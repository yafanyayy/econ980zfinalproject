Before Joe begins, let me remind you that some of the comments made during today’s conference call may be considered forward-looking statements. As such, they should be taken in the context of the risks and uncertainties discussed in the Safe Harbor disclosures contained in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings and found on Slide 2 of our presentation.
Also please note that today’s call will include a discussion of our results excluding certain items that we feel are not representative of the company’s ongoing business operations. These special items and their financial impacts are described in our earnings release dated today. The earnings release can be found on our website www.pepcoholdings.com/investors. Joe?"

The sale Conectiv Energy's generation asset and the exit from the merchant power business repositioned PHI as fundamentally regulated utility company, a company focus on delivering reliable service and meeting customer expectations. The sale improved our business risk profile, lower capital and collateral requirements, strengthen our credit profile and reduce earnings volatility. The year was also marked by steady progress on our key initiatives for the regulated business. Our plans for our Smart Grid are moving forward as we continue with meter installations in Delaware and the District of Columbia. 
Our build out of utility infrastructure is also progressing with $765 million in capital invested in the regulated business in 2010 including $226 million in transmission. Given this level of investment, we recognize the need to minimize regulatory and modified our approach to the rate case process with our most recent filing in Maryland. 2010 was a year in which we clarified our strategic vision as well as our value proposition for our customers and investors. 
Earnings from continuing operations for 2010 were $0.62 per share compared with $1.01 per share in 2009. Excluding special items in both periods, earnings would've been $1.24 per share in 2010 compared to $0.85 per share in 2009. Our operating results were driven by Power Delivery earnings that reflect the positive impact of our infrastructure investments, regulatory outcome and higher sales and our non-decoupled service territories. Lower interest expense resulting from the pay down of parent company debt with Conectiv Energy's generation asset sale proceeds and income tax adjustment also boosted earnings. The results of the Conectiv Energy segment are accounted for as discontinued operations. 
As seen on Slide 3, our 2010 earnings guidance was a range of $1 to $1.10 per share. Several factors contributed to our results being in excess of our own guidance. As we noted in our third quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call, this range assumed a reversal of $0.07 of earnings per share from unbilled revenue related to Atlantic City electric's basic generation service. In our results, only $0.04 per share reversed during the fourth quarter of 2010 leaving us with $0.03 per share in annual earnings related to Atlantic City electric's basic generation service. Also in the fourth quarter of 2010, we recognized earnings of $0.07 per share related to a tax settlement with the Internal Revenue Service that was reached in the fourth quarter for the tax years 2001 and 2002. This tax settlement was not contemplated in the guidance range. Later during the call, Tony will address the settlement in more detail along with the financial results and our operating segment performance but first I'll address some topics of interest. 
In 2010, we made great strides in implementing the blueprint for the future. The status by jurisdiction can be seen on Slide 4. About 215,000 advanced meters have been installed in Delaware for our electric and gas customers and we expect to complete all of the meter exchanges in Delaware in the second quarter of 2011. We began activating meters in October and plan to have all Delaware meters activated in the third quarter. The initial functionality includes remote metering, billing and outage notification. In the District of Columbia, we began the deployment of advanced meters in October with a goal of having the installations completed by the end of 2011. As approved by the commissions in Delaware and the District of Columbia, regulatory assets have been created to assure recovery of and the return on AMI-related cost between rate cases. In Maryland, the public service commission also approved the creation of the regulatory assets for AMI-related cost. For Pepco, the commission approved the deployment of advanced meters subject to the implementation of a commission approved customer education and communication plan. Pepco's proposed plan was approved by the commission last week and we intend to begin meter installations in June from Pepco's Maryland customers. For Delmarva power, the Maryland Commission deferred its decision when the deployment of advanced meters pending review and approval of an amended business case. We filed the business case in December, the procedural schedule has not yet been established. 
Through the build out of the Smart Grid, we will gain added tools to improve system reliability while providing customers with access to detailed usage information that will enable them to better manage their energy use and lower their energy bills. Our energy efficiency and demand side management programs will also help our customers to reduce energy cost. The costs of these programs would be recovered through DSM related grid adjustment mechanisms. 
2010 was a very busy year on the regulatory front with decisions in four distribution base rate cases since the end of 2009 and the filing of two additional cases. The details of the decided cases can be seen on Slides 5 and 6. In total, an annual increase of $64 million in electric distribution based rates was authorized in the fourth side of cases. Delmarva Power's electric case in Delaware was the most recently decided. On January 18, the commission approved a $16 million annual increase in distribution base rates based on the 10% return on equity. The new rates were effective February 1. 
Delmarva Power's request had been for an increase of $24 million. As permitted by Delaware law, Delmarva Power implemented subject to refund $2.5 million of the proposed rate increase in November, 2009 and the balance in April, 2010. The excess amount collected is being returned to customers which will impact cash flow but not earnings. The Commission deferred its decision on revenue decoupling and in Delmarva Power's development of an implementation plan including the plan for customer education. 
Slides 7 and 8 provides the detail of the pending cases. On February 9, Delmarva Power the Commission Staff and the Attorney General entered into a proposed settlement agreement in Delmarva Power's natural gas delivery base rate cases in Delaware. The proposed settlement provides for an annual rate increase of $6 million for service rendered on and after April 1, 2011. A stated return on equity is 10%. The parties agreed to deferred the request to place the revenue decoupling into effect until an implementation plan has been developed. The proposed settlement agreement is subject to final review and approval by the public service commission. And the decision is expected by the end of March. 
Delmarva Power implemented interim rate increases of $2.5 million on August 31 and $7.7 million  on February 2. The excess amount collected will be returned to customers. On December 21, Delmarva Power filed a distribution base rate case in Maryland seeking approval of an annual rate increase of $18 million based on a 10.75% return on equity. This filing includes comprehensive discussion on the topic of regulatory lag and it's negative effects as well as the proposal for the adoption of two mechanisms to reduce regulatory lag. The first is a reliability investment recovery mechanism, which provides full and timely recovery of future capital investments related to distribution system reliability. And the second is an annual rate review process, which would adjust rates annually using actual financial data and the return on equity approved in the most recent case to calculate a revenue requirement. This revenue requirement would then be the basis for any adjustment to rates. Hearings on the case are scheduled to begin May 31, with a decision expected in July of this year. 
As we previously reported in October, PJM reaffirmed the need for our mid-Atlantic power pathway or MAPP transmission project, with a one-year delay in the in-service date to June 1, 2015. The estimated total cost of the project remains $1.2 billion. PJM currently is in the annual process of reassessing reliability requirements for the region under its Regional Transmission Expansion Plan process. This reassessment includes the incorporation of our revised load forecast that is a significantly lower than the load forecast used in prior studies. PJM's reassessment is expected to be completed this spring and will determine if there will be any further delay in the in-service date for the MAPP project. 
Meanwhile, as seen on Slide 9, we continue to move forward with seeking required regulatory approvals for the project with the support of PJM. We filed an updated application for Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity or CPCN with the Maryland Public Service Commission in November. A procedural schedule has been set with hearing scheduled to begin on September 6 and a final order expected in January, 2012. Brief reviews with state and federal environmental agencies are substantially complete for the Southern Maryland portion of the line and we plan to file for the Maryland state environmental permit in the second quarter of 2011. 
Our projected capital expenditures are shown on Slide 10. Over the next five years, we expect to spend $3.1 billion on electric distribution, gas delivery and our blueprint for the future initiatives. These investments are aimed at improving reliability, enhancing customer service, meeting load growth and implementing AMI. In addition to the MAPP project, we expect to spend almost $1 billion on transmission infrastructure over this time period to improve reliability. Our transmission assets are subject to FERC jurisdiction and the transmission rates are set under a formula rate process. These assets earned returns on equity of either 11.3% or 12.8%. 
At Pepco Energy Services, profitable wind down of the Retail Energy Supply business continues to be on track and we are making good progress in growing the Energy Services business. As seen on Slide 11, PES signed $169 million of new energy efficiency contracts in 2010 including large contracts with BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport, the Marine Corps and Prince George's County school in Maryland. As seen on Slide 12 in December, Pepco Energy Services entered into a contract to construct the 2.2-megawatt solar electric generating system for of Atlantic Cape Community College at two of its campuses. Installation is expected to begin in May and to be completed in November. The solar photovoltaic system will generate almost half of the campuses electricity consumption. 
Since 1995, Pepco Energy Services has evolved to become one of the leading providers of energy efficiency and renewable energy services. We believe the benefits of energy efficiency provide long term growth opportunities for this business and we can grow Pepco Energy Services in a manner that is consistent with our lower risk profile. Before I turn it over to Tony, I want to address the impact of a recent storm that hit our service territories. In late January, we were hit by severe winter storm that included heavy snow and ice. In the days that followed the storm, we restored service to approximately 250,000 customers, most of which were in the Pepco service territory. We currently estimate the cost of storm restoration to be approximately $15 million with 1/2 to 2/3 being expensed and the balance being charged to capital. 
Pepco's response to the storm has been criticized by customers and elected officials and received significant media attention. Earlier this month, lawmakers in Maryland introduce legislation to increase utility reliability by directing the Public Service Commission to establish reliability standards for Maryland Electric Company. In August 2010, The commission initiated a proceeding to investigate the reliability of Pepco's electric distribution system. The commission recently expanded the scope of issues in the proceeding to include potential remedial action and has also proposed reliability standards. 
In the fall of 2010, we announced a six-point enhanced reliability plan for Pepco aimed at reducing both the frequency and duration of outage. Capital portion of the plan is reflected in the five-year forecast I discussed earlier. We will routinely assess this plan to determine the extent to which it can be accelerated in our major focus in 2011 would be on improving reliability. We will address our expected operation and maintenance expense at our upcoming analyst conference. At this point, let me turn it over to Tony Kamerick."

I'll recap our earnings, address our performance by operating segment and discuss some topics of interest for 2011 including our earnings guidance. We will then open the call to your questions. Our results",1593,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'll recap our earnings, address our performance by operating segment and discuss some topics of interest for 2011 including our earnings guidance. We will then open the call to your questions. Our results for both the quarter and year-to-date periods show Conectiv Energy's results as discontinued operations. For the full year 2010, Pepco Holdings incurred an after-tax loss of $107 million from discontinued operations. This loss reflects the sale of the wholesale power generation business as well as the liquidation of substantially all of Conectiv Energy's remaining assets and businesses. No material amount of gain or loss is expected to be recognized from the liquidation of the few remaining assets and liabilities held in Conectiv Energy. 
Slide 13 summarizes our earnings for the full year and fourth quarter of 2010. Earnings from continuing operations for the full year 2010 were $139 million or $0.62 per share compared to $223 million or $1.01 per share for the full year 2009. There were three special items recorded in 2010 period. The first is a $113-million after-tax charge for debt extinguishment cost that were incurred due to the early redemption of parent company debt primarily with the proceeds from the Conectiv Energy generation sale. The second is an $18 million after-tax restructuring charge related to an organizational review and the third is a $6-million after-tax charge due to the issuance of an order in the District of Columbia related to Pepco's divestiture of it's generating assets in the year 2000. Note that we have filed an appeal of this order, which gives successful, good result in the recovery of some or all of the charge. 
In the 2009 period, we recognized after-tax gains related to the Myriad bankruptcy settlement. We also recognize in Maryland state income tax benefit due to a chart change in the tax reporting for the disposition of certain assets in prior years. Excluding the special items, earnings in continuing operations for the full year 2010 would've been $276 million or $1.24 per share, compared to $188 million or $0.85 per share in 2009. 
For the fourth quarter of 2010, earnings from continuing operations were $14 million or $0.06 per share compared to $39 million or $0.17 per share for the fourth quarter of 2009. Excluding the debt extinguishment costs and the restructuring charge, earnings from continuing operations for the 2010 quarter would've been $56 million or $0.25 per share. A summary of the drivers of our financial results can be found on Slide 14. 
As Joe mentioned in the fourth quarter of 2010, we reached the tax settlement with the Internal Revenue Service for the tax years 2001 and 2002, which affected our tax provisions as far back as 1996. This tax settlement covered all open issues for those years except for the cross-border leases. The estimated interest due to the IRS under the settlement was recalculated resulting in the reversal of $15 million of accrued interest after tax. This reversal increased earnings for the quarter and full year by $0.07 per share and primarily affected the Power Delivery Segment. Though we do not expect an adjustment of this magnitude every year, until the IRS becomes more current with its audits, we can expect some level of adjustments as we reached settlement with the IRS and closed tax years. 
Power Delivery earnings excluding special items were $1.03 per share for the full year 2010, compared to $0.74 per share in 2009. Higher distribution rate during year increased earnings by $0.11 per share. A higher rates reflect the impact of rate case decisions for Pepco in the District of Columbia in Maryland, Delmarva Power in Maryland and for Atlantic City Electric. The higher rates also reflect the interim rates put in place for Delmarva Power in Delaware. 
Higher sales due to a higher cooling degree days versus the prior year increase the earnings by $0.07 per share. Cooling degree days were up 48%. Keep in mind that our distribution revenue in Maryland and the District of Columbia, which represents approximately 2/3 of total distribution revenue is decoupled from consumption and therefore is not impacted by temperature variations. Higher transmission revenue drove $0.10 per share in earnings increased due to higher investment in transmission assets. Also driving higher Power Delivery earnings was the adjustment related to the federal income tax settlement that I referred to earlier. 
Partially offsetting these increases was higher operation and maintenance expense, which reduced earnings by $0.12 per share year-over-year. Higher restoration activity due to several severe storms in 2010 cost about $0.05 of this earnings decrease. higher treatment and environmental remediation costs were also was also a factor partially offset by lower pension expense. 
For the fourth quarter of 2010, Power Delivery earnings excluding special items, were $0.24 per share compared to $0.14 per share for the fourth quarter of 2009. The higher earnings is 2010 quarter were driven by higher distribution and transmission revenue due to higher rates in effect, higher sales and the adjustment related to the federal income tax settlement. Higher Power Delivery operation and maintenance expense partially offset the earnings increases. Pepco Energy Services full year 2010 earnings were $0.16 per share compared to $0.18 per share in 2009. Fourth quarter earnings were $0.03 per share as compared to $0.04 per share for the 2009 quarter. The decrease in earnings during both periods was due to lower retail electricity sales volumes due to the ongoing wind down of the Retail Energy Supply business and higher operation and maintenance expenses for the thermal services business partially offset by higher generation output and lower interest expense. 
In our corporate and other segment which is primarily unallocated corporate costs, earnings improved by $0.15 per share year-over-year excluding special items. The earnings improvement is due to the favorable state income tax effect resulting from the corporate restructuring involving certain PHI entities as well as lower interest expense due to the pay down of parent company debt with the proceeds from the Conectiv Energy generation asset sale. Quarter-over-quarter, earnings improved by 1 cent per share driven by lower interest expense. Now I'll turn to some topics of interest for 2011. 
For 2011, we estimate the pension and other post-retirement benefit costs to be approximately $107 million across PHI as compared to $116 million in 2010. Historically about 70% of this amount is reflected in our operating expenses with the balance charged to capital. So as seen on Slide 15, we estimate that the pension and other post-retirement benefit expense will be approximately $75 million in 2011 as compared to $81 million in 2010. Additionally, although we project there'll be no minimum funding requirement in 2011 under the Pension Protection Act, in accordance with our policy, we currently plan to make a discretionary tax-deductible contribution in 2011 of up to $150 million to bring the plan assets to at least the full funding level under the Pension Protection Act. The utility subsidiaries obligation for funding the plan is expected to be approximately 80% of this contribution. We made a $100 million contribution to the pension plan in 2010.
Late last year, legislation was passed to extend bonus depreciation through 2012. We expect to be in a net operating loss position for income tax purposes for at least 2011 and 2012. Therefore the cash flow benefit from bonus depreciation will be delayed but realized in future years. We plan to provide an update of our forecasted cash flow and financing plan in our upcoming analyst conference. 
Slide 16 and 17 show our earnings guidance for 2011 and expected major earnings drivers. Our 2011 earnings guidance range for ongoing operations is $1.10 to $1.25 per share. The guidance range excludes the result of discontinued operations and the impact of any special, unusual or extraordinary items. The guidance range also excludes the net mark-to-market effects of economic hedging activities at Pepco Energy Services. As we wind down the retail energy business, we are experiencing more hedge in effectiveness as the result of smaller loads and expect to experience some mark-to-market fluctuations over the next couple of years. Note that the guidance range takes into account the incremental storm that Joe mentioned earlier. 
Looking at our range for 2011 versus actual results for 2010, significant drivers that are expected to have a positive impact on earnings include annualization of interest savings resulting from that retirement in 2010, which is expected to increase earnings by $0.12 per share and the annualization of 2010 distribution rate increases, which is expected to increase earnings by $0.05 per share. Also keep in mind that we incurred incremental storm costs of $0.05 or share in 2010. A factor that will negatively impact earnings in 2011 is the $0.11 per share of earnings in 2010 resulting from income tax adjustments. Other factors that are expected to have a negative impact on earnings in 2011 as compared to 2010 include higher depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $0.07 per share from infrastructure investments and the assumed reversal of unbilled revenue related to Atlantic City electric basic generation service which contributed $0.03 per share to earnings in 2010. Our guidance range also assumes normal temperatures. 
Higher cooling degree days as compared to normal contributed $0.03 per share to earnings in 2010. And finally, the range also takes into consideration the incremental storm costs related to the January storm that Joe referred to, which we estimate to be approximately $0.02 per share. Now let me turn it back to Joe Rigby for some closing remarks."

But from a directional point of view, we fully expect that outcome. With respect to the discussion on the BSA, I think that one comment I would make there is that, what's been discussed around that is a component within the BSA that exist in the state of Maryland, which is intended to reflect outages during or reflect revenue during outages. And I fully expect that the Maryland PSE is going to work -- we're going to work way through that issue in a very acceptable manner. The issue just on the franchise, I want to be really clear about that one. We're very much cognizant of the fact that it's been mentioned but obviously, we would vigorously oppose that as we take great pride and take it very seriously that this is who we are, these are our customers.

Also available to answer your questions are Dave Velazquez, Executive Vice President, Power Delivery; and John Huffman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Pepco Energy Services.
On today’s call, we will be referring to slides which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Before Joe begins, let me remind you that some of the comments made during today’s conference call may be considered forward-looking statements. As such, they should be taken in the context of the risks and uncertainties discussed in the Safe Harbor disclosures contained in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings and found on Slide 2 of our presentation.
Also please note that today’s call will include a discussion of our results excluding certain items that we feel are not representative of the company’s ongoing business operations. These special items and their financial impacts are described in our earnings release dated today. The earnings release can be found on our website www.pepcoholdings.com/investors. Joe?"

The sale of Conectiv Energy's generation assets and the exit from the merchant power business repositioned PHI as fundamentally a regulated utility company, a company focused on delivering reliable service and meeting customer expectations. The sale improved our business risk profile, lower capital and collateral requirements, strengthened our credit profile and reduced earnings volatility. The year was also marked by steady progress on our key initiatives for the regulated business. Our plans for our Smart Grid are moving forward as we continue with meter installations in Delaware and the District of Columbia. 
Our build out of utility infrastructure is also progressing with $765 million in capital invested in the regulated business in 2010 including $226 million in transmission. Given this level of investment, we recognize the need to minimize regulatory lag and modified our approach to the rate case process with our most recent filing in Maryland. 2010 was a year in which we clarified our strategic vision as well as our value proposition for our customers and investors. 
Earnings from continuing operations for 2010 were $0.62 per share compared with $1.01 per share in 2009. Excluding special items in both periods, earnings would've been $1.24 per share in 2010 compared to $0.85 per share in 2009. Our operating results were driven by Power Delivery earnings that reflect the positive impact of our infrastructure investments, regulatory outcome and higher sales and our non-decoupled service territories. Lower interest expense resulting from the pay down of parent company debt with Conectiv Energy's generation asset sale proceeds and income tax adjustments also boosted earnings. The results of the Conectiv Energy segment are accounted for as discontinued operations. 
As seen on Slide 3, our 2010 earnings guidance was a range of $1 to $1.10 per share. Several factors contributed to our results being an excess of our own guidance. As we noted in our third quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call, this range assumed a reversal of $0.07 of earnings per share from unbilled revenue related to Atlantic City Electric's basic generation service. In our results, only $0.04 per share reversed during the fourth quarter of 2010 leaving us with $0.03 per share in annual earnings related to Atlantic City Electric's basic generation service. Also in the fourth quarter of 2010, we recognized earnings of $0.07 per share related to a tax settlement with the Internal Revenue Service that was reached in the fourth quarter for the tax years 2001 and 2002. This tax settlement was not contemplated in the guidance range. Later during the call, Tony will address the settlement in more detail along with the financial results and our operating segment performance, but first I'll address some topics of interest. 
In 2010, we made great strides in implementing the blueprint for the future. The status by jurisdiction can be seen on Slide 4. About 215,000 advanced meters have been installed in Delaware for our electric and gas customers and we expect to complete all of the meter exchanges in Delaware in the second quarter of 2011. We began activating meters in October and plan to have all Delaware meters activated in the third quarter. The initial functionality includes remote metering, billing and outage notification. In the District of Columbia, we began the deployment of advanced meters in October with a goal of having the installations completed by the end of 2011. As approved by the commissions in Delaware and the District of Columbia, regulatory assets have been created to assure recovery of and the return on AMI-related cost between rate cases. 
In Maryland, the Public Service Commission also approved the creation of a regulatory asset for AMI-related cost. For Pepco, the Commission approved the deployment of advanced meters subject to the implementation of a commission-approved customer education and communication plan. Pepco's proposed plan was approved by the commission last week and we intend to begin meter installations in June from Pepco's Maryland customers. For Delmarva Power, the Maryland Commission deferred its decision on the deployment of advanced meters pending review and approval of an amended business case. We filed the business case in December, the procedural schedule has not yet been established. 
Through the build out of the Smart Grid, we will gain added tools to improve system reliability while providing customers with access to detailed usage information that will enable them to better manage their energy use and lower their energy bills. Where energy efficiency and demand side management programs will also help our customers to reduce energy cost. The cost of these programs will be recovered through DSM-related rate adjustment mechanisms. 
2010 was a very busy year on the regulatory front with decisions in four distribution base rate cases since the end of 2009 and the filing of two additional cases. The details of the decided cases can be seen on Slides 5 and 6. In total, an annual increase of $64 million in electric distribution base rates was authorized in the fourth side of cases. Delmarva Power's electric case in Delaware was the most recently decided. On January 18, the commission approved a $16 million annual increase in distribution base rates based on the 10% return on equity. The new rates were effective February 1. 
Delmarva Power's request had been for an increase of $24 million. As permitted by Delaware law, Delmarva Power implemented subject to refund $2.5 million of the proposed rate increase in November 2009 and the balance in April 2010. The excess amount collected is being returned to customers which will impact cash flow but not earnings. The Commission deferred its decision on revenue decoupling and in Delmarva Power's development of an implementation plan including the plan for customer education. 
Slides 7 and 8 provide the details of the pending cases. On February 9, Delmarva Power, the Commission Staff and the Attorney General entered into a proposed settlement agreement in Delmarva Power's natural gas delivery base rate cases in Delaware. The proposed settlement provides for an annual rate increase of $6 million for service rendered on and after April 1, 2011. A stated return on equity is 10%. The parties agreed to defer the request to place revenue decoupling into effect until an implementation plan has been developed. The proposed settlement agreement is subject to final review and approval by the public service commission. And a decision is expected by the end of March. 
Delmarva Power implemented interim rate increases of $2.5 million on August 31 and $7.7 million on February 2. The excess amount collected will be returned to customers. On December 21, Delmarva Power filed a distribution base rate case in Maryland seeking approval of an annual rate increase of $18 million based on a 10.75% return on equity. This filing includes comprehensive discussion on the topic of regulatory lag and its negative effects, as well as the proposal for the adoption of two mechanisms to reduce regulatory lag. The first is a reliability investment recovery mechanism, which provides full and timely recovery of future capital investments related to distribution system reliability. And the second is an annual rate review process, which would adjust rates annually using actual financial data and the return on equity approved in the most recent case to calculate a revenue requirement. This revenue requirement would then be the basis for any adjustment to rates. Hearings on the case are scheduled to begin May 31, with a decision expected in July of this year. 
As we previously reported in October, PJM reaffirmed the need for our mid-Atlantic power pathway or MAPP transmission project, with a one-year delay in the in-service date to June 1, 2015. The estimated total cost of the project remains $1.2 billion. PJM currently is in the annual process of reassessing reliability requirements for the region under its Regional Transmission Expansion Plan process. This reassessment includes the incorporation of a revised load forecast that is significantly lower than the load forecast used in prior studies. PJM's reassessment is expected to be completed this spring and will determine if there will be any further delay in the in-service date for the MAPP project. 
Meanwhile, as seen on Slide 9, we continue to move forward with seeking the required regulatory approvals for the project with the support of PJM. We filed an updated application for Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity or CPCN with the Maryland Public Service Commission in November. A procedural schedule has been set with hearing scheduled to begin on September 6 and a final order expected in January, 2012. Brief [ph] reviews with state and federal environmental agencies are substantially complete for the Southern Maryland portion of the line and we plan to file for the Maryland state environmental permit in the second quarter of 2011. 
Our projected capital expenditures are shown on Slide 10. Over the next five years, we expect to spend $3.1 billion on electric distribution, gas delivery and our blueprint for the future initiatives. These investments are aimed at improving reliability, enhancing customer service, meeting load growth and implementing AMI. In addition to the MAPP project, we expect to spend almost $1 billion on transmission infrastructure over this time period to improve reliability. Our transmission assets are subject to FERC jurisdiction and the transmission rates are set under a formula rate process. These assets earned returns on equity of either 11.3% or 12.8%. 
At Pepco Energy Services, profitable wind down of the Retail Energy Supply business continues to be on track and we are making good progress in growing the Energy Services business. As seen on Slide 11, PES signed $169 million of new energy efficiency contracts in 2010 including large contracts with BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport, the Marine Corps and Prince George's County schools in Maryland. As seen on Slide 12 in December, Pepco Energy Services entered into a contract to construct a 2.2-megawatt solar electric generating system for New Jersey's Atlantic Cape Community College at two of its campuses. Installation is expected to begin in May and to be completed in November. The solar photovoltaic system will generate almost half of the campuses electricity consumption. 
Since 1995, Pepco Energy Services has evolved to become one of the leading providers of energy efficiency and renewable energy services. We believe the benefits of energy efficiency provide long term growth opportunities for this business and we can grow Pepco Energy Services in a manner that is consistent with our lower risk profile. Before I turn it over to Tony, I want to address the impact of a recent storm that hit our service territories. In late January, we were hit by severe winter storm that included heavy snow and ice. In the days that followed the storm, we restored service to approximately 250,000 customers, most of which were in the Pepco service territory. We currently estimate the cost of storm restoration to be approximately $15 million with 1/2 to 2/3 being expense and the balance being charged to capital. 
Pepco's response to the storm has been criticized by customers and elected officials and received significant media attention. Earlier this month, lawmakers in Maryland introduce legislation to increase utility reliability by directing the Public Service Commission to establish reliability standards for Maryland electric companies. In August 2010, The commission initiated a proceeding to investigate the reliability of Pepco's electric distribution system. The commission recently expanded the scope of issues in the proceeding to include potential remedial action and has also proposed reliability standards. 
In the fall of 2010, we announced a six-point enhanced reliability plan for Pepco aimed at reducing both the frequency and duration of outage. A capital portion of the plan is reflected in the five-year forecast I discussed earlier. We will routinely assess this plan to determine the extent to which it can be accelerated and our major focus in 2011 would be on improving reliability. We will address our expected operation and maintenance expense at our upcoming analyst conference. 
At this point, let me turn it over to Tony Kamerick."

Our results for both the quarter and year-to-date periods show Conectiv Energy's results as discontinued operations. For the full year 2010, Pepco Holdings incurred an after-tax loss of $107 million from discontinued operations. This loss reflects the sale of the wholesale power generation business as well as the liquidation of substantially all of Conectiv Energy's remaining assets and businesses. No material amount of gain or loss is expected to be recognized from the liquidation of the few remaining assets and liabilities held in Conectiv Energy. 
Slide 13 summarizes our earnings for the full year and fourth quarter of 2010. Earnings from continuing operations for the full year of 2010 were $139 million or $0.62 per share compared to $223 million or $1.01 per share for the full year of 2009. There were three special items recorded in 2010 period. The first is a $113-million after-tax charge for debt extinguishment costs that were incurred due to the early redemption of parent company debt primarily with the proceeds from the Conectiv Energy generation sale. The second, is an $18 million after-tax restructuring charge related to an organizational review and the third is a $6-million after-tax charge due to the issuance of an order in the District of Columbia related to Pepco's divestiture of it's generating assets in the year of 2000. Note that we have filed an appeal of this order, which if successful, good result in the recovery of some or all of the charge. 
In the 2009 period, we recognized after-tax gains related to the Myriad bankruptcy settlement. We also recognized in Maryland state income tax benefit due to a chart change in the tax reporting for the disposition of certain assets in prior years. Excluding the special items, earnings from continuing operations for the full year of 2010 would've been $276 million or $1.24 per share, compared to $188 million or $0.85 per share in 2009. 
For the fourth quarter of 2010, earnings from continuing operations were $14 million or $0.06 per share compared to $39 million or $0.17 per share for the fourth quarter of 2009. Excluding the debt extinguishment costs and the restructuring charge, earnings from continuing operations for the 2010 quarter would've been $56 million or $0.25 per share. A summary of the drivers of our financial results can be found on Slide 14. 
As Joe mentioned in the fourth quarter of 2010, we reached the tax settlement with the Internal Revenue Service for the tax years 2001 and 2002, which affected our tax provisions as far back as 1996. This tax settlement covered all open issues for those years except for the cross-border leases. The estimated interest due to the IRS under the settlement was recalculated resulting in the reversal of $15 million of accrued interest after tax. This reversal increased earnings for the quarter and full year by $0.07 per share and primarily affected the Power Delivery segment. Though we do not expect an adjustment of this magnitude every year, until the IRS becomes more current with its audits, we can expect some level of adjustments as we reached settlements with the IRS in closed tax years. 
Power Delivery earnings excluding special items, were $1.03 per share for the full year 2010, compared to $0.74 per share in 2009. Higher distribution rates during the year increased earnings by $0.11 per share. Our higher rates reflect the impact of rate-case decisions for Pepco in the District of Columbia in Maryland, Delmarva Power in Maryland and for Atlantic City Electric. The higher rates also reflect the interim rates put in place for Delmarva Power in Delaware. 
Higher sales due to a higher cooling degree days versus the prior year increased earnings by $0.07 per share. Cooling degree days were up 48%. Keep in mind that our distribution revenue in Maryland and the District of Columbia, which represents approximately 2/3 of total distribution revenue is decoupled from consumption and therefore is not impacted by temperature variations. Higher transmission revenue drove $0.10 per share of the earnings increased due to a higher investment in transmission assets. Also driving higher Power Delivery earnings was the adjustment related to the federal income tax settlement that I referred to earlier. 
Partially offsetting these increases was higher operation and maintenance expense, which reduced earnings by $0.12 per share year-over-year. Higher restoration activity due to several severe storms in 2010 cost about $0.05 of this earnings decrease. higher tree trimming and environmental remediation costs were also factors partially offset by lower pension expense. 
For the fourth quarter of 2010, Power Delivery earnings excluding special items, were $0.24 per share compared to $0.14 per share for the fourth quarter of 2009. The higher earnings is the 2010 quarter were driven by higher distribution and transmission revenue due to higher rates in effect, higher sales and the adjustment related to the federal income tax settlement. Higher Power Delivery operation and maintenance expense partially offset the earnings increases. Pepco Energy Services full year 2010 earnings were $0.16 per share compared to $0.18 per share in 2009. Fourth quarter earnings were $0.03 per share as compared to $0.04 per share for the 2009 quarter. The decrease in earnings during both periods was due to lower retail electricity sales volumes due to the ongoing wind down of the Retail Energy Supply business and higher operation and maintenance expenses for the Thermal Services business partially offset by higher generation output and lower interest expense. 
In our corporate and other segment, which is primarily unallocated corporate costs, earnings improved by $0.15 per share year-over-year excluding special items. The earnings improvement is due to the favorable state income tax effect resulting from the corporate restructuring involving certain PHI entities as well as lower interest expense due to the pay down of parent company debt with the proceeds from the Conectiv Energy generation asset sale. Quarter-over-quarter, earnings improved by $0.01 per share driven by lower interest expense. Now I'll turn to some topics of interest for 2011. 
For 2011, we estimate the pension and other post-retirement benefit costs to be approximately $107 million across PHI as compared to $116 million in 2010. Historically about 70% of this amount is reflected in our operating expenses with the balance charged to capital. So as seen on Slide 15, we estimate that the pension and other post-retirement benefit expense will be approximately $75 million in 2011 as compared to $81 million in 2010. Additionally, although we project there will be no minimum funding requirement in 2011 under the Pension Protection Act, in accordance with our policy, we currently plan to make a discretionary tax-deductible contribution in 2011 of up to $150 million to bring the plan assets to at least the full funding level under the Pension Protection Act. The utility subsidiaries obligation for funding the plan is expected to be approximately 80% of this contribution. We made a $100 million contribution to the pension plan in 2010.
Late last year, legislation was passed to extend bonus depreciation through 2012. We expect to be in a net operating loss position for income tax purposes for at least 2011 and 2012. Therefore the cash flow benefit from bonus depreciation will be delayed but realized in future years. We plan to provide an update of our forecasted cash flow and financing plans in our upcoming analyst conference. 
Slide 16 and 17 show our earnings guidance for 2011 and expected major earnings drivers. Our 2011 earnings guidance range for ongoing operations is $1.10 to $1.25 per share. The guidance range excludes the results of discontinued operations and the impact of any special, unusual or extraordinary items. The guidance range also excludes the net mark-to-market effects of economic hedging activities at Pepco Energy Services. As we wind down the retail energy business, we are experiencing more hedge in effectiveness as the result of smaller loads and expect to experience some mark-to-market fluctuations over the next couple of years. Note that the guidance range takes into account the incremental storm events that Joe mentioned earlier. 
Looking at our range for 2011 versus actual results for 2010, significant drivers that are expected to have a positive impact on earnings include the annualization of interest savings resulting from debt retirement in 2010, which is expected to increase earnings by $0.12 per share and the annualization of 2010 distribution rate increases, which is expected to increase earnings by $0.05 per share. Also keep in mind that we incurred incremental storm costs of $0.05 or share in 2010.
A factor that will negatively impact earnings in 2011 is the $0.11 per share of earnings in 2010 resulting from income tax adjustments. Other factors that are expected to have a negative impact on earnings in 2011 as compared to 2010 include higher depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $0.07 per share from infrastructure investments and the assumed reversal of unbilled revenue related to Atlantic City Electric's basic generation service which contributed $0.03 per share to earnings in 2010. Our guidance range also assumes normal temperatures. 
Higher cooling degree days as compared to normal contributed $0.03 per share to earnings in 2010. And finally, the range also takes into consideration the incremental storm costs related to the January storm that Joe referred to, which we estimate to be approximately $0.02 per share. 
Now let me turn it back to Joe Rigby, for some closing remarks."

The issues around reliability, I've said this several times in public settings that we are absolutely committed, if you could just think about the repositioning we've gone through. For us success is very clear in terms of us improving the reliability of the system. We are deeply involved in tracking all of the issues that you mentioned, I will make a couple of comments. I would fully expect that not to similar what we have in our other jurisdictions that the state of Maryland will in fact, establish reliability standards and we're not going to be in opposition to that, we want to be a full participant in the development of those standards and to make sure that all the parties have a very thorough vetting of all the issues that come along with that. But from a directional point of view, we fully expect that outcome. With respect to the discussion on the BSA, I think that one comment I would make there is that, what's being discussed around that is a component within the BSA that exists in the state of Maryland, which is intended to reflect outages during or reflect revenue during outages. And I fully expect that the Maryland PSE here is going to work -- we're going to work our way through that issue in a very acceptable manner. The issue just on the franchise, I want to be really clear about that one. We're very much cognizant of the fact that it's been mentioned but obviously, we would vigorously oppose that as we take great pride and take it very seriously that this is who we are, these are our customers. So as it relates to someone raising the issue around our franchise, that would be one that we would oppose very, very vigorously. But I would tell you that the full force of the company is in monitoring this and I think most fundamentally, working to execute the reliability enhancement plan that I mentioned to improve service to our customers."

The sale of Conectiv Energy's generation assets and the exit from the merchant power business repositioned PHI as fundamentally a regulated utility company, a company focused on delivering reliable service and meeting customer expectations. The sale improved our business risk profile, lower capital and collateral requirements, strengthened our credit profile and reduced earnings volatility. The year was also marked by steady progress on our key initiatives for the regulated business. Our plans for our Smart Grid are moving forward as we continue with meter installations in Delaware and the District of Columbia. 
Our build out of utility infrastructure is also progressing with $765 million in capital invested in the regulated business in 2010 including $226 million in transmission. Given this level of investment, we recognize the need to minimize regulatory lag and modified our approach to the rate case process with our most recent filing in Maryland. 2010 was a year in which we clarified our strategic vision as well as our value proposition for our customers and investors. 
Earnings from continuing operations for 2010 were $0.62 per share compared with $1.01 per share in 2009. Excluding special items in both periods, earnings would've been $1.24 per share in 2010 compared to $0.85 per share in 2009. Our operating results were driven by Power Delivery earnings that reflect the positive impact of our infrastructure investments, regulatory outcome and higher sales and our non-decoupled service territories. Lower interest expense resulting from the pay down of parent company debt with Conectiv Energy's generation asset sale proceeds and income tax adjustments also boosted earnings. The results of the Conectiv Energy segment are accounted for as discontinued operations. 
As seen on Slide 3, our 2010 earnings guidance was a range of $1 to $1.10 per share. Several factors contributed to our results being an excess of our own guidance. As we noted in our third quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call, this range assumed a reversal of $0.07 of earnings per share from unbilled revenue related to Atlantic City Electric's basic generation service. In our results, only $0.04 per share reversed during the fourth quarter of 2010 leaving us with $0.03 per share in annual earnings related to Atlantic City Electric's basic generation service. Also in the fourth quarter of 2010, we recognized earnings of $0.07 per share related to a tax settlement with the Internal Revenue Service that was reached in the fourth quarter for the tax years 2001 and 2002. This tax settlement was not contemplated in the guidance range. Later during the call, Tony will address the settlement in more detail along with the financial results and our operating segment performance, but first I'll address some topics of interest. 
In 2010, we made great strides in implementing the blueprint for the future. The status by jurisdiction can be seen on Slide 4. About 215,000 advanced meters have been installed in Delaware for our electric and gas customers and we expect to complete all of the meter exchanges in Delaware in the second quarter of 2011. We began activating meters in October and plan to have all Delaware meters activated in the third quarter. The initial functionality includes remote metering, billing and outage notification. In the District of Columbia, we began the deployment of advanced meters in October with a goal of having the installations completed by the end of 2011. As approved by the commissions in Delaware and the District of Columbia, regulatory assets have been created to assure recovery of and the return on AMI-related cost between rate cases. 
In Maryland, the Public Service Commission also approved the creation of a regulatory asset for AMI-related cost. For Pepco, the Commission approved the deployment of advanced meters subject to the implementation of a commission-approved customer education and communication plan. Pepco's proposed plan was approved by the commission last week and we intend to begin meter installations in June from Pepco's Maryland customers. For Delmarva Power, the Maryland Commission deferred its decision on the deployment of advanced meters pending review and approval of an amended business case. We filed the business case in December, the procedural schedule has not yet been established. 
Through the build out of the Smart Grid, we will gain added tools to improve system reliability while providing customers with access to detailed usage information that will enable them to better manage their energy use and lower their energy bills. Where energy efficiency and demand side management programs will also help our customers to reduce energy cost. The cost of these programs will be recovered through DSM-related rate adjustment mechanisms. 
2010 was a very busy year on the regulatory front with decisions in four distribution base rate cases since the end of 2009 and the filing of two additional cases. The details of the decided cases can be seen on Slides 5 and 6. In total, an annual increase of $64 million in electric distribution base rates was authorized in the fourth side of cases. Delmarva Power's electric case in Delaware was the most recently decided. On January 18, the commission approved a $16 million annual increase in distribution base rates based on the 10% return on equity. The new rates were effective February 1. 
Delmarva Power's request had been for an increase of $24 million. As permitted by Delaware law, Delmarva Power implemented subject to refund $2.5 million of the proposed rate increase in November 2009 and the balance in April 2010. The excess amount collected is being returned to customers which will impact cash flow but not earnings. The Commission deferred its decision on revenue decoupling and in Delmarva Power's development of an implementation plan including the plan for customer education. 
Slides 7 and 8 provide the details of the pending cases. On February 9, Delmarva Power, the Commission Staff and the Attorney General entered into a proposed settlement agreement in Delmarva Power's natural gas delivery base rate cases in Delaware. The proposed settlement provides for an annual rate increase of $6 million for service rendered on and after April 1, 2011. A stated return on equity is 10%. The parties agreed to defer the request to place revenue decoupling into effect until an implementation plan has been developed. The proposed settlement agreement is subject to final review and approval by the public service commission. And a decision is expected by the end of March. 
Delmarva Power implemented interim rate increases of $2.5 million on August 31 and $7.7 million on February 2. The excess amount collected will be returned to customers. On December 21, Delmarva Power filed a distribution base rate case in Maryland seeking approval of an annual rate increase of $18 million based on a 10.75% return on equity. This filing includes comprehensive discussion on the topic of regulatory lag and its negative effects, as well as the proposal for the adoption of two mechanisms to reduce regulatory lag. The first is a reliability investment recovery mechanism, which provides full and timely recovery of future capital investments related to distribution system reliability. And the second is an annual rate review process, which would adjust rates annually using actual financial data and the return on equity approved in the most recent case to calculate a revenue requirement. This revenue requirement would then be the basis for any adjustment to rates. Hearings on the case are scheduled to begin May 31, with a decision expected in July of this year. 
As we previously reported in October, PJM reaffirmed the need for our mid-Atlantic power pathway or MAPP transmission project, with a one-year delay in the in-service date to June 1, 2015. The estimated total cost of the project remains $1.2 billion. PJM currently is in the annual process of reassessing reliability requirements for the region under its Regional Transmission Expansion Plan process. This reassessment includes the incorporation of a revised load forecast that is significantly lower than the load forecast used in prior studies. PJM's reassessment is expected to be completed this spring and will determine if there will be any further delay in the in-service date for the MAPP project. 
Meanwhile, as seen on Slide 9, we continue to move forward with seeking the required regulatory approvals for the project with the support of PJM. We filed an updated application for Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity or CPCN with the Maryland Public Service Commission in November. A procedural schedule has been set with hearing scheduled to begin on September 6 and a final order expected in January, 2012. Brief reviews with state and federal environmental agencies are substantially complete for the Southern Maryland portion of the line and we plan to file for the Maryland state environmental permit in the second quarter of 2011. 
Our projected capital expenditures are shown on Slide 10. Over the next five years, we expect to spend $3.1 billion on electric distribution, gas delivery and our blueprint for the future initiatives. These investments are aimed at improving reliability, enhancing customer service, meeting load growth and implementing AMI. In addition to the MAPP project, we expect to spend almost $1 billion on transmission infrastructure over this time period to improve reliability. Our transmission assets are subject to FERC jurisdiction and the transmission rates are set under a formula rate process. These assets earned returns on equity of either 11.3% or 12.8%. 
At Pepco Energy Services, profitable wind down of the Retail Energy Supply business continues to be on track and we are making good progress in growing the Energy Services business. As seen on Slide 11, PES signed $169 million of new energy efficiency contracts in 2010 including large contracts with BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport, the Marine Corps and Prince George's County schools in Maryland. As seen on Slide 12 in December, Pepco Energy Services entered into a contract to construct a 2.2-megawatt solar electric generating system for New Jersey's Atlantic Cape Community College at two of its campuses. Installation is expected to begin in May and to be completed in November. The solar photovoltaic system will generate almost half of the campuses electricity consumption. 
Since 1995, Pepco Energy Services has evolved to become one of the leading providers of energy efficiency and renewable energy services. We believe the benefits of energy efficiency provide long term growth opportunities for this business and we can grow Pepco Energy Services in a manner that is consistent with our lower risk profile. Before I turn it over to Tony, I want to address the impact of a recent storm that hit our service territories. In late January, we were hit by severe winter storm that included heavy snow and ice. In the days that followed the storm, we restored service to approximately 250,000 customers, most of which were in the Pepco service territory. We currently estimate the cost of storm restoration to be approximately $15 million with 1/2 to 2/3 being expense and the balance being charged to capital. 
Pepco's response to the storm has been criticized by customers and elected officials and received significant media attention. Earlier this month, lawmakers in Maryland introduce legislation to increase utility reliability by directing the Public Service Commission to establish reliability standards for Maryland electric companies. In August 2010, The commission initiated a proceeding to investigate the reliability of Pepco's electric distribution system. The commission recently expanded the scope of issues in the proceeding to include potential remedial action and has also proposed reliability standards. 
In the fall of 2010, we announced a six-point enhanced reliability plan for Pepco aimed at reducing both the frequency and duration of outage. A capital portion of the plan is reflected in the five-year forecast I discussed earlier. We will routinely assess this plan to determine the extent to which it can be accelerated and our major focus in 2011 would be on improving reliability. We will address our expected operation and maintenance expense at our upcoming analyst conference. 
At this point, let me turn it over to Tony Kamerick."

Our results for both the quarter and year-to-date periods show Conectiv Energy's results as discontinued operations. For the full year 2010, Pepco Holdings incurred an after-tax loss of $107 million from discontinued operations. This loss reflects the sale of the wholesale power generation business as well as the liquidation of substantially all of Conectiv Energy's remaining assets and businesses. No material amount of gain or loss is expected to be recognized from the liquidation of the few remaining assets and liabilities held in Conectiv Energy. 
Slide 13 summarizes our earnings for the full year and fourth quarter of 2010. Earnings from continuing operations for the full year of 2010 were $139 million or $0.62 per share compared to $223 million or $1.01 per share for the full year of 2009. There were three special items recorded in 2010 period. The first is a $113-million after-tax charge for debt extinguishment costs that were incurred due to the early redemption of parent company debt primarily with the proceeds from the Conectiv Energy generation sale. The second, is an $18 million after-tax restructuring charge related to an organizational review and the third is a $6-million after-tax charge due to the issuance of an order in the District of Columbia related to Pepco's divestiture of it's generating assets in the year of 2000. Note that we have filed an appeal of this order, which if successful, good result in the recovery of some or all of the charge. 
In the 2009 period, we recognized after-tax gains related to the Myriad bankruptcy settlement. We also recognized in Maryland state income tax benefit due to a chart change in the tax reporting for the disposition of certain assets in prior years. Excluding the special items, earnings from continuing operations for the full year of 2010 would've been $276 million or $1.24 per share, compared to $188 million or $0.85 per share in 2009. 
For the fourth quarter of 2010, earnings from continuing operations were $14 million or $0.06 per share compared to $39 million or $0.17 per share for the fourth quarter of 2009. Excluding the debt extinguishment costs and the restructuring charge, earnings from continuing operations for the 2010 quarter would've been $56 million or $0.25 per share. A summary of the drivers of our financial results can be found on Slide 14. 
As Joe mentioned in the fourth quarter of 2010, we reached the tax settlement with the Internal Revenue Service for the tax years 2001 and 2002, which affected our tax provisions as far back as 1996. This tax settlement covered all open issues for those years except for the cross-border leases. The estimated interest due to the IRS under the settlement was recalculated resulting in the reversal of $15 million of accrued interest after tax. This reversal increased earnings for the quarter and full year by $0.07 per share and primarily affected the Power Delivery segment. Though we do not expect an adjustment of this magnitude every year, until the IRS becomes more current with its audits, we can expect some level of adjustments as we reached settlements with the IRS in closed tax years. 
Power Delivery earnings excluding special items, were $1.03 per share for the full year 2010, compared to $0.74 per share in 2009. Higher distribution rates during the year increased earnings by $0.11 per share. Our higher rates reflect the impact of rate-case decisions for Pepco in the District of Columbia in Maryland, Delmarva Power in Maryland and for Atlantic City Electric. The higher rates also reflect the interim rates put in place for Delmarva Power in Delaware. 
Higher sales due to a higher cooling degree days versus the prior year increased earnings by $0.07 per share. Cooling degree days were up 48%. Keep in mind that our distribution revenue in Maryland and the District of Columbia, which represents approximately 2/3 of total distribution revenue is decoupled from consumption and therefore is not impacted by temperature variations. Higher transmission revenue drove $0.10 per share of the earnings increased due to a higher investment in transmission assets. Also driving higher Power Delivery earnings was the adjustment related to the federal income tax settlement that I referred to earlier. 
Partially offsetting these increases was higher operation and maintenance expense, which reduced earnings by $0.12 per share year-over-year. Higher restoration activity due to several severe storms in 2010 cost about $0.05 of this earnings decrease. higher tree trimming and environmental remediation costs were also factors partially offset by lower pension expense. 
For the fourth quarter of 2010, Power Delivery earnings excluding special items, were $0.24 per share compared to $0.14 per share for the fourth quarter of 2009. The higher earnings is the 2010 quarter were driven by higher distribution and transmission revenue due to higher rates in effect, higher sales and the adjustment related to the federal income tax settlement. Higher Power Delivery operation and maintenance expense partially offset the earnings increases. Pepco Energy Services full year 2010 earnings were $0.16 per share compared to $0.18 per share in 2009. Fourth quarter earnings were $0.03 per share as compared to $0.04 per share for the 2009 quarter. The decrease in earnings during both periods was due to lower retail electricity sales volumes due to the ongoing wind down of the Retail Energy Supply business and higher operation and maintenance expenses for the Thermal Services business partially offset by higher generation output and lower interest expense. 
In our corporate and other segment, which is primarily unallocated corporate costs, earnings improved by $0.15 per share year-over-year excluding special items. The earnings improvement is due to the favorable state income tax effect resulting from the corporate restructuring involving certain PHI entities as well as lower interest expense due to the pay down of parent company debt with the proceeds from the Conectiv Energy generation asset sale. Quarter-over-quarter, earnings improved by $0.01 per share driven by lower interest expense. Now I'll turn to some topics of interest for 2011. 
For 2011, we estimate the pension and other post-retirement benefit costs to be approximately $107 million across PHI as compared to $116 million in 2010. Historically about 70% of this amount is reflected in our operating expenses with the balance charged to capital. So as seen on Slide 15, we estimate that the pension and other post-retirement benefit expense will be approximately $75 million in 2011 as compared to $81 million in 2010. Additionally, although we project there will be no minimum funding requirement in 2011 under the Pension Protection Act, in accordance with our policy, we currently plan to make a discretionary tax-deductible contribution in 2011 of up to $150 million to bring the plan assets to at least the full funding level under the Pension Protection Act. The utility subsidiaries obligation for funding the plan is expected to be approximately 80% of this contribution. We made a $100 million contribution to the pension plan in 2010.
Late last year, legislation was passed to extend bonus depreciation through 2012. We expect to be in a net operating loss position for income tax purposes for at least 2011 and 2012. Therefore the cash flow benefit from bonus depreciation will be delayed but realized in future years. We plan to provide an update of our forecasted cash flow and financing plans in our upcoming analyst conference. 
Slide 16 and 17 show our earnings guidance for 2011 and expected major earnings drivers. Our 2011 earnings guidance range for ongoing operations is $1.10 to $1.25 per share. The guidance range excludes the results of discontinued operations and the impact of any special, unusual or extraordinary items. The guidance range also excludes the net mark-to-market effects of economic hedging activities at Pepco Energy Services. As we wind down the retail energy business, we are experiencing more hedge in effectiveness as the result of smaller loads and expect to experience some mark-to-market fluctuations over the next couple of years. Note that the guidance range takes into account the incremental storm events that Joe mentioned earlier. 
Looking at our range for 2011 versus actual results for 2010, significant drivers that are expected to have a positive impact on earnings include the annualization of interest savings resulting from debt retirement in 2010, which is expected to increase earnings by $0.12 per share and the annualization of 2010 distribution rate increases, which is expected to increase earnings by $0.05 per share. Also keep in mind that we incurred incremental storm costs of $0.05 or share in 2010.
A factor that will negatively impact earnings in 2011 is the $0.11 per share of earnings in 2010 resulting from income tax adjustments. Other factors that are expected to have a negative impact on earnings in 2011 as compared to 2010 include higher depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $0.07 per share from infrastructure investments and the assumed reversal of unbilled revenue related to Atlantic City Electric's basic generation service which contributed $0.03 per share to earnings in 2010. Our guidance range also assumes normal temperatures. 
Higher cooling degree days as compared to normal contributed $0.03 per share to earnings in 2010. And finally, the range also takes into consideration the incremental storm costs related to the January storm that Joe referred to, which we estimate to be approximately $0.02 per share. 
Now let me turn it back to Joe Rigby, for some closing remarks."

I would fully expect that not to similar what we have in our other jurisdictions that the state of Maryland will in fact, establish reliability standards and we're not going to be in opposition to that, we want to be a full participant in the development of those standards and to make sure that all the parties have a very thorough vetting of all the issues that come along with that. But from a directional point of view, we fully expect that outcome.

And I fully expect that the Maryland PSE here is going to work -- we're going to work our way through that issue in a very acceptable manner. The issue just on the franchise, I want to be really clear about that one. We're very much cognizant of the fact that it's been mentioned but obviously, we would vigorously oppose that as we take great pride and take it very seriously that this is who we are, these are our customers. So as it relates to someone raising the issue around our franchise, that would be one that we would oppose very, very vigorously. But I would tell you that the full force of the company is in monitoring this and I think most fundamentally, working to execute the reliability enhancement plan that I mentioned to improve service to our customers."

The sale of Conectiv Energy's generation assets and the exit from the merchant power business repositioned PHI as fundamentally a regulated utility company, a company focused on delivering reliable service and meeting customer expectations. The sale improved our business risk profile, lowered capital and collateral requirements, strengthened our credit profile and reduced earnings volatility. The year was also marked by steady progress on our key initiatives for the regulated business. Our plans for a Smart Grid are moving forward as we continue with meter installations in Delaware and the District of Columbia. 
Our build out of utility infrastructure is also progressing with $765 million in capital invested in the regulated business in 2010 including $226 million in transmission. Given this level of investment, we recognized the need to minimize regulatory lag and modified our approach to the rate case process with our most recent filing in Maryland. 2010 was a year in which we clarified our strategic vision as well as our value proposition for our customers and investors. 
Earnings from continuing operations for 2010 were $0.62 per share compared to $1.01 per share in 2009. Excluding special items in both periods, earnings would have been $1.24 per share in 2010 compared to $0.85 per share in 2009. Our operating results were driven by Power Delivery earnings that reflect the positive impact of our infrastructure investments, regulatory outcome and higher sales in our non-decoupled service territories. Lower interest expense resulting from the pay-down of parent company debt with Conectiv Energy's generation asset sale proceeds and income tax adjustments also boosted earnings. The results of the Conectiv Energy segment are accounted for as discontinued operations. 
As seen on Slide 3, our 2010 earnings guidance was a range of $1 to $1.10 per share. Several factors contributed to our results being in excess of our own guidance. As we noted in our third quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call, this range assumed a reversal of $0.07 of earnings per share from unbilled revenue related to Atlantic City Electric's basic generation service. In our results, only $0.04 per share reversed during the fourth quarter of 2010 leaving us with $0.03 per share in annual earnings related to Atlantic City Electric's basic generation service. Also in the fourth quarter of 2010, we recognized earnings of $0.07 per share related to a tax settlement with the Internal Revenue Service that was reached in the fourth quarter for the tax years 2001 and 2002. This tax settlement was not contemplated in the guidance range. Later during the call, Tony will address the settlement in more detail along with the financial results and our operating segment performance, but first I'll address some topics of interest. 
In 2010, we made great strides in implementing the blueprint for the future. The status by jurisdiction can be seen on Slide 4. About 215,000 advanced meters have been installed in Delaware for our electric and gas customers, and we expect to complete all of the meter exchanges in Delaware in the second quarter of 2011. We began activating meters in October and plan to have all Delaware meters activated in the third quarter. The initial functionality includes remote meter reading, billing and outage notification. In the District of Columbia, we began the deployment of advanced meters in October with a goal of having the installations completed by the end of 2011. As approved by the Commissions in Delaware and the District of Columbia, regulatory assets have been created to assure recovery of and a return on AMI-related cost between rate cases. 
In Maryland, the Public Service Commission also approved the creation of a regulatory asset for AMI-related cost. For Pepco, the Commission approved the deployment of advanced meters subject to the implementation of a Commission-approved customer education and communication plan. Pepco's proposed plan was approved by the Commission last week and we intend to begin meter installations in June from Pepco's Maryland customers. For Delmarva Power, the Maryland Commission deferred its decision on the deployment of advanced meters pending review and approval of an amended business case. We filed the business case in December, the procedural schedule has not yet been established. 
Through the build out of the Smart Grid, we will gain added tools to improve system reliability while providing customers with access to detailed usage information that will enable them to better manage their energy use and lower their energy bills. Our energy efficiency and demand side management programs will also help our customers to reduce energy cost. The cost of these programs will be recovered through DSM-related rate adjustment mechanisms. 
2010 was a very busy year on the regulatory front with decisions in four distribution base rate cases since the end of 2009 and the filing of two additional cases. The details of the decided cases can be seen on Slides 5 and 6. In total, an annual increase of $64 million in electric distribution base rates was authorized in the four decided cases. Delmarva Power's electric case in Delaware was the most recently decided. On January 18, the Commission approved a $16 million annual increase in distribution base rates based on a 10% return on equity. The new rates were effective February 1. 
Delmarva Power's request had been for an increase of $24 million. As permitted by Delaware law, Delmarva Power implemented, subject to refund, $2.5 million of the proposed rate increase in November 2009 and the balance in April 2010. The excess amount collected is being returned to customers which will impact cash flow but not earnings. The Commission deferred its decision on revenue decoupling pending Delmarva Power's development of an implementation plan including the plan for customer education. 
Slides 7 and 8 provide the details of the pending cases. On February 9, Delmarva Power, the Commission Staff and the Attorney General entered into a proposed settlement agreement in Delmarva Power's natural gas delivery base rate case in Delaware. The proposed settlement provides for an annual rate increase of $6 million for service rendered on and after April 1, 2011. The stated return on equity is 10%. The parties agreed to defer the request to place revenue decoupling into effect until an implementation plan has been developed. The proposed settlement agreement is subject to final review and approval by the public service commission. And a decision is expected by the end of March. 
Delmarva Power implemented interim rate increases of $2.5 million on August 31 and $7.7 million on February 2. The excess amount collected will be returned to customers. On December 21, Delmarva Power filed a distribution base rate case in Maryland seeking approval of an annual rate increase of $18 million based on a 10.75% return on equity. This filing includes comprehensive discussion on the topic of regulatory lag and its negative effects, as well as a proposal for the adoption of two mechanisms to reduce regulatory lag. The first is a reliability investment recovery mechanism, which provides full and timely recovery of future capital investments related to distribution system reliability. And the second is an annual rate review process, which would adjust rates annually using actual financial data and a return on equity approved in the most recent case to calculate a revenue requirement. This revenue requirement would then be the basis for any adjustment to rates. Hearings on the case are scheduled to begin May 31, with a decision expected in July of this year. 
As we previously reported in October, PJM reaffirmed the need for a mid-Atlantic power pathway or MAPP transmission project, with a one-year delay in the in-service date to June 1, 2015. The estimated total cost of the project remains $1.2 billion. PJM currently is in the annual process of reassessing reliability requirements for the region under its Regional Transmission Expansion Plan process. This reassessment includes the incorporation of a revised load forecast that is significantly lower than the load forecast used in prior studies. PJM's reassessment is expected to be completed this spring and will determine if there will be any further delay in the in-service date for the MAPP project. 
Meanwhile, as seen on Slide 9, we continue to move forward with seeking the required regulatory approvals for the project with the support of PJM. We filed an updated application for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity or CPCN with the Maryland Public Service Commission in November. A procedural schedule has been set with hearing scheduled to begin on September 6 and a final order expected in January, 2012. Field reviews with state and federal environmental agencies are substantially complete for the Southern Maryland portion of the line and we plan to file for the Maryland state environmental permit in the second quarter of 2011. 
Our projected capital expenditures are shown on Slide 10. Over the next five years, we expect to spend $3.1 billion on electric distribution, gas delivery and our blueprint for the future initiatives. These investments are aimed at improving reliability, enhancing customer service, meeting load growth and implementing AMI. In addition to the MAPP project, we expect to spend almost $1 billion on transmission infrastructure over this time period to improve reliability. Our transmission assets are subject to FERC jurisdiction and the transmission rates are set under a formula rate process. These assets earn returns on equity of either 11.3% or 12.8%. 
At Pepco Energy Services, profitable wind down of the Retail Energy Supply business continues to be on track, and we are making good progress in growing the Energy Services business. As seen on Slide 11, PES signed $169 million of new energy efficiency contracts in 2010 including large contracts with BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport, the Marine Corps and Prince George's County schools in Maryland. As seen on Slide 12, in December Pepco Energy Services entered into a contract to construct a 2.2-megawatt solar electric generating system for New Jersey's Atlantic Cape Community College at two of its campuses. Installation is expected to begin in May and to be completed in November. The solar photovoltaic system will generate almost half of the campuses’ electricity consumption. 
Since 1995, Pepco Energy Services has evolved to become one of the leading providers of energy efficiency and renewable energy services. We believe the benefits of energy efficiency provide long-term growth opportunities for this business, and we can grow Pepco Energy Services in a manner that is consistent with our lower risk profile. Before I turn it over to Tony, I want to address the impact of a recent storm that hit our service territories. In late January, we were hit by a severe winter storm that included heavy snow and ice. In the days that followed the storm, we restored service to approximately 250,000 customers, most of which were in the Pepco service territory. We currently estimate the cost of storm restoration to be approximately $15 million with 1/2 to 2/3 being expensed and the balance being charged to capital. 
Pepco's response to the storm has been criticized by customers and elected officials and received significant media attention. Earlier this month, lawmakers in Maryland introduced legislation to increase utility reliability by directing the Public Service Commission to establish reliability standards for Maryland electric companies. In August 2010, the Commission initiated a proceeding to investigate the reliability of Pepco's electric distribution system. The Commission recently expanded the scope of issues in the proceeding to include potential remedial action and has also proposed reliability standards. 
In the fall of 2010, we announced a six-point enhanced reliability plan for Pepco aimed at reducing both the frequency and duration of outage. The capital portion of the plan is reflected in the five-year forecast I discussed earlier. We will routinely assess this plan to determine the extent to which it can be accelerated and our major focus in 2011 will be on improving reliability. We will address our expected operation and maintenance expense at our upcoming analyst conference. 
At this point, let me turn it over to Tony Kamerick."

Our results for both the quarter and year-to-date periods show Conectiv Energy's results as discontinued operations. For the full year 2010, Pepco Holdings incurred an after-tax loss of $107 million from discontinued operations. This loss reflects the sale of the wholesale power generation business as well as the liquidation of substantially all of Conectiv Energy's remaining assets and businesses. No material amount of gain or loss is expected to be recognized from the liquidation of the few remaining assets and liabilities held in Conectiv Energy. 
Slide 13 summarizes our earnings for the full year and fourth quarter of 2010. Earnings from continuing operations for the full year of 2010 were $139 million or $0.62 per share compared to $223 million or $1.01 per share for the full year of 2009. There were three special items recorded in the 2010 period. The first is a $113-million after-tax charge for debt extinguishment costs that were incurred due to the early redemption of parent company debt primarily with the proceeds from the Conectiv Energy generation sale. The second is an $18 million after-tax restructuring charge related to an organizational review and the third is a $6-million after-tax charge due to the issuance of an order in the District of Columbia related to Pepco's divestiture of its generating assets in the year 2000. Note that we have filed an appeal of this order, which if successful, could result in a recovery of some or all of the charge. 
In the 2009 period, we recognized after-tax gains related to the Mirant bankruptcy settlement. We also recognized in Maryland state income tax benefit due to a change in the tax reporting for the disposition of certain assets in prior years. Excluding the special items, earnings from continuing operations for the full year 2010 would have been $276 million or $1.24 per share compared to $188 million or $0.85 per share in 2009. 
For the fourth quarter of 2010, earnings from continuing operations were $14 million or $0.06 per share compared to $39 million or $0.17 per share for the fourth quarter of 2009. Excluding the debt extinguishment costs and the restructuring charge, earnings from continuing operations for the 2010 quarter would have been $56 million or $0.25 per share. A summary of the drivers of our financial results can be found on Slide 14. 
As Joe mentioned in the fourth quarter of 2010, we reached a tax settlement with the Internal Revenue Service for the tax years 2001 and 2002, which affected our tax provisions as far back as 1996. This tax settlement covered all open issues for those years except for the cross-border leases. The estimated interest due to the IRS under the settlement was recalculated resulting in the reversal of $15 million of accrued interest after tax. This reversal increased earnings for the quarter and full year by $0.07 per share and primarily affected the Power Delivery segment. Though we do not expect an adjustment of this magnitude every year, until the IRS becomes more current with its audits, we can expect some level of adjustments as we reach settlements with the IRS in closed tax years. 
Power Delivery earnings excluding special items were $1.03 per share for the full year 2010 compared to $0.74 per share in 2009. Higher distribution rates during the year increased earnings by $0.11 per share. The higher rates reflect the impact of rate-case decisions for Pepco in the District of Columbia and Maryland, Delmarva Power in Maryland and for Atlantic City Electric. The higher rates also reflect the interim rates put in place for Delmarva Power in Delaware. 
Higher sales due to higher cooling degree days versus the prior year increased earnings by $0.07 per share. Cooling degree days were up 48%. Keep in mind that our distribution revenue in Maryland and the District of Columbia, which represents approximately 2/3 of total distribution revenue is decoupled from consumption and therefore is not impacted by temperature variations. Higher transmission revenue drove $0.10 per share of the earnings increase due to a higher investment in transmission assets. Also driving higher Power Delivery earnings was the adjustment related to the federal income tax settlement that I referred to earlier. 
Partially offsetting these increases was higher operation and maintenance expense, which reduced earnings by $0.12 per share year-over-year. Higher restoration activity due to several severe storms in 2010 cost about $0.05 of this earnings decrease. Higher tree trimming and environmental remediation costs were also factors partially offset by lower pension expense. 
For the fourth quarter of 2010, Power Delivery earnings excluding special items, were $0.24 per share compared to $0.14 per share for the fourth quarter of 2009. The higher earnings in the 2010 quarter were driven by higher distribution and transmission revenue due to higher rates in effect, higher sales and the adjustment related to the federal income tax settlement. Higher Power Delivery operation and maintenance expense partially offset the earnings increases. Pepco Energy Services full year 2010 earnings were $0.16 per share compared to $0.18 per share in 2009. Fourth quarter earnings were $0.03 per share as compared to $0.04 per share for the 2009 quarter. The decrease in earnings during both periods was due to lower retail electricity sales volumes due to the ongoing wind down of the Retail Energy Supply business and higher operation and maintenance expenses for the Thermal Services business partially offset by higher generation output and lower interest expense. 
In our corporate and other segment, which is primarily unallocated corporate costs, earnings improved by $0.15 per share year-over-year excluding special items. The earnings improvement is due to the favorable state income tax effect resulting from the corporate restructuring involving certain PHI entities as well as lower interest expense due to the pay-down of parent company debt with the proceeds from the Conectiv Energy generation asset sale. Quarter-over-quarter, earnings improved by $0.01 per share driven by lower interest expense. Now I'll turn to some topics of interest for 2011. 
For 2011, we estimate the pension and other post-retirement benefit costs to be approximately $107 million across PHI as compared to $116 million in 2010. Historically about 70% of this amount is reflected in our operating expenses with the balance charged to capital. So as seen on Slide 15, we estimate that the pension and other post-retirement benefit expense will be approximately $75 million in 2011 as compared to $81 million in 2010. Additionally, although we project there will be no minimum funding requirement in 2011 under the Pension Protection Act, in accordance with our policy, we currently plan to make a discretionary tax-deductible contribution in 2011 of up to $150 million to bring the plan assets to at least the full funding level under the Pension Protection Act. The utility subsidiaries’ obligation for funding the plan is expected to be approximately 80% of this contribution. We made a $100 million contribution to the pension plan in 2010.
Late last year, legislation was passed to extend bonus depreciation through 2012. We expect to be in a net operating loss position for income tax purposes for at least 2011 and 2012. Therefore the cash flow benefit from bonus depreciation will be delayed but realized in future years. We plan to provide an update of our forecasted cash flow and financing plans in our upcoming analyst conference. 
Slide 16 and 17 show our earnings guidance for 2011 and expected major earnings drivers. Our 2011 earnings guidance range for ongoing operations is $1.10 to $1.25 per share. The guidance range excludes the results of discontinued operations and the impact of any special, unusual or extraordinary items. The guidance range also excludes the net mark-to-market effects of economic hedging activities at Pepco Energy Services. As we wind down the retail energy business, we are experiencing more hedge in effectiveness as the result of smaller loads and expect to experience some mark-to-market fluctuations over the next couple of years. Note that the guidance range takes into account the incremental storm expense that Joe mentioned earlier. 
Looking at our range for 2011 versus actual results for 2010, significant drivers that are expected to have a positive impact on earnings include the annualization of interest savings resulting from debt retirement in 2010, which is expected to increase earnings by $0.12 per share and the annualization of 2010 distribution rate increases, which is expected to increase earnings by $0.05 per share. Also keep in mind that we incurred incremental storm costs of $0.05 per share in 2010.
A factor that will negatively impact earnings in 2011 is the $0.11 per share of earnings in 2010 resulting from income tax adjustments. Other factors that are expected to have a negative impact on earnings in 2011 as compared to 2010 include higher depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $0.07 per share from infrastructure investments and the assumed reversal of unbilled revenue related to Atlantic City Electric's basic generation service which contributed $0.03 per share to earnings in 2010. Our guidance range also assumes normal temperatures. 
Higher cooling degree days as compared to normal contributed $0.03 per share to earnings in 2010. And finally, the range also takes into consideration the incremental storm costs related to the January storm that Joe referred to, which we estimate to be approximately $0.02 per share. 
Now let me turn it back to Joe Rigby, for some closing remarks."

I mean, I haven't seen anything and I'm sure you guys are much more on top of this. I guess what I'm trying to get a sense of though, is how many of these bills do you think are really potentially possible for passage? The franchise bill, I don't really know what the impact of that kind of thing would be. Just how do we think about this?

The issues around reliability, I've said this several times in public settings that we are absolutely committed, if you just think about the repositioning we've gone through. For us success is very clear in terms of us improving the reliability of the system. We are deeply involved in tracking all of the issues that you mentioned, I will make a couple of comments. I would fully expect that not dissimilar to what we have in our other jurisdictions that the state of Maryland will, in fact, establish reliability standards, and we're not going to be in opposition to that. We want to be a full participant in the development of those standards and to make sure that all the parties have a very thorough vetting of all the issues that come along with that. But from a directional point of view, we fully expect that outcome. With respect to the discussion on the BSA, I think that one comment I would make there is that, what's being discussed around that is a component within the BSA that exists in the state of Maryland, which is intended to reflect outages during or reflect revenue during outages. And I fully expect that the Maryland PSE is going to work -- we're going to work our way through that issue in a very acceptable manner. The issue just on the franchise, I want to be really clear about that one. We're very much cognizant of the fact that it's been mentioned but obviously, we would vigorously oppose that as we take great pride and take it very seriously that this is who we are, these are our customers. So as it relates to someone raising the issue around our franchise, that would be one that we would oppose very, very vigorously. But I would tell you that the full force of the company is in monitoring this and I think most fundamentally, working to execute the reliability enhancement plan that I mentioned to improve service to our customers."

Earnings from continuing operations for the quarter were $62 million compared to $28 million in the 2010 quarter. Our operating results were driven by strong power delivery earnings that reflect the positive impact of our infrastructure investments and reasonable regulatory outcomes. Lower interest expense resulting from the paydown of parent company debt with Conectiv Energy's generation asset sales proceeds also boosted earnings. Our results for both 2011 and 2010 quarters reflect Conectiv Energy's results as discontinued operations. Tony will discuss the financial results and our operating segment performance in more detail but first I'll address some topics of interest starting with an update on our initiatives to improve system reliability as shown on Slide 3. 
We have made considerable progress advancing infrastructure improvements in performing system maintenance in the Pepco region that will reduce power outages and improve service to our customers. Since launching our Reliability Enhancement Plan last fall, we have increased our personnel from 80 to 350 from trace along 16,000 miles power lines replaced or upgraded on 70 miles underground cable and identified overhead lines for underground and among other efforts. We have also made several enhancements to improve customer communications during major storms. I want to reiterate my commitment to improving system reliability. This will remain a top priority for our company. 
We continue to make very good progress on our blueprint for the future initiatives. The status by jurisdiction can be seen on Slide 4. About 281,000 advanced meters have been installed in Delaware for our electric customers and we expect to complete the remaining electric meters exchanges in Delaware in the second quarter of 2011. We began activating meters in October and plan to have all Delaware electric meters activated in the third quarter. The initial functionality includes remote meter reading, the availability of accounts Pacific energy used information and outage detection. In the District of Columbia, we have installed about 50,000 advanced meters with a goal of having the installations completed by the end of 2011. As approved by the Commissions in Delaware and the District of Columbia, regulatory assets have been created to differ AMI-related cost between rate cases. The commissions have also approved the accrual of returns at the authorized rates of return on the deferred cost until such time as the cost and accrued returns can be incorporated in the customer rates. 
In Maryland, the Public Service Commission also approved the creation of a regulatory asset for AMI-related cost. At Pepco, the commission approved the deployment of advanced meters, subject to the implementation of a commission-approved customer education and communication plan. Pepco's plan was approved by the Commission in February and we intend to begin meter installations in June for Pepco's Maryland customers. For Delmarva Power, the Maryland Commission deferred its decision on the deployment of advanced meters pending review and approval of an amended business case. We filed a business case in December and a procedural schedule has not yet been established. 
On March 22, Delmarva Power made a filing with the Delaware Public Service Commission requesting permission to implement a dynamic pricing plan for Delaware customers to be phased in beginning in 2012. Under the proposed critical peak rebate structure, the plan will reward Standard Offer Service customers for lowering their energy use during critical peak periods when energy demand and the cost of supplying electricity are higher. Through the build out of the Smart Grid, we will gain added tools to improve system reliability while providing customers with access detailed usage information that will enable them to better manage their energy use and lower their energy bills. Our energy efficiency and demand side management programs will also help our customers to reduce energy cost. The cost of these programs will be recovered through the demand-side management-related rate adjustment mechanisms. 
Turning to our regulatory filings in February, Delmarva Power, the Commission Staff and the Attorney General entered into a proposed settlement agreement in Delmarva Power's natural gas delivery base rate case in Delaware. The proposed settlement summarized on Slide 5 have provide for an annual rate increase of $6 million based on a stated return on equity of 10%. The parties agreed to defer the request to place revenue decoupling into effect until an implementation plan has been developed. We are currently waiting the recommendation of hearing examiner. The proposed settlement agreement is subject to final review and approval by the Public Service Commission and a decision is expect shortly. Delmarva Power implemented interim rate increases of $2.5 million on August 31 and $7.7 million on February 2. And the excess amount collected will be returned to customers. 
Slide 6 and 7 summarized the status of Delmarva Power distribution base rate cases in Maryland, which is proceeding on schedule. The filing 6 approval on an annual rate increase of $80 million based on 10.75% return on equity. This filing includes the comprehensive discussion when the topic of regulatory lag and it's negative effects as well as proposal for the adoption of 2 mechanisms to reduce regulatory lag. The first is a reliability investment recovery mechanism, which provides full and timely recovery of future capital investments related to distribution system reliability. And the second is an annual rate review process, which would adjust rates annually using actual financial data and a return on equity approved in the most recent case to calculate the revenue requirement. This revenue requirement would then be the basis for any adjustments to rates. Hearings in the case are scheduled to begin on May 31, with a decision expected in July of this year. We remain on track with our preparations to file 4 additional rate cases later this year. As shown on Slide 8, we currently expect Pepco to file on the district later this quarter and Atlantic City Electric to file in New Jersey in the third quarter. 
In the fourth quarter, we plan to file cases in Maryland for Pepco and to Delaware for Delmarva Power Electric. Note that this filing schedule is tentative and may be impacted by financial projections or other considerations. We plan to include in our rate case filings a comprehensive discussion on the topic of regulatory lag and it's negative effects. Each of our filings will include proposals for methods to minimize lag. The status of that Mid-Atlantic Power Pathway or MAPP project can be seen on Slide 9. As we previously reported, PJM currently is in the process of evaluating reliability requirements for the region under its Regional Transmission Expansion Plan process. PJM has stated that it expects to complete this evaluation in August. The outcome of the evaluation could result in a delay of the in-service fee for the MAPP project beyond the current in-service date of June 1, 2015. 
In November, we filed an updated application for the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity with the Maryland Public Service Commission. Last week, Pepco and Delmarva Power made a filing with the hearing examiner in this case, requesting a 6-month delay for the procedure of schedule in order to allow for the completion of the ongoing PJM review. The proposed revision to the schedule costs for direct testimony of the parties to be filed in December, 2011, and evidentiary hearings to be held in March, 2012. The total projected construction costs for the MAPP project remains at $1.2 billion. Slide 10 shows the forecast that annual construction expenditures for our Power Delivery initiatives including the MAPP project. Due to the uncertainty of the MAPP projects in-service date, we currently anticipate that the 2011 construction expenditures associated with MAPP may be lower than our forecast by $90 million to $110 million. 
As shown on our April 8 Analyst Conference, Slide 11 shows the MAPP construction expenditures under 3 different in-service date scenarios: 2015, 2017 and 2019. As we discussed at our conference, should the MAPP project in-service be delayed beyond 2015, we expect to accelerate other Power Delivery projects resulting in no material change in the total construction expenditures over the next 5 years. If there is a change in the MAPP's projects in-service date as a result of PJM's evaluation, we will update our 5-year construction expenditure forecast accordingly. 
At Pepco Energy Services, the profitable wind down on the Retail Energy Supply business continues to be on track and we continue to make good progress in growing the Energy Services business. PES signed $8 million of new energy efficiency contracts in the first quarter of 2011 including a $6 million construction projects for the National Institutes of Health at Maryland. As shown on Slide 12, the business development efforts we have undertaken over the past 2 years are beginning to show results and the project development pipeline has grown to nearly $800 million. We believe the benefits of energy efficiency provide long term growth opportunities for this business and we can grow Pepco Energy Services in a manner that is consistent with our low risk profile. At this point, let me turn it over to Tony Kamerick. Tony?"

I'll recap our earnings, address our performance by operating segment and review our recent financing activity. We will then open the call to your questions. Earnings from continuing operations for the fir",694,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'll recap our earnings, address our performance by operating segment and review our recent financing activity. We will then open the call to your questions. Earnings from continuing operations for the first quarter were $62 million or $0.27 per share compared to $28 million or $0.13 per share for the first quarter of last year. There were no special items in either period. Our results show Conectiv Energy's results as discontinued operations. In the first quarter of 2011, income from discontinued operations net of taxes was $2 million. This includes income from adjustments to accrued expenses in connection with the sale of the generation assets partially offset by losses from the disposition of Conectiv Energy's remaining assets and businesses. A summary of the drivers of our financial results can be found on Slide 13. 
For the first quarter, Power Delivery earnings were $0.21 per share compared to $0.09 per share for the 2010 period. Higher distribution rates during the quarter increased earnings by $0.06 per share. The higher rates reflect the impact of electric rate decisions for Pepco in the District of Columbia and Maryland, for Atlantic City Electric and for Delmarva Power in Delaware. The higher rates also reflect the interim rates put in effect for Delmarva Power's gas business in Delaware. These rate increases were driven by higher cost and increased investment in distribution assets to enhance reliability. Higher transmission revenue drove $0.05 per share of the earnings increase due to higher investment transmission assets. Higher weather-related sales versus the prior year increase quarterly earnings by $0.01 per share. Heating degree days increased by 2% quarter-over-quarter. Keep in mind that our distribution revenue in Maryland and the District of Columbia which represents approximately 2/3 of total distribution revenue is decoupled from consumption and therefore, the higher sales due to weather will not increase the distribution portion of customer bills in those jurisdictions. Also contributing to the earnings increase is higher distribution revenue due to growth in the number of customers, higher margins from the supply of Standard Offer Service, higher unbilled revenue related to Atlantic City electric basic generation service and the impact of unfavorable income tax adjustments in the first quarter of 2010. Partially offsetting these increases was higher operation and maintenance expense, which reduced earnings by $0.07 per share. This increase was driven by higher tree terming and corrective and preventive maintenance costs as well as higher employee-related expenses. 
Pepco Energy Services first quarter earnings were $0.05 per share compared to $0.06 per share in the same quarter of last year. The decrease in earnings was due to lower retail electricity sales volumes due to the ongoing wind down of the Retail Energy Supply business, partially offset by higher construction revenues. Note that each of the 2011 and 2010 quarters includes net mark-to-market losses on energy supply contracts of approximately $0.01 per share. Now our corporate and other segment, which is primarily unallocated corporate costs, earnings improved by $0.02 per share quarter-over-quarter. The earnings improvement resulted from lower interest expense due to lower parent company debt outstanding. 
Turning to Slide 14, given the year-to-date results and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are reaffirming our 2011 earnings guidance range of $1.10 to $1.25 per share. I'll now turn to our recent financing activity, which is summarized on Slide 15. On February 25, Atlantic City Electric redeemed all of it's outstanding cumulative preferred stock for approximately $6 million. This redemption leaves no outstanding preferred stock at PHI or any of the subsidiaries. On April 5, Atlanctic City Electric issued $200 million of first mortgage bonds. The bonds bear interest at an annual fixed rate of 4.35% and are due on April 1, 2021. The proceeds from the sale of the bonds were used to redeem Atlantic City Electric commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. Earlier this week, Delmarva Power repurchased $35 million of 4.9% tax exempt bonds due in 2026, pursuant to a mandatory repurchase obligation. We plan to remarket the bonds later this quarter. Now let me turn it back to Joe Rigby for some closing remarks."

Thank you for joining us today. Earnings from continuing operations for the quarter were $62 million compared to $28 million in the 2010 quarter. Our operating results were driven by strong Power Deli",1519,"Thanks, Donna, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today. Earnings from continuing operations for the quarter were $62 million compared to $28 million in the 2010 quarter. Our operating results were driven by strong Power Delivery earnings that reflect the positive impact of our infrastructure investments and reasonable regulatory outcomes. Lower interest expense resulting from the paydown of parent company debt with Conectiv Energy's generation asset sale proceeds also boosted earnings. Our results for both 2011 and 2010 quarters reflect Conectiv Energy's results as discontinued operations. Tony will discuss the financial results and our operating segment performance in more detail, but first I'll address some topics of interest, starting with an update on our initiatives to improve system reliability as shown on Slide 3. 
We have made considerable progress advancing infrastructure improvements and performing system maintenance in the Pepco region that will reduce power outages and improve service to our customers. Since launching our Reliability Enhancement Plan last fall, we have increased our tree trimming personnel from 80 to 350, trimming trees along 16,000 miles of power lines replaced or upgraded on 70 miles of underground cable and identified overhead lines for underground, among other efforts. We have also made several enhancements to improve customer communications during major storms. I want to reiterate my commitment to improving system reliability. This will remain a top priority for our company. 
We continue to make very good progress on our blueprint for the future initiatives. The status by jurisdiction can be seen on Slide 4. About 281,000 advanced meters have been installed in Delaware for our electric customers, and we expect to complete the remaining electric meter exchanges in Delaware in the second quarter of 2011. We began activating meters in October and plan to have all Delaware electric meters activated in the third quarter. The initial functionality includes remote meter reading, the availability of account-specific energy use information and outage detection. In the District of Columbia, we have installed about 50,000 advanced meters with a goal of having the installations completed by the end of 2011. 
As approved by the commissions in Delaware and the District of Columbia, regulatory assets have been created to defer AMI-related costs between rate cases. The commissions have also approved the accrual of returns at the authorized rates of return on the deferred costs until such time as the costs and accrued returns can be incorporated in the customer rates. 
In Maryland, the Public Service Commission also approved the creation of a regulatory asset for AMI-related costs. For Pepco, the Commission approved the deployment of advanced meters subject to the implementation of a Commission-approved customer education and communication plan. Pepco's plan was approved by the Commission in February, and we intend to begin meter installations in June for Pepco's Maryland customers. 
For Delmarva Power, the Maryland Commission deferred its decision on the deployment of advanced meters pending review and approval of an amended business case. We filed the business case in December, and a procedural schedule has not yet been established. 
On March 22, Delmarva Power made a filing with the Delaware Public Service Commission requesting permission to implement a dynamic pricing plan for Delaware customers to be phased in beginning in 2012. Under the proposed Critical Peak Rebate structure, the plan would reward Standard Offer Service customers for lowering their energy use during critical peak periods when energy demand and the cost of supplying electricity are higher. 
With the build out of the Smart Grid, we will gain added tools to improve system reliability while providing customers with access to detailed usage information that will enable them to better manage their energy use and lower their energy bills. Our energy efficiency and demand side management programs will also help our customers to reduce energy cost. The cost of these programs will be recovered through demand-side management-related rate adjustment mechanisms. 
Turning to our regulatory filings in February. Delmarva Power, the Commission Staff and the Attorney General entered into a proposed settlement agreement in Delmarva Power's natural gas delivery base rate case in Delaware. The proposed settlement is summarized on Slide 5 and provide for an annual rate increase of $6 million based on a stated return on equity of 10%. The parties agreed to defer the request to place revenue decoupling into effect until an implementation plan has been developed. We are currently waiting the recommendation of the hearing examiner. The proposed settlement agreement is subject to final review and approval by the Public Service Commission, and a decision is expect shortly. Delmarva Power implemented interim rate increases of $2.5 million on August 31 and $7.7 million on February 2. Any excess amount collected will be returned to customers. 
Slides 6 and 7 summarize the status of Delmarva Power's distribution base rate cases in Maryland, which is proceeding on schedule. The filing seeks  approval on an annual rate increase of $18 million based on 10.75% return on equity. This filing includes a comprehensive discussion on the topic of regulatory lag and its negative effects, as well as a proposal for the adoption of 2 mechanisms to reduce regulatory lag. The first is a reliability investment recovery mechanism, which provides full and timely recovery of future capital investments related to distribution system reliability. And the second is an annual rate review process, which will adjust rates annually using actual financial data and the return on equity approved in the most recent case to calculate a revenue requirement. This revenue requirement would then be the basis for any adjustment to rates. Hearings in the case are scheduled to begin on May 31 with a decision expected in July of this year. 
We remain on track with our preparations to file 4 additional rate cases later this year. As shown on Slide 8, we currently expect Pepco to file in the district later this quarter and Atlantic City Electric to file in New Jersey in the third quarter. 
In the fourth quarter, we plan to file cases in Maryland for Pepco and in Delaware for Delmarva Power Electric. Note that this filing schedule is tentative and may be impacted by financial projections or other considerations. 
We plan to include in our rate case filings a comprehensive discussion on the topic of regulatory lag and its negative effects. Each of our filings will include proposals for methods to minimize lag. 
The status of that Mid-Atlantic Power Pathway, or MAPP project, can be seen on Slide 9. As we've previously reported, PJM currently is in the process of evaluating reliability requirements for the region under its Regional Transmission Expansion Plan process. PJM has stated that it expects to complete this evaluation in August. The outcome of the evaluation could result in a delay of the in-service date for the MAPP project beyond the current in-service date of June 1, 2015. 
In November, we filed an updated application for the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity with the Maryland Public Service Commission. Last week, Pepco and Delmarva Power made a filing with the hearing examiner in this case, requesting a 6-month delay to the procedural schedule in order to allow for the completion of the ongoing PJM review. The proposed revision to the schedule calls for direct testimony of the parties to be filed in December 2011 and evidentiary hearings to be held in March 2012. 
The total projected construction cost for the MAPP project remains at $1.2 billion. Slide 10 shows the forecasted annual construction expenditures for our Power Delivery initiatives, including the MAPP project. Due to the uncertainty of the MAPP project's in-service date, we currently anticipate that the 2011 construction expenditures associated with MAPP may be lower than our forecast by $90 million to $110 million. 
As shown at our April 8 Analyst Conference, Slide 11 shows the MAPP construction expenditures under 3 different in-service date scenarios: 2015, 2017 and 2019. As we discussed at our conference, should the MAPP project in-service date be delayed beyond 2015, we expect to accelerate other Power Delivery projects, resulting in no material change in the total construction expenditures over the next 5 years. If there is a change in the MAPP's project's in-service date as a result of PJM's evaluation, we will update our 5-year Construction Expenditure Forecast accordingly. 
At Pepco Energy Services, the profitable wind down of the Retail Energy Supply business continues to be on track, and we continue to make good progress in growing the Energy Services business. PES signed $8 million of new energy efficiency contracts in the first quarter of 2011, including a $6 million construction projects for the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. As shown on Slide 12, the business development efforts we have undertaken over the past 2 years are beginning to show results, and the project development pipeline has grown to nearly $800 million. We believe the benefits of energy efficiency provide long-term growth opportunities for this business, and we can grow Pepco Energy Services in a manner that is consistent with our low-risk profile. At this point, let me turn it over to Tony Kamerick. Tony?"

I'll recap our earnings, address our performance by operating segment and review our recent financing activity. We will then open the call to your questions. 
Earnings from continuing operations for the first quarter were $62 million or $0.27 per share compared to $28 million or $0.13 per share for the first quarter of last year. There were no special items in either period. Our results show Conectiv Energy's results as discontinued operations. 
In the first quarter of 2011, income from discontinued operations net of taxes was $2 million. This includes income from adjustments to accrued expenses in connection with the sale of the generation assets, partially offset by losses from the disposition of Conectiv Energy's remaining assets and businesses. 
A summary of the drivers of our financial results can be found on Slide 13. For the first quarter, Power Delivery earnings were $0.21 per share compared to $0.09 per share for the 2010 period. Higher distribution rates during the quarter increased earnings by $0.06 per share. The higher rates reflect the impact of electric rate decisions for Pepco in the District of Columbia and Maryland, for Atlantic City Electric and for Delmarva Power in Delaware. The higher rates also reflect the interim rates put in effect for Delmarva Power's Gas business in Delaware. These rate increases were driven by higher costs and increased investment in distribution assets to enhance reliability. Higher transmission revenue drove $0.05 per share of the earnings increase due to higher investment in transmission assets. 
Higher weather-related sales versus the prior year increased quarterly earnings by $0.01 per share. Heating degree days increased by 2% quarter-over-quarter. Keep in mind that our distribution revenue in Maryland and the District of Columbia, which represents approximately 2/3 of total distribution revenue, is decoupled from consumption, and, therefore, the higher sales due to weather will not increase the distribution portion of customer bills in those jurisdictions. 
Also contributing to the earnings increase is higher distribution revenue due to growth in the number of customers, higher margins from the supply of Standard Offer Service, higher unbilled revenue related to Atlantic City Electric's basic generation service and the impact of unfavorable income tax adjustments in the first quarter of 2010. Partially offsetting these increases was higher operation and maintenance expense, which reduced earnings by $0.07 per share. This increase was driven by higher tree trimming and corrective and preventive maintenance costs as well as higher employee-related expenses. 
Pepco Energy Services' first quarter earnings were $0.05 per share compared to $0.06 per share in the same quarter of last year. The decrease in earnings was due to lower retail electricity sales volumes due to the ongoing wind down of the Retail Energy Supply business, partially offset by higher construction revenues. Note that each of the 2011 and 2010 quarters includes net mark-to-market losses on energy supply contracts of approximately $0.01 per share. 
In our Corporate and Other segment, which is primarily unallocated corporate costs, earnings improved by $0.02 per share quarter-over-quarter. The earnings improvement resulted from lower interest expense due to lower parent company debt outstanding. 
Turning to Slide 14. Given the year-to-date results and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are reaffirming our 2011 earnings guidance range of $1.10 to $1.25 per share. 
I'll now turn to our recent financing activity, which is summarized on Slide 15. On February 25, Atlantic City Electric redeemed all of its outstanding cumulative preferred stock for approximately $6 million. This redemption leaves no outstanding preferred stock at PHI or any of its subsidiaries. 
On April 5, Atlantic City Electric issued $200 million of first mortgage bonds. The bonds bear interest at an annual fixed rate of 4.35% and are due on April 1, 2021. The proceeds from the sale of the bonds were used to redeem Atlantic City Electric commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. 
Earlier this week, Delmarva Power repurchased $35 million of 4.9% tax-exempt bonds due in 2026, pursuant to a mandatory repurchase obligation. We plan to remarket the bonds later this quarter. Now let me turn it back to Joe Rigby for some closing remarks."

And for the most part, we operate in states that have very strongly stated goals of reducing energy consumption by fairly aggressive amounts.

297660,130655253,123778,"Pepco Holdings, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 06, 2011",2011-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Pepco Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Donna, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today. Earnings from continuing operations for the quarter were $62 million compared to $28 million in the 2010 quarter. Our operating results were driven by strong Power Deli",1520,"Thanks, Donna, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today. Earnings from continuing operations for the quarter were $62 million compared to $28 million in the 2010 quarter. Our operating results were driven by strong Power Delivery earnings that reflect the positive impact of our infrastructure investments and reasonable regulatory outcomes. Lower interest expense resulting from the paydown of parent company debt with Conectiv Energy's generation asset sale proceeds also boosted earnings. Our results for both 2011 and 2010 quarters reflect Conectiv Energy's results as discontinued operations. Tony will discuss the financial results and our operating segment performance in more detail, but first I'll address some topics of interest, starting with an update on our initiatives to improve system reliability as shown on Slide 3. 
We have made considerable progress advancing infrastructure improvements and performing system maintenance in the Pepco region that will reduce power outages and improve service to our customers. Since launching our Reliability Enhancement Plan last fall, we have increased our tree trimming personnel from 80 to 350, trimming trees along 16,000 miles of power lines replaced or upgraded on the 70 miles of underground cable and identified overhead lines for underground, among other efforts. We have also made several enhancements to improve customer communications during major storms. I want to reiterate my commitment to improving system reliability. This will remain a top priority for our company. 
We continue to make very good progress on our blueprint for the future initiatives. The status by jurisdiction can be seen on Slide 4. About 281,000 advanced meters have been installed in Delaware for our electric customers, and we expect to complete the remaining electric meter exchanges in Delaware in the second quarter of 2011. We began activating meters in October and plan to have all Delaware electric meters activated in the third quarter. The initial functionality includes remote meter reading, the availability of account-specific energy use information and outage detection. In the District of Columbia, we have installed about 50,000 advanced meters with a goal of having the installations completed by the end of 2011. 
As approved by the commissions in Delaware and the District of Columbia, regulatory assets have been created to defer AMI-related costs between rate cases. The commissions have also approved the accrual of returns at the authorized rates of return on the deferred costs until such time as the costs and accrued returns can be incorporated into customer rates. 
In Maryland, the Public Service Commission also approved the creation of a regulatory asset for AMI-related costs. For Pepco, the Commission approved the deployment of advanced meters subject to the implementation of a Commission-approved customer education and communication plan. Pepco's plan was approved by the Commission in February, and we intend to begin meter installations in June for Pepco's Maryland customers. 
For Delmarva Power, the Maryland Commission deferred its decision on the deployment of advanced meters pending review and approval of an amended business case. We filed the business case in December, and a procedural schedule has not yet been established. 
On March 22, Delmarva Power made a filing with the Delaware Public Service Commission requesting permission to implement a dynamic pricing plan for Delaware customers to be phased in beginning in 2012. Under the proposed Critical Peak Rebate structure, the plan would reward Standard Offer Service customers for lowering their energy use during critical peak periods when energy demand and the cost of supplying electricity are higher. 
With the build out of the Smart Grid, we will gain added tools to improve system reliability while providing customers with access to detailed usage information that will enable them to better manage their energy use and lower their energy bills. Our energy efficiency and demand side management programs will also help our customers to reduce energy cost. The cost of these programs will be recovered through demand-side management-related rate adjustment mechanisms. 
Turning to our regulatory filings in February. Delmarva Power, the Commission Staff and the Attorney General entered into a proposed settlement agreement in Delmarva Power's natural gas delivery base rate case in Delaware. The proposed settlement is summarized on Slide 5 and provides for an annual rate increase of $6 million based on a stated return on equity of 10%. The parties agreed to defer the request to place revenue decoupling into effect until an implementation plan has been developed. We are currently awaiting the recommendation of the hearing examiner. The proposed settlement agreement is subject to final review and approval by the Public Service Commission, and a decision is expected shortly. Delmarva Power implemented interim rate increases of $2.5 million on August 31 and $7.7 million on February 2. Any excess amount collected will be returned to customers. 
Slides 6 and 7 summarize the status of Delmarva Power's distribution base rate cases in Maryland, which is proceeding as scheduled. The filing seeks approval on an annual rate increase of $18 million based on a 10.75% return on equity. This filing includes a comprehensive discussion on the topic of regulatory lag and its negative effects, as well as a proposal for the adoption of 2 mechanisms to reduce regulatory lag. The first is a reliability investment recovery mechanism, which provides full and timely recovery of future capital investments related to distribution system reliability. And the second is an annual rate review process, which will adjust rates annually using actual financial data and the return on equity approved in the most recent case to calculate a revenue requirement. This revenue requirement would then be the basis for any adjustment to rates. Hearings in the case are scheduled to begin on May 31 with a decision expected in July of this year. 
We remain on track with our preparations to file 4 additional rate cases later this year. As shown on Slide 8, we currently expect Pepco to file in the district later this quarter and Atlantic City Electric to file in New Jersey in the third quarter. 
In the fourth quarter, we plan to file cases in Maryland for Pepco and in Delaware for Delmarva Power Electric. Note that this filing schedule is tentative and may be impacted by financial projections or other considerations. 
We plan to include in our rate case filings a comprehensive discussion on the topic of regulatory lag and its negative effects. Each of our filings will include proposals for methods to minimize lag. 
The status of the Mid-Atlantic Power Pathway, or MAPP project, can be seen on Slide 9. As we've previously reported, PJM currently is in the process of evaluating reliability requirements for the region under its Regional Transmission Expansion Plan process. PJM has stated that it expects to complete this evaluation in August. The outcome of the evaluation could result in a delay of the in-service date for the MAPP project beyond the current in-service date of June 1, 2015. 
In November, we filed an updated application for the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity with the Maryland Public Service Commission. Last week, Pepco and Delmarva Power made a filing with the hearing examiner in this case, requesting a 6-month delay to the procedural schedule in order to allow for the completion of the ongoing PJM review. The proposed revision to the schedule calls for direct testimony of the parties to be filed in December 2011 and evidentiary hearings to be held in March 2012. 
The total projected construction cost for the MAPP project remains at $1.2 billion. Slide 10 shows the forecasted annual construction expenditures for our Power Delivery initiatives, including the MAPP project. Due to the uncertainty of the MAPP project's in-service date, we currently anticipate that the 2011 construction expenditures associated with MAPP may be lower than our forecast by $90 million to $110 million. 
As shown at our April 8 Analyst Conference, Slide 11 shows the MAPP construction expenditures under 3 different in-service date scenarios: 2015, 2017 and 2019. As we discussed at our conference, should the MAPP project in-service date be delayed beyond 2015, we expect to accelerate other Power Delivery projects, resulting in no material change in the total construction expenditures over the next 5 years. If there is a change in the MAPP's project's in-service date as a result of PJM's evaluation, we will update our 5-year Construction Expenditure Forecast accordingly. 
At Pepco Energy Services, the profitable wind down of the Retail Energy Supply business continues to be on track, and we continue to make good progress in growing the Energy Services business. PES signed $8 million of new energy efficiency contracts in the first quarter of 2011, including a $6 million construction projects for the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. As shown on Slide 12, the business development efforts we have undertaken over the past 2 years are beginning to show results, and the project development pipeline has grown to nearly $800 million. We believe the benefits of energy efficiency provide long-term growth opportunities for this business, and we can grow Pepco Energy Services in a manner that is consistent with our low-risk profile. At this point, let me turn it over to Tony Kamerick. Tony?"
297660,130655253,123778,"Pepco Holdings, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 06, 2011",2011-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Pepco Holdings LLC","Executives","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'll recap our earnings, address our performance by operating segment and review our recent financing activity. We will then open the call to your questions. Earnings from continuing operations for the f",694,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'll recap our earnings, address our performance by operating segment and review our recent financing activity. We will then open the call to your questions. 
Earnings from continuing operations for the first quarter were $62 million or $0.27 per share compared to $28 million or $0.13 per share for the first quarter of last year. There were no special items in either period. Our results show Conectiv Energy's results as discontinued operations. 
In the first quarter of 2011, income from discontinued operations net of taxes was $2 million. This includes income from adjustments to accrued expenses in connection with the sale of the generation assets, partially offset by losses from the disposition of Conectiv Energy's remaining assets and businesses. 
A summary of the drivers of our financial results can be found on Slide 13. For the first quarter, Power Delivery earnings were $0.21 per share compared to $0.09 per share for the 2010 period. Higher distribution rates during the quarter increased earnings by $0.06 per share. The higher rates reflect the impact of electric rate decisions for Pepco in the District of Columbia and Maryland, for Atlantic City Electric and for Delmarva Power in Delaware. The higher rates also reflect the interim rates put in effect for Delmarva Power's Gas business in Delaware. These rate increases were driven by higher costs and increased investment in distribution assets to enhance reliability. Higher transmission revenue drove $0.05 per share of the earnings increase due to higher investment in transmission assets. 
Higher weather-related sales versus the prior year increased quarterly earnings by $0.01 per share. Heating degree days increased by 2% quarter-over-quarter. Keep in mind that our distribution revenue in Maryland and the District of Columbia, which represents approximately 2/3 of total distribution revenue, is decoupled from consumption, and, therefore, the higher sales due to weather will not increase the distribution portion of customer bills in those jurisdictions. 
Also contributing to the earnings increase is higher distribution revenue due to growth in the number of customers, higher margins from the supply of Standard Offer Service, higher unbilled revenue related to Atlantic City Electric's basic generation service and the impact of unfavorable income tax adjustments in the first quarter of 2010. Partially offsetting these increases was higher operation and maintenance expense, which reduced earnings by $0.07 per share. This increase was driven by higher tree trimming and corrective and preventive maintenance costs as well as higher employee-related expenses. 
Pepco Energy Services' first quarter earnings were $0.05 per share compared to $0.06 per share in the same quarter of last year. The decrease in earnings was due to lower retail electricity sales volumes due to the ongoing wind down of the Retail Energy Supply business, partially offset by higher construction revenues. Note that each of the 2011 and 2010 quarters includes net mark-to-market losses on energy supply contracts of approximately $0.01 per share. 
In our Corporate and Other segment, which is primarily unallocated corporate costs, earnings improved by $0.02 per share quarter-over-quarter. The earnings improvement resulted from lower interest expense due to lower parent company debt outstanding. 
Turning to Slide 14. Given the year-to-date results and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are reaffirming our 2011 earnings guidance range of $1.10 to $1.25 per share. 
I'll now turn to our recent financing activity, which is summarized on Slide 15. On February 25, Atlantic City Electric redeemed all of its outstanding cumulative preferred stock for approximately $6 million. This redemption leaves no outstanding preferred stock at PHI or any of its subsidiaries. 
On April 5, Atlantic City Electric issued $200 million of first mortgage bonds. The bonds bear interest at an annual fixed rate of 4.35% and are due on April 1, 2021. The proceeds from the sale of the bonds were used to redeem Atlantic City Electric commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. 
Earlier this week, Delmarva Power repurchased $35 million of 4.9% tax-exempt bonds due in 2026, pursuant to a mandatory repurchase obligation. We plan to remarket the bonds later this quarter. Now let me turn it back to Joe Rigby for some closing remarks."

Thank you for joining us today. Earnings from continuing operations for the quarter were $62 million compared to $28 million in the 2010 quarter. Our operating results were driven by strong Power Deli",1520,"Thanks, Donna, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today. Earnings from continuing operations for the quarter were $62 million compared to $28 million in the 2010 quarter. Our operating results were driven by strong Power Delivery earnings that reflect the positive impact of our infrastructure investments and reasonable regulatory outcomes. Lower interest expense resulting from the paydown of parent company debt with Conectiv Energy's generation asset sale proceeds also boosted earnings. Our results for both 2011 and 2010 quarters reflect Conectiv Energy's results as discontinued operations. Tony will discuss the financial results and our operating segment performance in more detail, but first I'll address some topics of interest, starting with an update on our initiatives to improve system reliability as shown on Slide 3. 
We have made considerable progress advancing infrastructure improvements and performing system maintenance in the Pepco region that will reduce power outages and improve service to our customers. Since launching our Reliability Enhancement Plan last fall, we have increased our tree trimming personnel from 80 to 350, trimming trees along 16,000 miles of power lines replaced or upgraded on the 70 miles of underground cable and identified overhead lines for underground, among other efforts. We have also made several enhancements to improve customer communications during major storms. I want to reiterate my commitment to improving system reliability. This will remain a top priority for our company. 
We continue to make very good progress on our blueprint for the future initiatives. The status by jurisdiction can be seen on Slide 4. About 281,000 advanced meters have been installed in Delaware for our electric customers, and we expect to complete the remaining electric meter exchanges in Delaware in the second quarter of 2011. We began activating meters in October and plan to have all Delaware electric meters activated in the third quarter. The initial functionality includes remote meter reading, the availability of account-specific energy use information and outage detection. In the District of Columbia, we have installed about 50,000 advanced meters with a goal of having the installations completed by the end of 2011. 
As approved by the commissions in Delaware and the District of Columbia, regulatory assets have been created to defer AMI-related costs between rate cases. The commissions have also approved the accrual of returns at the authorized rates of return on the deferred costs until such time as the costs and accrued returns can be incorporated into customer rates. 
In Maryland, the Public Service Commission also approved the creation of a regulatory asset for AMI-related costs. For Pepco, the Commission approved the deployment of advanced meters subject to the implementation of a Commission-approved customer education and communication plan. Pepco's plan was approved by the Commission in February, and we intend to begin meter installations in June for Pepco's Maryland customers. 
For Delmarva Power, the Maryland Commission deferred its decision on the deployment of advanced meters pending review and approval of an amended business case. We filed the business case in December, and a procedural schedule has not yet been established. 
On March 22, Delmarva Power made a filing with the Delaware Public Service Commission requesting permission to implement a dynamic pricing plan for Delaware customers to be phased in beginning in 2012. Under the proposed Critical Peak Rebate structure, the plan would reward Standard Offer Service customers for lowering their energy use during critical peak periods when energy demand and the cost of supplying electricity are higher. 
With the build out of the Smart Grid, we will gain added tools to improve system reliability while providing customers with access to detailed usage information that will enable them to better manage their energy use and lower their energy bills. Our energy efficiency and demand side management programs will also help our customers to reduce energy cost. The cost of these programs will be recovered through demand-side management-related rate adjustment mechanisms. 
Turning to our regulatory filings in February. Delmarva Power, the Commission Staff and the Attorney General entered into a proposed settlement agreement in Delmarva Power's natural gas delivery base rate case in Delaware. The proposed settlement is summarized on Slide 5 and provides for an annual rate increase of $6 million based on a stated return on equity of 10%. The parties agreed to defer the request to place revenue decoupling into effect until an implementation plan has been developed. We are currently awaiting the recommendation of the hearing examiner. The proposed settlement agreement is subject to final review and approval by the Public Service Commission, and a decision is expected shortly. Delmarva Power implemented interim rate increases of $2.5 million on August 31 and $7.7 million on February 2. Any excess amount collected will be returned to customers. 
Slides 6 and 7 summarize the status of Delmarva Power's distribution base rate cases in Maryland, which is proceeding as scheduled. The filing seeks approval on an annual rate increase of $18 million based on a 10.75% return on equity. This filing includes a comprehensive discussion on the topic of regulatory lag and its negative effects, as well as a proposal for the adoption of 2 mechanisms to reduce regulatory lag. The first is a reliability investment recovery mechanism, which provides full and timely recovery of future capital investments related to distribution system reliability. And the second is an annual rate review process, which will adjust rates annually using actual financial data and the return on equity approved in the most recent case to calculate a revenue requirement. This revenue requirement would then be the basis for any adjustment to rates. Hearings in the case are scheduled to begin on May 31 with a decision expected in July of this year. 
We remain on track with our preparations to file 4 additional rate cases later this year. As shown on Slide 8, we currently expect Pepco to file in the district later this quarter and Atlantic City Electric to file in New Jersey in the third quarter. 
In the fourth quarter, we plan to file cases in Maryland for Pepco and in Delaware for Delmarva Power Electric. Note that this filing schedule is tentative and may be impacted by financial projections or other considerations. 
We plan to include in our rate case filings a comprehensive discussion on the topic of regulatory lag and its negative effects. Each of our filings will include proposals for methods to minimize lag. 
The status of the Mid-Atlantic Power Pathway, or MAPP project, can be seen on Slide 9. As we've previously reported, PJM currently is in the process of evaluating reliability requirements for the region under its Regional Transmission Expansion Plan process. PJM has stated that it expects to complete this evaluation in August. The outcome of the evaluation could result in a delay of the in-service date for the MAPP project beyond the current in-service date of June 1, 2015. 
In November, we filed an updated application for the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity with the Maryland Public Service Commission. Last week, Pepco and Delmarva Power made a filing with the hearing examiner in this case, requesting a 6-month delay to the procedural schedule in order to allow for the completion of the ongoing PJM review. The proposed revision to the schedule calls for direct testimony of the parties to be filed in December 2011 and evidentiary hearings to be held in March 2012. 
The total projected construction cost for the MAPP project remains at $1.2 billion. Slide 10 shows the forecasted annual construction expenditures for our Power Delivery initiatives, including the MAPP project. Due to the uncertainty of the MAPP project's in-service date, we currently anticipate that the 2011 construction expenditures associated with MAPP may be lower than our forecast by $90 million to $110 million. 
As shown at our April 8 Analyst Conference, Slide 11 shows the MAPP construction expenditures under 3 different in-service date scenarios: 2015, 2017 and 2019. As we discussed at our conference, should the MAPP project in-service date be delayed beyond 2015, we expect to accelerate other Power Delivery projects, resulting in no material change in the total construction expenditures over the next 5 years. If there is a change in the MAPP's project's in-service date as a result of PJM's evaluation, we will update our 5-year Construction Expenditure Forecast accordingly. 
At Pepco Energy Services, the profitable wind down of the Retail Energy Supply business continues to be on track, and we continue to make good progress in growing the Energy Services business. PES signed $8 million of new energy efficiency contracts in the first quarter of 2011, including a $6 million construction projects for the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. As shown on Slide 12, the business development efforts we have undertaken over the past 2 years are beginning to show results, and the project development pipeline has grown to nearly $800 million. We believe the benefits of energy efficiency provide long-term growth opportunities for this business, and we can grow Pepco Energy Services in a manner that is consistent with our low-risk profile. At this point, let me turn it over to Tony Kamerick. Tony?"

Earnings from continuing operations for the first quarter were $62 million or $0.27 per share compared to $28 million or $0.13 per share for the first quarter of last year. There were no special items in either period. Our results show Conectiv Energy's results as discontinued operations. 
In the first quarter of 2011, income from discontinued operations net of taxes was $2 million. This includes income from adjustments to accrued expenses in connection with the sale of the generation assets, partially offset by losses from the disposition of Conectiv Energy's remaining assets and businesses. 
A summary of the drivers of our financial results can be found on Slide 13. For the first quarter, Power Delivery earnings were $0.21 per share compared to $0.09 per share for the 2010 period. Higher distribution rates during the quarter increased earnings by $0.06 per share. The higher rates reflect the impact of electric rate decisions for Pepco in the District of Columbia and Maryland, for Atlantic City Electric and for Delmarva Power in Delaware. The higher rates also reflect the interim rates put in effect for Delmarva Power's Gas business in Delaware. These rate increases were driven by higher costs and increased investment in distribution assets to enhance reliability. Higher transmission revenue drove $0.05 per share of the earnings increase due to higher investment in transmission assets. 
Higher weather-related sales versus the prior year increased quarterly earnings by $0.01 per share. Heating degree days increased by 2% quarter-over-quarter. Keep in mind that our distribution revenue in Maryland and the District of Columbia, which represents approximately 2/3 of total distribution revenue, is decoupled from consumption, and, therefore, the higher sales due to weather will not increase the distribution portion of customer bills in those jurisdictions. 
Also contributing to the earnings increase is higher distribution revenue due to growth in the number of customers, higher margins from the supply of Standard Offer Service, higher unbilled revenue related to Atlantic City Electric's basic generation service and the impact of unfavorable income tax adjustments in the first quarter of 2010. Partially offsetting these increases was higher operation and maintenance expense, which reduced earnings by $0.07 per share. This increase was driven by higher tree trimming and corrective and preventive maintenance costs as well as higher employee-related expenses. 
Pepco Energy Services' first quarter earnings were $0.05 per share compared to $0.06 per share in the same quarter of last year. The decrease in earnings was due to lower retail electricity sales volumes due to the ongoing wind down of the Retail Energy Supply business, partially offset by higher construction revenues. Note that each of the 2011 and 2010 quarters includes net mark-to-market losses on energy supply contracts of approximately $0.01 per share. 
In our Corporate and Other segment, which is primarily unallocated corporate costs, earnings improved by $0.02 per share quarter-over-quarter. The earnings improvement resulted from lower interest expense due to lower parent company debt outstanding. 
Turning to Slide 14. Given the year-to-date results and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are reaffirming our 2011 earnings guidance range of $1.10 to $1.25 per share. 
I'll now turn to our recent financing activity, which is summarized on Slide 15. On February 25, Atlantic City Electric redeemed all of its outstanding cumulative preferred stock for approximately $6 million. This redemption leaves no outstanding preferred stock at PHI or any of its subsidiaries. 
On April 5, Atlantic City Electric issued $200 million of first mortgage bonds. The bonds bear interest at an annual fixed rate of 4.35% and are due on April 1, 2021. The proceeds from the sale of the bonds were used to redeem Atlantic City Electric commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. 
Earlier this week, Delmarva Power repurchased $35 million of 4.9% tax-exempt bonds due in 2026, pursuant to a mandatory repurchase obligation. We plan to remarket the bonds later this quarter. Now let me turn it back to Joe Rigby for some closing remarks."

As we think about the economy and factor in all the diversity across our service territory, it's how it all nets down, on a net basis, to about 1% annual growth. One thing I would ask you to keep in mind is that there is still a very strong appetite for energy efficiency. And for the most part, we operate in states that have very strongly stated goals of reducing energy consumption by fairly aggressive amounts. So that's one of the reasons why I think on a relative level we appear to be somewhat aggressive in that, because we're very much attuned to the policy of our service territories. So a rather long-winded way to say that it's about 1% growth year-over-year, factoring in what we would anticipate impacts from energy efficiency."

And my sense is that there's going to be a very balanced approach taken here. And as the standards are put in place, I believe that we have every reason to think that we'll be able to meet those standards, to grow into those standards. And I think that the Commission understands that we're somewhat digging out of a little bit of a problem here but also understanding that these are good and necessary investments. So I'm positive in terms of how this will all play out. I would say this. We're absolutely committed to making the necessary investments to improve customer service.

Earnings from continuing operations for the quarter were $95 million compared to $76 million in the 2010 quarter. Our operating results were driven by the positive impact of our infrastructure investments and reasonable regulatory outcomes, lower interest expense and income tax adjustments. Our results for both 2011 and 2010 quarters reflect Conectiv Energy's results as discontinued operations. Tony will discuss the financial results and our operating segments performance in more detail but first I'll address some topics of interest. Starting with an update on our initiatives to improve system reliability as shown on Slide 3. We continue to make good progress in advancing infrastructure improvements and performing system maintenance in the Pepco region that will reduce power outages and improve service for our customers. Since launching our Reliability Enhancement Plan last fall, we have trimmed trees along more than 2,200 miles of power lines in our service territories, replaced or upgraded more than 150 miles of underground cable and identified overhead lights underground in among other airports. We also have the several enhancements to improve customer communications during major storms, such as increasing cost and stuff and phone system capability enabling the outage maps to be viewed on smartphones. Our Reliability Enhancement Plan is on track and we are beginning to see positive trends in the operating performance of our electric system. Improving system reliability will remain a top priority for our company. As we are making progress in advancing our Reliability Enhancement Plan, we are continuing to dialogue with our regulators regarding some system reliability and standards. In Maryland, the proceeding initiated in August 2010 to investigate the reliability of Pepco's distribution system is progressing. Hearings were completed in June and initial briefs were filed on July 20 with reply briefs due on August 8. Certain parties to the case have recommended the imposition of a variety of sanctions in various reported requirements. As I've stated, we are committed to improving the reliability of Pepco's electric service. However, while we cannot predict the outcome of this case, we will oppose the sanctions requested by the other parties which we believe are not supported by the record.
Also in Maryland, the Commission has commenced a rule-making to establish reliability benchmarks applicable to all electric utilities in the states. The proceeding involves all of Maryland's electric utilities and commission staff, people's council and other interested parties. We are participants in the process and support the development of objective fair standards with reasonable penalties. In the District of Colombia, the Commission has recently has adopted new reliability standards. The new rules require improvements in reliability performance on an annual basis beginning in 2013 and continuing through 2020. Again, we support objective fair standards but we believe the regulations in their current forms are fraud because they proposed inconsistent method to calculate reliability. Furthermore, what we are in the process of evaluating cost and operational changes necessary to comply with the new requirements, we currently believe the standards has adopted may not be realistically achievable at an acceptable cost over the longer term. As a result, we intend to file an application for reconsideration of the regulations for the commission shortly. 
We continue to make progress on our blueprint for the future initiatives. Status by jurisdiction can be seen on Slide 4. The advance meter installation for electric customers is largely complete in Delaware with 305,000 meters deploy about 98% of the total. Of the installed meters, 273,000 have been activated and we plan to have the remainder activated by the end of the third quarter. The initial functionality includes remote meter reading, the availability of account specific energy use information and outage detection. In the District of Colombia, 102,000 advanced meters have been installed, about 38% of the total with the goal of having the installations completed by the end of 2011. In June, we began installing advanced meters
for Pepco customers in Maryland and expect to have the installations completed by the end of 2012. The commissions in Delaware, the District of Colombia and Maryland have approved the establishment of our regulatory asset to defer AMI-related cost and the accrual of returns and the authorized rates of return on the deferred cost until such time as the cost in accrued returns can be incorporated in customer rates.
Proposals are pending in Delaware and the District of Colombia that request permission to implement dynamic pricing plan for customers. Under the proposed critical peak rebate structure, the plans would reward Standard Offer Service customers for lowering their energy used during critical peak periods when energy demand and the cost of supply and electricity are higher. Decisions on the proposal are expected by year end. This Critical Peak Rebate structure has been approved concept with in Maryland. And the details are currently being developed by working group. Subject to approval, the phase of implementation for residential customers in Delaware, the District of Colombia and Pepco Maryland customers is targeted to begin in 2012 and continuing into 2013. Through the buildup of the smart grid, we will gain added tools to improve system reliability while providing customers with access to detailed usage information that will enable them to better manage their energy use and lower their energy bills. Our energy efficiency and demand side management programs will also have our customers to reduce energy costs. Cost of these programs is being recovered through the demand side management related rate adjustment mechanisms. 
Turning to our regulatory filings in June, the Delaware Commission approved the settlement agreement of Delmarva Power's natural gas delivery base rate case. As seen on Slide 5, the commission granted an annual rate increase of $6 million based on stated return equity of 10%. The parties to the settlement agreed to differ the request of place revenue decoupling into effect until an implementation plan has been develop. While the new rates were effective July 1, keep in mind that as permitted by Delaware law, Delmarva Power implemented interim rate increases of $2.5 million on August 31, 2010 and $7.7 million on February 2, 2011. The amount collected in excess of the approved rates will be returned to customers. On July 8, the Maryland Commission approved the settlement agreement in Delmarva Power's electric base rate case. As seen on Slide 6, the commission granted an annual rate increase of $12 million. The new rates became effective on July 8. Although the return equity was not specified in the proposed settlement, the commission authorized a return on equity of 10% for purposes of calculating the allowance for fund used during construction and regulatory asset carrying costs. The commission also authorized a Phase 2 proceeding during which the working group including Delmarva Power, commission staff and the People's Council will explore methods to address the issue of regulatory lag. Our objective in this process is to gain a consensus of the working group regarding the adoption of one or more mechanisms that would reduce regulatory lag and file a proposal with the Commission that is supported by all parties. If consensus cannot be reached, each party can file its own proposal at the Commission. Phase 2 proceeding has a 100-day term, which commenced on July 8. Delmarva Power is preparing to file a rate case in Maryland this fall in order to continue its efforts to close the gap between its earned on authorized return. This case will request commission approval for any proposals to reduce regulatory lag that are developed in the Phase 2 proceeding. I've noted previously, we do see reduce regulatory lag as a significant focus. Our preference is to achieve this by adopting mechanisms that indicate the need for frequent rate base cases, which we view as costly and inefficient. However, we have a deep and experienced regulatory staff that can execute our regulatory strategy that includes frequent phases in order to earn returns close to what the commission has authorized.
Turning to Slide 7, on July 8, Pepco filed a rate case in the District of Colombia requesting an annual revenue increase of $42 million based on the return on equity of 10.75%. Of the requested of $42 million increase, approximately $10 million relates to AMI-related costs. As we have generally been earning return on these cost since they were incurred, recovery of the customer rates have a positive cash flow impact but does not affect earnings. By Delmarva Power's filing in Maryland, this filing includes comprehensive discussion on the topic of regulatory lag and its negative effects. The filing request approval of our reliability investment recovery mechanisms which provides full and timely recovery of future capital investments related to distribution system reliability. The filing also request the commission adopt fully forecasted test periods, prehearing conference has been scheduled for September 8 but decision is expected in April 2012. We remain on track with our preparations to file 4 additional rate cases later this year. As shown on Slide 8, Atlantic City Electric, expects to file a case shortly likely by the end of today. The case will request an annual revenue increase of $59 million based on a return in equity of 10.75%. In September, we plan to make another filing in New Jersey requesting an extension of the current infrastructure investment surcharge to help mitigate the effects of regulatory lag. As I've noted, Delmarva Power plans to file a case in Maryland in the fourth quarter. Also in the fourth quarter, Pepco plans to file a rate case in Maryland and Delmarva Power plans to file an electric rate case in Delaware. Note that this filing schedule is tentative in each of our jurisdictions we plan to include in our rate cases or other filings in the comprehensive discussion on the topic of regulatory lag and its negative effects as well as proposals to minimize lag. The status of the Mid-Atlantic Power Pathway or MAPP project can be seen on Slide 9. As we have previously reported, PJM is in annual process of evaluating regions overall transmission needs. PJM has stated that it expects to complete its evaluation sometime this month. While the PJM process is not yet complete, our expectation is at the MAPP projects in-service date will be delayed several years beyond the current in-service date on June 2015. We will have further clarity on the revised in-service date when PJM completes his process.
Slide 10 shows a forecasted annual construction expenditures for our Power Delivery initiatives including the MAPP project. Due to the uncertainty of the MAPP projects in-service date, we currently anticipate that the 2011 construction expenditures associated with MAPP may be lower than our forecast due to the deferral of the between $90 million to $110 million of MAPP expenditures to later years. However, we also anticipate that approximately $40 million of non-MAPP transmission capital expenditures planned for later years will be incurred in 2011. Once the revised in-service date for the MAPP project has been determined, we would update our 5-year Construction Expenditure Forecast accordingly. 
At Pepco Energy Services, the profitable wind down of the Retail Energy Supply business continues to be on track. And we continue to make good progress in growing the Energy Services business. As shown on Slide 11, Pepco Energy Services signed $35 million of new energy efficiency contracts in the second quarter of 2011, including a $28 million energy performance contract with the Maryland Port Administration. This project consists of the installation of a number of energy conservation measures including renewable energy components as well as building upgrades. Looking ahead, the business development efforts we have undertaken over the past 2 years are showing results. With the prospective project pipeline of nearly $600 million. We believe the benefits of energy efficiency provide long-term growth opportunities for this business and we can grow Pepco Energy Services in a manner that is consistent with our lower risk profile. At this point, let me turn it over to Tony Kamerick. Tony?"

I'll recap our earnings, address our performance by operating segment and discuss some topic of interest. We will then open the call to your questions. Earnings from continuing operations for the second qu",1488,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'll recap our earnings, address our performance by operating segment and discuss some topic of interest. We will then open the call to your questions. Earnings from continuing operations for the second quarter were $95 million or $0.42 per share compared to $76 million or $0.34 per share for the second quarter of last year. For the 6 months ended June 30, 2011 earnings from continuing operations were $157 million or $0.69 per share compared to $104 million or $0.47 per share for the 2010 period. Our results show Conectiv Energy's results as continuing operations. For the 6 months ended June 30, 2011, income from discontinued operations net of taxes is $1 million. This includes income from adjustments to accrued expenses in connection with the sale of the generation assets partially offset by losses from the disposition of Conectiv Energy's remaining assets and businesses. A summary of the drivers of our financial results can be found on Slides 12 and 13. In the fourth quarter of last year, we reached a settlement with the IRS for the tax years 2001 and 2002, which affected our tax returns as far back as 1996. In June, we reached an agreement with the IRS with respect to the interest due on the tax liabilities related to that settlement. In the second quarter of 2011, we recorded a tax benefit of $17 million or $0.08 per share primarily related to that agreement. About half of the tax benefit affects the power delivery segment with the balance affecting the other nonregulated segment. Our earnings guidance includes a range of tax benefits for the expected resolution of pending tax matters. Tax years 2003 and beyond are still open with IRS and the IRS is in the process of examining several large industry issues such as the treatment of mixed service cost and repair deductions. Until the IRS becomes more current with its audits and this industry issues are resolved, we can expect some level of tax adjustments in our results.
For the second quarter, Power Delivery earnings were $0.32 per share compared to $0.29 per share for the 2010 quarter. In addition to the tax benefit from the settlement with IRS that I just discussed, higher distribution rates and default service margins positively affected earnings quarter-over-quarter. Higher distribution rates during the quarter increased earnings by $0.02 per share. The higher rates reflect the impact of electric rate decisions for Pepco in Maryland and Atlantic City Electric. The higher rates also reflect the interim rates put in place for Delmarva Power's gas business in Delaware. These rate increases were driven by higher costs and increased investment and distribution assets to enhance reliability. Higher default electricity supply margins during the quarter positively impacted earnings by $0.03 per share. About half of this increase is due to an increase in Pepco's cost recovery rate in the District of Colombia to recover higher cash working capital costs. The other half of the increase is due to an adjustment to Delmarva Power's operation and maintenance expense for providing the full service in Delaware.
Partially offsetting these increases, was higher operation and maintenance expense, which reduced earnings by $0.06 per share. The expense increase was driven by higher rate earnings and preventive maintenance cost as well as emergency restoration expenditures. Lower weather-related sales versus the prior year decreased quarterly earnings by $0.01 per share. Cooling degree days decreased by 15% quarter-over-quarter. The weather for the quarter versus normal weather had no impact on the earnings. Keep in mind that our distribution revenue in Maryland and the District of Colombia, which represents approximately 2/3 of total distribution revenue is decoupled from consumption. Year-to-date, Power Delivery earnings were $0.53 per share in 2011 compared to $0.38 per share for the 6 months ended June 30, 2010. The increase in earnings was the result of higher distribution and transmission revenue due to a higher rate, higher default electricity supply margins and favorable income tax adjustments. Partially offsetting the earnings increases was higher Power Delivery operation and maintenance expense. At our analyst conference in April, we provided a forecast of total O&M for power delivery of $818 million in 2011. We now expect O&M to be approximately $850 million with additional maintenance expense and tree terming driving the increase. This level of O&M spending is contemplated in our earnings guidance range.
Pepco Energy Services' second quarter earnings were $0.03 per share compared to $0.05 per share for the 2010 quarter. Year-to-date, earnings were $0.08 per share compared to $0.11 per share for the six-month period ended June 2010. The decrease in earnings for both the quarter and year-to-date periods was due to lower retail electricity sales volumes resulting from the ongoing wind down of the Retail Energy Supply business partially offset by higher construction revenue. Note that the second quarter includes $2 million of net mark-to-market losses compared to $1 million of net mark-to-market gains for the 2010 quarter. For the 6 months ended June 2011, mark-to-market losses were $4 million as compared to losses of $1 million in the 2010 period.
In our other nonregulated segment, second quarter earnings were $0.08 per share compared to $0.03 per share in the 2010 quarter. Year-to-date earnings were $0.11 per share compared to $0.05 per share for the 6 months ended June 2010. The increase in earnings for both the quarter and year-to-date periods is primarily due to tax benefit resulting from the settlement with the IRS for prior tax years, which I addressed earlier and the early termination of certain cross-border energy leases, which I will discuss in more detail shortly.
In our corporate and other segment which is primarily unallocated corporate cost, earnings improved for both the 2011 quarter and year-to-date periods compared to the same periods in the prior year. the earnings improvement resulted from lower interest expense due to lower parent company debt outstanding partially offset by the effect of favorable income tax adjustments in 2010.
Returning to the subject of the cross-border of energy leases, as shown on Slide 14, in 2011, Pepco Holdings entered into early termination agreements for a number of leases in the portfolio at the request of the lessees. The lease terminations involved all the leases comprising one of the eighth cross-border lease investments and a small portion of the leases comprising a second lease investment. Pepco Holdings received net proceeds of $161 million and recorded an after-tax gain of $3 million upon the termination. While the pretax gain was $39 million, in addition to the $14 million tax expense on the gain, $22 million of income tax benefits recognized previously were reversed in connection with the termination of the leases. The book value of the lease investment portfolio as of June 30, 2011 was $1.3 billion. As seen on Slide 15, the current annual tax benefits from the remaining cross-border energy lease investments are approximately $52 million and annual net earnings are proxies $21 million. For the current status of our dispute with the IRS regarding the tax benefits of the leases, earlier this year PHI paid $74 million of additional tax associated with the disallowance deductions from the leased investments in connection with audits of the 2001, 2002 tax years, plus penalties of $1 million and subsequent interest of $28 million.
Last month, we filed a claim for refund with IRS, which we expect IRS to deny and if so, we intend to pursue litigation in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims against the IRS seeking to recover the tax payment, interest and penalties. Now I'll turn to our recent financing activity, which is summarized on Slide 16. In May, Delmarva Power repurchase approximately $35 million of 4.9% tax-exempt bonds due 2026 pursuant to mandatory repurchase obligation triggered by the expiration of the original interest period. On June 1, the bonds were resold with the new interest rate of 0.75%. The bonds are subject to mandatory repurchase by Delmarva Power on June 1, 2012. PHI and utility subsidiaries maintain an unsecured syndicated credit facility to provide for short-term liquidity needs. On August 1, PHI and the utilities entered into an amendment and restated credit agreement to extend the expiration date of the facility from May 2012 to August 2016 and to include various enhancements to the terms and conditions of the facility. The aggregate borrowing limit under the credit facility remains $1.5 billion. 
Turning to our earnings guidance, as seen on Slide 17, we are reaffirming our 2011 guidance range of $1.10 to $1.25 per share. However, given year-to-date results and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we currently anticipate being above the midpoint of that range. We will address the guidance change on the third quarter earnings call when we have more clarity on the resolution of certain tax matters. Now, let me turn it back to Joe Rigby for some closing remarks."

A larger number of contract contingency or higher level of spend at the call center such as that you take the O&M expectation for delivery up. From I think it was 810 to almost 850. Now whether that's a, whether that's the spend rate going forward, we're still debating that looking ahead but the one thing I know is that if I think about the spend that we're making relative to what we see as the right kind of regulatory outcomes.

State of Tony, just lastly, to sort of put those in days, together and think about '12 and I know you haven't given guidance but since you talked about $850 million of O&M, should we think of that as sort of a baseline, I guess sort of came into the first half of this you're thinking 2011 O&M would be high in U.S. would work harder than it might roll little lower in '12.

297660,138270573,153450,"Pepco Holdings, Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2011",2011-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Pepco Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Donna, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen and thank you for joining us today. Earnings from continuing operations for the quarter were $95 million compared to $76 million in the 2010 quarter. Our operating results were driven by the positive i",2012,"Thanks, Donna, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen and thank you for joining us today. Earnings from continuing operations for the quarter were $95 million compared to $76 million in the 2010 quarter. Our operating results were driven by the positive impact of our infrastructure investments and reasonable regulatory outcomes, lower interest expense and income tax adjustments. Our results for both 2011 and 2010 quarters reflect Conectiv Energy's results as discontinued operations. Tony will discuss the financial results and our operating segment performance in more detail but first I'll address some topics of interest, starting with an update on our initiatives to improve system reliability as shown on Slide 3. We continue to make good progress in advancing infrastructure improvements and performing system maintenance in the Pepco region that will reduce power outages and improve service for our customers. Since launching our Reliability Enhancement Plan last fall, we have trimmed trees along more than 2,200 miles of power lines in our service territories, replaced or upgraded more than 150 miles of underground cable and identified overhead lines for undergrounding, among other efforts. We also have made several enhancements to improve customer communications during major storms, such as increasing call center staff and phone system capability and enabling outage maps to be viewed on smartphones. Our Reliability Enhancement Plan is on track and we are beginning to see positive trends in the operating performance of our electric system. Improving system reliability will remain a top priority for our company. As we are making progress in advancing our Reliability Enhancement Plan, we are continuing to dialogue with our regulators regarding system reliability and standards. In Maryland, the proceeding initiated in August 2010 to investigate the reliability of Pepco's distribution system is progressing. Hearings were completed in June and initial briefs were filed on July 20 with reply briefs due on August 8. Certain parties to the case have recommended the imposition of a variety of sanctions in various reporting requirements. As I've stated, we are committed to improving the reliability of Pepco's electric service. However, while we cannot predict the outcome of this case, we will oppose the sanctions requested by the other parties which we believe are not supported by the record.
Also in Maryland, the commission has commenced a rule-making to establish reliability benchmarks applicable to all electric utilities in the states. The proceeding involves all of Maryland electric utilities, the commission staff, People's Counsel and other interested parties. We are participants in the process and support the development of objective-fair standards with reasonable penalties. In the District of Columbia, the commission has recently has adopted new reliability standards. The new rules require improvements in reliability performance on an annual basis beginning in 2013 and continuing through 2020. Again, we support objective-fair standards, but we believe the regulations in their current form are flawed because they propose an inconsistent method to calculate reliability. Furthermore, while we are in the process of evaluating the cost and operational changes necessary to comply with the new requirements, we currently believe the standards as adopted may not be realistically achievable at an acceptable cost over the longer term. As a result, we intend to file an application for reconsideration of the regulations with the commission shortly. 
We continue to make progress on our Blueprint for the Future initiatives. Status by jurisdiction can be seen on Slide 4. The advanced meter installation for electric customers is largely complete in Delaware with 305,000 meters deployed, about 98% of the total. Of the installed meters, 273,000 have been activated and we plan to have the remainder activated by the end of the third quarter. The initial functionality includes remote meter reading, the availability of account-specific energy use information and outage detection. In the District of Columbia, 102,000 advanced meters have been installed, about 38% of the total, with the goal of having the installations completed by the end of 2011. In June, we began installing advanced meters
for Pepco customers in Maryland and expect to have the installations completed by the end of 2012. The commissions in Delaware, the District of Columbia and Maryland have approved the establishment of a regulatory asset to defer AMI-related cost and the accrual of returns at the authorized rates of return on the deferred cost until such time as the cost in accrued returns can be incorporated in customer rates.
Proposals are pending in Delaware and the District of Columbia that request permission to implement dynamic pricing plan for customers. Under the proposed critical peak rebate structure, the plans would reward Standard Offer Service customers for lowering their energy use during critical peak periods when energy demand and the cost of supply and electricity are higher. Decisions on the proposal are expected by year end. This Critical Peak Rebate structure has been approved in concept in Maryland, and the tariff details are currently being developed by a working group. Subject to approval, the phase-in implementation for residential customers in Delaware, the District of Columbia and Pepco Maryland's customers is targeted to begin in 2012 and continuing to 2013. During the build out of the Smart Grid, we will gain added tools to improve system reliability while providing customers with access to detailed usage information that will enable them to better manage their energy use and lower their energy bills. Our energy efficiency and demand side management programs will also help our customers to reduce energy costs. The cost of these programs is being recovered through our demand side management-related rate adjustment mechanisms. 
Turning to our regulatory filings in June, the Delaware Commission approved the settlement agreement in Delmarva Power's natural gas delivery base rate case. As seen on Slide 5, the commission granted an annual rate increase of $6 million based on a stated return on equity of 10%. The parties to the settlement agreed to defer the request to place revenue decoupling into effect until an implementation plan has been developed. While the new rates were effective July 1, keep in mind that as permitted by Delaware law, Delmarva Power implemented interim rate increases of $2.5 million on August 31, 2010, and $7.7 million on February 2, 2011. The amount collected in excess of the approved rates will be returned to customers. On July 8, the Maryland Commission approved the settlement agreement in Delmarva Power's electric base rate case. As seen on Slide 6, the commission granted an annual rate increase of $12 million. The new rates became effective on July 8. Although the return on equity was not specified in the proposed settlement, the commission authorized a return on equity of 10% for purposes of calculating the allowance for funds used during construction and regulatory asset carrying cost. The commission also authorized a Phase 2 proceeding during which a working group, including Delmarva Power, commission staff and the People's Counsel will explore methods to address the issue of regulatory lag. Our objective in this process is to gain a consensus of the working group regarding the adoption of one or more mechanisms that will reduce regulatory lag and file a proposal with the commission that is supported by all parties. If consensus cannot be reached, each party can file its own proposal with the commission. Phase 2 proceeding has a 100-day term, which commenced on July 8. Delmarva Power is preparing to file a rate case in Maryland this fall in order to continue its efforts to close the gap between its earned and authorized return. This case will request commission approval for any proposals to reduce regulatory lag that are developed in the Phase 2 proceeding. As I've noted previously, reducing regulatory lag as a significant focus. Our preference is to achieve this by adopting mechanisms that negate the need for frequent rate cases, which we view as costly and inefficient. However, we have a deep and experienced regulatory staff that can execute a regulatory strategy that includes frequent cases if need be in order to earn returns close to what the commission has authorized.
Turning to Slide 7. On July 8, Pepco filed a rate case in the District of Columbia requesting an annual revenue increase of $42 million based on a return on equity of 10.75%. Of the requested of $42 million increase, approximately $10 million relates to AMI-related cost. Since we have generally been earning a return on this cost since they were incurred, recovery of the cost through rates has a positive cash flow impact but does not affect earnings. By Delmarva Power's filing in Maryland, this filing includes a comprehensive discussion on the topic of regulatory lag and its negative effects. The filing request approval of a reliability investment recovery mechanism, which provides full and timely recovery of future capital investments related to distribution system reliability. The filing also request the commission adopt fully forecasted test periods. The prehearing conference has been scheduled for September 8, a decision is expected in April 2012. We remain on track with our preparations to file 4 additional rate cases later this year. As shown on Slide 8, Atlantic City Electric expects to file a case shortly likely by the end of today. The case will request an annual revenue increase of $59 million based on a return on equity of 10.75%. In September, we plan to make another filing in New Jersey requesting an extension of the current infrastructure investment surcharge to help mitigate the effects of regulatory lag. As I've noted, Delmarva Power plans to file a case in Maryland in the fourth quarter. Also in the fourth quarter, Pepco plans to file a rate case in Maryland and Delmarva Power plans to file an electric rate case in Delaware. Note that this filing schedule is tentative. In each of our jurisdictions, we plan to include in our rate cases or other filings a comprehensive discussion on the topic of regulatory lag and its negative effects as well as proposals to minimize lag. The status of the Mid-Atlantic Power Pathway or MAPP project can be seen on Slide 9. As we have previously reported, PJM is in the annual process of evaluating the region's overall transmission needs. PJM has stated that it expects to complete this evaluation sometime this month. While the PJM process is not yet complete, our expectation is that the MAPP projects' in-service date will be delayed several years beyond the current in-service date of June 2015. We will have further clarity on the revised in-service date when PJM completes its process.
Slide 10 shows the forecasted annual construction expenditures for our Power Delivery initiatives including the MAPP project. Due to the uncertainty of the MAPP projects in-service date, we currently anticipate that the 2011 construction expenditures associated with MAPP may be lower than our forecast due to the deferral of between $90 million to $110 million of MAPP expenditures to later years. However, we also anticipate that approximately $40 million of non-MAPP transmission capital expenditures planned for later years will be incurred in 2011. Once the revised in-service date for the MAPP project has been determined, we will update our 5-year Construction Expenditure Forecast accordingly. 
At Pepco Energy Services, the profitable wind down of the Retail Energy Supply business continues to be on track. And we continue to make good progress in growing the Energy Services business. As shown on Slide 11, Pepco Energy Services signed $35 million of new energy efficiency contracts in the second quarter of 2011, including a $28 million energy performance contract with the Maryland Port Administration. This project consists of the installation of a number of energy conservation measures, including renewable energy components as well as building upgrades. Looking ahead, the business development efforts we have undertaken over the past 2 years are showing results, with a prospective project pipeline of nearly $600 million. We believe the benefits of energy efficiency provide long-term growth opportunities for this business and we can grow Pepco Energy Services in a manner that is consistent with our lower risk profile. At this point, let me turn it over to Tony Kamerick. Tony?"
297660,138270573,153450,"Pepco Holdings, Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2011",2011-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Pepco Holdings LLC","Executives","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'll recap our earnings, address our performance by operating segment and discuss some topics of interest. We will then open the call to your questions. Earnings from continuing operations for the second q",1496,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'll recap our earnings, address our performance by operating segment and discuss some topics of interest. We will then open the call to your questions. Earnings from continuing operations for the second quarter were $95 million or $0.42 per share compared to $76 million or $0.34 per for the second quarter of last year. For the 6 months ended June 30, 2011, earnings from continuing operations were $157 million or $0.69 per share compared to $104 million or $0.47 per share for the 2010 period. Our results show Conectiv Energy's results as continuing operations. For the 6 months ended June 30, 2011, income from discontinued operations, net of taxes, is $1 million. This includes income from adjustments to accrued expenses in connection with the sale of the generation assets, partially offset by losses from the disposition of Conectiv Energy's remaining assets and businesses. A summary of the drivers of our financial results can be found on Slides 12 and 13. In the fourth quarter of last year, we reached a settlement with the IRS for the tax years 2001 and 2002, which affected our tax returns as far back as 1996. In June, we reached an agreement with the IRS with respect to the interest due on the tax liabilities related to that settlement. In the second quarter of 2011, we recorded a tax benefit of $17 million or $0.08 per share primarily related to this agreement. About half of the tax benefit affects the Power Delivery segment with the balance affecting the other nonregulated segment. Our earnings guidance includes a range of tax benefits for the expected resolution of pending tax matters. Tax years 2003 and beyond are still open with the IRS, and the IRS is in the process of examining several large industry issues such as the treatment of mixed service costs and repair deductions. Until the IRS becomes more current with its audits and this industry issues are resolved, we can expect some level of tax adjustments in our results.
For the second quarter, Power Delivery earnings were $0.32 per share compared to $0.29 per share for the 2010 quarter. In addition to the tax benefit from the settlement with the IRS that I just discussed, higher distribution rates and default service margins positively affected earnings quarter-over-quarter. Higher distribution rates during the quarter increased earnings by $0.02 per share. The higher rates reflect the impact of electric rate decisions for Pepco in Maryland and Atlantic City Electric. The higher rates also reflect the interim rates put in place for Delmarva Power's gas business in Delaware. These rate increases were driven by higher costs and increased investment and distribution assets to enhance reliability. Higher default electricity supply margins during the quarter positively impacted earnings by $0.03 per share. About half of this increase is due to an increase in Pepco's cost recovery rate in the District of Columbia to recover higher cash working capital costs. The other half of the increase is due to an adjustment to Delmarva Power's operation and maintenance expense for providing the full service in Delaware.
Partially offsetting these increases was higher operation and maintenance expense, which reduced earnings by $0.06 per share. The expense increase was driven by higher tree trimming and preventive maintenance costs, as well as emergency restoration expenditures. Lower weather-related sales versus the prior year decreased quarterly earnings by $0.01 per share. Cooling degree days decreased by 15% quarter-over-quarter. The weather for the quarter versus normal weather had no impact on the earnings. Keep in mind that our distribution revenue in Maryland and the District of Columbia, which represents approximately 2/3 of total distribution revenue is decoupled from consumption. Year-to-date, Power Delivery earnings were $0.53 per share in 2011 compared to $0.38 per share for the 6 months ended June 30, 2010. The increase in earnings was the result of higher distribution and transmission revenue due to higher rate, higher default electricity supply margins and favorable income tax adjustments. Partially offsetting the earnings increases was higher Power Delivery operation and maintenance expense. At our analyst conference in April, we provided a forecast of total O&M for Power Delivery of $818 million in 2011. We now expect O&M to be approximately $850 million with additional maintenance expense and tree trimming driving the increase. This level of O&M spending is contemplated in our earnings guidance range.
Pepco Energy Services' second quarter earnings were $0.03 per share compared to $0.05 per share for the 2010 quarter. Year-to-date, earnings were $0.08 per share compared to $0.11 per share for the six-month period ended June 2010. The decrease in earnings for both the quarter and year-to-date periods was due to lower retail electricity sales volumes resulting from the ongoing wind down of the Retail Energy Supply business partially offset by higher construction revenue. Note that the second quarter includes $2 million of net mark-to-market losses compared to $1 million of net mark-to-market gains for the 2010 quarter. For the 6 months ended June 2011, mark-to-market losses were $4 million as compared to losses of $1 million in the 2010 period.
In our other nonregulated segment, second quarter earnings were $0.08 per share compared to $0.03 per share in the 2010 quarter. Year-to-date earnings were $0.11 per share compared to $0.05 per share for the 6 months ended June 2010. The increase in earnings for both the quarter and year-to-date periods was primarily due to the tax benefit resulting from the settlement with the IRS for prior tax years, which I addressed earlier and the early termination of certain cross-border energy leases, which I will discuss in more detail shortly.
In our corporate and other segment which is primarily unallocated corporate costs, earnings improved for both the 2011 quarter and year-to-date periods compared to the same periods in the prior year. The earnings improvement resulted from lower interest expense due to lower parent company debt outstanding partially offset by the effect of favorable income tax adjustments in 2010.
Returning to the subject of the cross-border of energy leases, as shown on Slide 14, in 2011, Pepco Holdings entered into early termination agreements for a number of leases in the portfolio at the request of the lessees. The lease terminations involved all of the leases comprising 1 of the 8 cross-border lease investments and a small portion of the leases comprising a second lease investment. Pepco Holdings received net proceeds of $161 million and recorded an after-tax gain of $3 million upon the termination. While the pretax gain was $39 million, in addition to the $14 million tax expense on the gain, $22 million of income tax benefits recognized previously were reversed in connection with the termination of the leases. The book value of the lease investment portfolio as of June 30, 2011, was $1.3 billion. As seen on Slide 15, the current annual tax benefits from the remaining cross-border energy lease investments are approximately $52 million and the annual net earnings are approximately $21 million. For the current status of our dispute with the IRS regarding the tax benefits of the leases, earlier this year, PHI paid $74 million of additional tax associated with the disallowance deductions from the lease investments in connection with the audits of the 2001 and 2002 tax years, plus penalties of $1 million and subsequent interest of $28 million.
Last month, we filed a claim for refund with the IRS, which we expect the IRS to deny. And if so, we intend to pursue litigation in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims against the IRS seeking to recover the tax payment interest and penalties. Now I'll turn to our recent financing activity, which is summarized on Slide 16. In May, Delmarva Power repurchased approximately $35 million of 4.9% tax-exempt bonds due 2026, pursuant to a mandatory repurchase obligation triggered by the expiration of the original interest period. On June 1, the bonds were resold with the new interest rate of 0.75%. The bonds are subject to mandatory repurchase by Delmarva Power on June 1, 2012. PHI and utility subsidiaries maintain an unsecured syndicated credit facility to provide for short-term liquidity needs. On August 1, PHI and the utilities entered into an amendment and restated credit agreement to extend the expiration date of the facility from May 2012 to August 2016 and to include various enhancements to the terms and conditions of the facility. The aggregate borrowing limit under the credit facility remains $1.5 billion. 
Turning to our earnings guidance as seen on Slide 17, we are reaffirming our 2011 guidance range of $1.10 to $1.25 per share. However, given year-to-date results and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we currently anticipate being above the midpoint of that range. We will address the guidance range on the third quarter earnings call when we have more clarity on the resolution of certain tax matters. Now let me turn it back to Joe Rigby for some closing remarks."

And we really haven't had a chance to dialogue with the regulators to really look at this, I'll say, from 2015 on to really understand what the true cost implications are. So I'm always kind of remain optimistic that once you get an opportunity to have a full sum discussion, that you'll be able to come to a pretty reasonable outcome. So that's pretty much where we stand at this point."

The other comment I'd make, and I'll make a comment about that one and maybe Dave wants to talk about the CapEx. We've clearly pushed very hard this year on our O&M with the tree trimming. A larger number of contractor contingency or higher level of spend at the call center such that you take the O&M expectation for delivery up from I think it was $810 million to almost $850 million. Now whether that's a, whether that's the spend rate going forward, we're still debating that looking ahead. But the one thing I know is that if I think about the spend that we're making relative to what we see as the right kind of regulatory outcomes. I know we're doing the right things.

Earnings from continuing operations for the quarter were $95 million compared to $76 million in the 2010 quarter. Our operating results were driven by the positive i",2012,"Thanks, Donna, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen and thank you for joining us today. Earnings from continuing operations for the quarter were $95 million compared to $76 million in the 2010 quarter. Our operating results were driven by the positive impact of our infrastructure investments and reasonable regulatory outcomes, lower interest expense and income tax adjustments. Our results for both 2011 and 2010 quarters reflect Conectiv Energy's results as discontinued operations. Tony will discuss the financial results and our operating segment performance in more detail but first I'll address some topics of interest, starting with an update on our initiatives to improve system reliability as shown on Slide 3. We continue to make good progress in advancing infrastructure improvements and performing system maintenance in the Pepco region that will reduce power outages and improve service for our customers. Since launching our Reliability Enhancement Plan last fall, we have trimmed trees along more than 2,200 miles of power lines in our service territories, replaced or upgraded more than 150 miles of underground cable and identified overhead lines for undergrounding, among other efforts. We also have made several enhancements to improve customer communications during major storms, such as increasing call center staff and phone system capability and enabling outage maps to be viewed on smartphones. Our Reliability Enhancement Plan is on track and we are beginning to see positive trends in the operating performance of our electric system. Improving system reliability will remain a top priority for our company. As we are making progress in advancing our Reliability Enhancement Plan, we are continuing to dialogue with our regulators regarding system reliability and standards. In Maryland, the proceeding initiated in August 2010 to investigate the reliability of Pepco's distribution system is progressing. Hearings were completed in June and initial briefs were filed on July 20 with reply briefs due on August 8. Certain parties to the case have recommended the imposition of a variety of sanctions in various reporting requirements. As I've stated, we are committed to improving the reliability of Pepco's electric service. However, while we cannot predict the outcome of this case, we will oppose the sanctions requested by the other parties which we believe are not supported by the record.
Also in Maryland, the commission has commenced a rule-making to establish reliability benchmarks applicable to all electric utilities in the states. The proceeding involves all of Maryland electric utilities, the commission staff, People's Counsel and other interested parties. We are participants in the process and support the development of objective-fair standards with reasonable penalties. In the District of Columbia, the commission has recently has adopted new reliability standards. The new rules require improvements in reliability performance on an annual basis beginning in 2013 and continuing through 2020. Again, we support objective-fair standards, but we believe the regulations in their current form are flawed because they propose an inconsistent method to calculate reliability. Furthermore, while we are in the process of evaluating the cost and operational changes necessary to comply with the new requirements, we currently believe the standards as adopted may not be realistically achievable at an acceptable cost over the longer term. As a result, we intend to file an application for reconsideration of the regulations with the commission shortly. 
We continue to make progress on our Blueprint for the Future initiatives. Status by jurisdiction can be seen on Slide 4. The advanced meter installation for electric customers is largely complete in Delaware with 305,000 meters deployed, about 98% of the total. Of the installed meters, 273,000 have been activated and we plan to have the remainder activated by the end of the third quarter. The initial functionality includes remote meter reading, the availability of account-specific energy use information and outage detection. In the District of Columbia, 102,000 advanced meters have been installed, about 38% of the total, with the goal of having the installations completed by the end of 2011. In June, we began installing advanced meters
for Pepco customers in Maryland and expect to have the installations completed by the end of 2012. The commissions in Delaware, the District of Columbia and Maryland have approved the establishment of a regulatory asset to defer AMI-related costs and the accrual of returns at the authorized rates of return on the deferred cost until such time as the cost and accrued returns can be incorporated in customer rates.
Proposals are pending in Delaware and the District of Columbia that request permission to implement a dynamic pricing plan for customers. Under the proposed critical peak rebate structure, the plans would reward Standard Offer Service customers for lowering their energy use during critical peak periods when energy demand and the cost of supply and electricity are higher. Decisions on the proposal are expected by year end. This Critical Peak Rebate structure has been approved in concept in Maryland, and the tariff details are currently being developed by a working group. Subject to approval, the phase-in implementation for residential customers in Delaware, the District of Columbia and Pepco Maryland's customers is targeted to begin in 2012 and continuing to 2013. Through the build out of the Smart Grid, we will gain added tools to improve system reliability while providing customers with access to detailed usage information that will enable them to better manage their energy use and lower their energy bills. Our energy efficiency and demand side management programs will also help our customers to reduce energy costs. The cost of these programs is being recovered through our demand side management-related rate adjustment mechanisms. 
Turning to our regulatory filings in June, the Delaware Commission approved the settlement agreement in Delmarva Power's natural gas delivery base rate case. As seen on Slide 5, the commission granted an annual rate increase of $6 million based on a stated return on equity of 10%. The parties to the settlement agreed to defer the request to place revenue decoupling into effect until an implementation plan has been developed. While the new rates were effective July 1, keep in mind that as permitted by Delaware law, Delmarva Power implemented interim rate increases of $2.5 million on August 31, 2010, and $7.7 million on February 2, 2011. The amount collected in excess of the approved rates will be returned to customers. On July 8, the Maryland Commission approved the settlement agreement in Delmarva Power's electric base rate case. As seen on Slide 6, the commission granted an annual rate increase of $12 million. The new rates became effective on July 8. Although the return on equity was not specified in the proposed settlement, the commission authorized a return on equity of 10% for purposes of calculating the allowance for funds used during construction and regulatory asset carrying cost. The commission also authorized a Phase 2 proceeding during which a working group, including Delmarva Power, commission staff and the People's Counsel will explore methods to address the issue of regulatory lag. Our objective in this process is to gain a consensus of the working group regarding the adoption of one or more mechanisms that will reduce regulatory lag and file a proposal with the commission that is supported by all parties. If consensus cannot be reached, each party can file its own proposal with the commission. Phase 2 proceeding has a 100-day term, which commenced on July 8. Delmarva Power is preparing to file a rate case in Maryland this fall in order to continue its efforts to close the gap between its earned and authorized return. This case will request commission approval for any proposals to reduce regulatory lag that are developed in the Phase 2 proceeding. As I've noted previously, reducing regulatory lag is a significant focus. Our preference is to achieve this by adopting mechanisms that negate the need for frequent rate cases, which we view as costly and inefficient. However, we have a deep and experienced regulatory staff that can execute a regulatory strategy that includes frequent cases if need be in order to earn returns close to what the commission has authorized.
Turning to Slide 7. On July 8, Pepco filed a rate case in the District of Columbia requesting an annual revenue increase of $42 million based on a return on equity of 10.75%. Of the requested $42 million increase, approximately $10 million relates to AMI-related cost. Since we have generally been earning a return on these costs since they were incurred, recovery of the cost through rates has a positive cash flow impact but does not affect earnings. Like Delmarva Power's filing in Maryland, this filing includes a comprehensive discussion on the topic of regulatory lag and its negative effects. The filing requests approval of a reliability investment recovery mechanism, which provides full and timely recovery of future capital investments related to distribution system reliability. The filing also requests the commission adopt fully forecasted test periods. The prehearing conference has been scheduled for September 8, a decision is expected in April 2012. We remain on track with our preparations to file 4 additional rate cases later this year. As shown on Slide 8, Atlantic City Electric expects to file a case shortly likely by the end of today. The case will request an annual revenue increase of $59 million based on a return on equity of 10.75%. In September, we plan to make another filing in New Jersey requesting an extension of the current infrastructure investment surcharge to help mitigate the effects of regulatory lag. As I've noted, Delmarva Power plans to file a case in Maryland in the fourth quarter. Also in the fourth quarter, Pepco plans to file a rate case in Maryland and Delmarva Power plans to file an electric rate case in Delaware. Note that this filing schedule is tentative. In each of our jurisdictions, we plan to include in our rate cases or other filings a comprehensive discussion on the topic of regulatory lag and its negative effects as well as proposals to minimize lag. The status of the Mid-Atlantic Power Pathway or MAPP project can be seen on Slide 9. As we have previously reported, PJM is in the annual process of evaluating the region's overall transmission needs. PJM has stated that it expects to complete this evaluation sometime this month. While the PJM process is not yet complete, our expectation is that the MAPP projects' in-service date will be delayed several years beyond the current in-service date of June 2015. We will have further clarity on the revised in-service date when PJM completes its process.
Slide 10 shows the forecasted annual construction expenditures for our Power Delivery initiatives including the MAPP project. Due to the uncertainty of the MAPP projects in-service date, we currently anticipate that the 2011 construction expenditures associated with MAPP may be lower than our forecast due to the deferral of between $90 million to $110 million of MAPP expenditures to later years. However, we also anticipate that approximately $40 million of non-MAPP transmission capital expenditures planned for later years will be incurred in 2011. Once the revised in-service date for the MAPP project has been determined, we will update our 5-year Construction Expenditure Forecast accordingly. 
At Pepco Energy Services, the profitable wind down of the Retail Energy Supply business continues to be on track. And we continue to make good progress in growing the Energy Services business. As shown on Slide 11, Pepco Energy Services signed $35 million of new energy efficiency contracts in the second quarter of 2011, including a $28 million energy performance contract with the Maryland Port Administration. This project consists of the installation of a number of energy conservation measures, including renewable energy components as well as building upgrades. Looking ahead, the business development efforts we have undertaken over the past 2 years are showing results, with a prospective project pipeline of nearly $600 million. We believe the benefits of energy efficiency provide long-term growth opportunities for this business and we can grow Pepco Energy Services in a manner that is consistent with our lower risk profile. At this point, let me turn it over to Tony Kamerick. Tony?"

Earnings from continuing operations for the second quarter were $95 million or $0.42 per share compared to $76 million or $0.34 per for the second quarter of last year. For the 6 months ended June 30, 2011, earnings from continuing operations were $157 million or $0.69 per share compared to $104 million or $0.47 per share for the 2010 period. Our results show Conectiv Energy's results as continuing operations. For the 6 months ended June 30, 2011, income from discontinued operations, net of taxes, is $1 million. This includes income from adjustments to accrued expenses in connection with the sale of the generation assets, partially offset by losses from the disposition of Conectiv Energy's remaining assets and businesses. A summary of the drivers of our financial results can be found on Slides 12 and 13. In the fourth quarter of last year, we reached a settlement with the IRS for the tax years 2001 and 2002, which affected our tax returns as far back as 1996. In June, we reached an agreement with the IRS with respect to the interest due on the tax liabilities related to that settlement. In the second quarter of 2011, we recorded a tax benefit of $17 million or $0.08 per share primarily related to this agreement. About half of the tax benefit affects the Power Delivery segment with the balance affecting the other nonregulated segment. Our earnings guidance includes a range of tax benefits for the expected resolution of pending tax matters. Tax years 2003 and beyond are still open with the IRS, and the IRS is in the process of examining several large industry issues such as the treatment of mixed service costs and repair deductions. Until the IRS becomes more current with its audits and these industry issues are resolved, we can expect some level of tax adjustments in our results.
For the second quarter, Power Delivery earnings were $0.32 per share compared to $0.29 per share for the 2010 quarter. In addition to the tax benefit from the settlement with the IRS that I just discussed, higher distribution rates and default service margins positively affected earnings quarter-over-quarter. Higher distribution rates during the quarter increased earnings by $0.02 per share. The higher rates reflect the impact of electric rate decisions for Pepco in Maryland and Atlantic City Electric. The higher rates also reflect the interim rates put in place for Delmarva Power's gas business in Delaware. These rate increases were driven by higher costs and increased investment and distribution assets to enhance reliability. Higher default electricity supply margins during the quarter positively impacted earnings by $0.03 per share. About half of this increase is due to an increase in Pepco's cost recovery rate in the District of Columbia to recover higher cash working capital costs. The other half of the increase is due to an adjustment to Delmarva Power's operation and maintenance expense for providing default service in Delaware.
Partially offsetting these increases was higher operation and maintenance expense, which reduced earnings by $0.06 per share. The expense increase was driven by higher tree trimming and preventive maintenance costs, as well as emergency restoration expenditures. Lower weather-related sales versus the prior year decreased quarterly earnings by $0.01 per share. Cooling degree days decreased by 15% quarter-over-quarter. The weather for the quarter versus normal weather had no impact on the earnings. Keep in mind that our distribution revenue in Maryland and the District of Columbia, which represents approximately 2/3 of total distribution revenue is decoupled from consumption. Year-to-date, Power Delivery earnings were $0.53 per share in 2011 compared to $0.38 per share for the 6 months ended June 30, 2010. The increase in earnings was the result of higher distribution and transmission revenue due to higher rates, higher default electricity supply margins and favorable income tax adjustments. Partially offsetting the earnings increases was higher Power Delivery operation and maintenance expense. At our analyst conference in April, we provided a forecast of total O&M for Power Delivery of $818 million in 2011. We now expect O&M to be approximately $850 million with additional maintenance expense and tree trimming driving the increase. This level of O&M spending is contemplated in our earnings guidance range.
Pepco Energy Services' second quarter earnings were $0.03 per share compared to $0.05 per share for the 2010 quarter. Year-to-date, earnings were $0.08 per share compared to $0.11 per share for the six-month period ended June 2010. The decrease in earnings for both the quarter and year-to-date periods was due to lower retail electricity sales volumes resulting from the ongoing wind down of the Retail Energy Supply business partially offset by higher construction revenue. Note that the second quarter includes $2 million of net mark-to-market losses compared to $1 million of net mark-to-market gains for the 2010 quarter. For the 6 months ended June 2011, mark-to-market losses were $4 million as compared to losses of $1 million in the 2010 period.
In our other nonregulated segment, second quarter earnings were $0.08 per share compared to $0.03 per share in the 2010 quarter. Year-to-date earnings were $0.11 per share compared to $0.05 per share for the 6 months ended June 2010. The increase in earnings for both the quarter and year-to-date periods was primarily due to the tax benefit resulting from the settlement with the IRS for prior tax years, which I addressed earlier and the early termination of certain cross-border energy leases, which I will discuss in more detail shortly.
In our corporate and other segment which is primarily unallocated corporate costs, earnings improved for both the 2011 quarter and year-to-date periods compared to the same periods in the prior year. The earnings improvement resulted from lower interest expense due to lower parent company debt outstanding partially offset by the effect of favorable income tax adjustments in 2010.
Returning to the subject of the cross-border energy leases, as shown on Slide 14, in 2011, Pepco Holdings entered into early termination agreements for a number of leases in the portfolio at the request of the lessees. The lease terminations involved all of the leases comprising 1 of the 8 cross-border lease investments and a small portion of the leases comprising a second lease investment. Pepco Holdings received net proceeds of $161 million and recorded an after-tax gain of $3 million upon the termination. While the pretax gain was $39 million, in addition to the $14 million tax expense on the gain, $22 million of income tax benefits recognized previously were reversed in connection with the termination of the leases. The book value of the lease investment portfolio as of June 30, 2011, was $1.3 billion. As seen on Slide 15, the current annual tax benefits from the remaining cross-border energy lease investments are approximately $52 million and the annual net earnings are approximately $21 million. For the current status of our dispute with the IRS regarding the tax benefits of the leases, earlier this year, PHI paid $74 million of additional tax associated with the disallowance deductions from the lease investments in connection with the audits of the 2001 and 2002 tax years, plus penalties of $1 million and subsequent interest of $28 million.
Last month, we filed a claim for refund with the IRS, which we expect the IRS to deny. And if so, we intend to pursue litigation in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims against the IRS seeking to recover the tax payment, interest and penalties. Now I'll turn to our recent financing activity, which is summarized on Slide 16. In May, Delmarva Power repurchased approximately $35 million of 4.9% tax-exempt bonds due 2026, pursuant to a mandatory repurchase obligation triggered by the expiration of the original interest period. On June 1, the bonds were resold with the new interest rate of 0.75%. The bonds are subject to mandatory repurchase by Delmarva Power on June 1, 2012. PHI and utility subsidiaries maintain an unsecured syndicated credit facility to provide for short-term liquidity needs. On August 1, PHI and the utilities entered into an amendment and restated credit agreement to extend the expiration date of the facility from May 2012 to August 2016 and to include various enhancements to the terms and conditions of the facility. The aggregate borrowing limit under the credit facility remains $1.5 billion. 
Turning to our earnings guidance as seen on Slide 17, we are reaffirming our 2011 guidance range of $1.10 to $1.25 per share. However, given year-to-date results and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we currently anticipate being above the midpoint of that range. We will address the guidance range on the third quarter earnings call when we have more clarity on the resolution of certain tax matters. Now let me turn it back to Joe Rigby for some closing remarks."

This plan that we put together is our plan, not necessarily driven from a stated set of reliability expectations or standards.

And my sense given the progress that we're making is that the level of, the pace of this work is certainly more than adequate, I think, and we really are seeing -- it's been interesting just even in the last calendar month to see the impact period-over-period particularly in the Pepco's service territory. The other comment I'd make, and I'll make a comment about O&M and maybe Dave wants to talk about the CapEx. We've clearly pushed very hard this year on our O&M with the tree trimming. A larger number of contractor contingency or higher level of spend at the call center such that you take the O&M expectation for delivery up from I think it was $810 million to almost $850 million. Now whether that's a, whether that's the spend rate going forward, we're still debating that looking ahead. But the one thing I know is that if I think about the spend that we're making relative to what we see as the right kind of regulatory outcomes, I know we're doing the right things. And we're going to keep doing those right things to drive that level of reliability improvement. But, Dave, I don't know if you want to comment on the CapEx piece of this."

Earnings from continuing operations for the quarter were $95 million compared to $76 million in the 2010 quarter. Our operating results were driven by the positive i",2012,"Thanks, Donna, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen and thank you for joining us today. Earnings from continuing operations for the quarter were $95 million compared to $76 million in the 2010 quarter. Our operating results were driven by the positive impact of our infrastructure investments and reasonable regulatory outcomes, lower interest expense and income tax adjustments. Our results for both 2011 and 2010 quarters reflect Conectiv Energy's results as discontinued operations. Tony will discuss the financial results and our operating segment performance in more detail but first I'll address some topics of interest, starting with an update on our initiatives to improve system reliability as shown on Slide 3. We continue to make good progress in advancing infrastructure improvements and performing system maintenance in the Pepco region that will reduce power outages and improve service for our customers. Since launching our Reliability Enhancement Plan last fall, we have trimmed trees along more than 2,200 miles of power lines in our service territories, replaced or upgraded more than 150 miles of underground cable and identified overhead lines for undergrounding, among other efforts. We also have made several enhancements to improve customer communications during major storms, such as increasing call center staff and phone system capability and enabling outage maps to be viewed on smartphones. Our Reliability Enhancement Plan is on track and we are beginning to see positive trends in the operating performance of our electric system. Improving system reliability will remain a top priority for our company. As we are making progress in advancing our Reliability Enhancement Plan, we are continuing to dialogue with our regulators regarding system reliability and standards. In Maryland, the proceeding initiated in August 2010 to investigate the reliability of Pepco's distribution system is progressing. Hearings were completed in June and initial briefs were filed on July 20 with reply briefs due on August 8. Certain parties to the case have recommended the imposition of a variety of sanctions in various reporting requirements. As I've stated, we are committed to improving the reliability of Pepco's electric service. However, while we cannot predict the outcome of this case, we will oppose the sanctions requested by the other parties which we believe are not supported by the record.
Also in Maryland, the commission has commenced a rule-making to establish reliability benchmarks applicable to all electric utilities in the states. The proceeding involves all of Maryland electric utilities, the commission staff, People's Counsel and other interested parties. We are participants in the process and support the development of objective-fair standards with reasonable penalties. In the District of Columbia, the commission has recently has adopted new reliability standards. The new rules require improvements in reliability performance on an annual basis beginning in 2013 and continuing through 2020. Again, we support objective-fair standards, but we believe the regulations in their current form are flawed because they propose an inconsistent method to calculate reliability. Furthermore, while we are in the process of evaluating the cost and operational changes necessary to comply with the new requirements, we currently believe the standards as adopted may not be realistically achievable at an acceptable cost over the longer term. As a result, we intend to file an application for reconsideration of the regulations with the commission shortly. 
We continue to make progress on our Blueprint for the Future initiatives. Status by jurisdiction can be seen on Slide 4. The advanced meter installation for electric customers is largely complete in Delaware with 305,000 meters deployed, about 98% of the total. Of the installed meters, 273,000 have been activated and we plan to have the remainder activated by the end of the third quarter. The initial functionality includes remote meter reading, the availability of account-specific energy use information and outage detection. In the District of Columbia, 102,000 advanced meters have been installed, about 38% of the total, with the goal of having the installations completed by the end of 2011. In June, we began installing advanced meters for Pepco customers in Maryland and expect to have the installations completed by the end of 2012. The commissions in Delaware, the District of Columbia and Maryland have approved the establishment of a regulatory asset to defer AMI-related costs and the accrual of returns at the authorized rates of return on the deferred cost until such time as the cost and accrued returns can be incorporated in customer rates.
Proposals are pending in Delaware and the District of Columbia that request permission to implement a dynamic pricing plan for customers. Under the proposed critical peak rebate structure, the plans would reward Standard Offer Service customers for lowering their energy use during critical peak periods when energy demand and the cost of supply and electricity are higher. Decisions on the proposal are expected by year end. This Critical Peak Rebate structure has been approved in concept in Maryland, and the tariff details are currently being developed by a working group. Subject to approval, the phase-in implementation for residential customers in Delaware, the District of Columbia and Pepco Maryland's customers is targeted to begin in 2012 and continuing to 2013. Through the build out of the Smart Grid, we will gain added tools to improve system reliability while providing customers with access to detailed usage information that will enable them to better manage their energy use and lower their energy bills. Our energy efficiency and demand side management programs will also help our customers to reduce energy costs. The cost of these programs is being recovered through our demand side management-related rate adjustment mechanisms. 
Turning to our regulatory filings in June, the Delaware Commission approved the settlement agreement in Delmarva Power's natural gas delivery base rate case. As seen on Slide 5, the commission granted an annual rate increase of $6 million based on a stated return on equity of 10%. The parties to the settlement agreed to defer the request to place revenue decoupling into effect until an implementation plan has been developed. While the new rates were effective July 1, keep in mind that as permitted by Delaware law, Delmarva Power implemented interim rate increases of $2.5 million on August 31, 2010, and $7.7 million on February 2, 2011. The amount collected in excess of the approved rates will be returned to customers. On July 8, the Maryland Commission approved the settlement agreement in Delmarva Power's electric base rate case. As seen on Slide 6, the commission granted an annual rate increase of $12 million. The new rates became effective on July 8. Although the return on equity was not specified in the proposed settlement, the commission authorized a return on equity of 10% for purposes of calculating the allowance for funds used during construction and regulatory asset carrying cost. The commission also authorized a Phase 2 proceeding during which a working group, including Delmarva Power, commission staff and the People's Counsel will explore methods to address the issue of regulatory lag. Our objective in this process is to gain a consensus of the working group regarding the adoption of one or more mechanisms that will reduce regulatory lag and file a proposal with the commission that is supported by all parties. If consensus cannot be reached, each party can file its own proposal with the commission. Phase 2 proceeding has a 100-day term, which commenced on July 8. Delmarva Power is preparing to file a rate case in Maryland this fall in order to continue its efforts to close the gap between its earned and authorized return. This case will request commission approval for any proposals to reduce regulatory lag that are developed in the Phase 2 proceeding. As I've noted previously, reducing regulatory lag is a significant focus. Our preference is to achieve this by adopting mechanisms that negate the need for frequent rate cases, which we view as costly and inefficient. However, we have a deep and experienced regulatory staff that can execute a regulatory strategy that includes frequent cases if need be in order to earn returns close to what the commission has authorized.
Turning to Slide 7. On July 8, Pepco filed a rate case in the District of Columbia requesting an annual revenue increase of $42 million based on a return on equity of 10.75%. Of the requested $42 million increase, approximately $10 million relates to AMI-related cost. Since we have generally been earning a return on these costs since they were incurred, recovery of the cost through rates has a positive cash flow impact but does not affect earnings. Like Delmarva Power's filing in Maryland, this filing includes a comprehensive discussion on the topic of regulatory lag and its negative effects. The filing requests approval of a reliability investment recovery mechanism, which provides full and timely recovery of future capital investments related to distribution system reliability. The filing also requests the commission adopt fully forecasted test periods. The prehearing conference has been scheduled for September 8, a decision is expected in April 2012. We remain on track with our preparations to file 4 additional rate cases later this year. As shown on Slide 8, Atlantic City Electric expects to file a case shortly likely by the end of today. The case will request an annual revenue increase of $59 million based on a return on equity of 10.75%. In September, we plan to make another filing in New Jersey requesting an extension of the current infrastructure investment surcharge to help mitigate the effects of regulatory lag. As I've noted, Delmarva Power plans to file a case in Maryland in the fourth quarter. Also in the fourth quarter, Pepco plans to file a rate case in Maryland and Delmarva Power plans to file an electric rate case in Delaware. Note that this filing schedule is tentative. In each of our jurisdictions, we plan to include in our rate cases or other filings a comprehensive discussion on the topic of regulatory lag and its negative effects as well as proposals to minimize lag. The status of the Mid-Atlantic Power Pathway or MAPP project can be seen on Slide 9. As we have previously reported, PJM is in the annual process of evaluating the region's overall transmission needs. PJM has stated that it expects to complete this evaluation sometime this month. While the PJM process is not yet complete, our expectation is that the MAPP projects' in-service date will be delayed several years beyond the current in-service date of June 2015. We will have further clarity on the revised in-service date when PJM completes its process.
Slide 10 shows the forecasted annual construction expenditures for our Power Delivery initiatives including the MAPP project. Due to the uncertainty of the MAPP projects in-service date, we currently anticipate that the 2011 construction expenditures associated with MAPP may be lower than our forecast due to the deferral of between $90 million to $110 million of MAPP expenditures to later years. However, we also anticipate that approximately $40 million of non-MAPP transmission capital expenditures planned for later years will be incurred in 2011. Once the revised in-service date for the MAPP project has been determined, we will update our 5-year Construction Expenditure Forecast accordingly. 
At Pepco Energy Services, the profitable wind down of the Retail Energy Supply business continues to be on track. And we continue to make good progress in growing the Energy Services business. As shown on Slide 11, Pepco Energy Services signed $35 million of new energy efficiency contracts in the second quarter of 2011, including a $28 million energy performance contract with the Maryland Port Administration. This project consists of the installation of a number of energy conservation measures, including renewable energy components as well as building upgrades. Looking ahead, the business development efforts we have undertaken over the past 2 years are showing results, with a prospective project pipeline of nearly $600 million. We believe the benefits of energy efficiency provide long-term growth opportunities for this business and we can grow Pepco Energy Services in a manner that is consistent with our lower risk profile. At this point, let me turn it over to Tony Kamerick. Tony?"

I'll recap our earnings, address our performance by operating segment and discuss some topics of interest. We will then open the call to your questions. Earnings from continuing operations for the second q",1494,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'll recap our earnings, address our performance by operating segment and discuss some topics of interest. We will then open the call to your questions. Earnings from continuing operations for the second quarter were $95 million or $0.42 per share compared to $76 million or $0.34 per for the second quarter of last year. For the 6 months ended June 30, 2011, earnings from continuing operations were $157 million or $0.69 per share compared to $104 million or $0.47 per share for the 2010 period. Our results show Conectiv Energy's results as continuing operations. For the 6 months ended June 30, 2011, income from discontinued operations, net of taxes, is $1 million. This includes income from adjustments to accrued expenses in connection with the sale of the generation assets, partially offset by losses from the disposition of Conectiv Energy's remaining assets and businesses. A summary of the drivers of our financial results can be found on Slides 12 and 13. In the fourth quarter of last year, we reached a settlement with the IRS for the tax years 2001 and 2002, which affected our tax returns as far back as 1996. In June, we reached an agreement with the IRS with respect to the interest due on the tax liabilities related to that settlement. In the second quarter of 2011, we recorded a tax benefit of $17 million or $0.08 per share primarily related to this agreement. About half of the tax benefit affects the Power Delivery segment with the balance affecting the other nonregulated segment. Our earnings guidance includes a range of tax benefits for the expected resolution of pending tax matters. Tax years 2003 and beyond are still open with the IRS, and the IRS is in the process of examining several large industry issues such as the treatment of mixed service costs and repair deductions. Until the IRS becomes more current with its audits and these industry issues are resolved, we can expect some level of tax adjustments in our results.
For the second quarter, Power Delivery earnings were $0.32 per share compared to $0.29 per share for the 2010 quarter. In addition to the tax benefit from the settlement with the IRS that I just discussed, higher distribution rates and default service margins positively affected earnings quarter-over-quarter. Higher distribution rates during the quarter increased earnings by $0.02 per share. The higher rates reflect the impact of electric rate decisions for Pepco in Maryland and Atlantic City Electric. The higher rates also reflect the interim rates put in place for Delmarva Power's gas business in Delaware. These rate increases were driven by higher costs and increased investment and distribution assets to enhance reliability. Higher default electricity supply margins during the quarter positively impacted earnings by $0.03 per share. About half of this increase is due to an increase in Pepco's cost recovery rate in the District of Columbia to recover higher cash working capital costs. The other half of the increase is due to an adjustment to Delmarva Power's operation and maintenance expense for providing default service in Delaware.
Partially offsetting these increases was higher operation and maintenance expense, which reduced earnings by $0.06 per share. The expense increase was driven by higher tree trimming and preventive maintenance costs, as well as emergency restoration expenditures. Lower weather-related sales versus the prior year decreased quarterly earnings by $0.01 per share. Cooling degree days decreased by 15% quarter-over-quarter. The weather for the quarter versus normal weather had no impact on the earnings. Keep in mind that our distribution revenue in Maryland and the District of Columbia, which represents approximately 2/3 of total distribution revenue is decoupled from consumption. Year-to-date, Power Delivery earnings were $0.53 per share in 2011 compared to $0.38 per share for the 6 months ended June 30, 2010. The increase in earnings was the result of higher distribution and transmission revenue due to higher rates, higher default electricity supply margins and favorable income tax adjustments. Partially offsetting the earnings increases was higher Power Delivery operation and maintenance expense. At our analyst conference in April, we provided a forecast of total O&M for Power Delivery of $818 million in 2011. We now expect O&M to be approximately $850 million with additional maintenance expense and tree trimming driving the increase. This level of O&M spending is contemplated in our earnings guidance range.
Pepco Energy Services' second quarter earnings were $0.03 per share compared to $0.05 per share for the 2010 quarter. Year-to-date, earnings were $0.08 per share compared to $0.11 per share for the six-month period ended June 2010. The decrease in earnings for both the quarter and year-to-date periods was due to lower retail electricity sales volumes resulting from the ongoing wind down of the Retail Energy Supply business partially offset by higher construction revenue. Note that the second quarter includes $2 million of net mark-to-market losses compared to $1 million of net mark-to-market gains for the 2010 quarter. For the 6 months ended June 2011, mark-to-market losses were $4 million as compared to losses of $1 million in the 2010 period.
In our other nonregulated segment, second quarter earnings were $0.08 per share compared to $0.03 per share in the 2010 quarter. Year-to-date earnings were $0.11 per share compared to $0.05 per share for the 6 months ended June 2010. The increase in earnings for both the quarter and year-to-date periods was primarily due to the tax benefit resulting from the settlement with the IRS for prior tax years, which I addressed earlier and the early termination of certain cross-border energy leases, which I will discuss in more detail shortly.
In our corporate and other segment which is primarily unallocated corporate costs, earnings improved for both the 2011 quarter and year-to-date periods compared to the same periods in the prior year. The earnings improvement resulted from lower interest expense due to lower parent company debt outstanding partially offset by the effect of favorable income tax adjustments in 2010.
Returning to the subject of the cross-border energy leases, as shown on Slide 14, in 2011, Pepco Holdings entered into early termination agreements for a number of leases in the portfolio at the request of the lessees. The lease terminations involved all of the leases comprising 1 of the 8 cross-border lease investments and a small portion of the leases comprising a second lease investment. Pepco Holdings received net proceeds of $161 million and recorded an after-tax gain of $3 million upon the termination. While the pretax gain was $39 million, in addition to the $14 million tax expense on the gain, $22 million of income tax benefits recognized previously were reversed in connection with the termination of the leases. The book value of the lease investment portfolio as of June 30, 2011, was $1.3 billion. As seen on Slide 15, the current annual tax benefits from the remaining cross-border energy lease investments are approximately $52 million and the annual net earnings are approximately $21 million. For the current status of our dispute with the IRS regarding the tax benefits of the leases, earlier this year, PHI paid $74 million of additional tax associated with the disallowance deductions from the lease investments in connection with the audits of the 2001 and 2002 tax years, plus penalties of $1 million and subsequent interest of $28 million.
Last month, we filed a claim for refund with the IRS, which we expect the IRS to deny. And if so, we intend to pursue litigation in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims against the IRS seeking to recover the tax payment, interest and penalties. Now I'll turn to our recent financing activity, which is summarized on Slide 16. In May, Delmarva Power repurchased approximately $35 million of 4.9% tax-exempt bonds due 2026, pursuant to a mandatory repurchase obligation triggered by the expiration of the original interest period. On June 1, the bonds were resold with the new interest rate of 0.75%. The bonds are subject to mandatory repurchase by Delmarva Power on June 1, 2012. PHI and utility subsidiaries maintain an unsecured syndicated credit facility to provide for short-term liquidity needs. On August 1, PHI and the utilities entered into an amendment and restated credit agreement to extend the expiration date of the facility from May 2012 to August 2016 and to include various enhancements to the terms and conditions of the facility. The aggregate borrowing limit under the credit facility remains $1.5 billion. 
Turning to our earnings guidance as seen on Slide 17, we are reaffirming our 2011 guidance range of $1.10 to $1.25 per share.

This plan that we put together is our plan, not necessarily driven from a stated set of reliability expectations or standards. We started this plan actually fully over a year ago and there was not any discussion around what the future standards would be. So what I see happening as we go forward in time is how we kind of think about this plan to make sure it's aligned to the evolving standards that are coming out. And my sense given the progress that we're making is that the level of, the pace of this work is certainly more than adequate, I think, and we really are seeing -- it's been interesting just even in the last calendar month to see the impact period-over-period particularly in the Pepco's service territory. The other comment I'd make, and I'll make a comment about O&M and maybe Dave wants to talk about the CapEx. We've clearly pushed very hard this year on our O&M with the tree trimming. A larger number of contractor contingency or higher level of spend at the call center such that you take the O&M expectation for delivery up from I think it was $810 million to almost $850 million. Now whether that's a, whether that's the spend rate going forward, we're still debating that looking ahead. But the one thing I know is that if I think about the spend that we're making relative to what we see as the right kind of regulatory outcomes, I know we're doing the right things. And we're going to keep doing those right things to drive that level of reliability improvement. But, Dave, I don't know if you want to comment on the CapEx piece of this."

We have spent about almost $30 million in CapEx year-to-date on this and expect that we'll be spending in the second half of the year somewhere between $75 million and $100 million of additional capital.

More significant construction would follow in the second half of the year.

Earnings from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2011 were $80 million, compared to $21 million for the third quarter of 2010. Excluding special items for the 2010 quarter earnings would have been $116 million. Our operating results reflect continued progress on executing our strategic plan including our efforts to improve system reliability customer service. Our results for both 2011 and 2010 quarters with Conectiv Energy's results as discontinued operations. Tony will discuss the financial results on our operating segment performance in more detail but first I'd like to address some topic of interest. 
Improving system reliability remains a top priority for our company and as shown on Slide 3, we continue to make good progress in advancing infrastructure improvements and performance system maintenance focus primarily in the Pepco region that will reduce power outages and improve service for our customers. Into launching our reliability enhancement plan last fall for Pepco, we have trimmed trees along more than 2,600 miles of power lines, replaced or upgraded more than 230 miles of underground cable, and added more than 125 automated switches that will reroute power more effectively during storms. Our Reliability Enhancement Plan is on track and we are beginning to see positive trends in the operating performance of our electric system as is demonstrated by improved outage frequency and outage duration statistics for Pepco. In addition to our efforts to improve system reliability, we have made several announcements to our emergency restoration process that will improve customer communications during major storms, such as increasing our cost in our staff and fill-in system capability conducting more frequent customer outreach and expanding the use of mobile applications for outage information and reporting. 
Turning to Slide 4, our reliability improvement efforts were tested with the arrival of Hurricane Irene in late August. The high winds and driving rains caused significant damage to the electric system throughout our service territories. Approximately 445,000 of our customers were without power at the peak of the storm, or about 25% of our electric customers. About half of the outages occurred in the Pepco service territory. 98% of the customers were restored in a little over 2 days after the storm seized. After restoration was complete, the survey showed that customers gave Pepco good marks on its handling of storm preparedness, restoration and communications. Tony will discuss the cost of our restoration efforts and the recovery of those costs later on this call. 
As we are making progress in advancing our Reliability Enhancement Plan, we also are continuing to dialogue with our regulators regarding system reliability and standards. 
Turning to Slide 5, we are awaiting the decision in the Maryland proceeding initiated in August 2010 to investigate the reliability of Pepco's distribution system. Certain parties to this case have recommended the imposition of a variety of sanctions and various reporting requirements. As I've stated, we are committed to improving the reliability of Pepco's electric service. However, while we cannot predict the outcome of the case, we will oppose the sanctions requested by the other parties, which we believe are not supported by the record. Also in Maryland, as seen on Slide 6, the rule-making to establish reliability standards applicable to all electric utilities in the state continues to move forward. The proceeding involves All Maryland electric utilities that commissioned Staff People's council and other interested parties. The working group bequeath through October and the commissioned staff issued a report with proposed draft standards on October 27. The report proposes benchmarks for service interruption, down wire response, customer communications, vegetation management and equipment inspection among other activities. We were in the process of reviewing the proposed standards and we'll file our comments to the commission on November 16. We will have an opportunity to discuss our comments in front of the commission during rule-making sessions that are scheduled for December 8th and 9th. According to the legislation, passed by the Maryland General Assembly, regulations must be adopted by July 1, 2012. We are participants in the process and support the development of objective, fair standards with reasonable penalties and the timely recovery of the investments necessary to meet these standards. In the District of Columbia, the commission adopted the reliability standards in July. The new rules require improvement in reliability performance on an annual basis beginning in 2013 and continuing through 2020. Again, we support objective fair standards. What we believe the regulations in their current form are flawed because they proposed an inconsistent method to calculate reliability. Furthermore, we currently believe the standards as adopted, may not be realistically achievable at an acceptable cost over the longer term. As a result, we filed an application for reconsideration of the regulations with the commission on August 8, which is still pending. Our application requested the commission to convene a working group process that considers fully all the relevant issues and allows the commission to adopt reliability benchmarks that will require a meaningful level of reliability. It also be reasonably be achievable through the use of cost effective reliability enhancement measures. We continue to make progress on our blueprint for the future initiatives. 
The status by jurisdiction can be seen on Slide 7. The advanced meter installation and activation for electric customers is largely complete in Delaware. The initial functionality includes remote meter reading, the availability of account specific energy, specific use of information and outage detection. in the District of Columbia, about 60% of the advanced leaders have been installed and our goal is to complete installations by early next year. Meter activation is underway and is expected to be completed by mid-2012. In June, we began installing advanced meters for Pepco's customers in Maryland, and we expect to complete installations by the end of 2012. The Commissions in Delaware, District of Columbia and Maryland have approved the establishment of regulatory assets to defer AMI related costs and the accrual of return at the authorized rates of return on the deferred cost until such time as the cost and accrued returns can be incorporated into summer rates. The AMI outage detection functionality proved useful during Hurricane Irene restoration efforts. We were able to obtain the AMI meters in Delaware and get data that allowed us to clear outage orders, thereby eliminating the need to dispatch crews several hundred potential outage locations. Proposals are pending in Delaware and the District of Columbia that request permission to implement dynamic pricing plans for customers. Under the proposed Critical Peak Rebate structure, the plans would award Standard Offer Service customer support lowering their energy use during critical peak periods when energy demand and the cost of supply and electricity are higher. Positions on the proposals are expected by year end. This Critical Peak Rebate structure has been approved in concept in Maryland and the tariff details are currently being developed by a working group. Subject to approval, and facing implementation for residential customers in Delaware, the District of Columbia, Pepco's Maryland customers is targeted to begin in 2012 and continuing to 2013. 
Turning to our regulatory filings as seen on Slide 8. Atlantic City filed a rate case in New Jersey on August 5th, requesting an annual revenue increase of $59 million based on a return on equity of 10.75%. Of the requested $59 million increase, approximately $5 million relates to an increase in sales and used taxes and therefore does not impact earnings. The prehearing conference was held on October 19th and the procedural schedule should be issued shortly. On October 18, Atlantic City Electric filed a separate request in New Jersey for the approval of a continuance and expansion of the recently completed infrastructure investment program. While helping to stimulate the New Jersey economy, the program reduces regulatory lag by allowing recovery on non-revenue-generating infrastructure investment capital expenditures through the special rate outside of the normal rate recovery mechanism of the base rate filing. Under the proposed expansion of the program, Atlantic City Electric would recover reliability related capital expenditures of approximately $69 million in 2012, $94 million in 2013 and $81 million in 2014. 
As shown on Slide 9, the Phase 2 proceeding of Delmarva Power's Electric distribution base rate case in Maryland concluded on October 17. In the Phase 2 proceeding, a working group including Delmarva Power, commission staff and the People's Council, examined the need for, and design a regulatory lag reduction mechanisms. Although consensus was reached among the parties of the working group, the proceeding did provide an opportunity to further educate the parties on the cause and effects of regulatory lag and to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of various regulatory lag reduction mechanisms. Delmarva Power is preparing a rate case in Maryland in December in order to continue its efforts to close the gap between its earned and authorized return. We plan to again request commission approval of regulatory lag reduction mechanisms in this case. 
Turning to Pepco's base rate case in the District of Columbia, as seen on Slide 10, the procedural schedule has been set for the case with hearings beginning on January 30 and a decision expected in the second quarter of 2012. The filing seeks approval of an annual rate increase of approximately $42 million based on a 10.75% return on equity. Recall that albeit the requested $42 million increase, approximately $10 million relates to AMI related cost. Since we have generally been earning a return on these costs since they were incurred, recovery of the cost to rates as a positive cash flow impact but does not affect earnings. Like Delmarva Power's filing in Maryland, this filing includes a comprehensive discussion on the topic of regulatory lag and its negative effects. The filing request approval of reliability and investment recovery mechanism, which provides full and timely recovery of future capital investments related to distribution system reliability. The filing also request that the commission adapt fully forecasted test periods. 
We remain on track with our preparations to file 3 additional rate cases in December as shown on Slide 11. As I've noted, Delmarva Power planned to file a case in Maryland, as well as an electric case in Delaware. Pepco also plans to file a case in Maryland. Note that the filing schedule is tentative, in each of our jurisdictions, we plan to include in our rate case a comprehensive discussion on the topic of regulatory lag, as well as proposals to minimize lag. As I've noted previously, reducing regulatory lag is a significant focus. Our preference is to achieve this by adopting mechanisms that negate the need for frequent rate cases, which we view as costly and inefficient. However, we have a deep and experienced regulatory staff that can execute a regulatory strategy that includes frequent cases, if need be, in order to return returns at/or close to what the commissions have authorized. 
The status of the Mid-Atlantic Power Pathway or MAP project can be seen on Slide 12. As we previously reported, PJM provides us notice in August on August 18 that the scheduled in-service date for the MAP project has been delayed from 2015 to 2019 to 2021 timeframe. This delay takes into account changes in demand response, generation retirements and addition, as well as a revised load forecast for the PJM region that is lower than forecast used in previous PJM studies. The revised service date will be evaluated as part of the PJM's 2012 Regional Transmission Expansion Plan review process. Given the delay and the end service date, we have suspended most permitting, engineering and environmental studies. However, with PJM support, we plan to complete right of way and land acquisition to Dorchester County and some permitting and environmental activities at an estimated cost of approximately $5 million in each of 2011 to 2012. 
Slide 13 shows the forecasted annual capital expenditures for Power Delivery from 2012 through 2016. The forecast assumes a MAP in-service date of 2020. Total expenditures over the 5-year period are estimated to be $5.6 billion, with 28% of the total expenditures spent on FERC regulated transmission projects. At Pepco Energy Services, the profitable wind down of the Retail Energy Supply business is on track and we continue to make good progress in growing Energy Services business. 
As shown on Slide 14, Pepco Energy Services signed $38 million of new energy efficiency contracts in the third quarter of 2011, including an $11 million energy performance contract with the Virginia Department of Military Affairs. This project consists of installation of a number of energy conservation measures for 22 armories and military facilities. Construction began last month and is projected to be completed in 2013. 
Looking ahead to business development efforts. We have undertaken over the past 2 years our show in results with a perspective product development pipeline of $511 million, up 14% since the beginning of the year. We believe the benefits of energy efficiency provide long-term growth opportunities for this business and we can grow Pepco Energy Services in a manner that is consistent with our lower risk profile. At this point let me turn it over to Tony Kamerick. Tony?"

I'll recap our earnings, address our performance by operating segment, and discuss some topics of interest. We will then open the call to your questions. 
As shown on Slide 15, earnings from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2011 were $80 million or $0.35 per share, compared to $21 million or $0.09 per share for the third quarter of last year. Excluding special items as identified in our earnings release and Slides, earnings from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2010 would have been $116 million, or $0.52 per share. For the 9 months ended September 30, 2011, earnings from continuing operations were $237 million or $1.05 per share, compared to $125 million or $0.56 per share for the 2010 period. Excluding special items for the 9 months ended September 30, 2010, earnings from continuing operations would have been $220 million or $0.99 per share. Our results show Conectiv Energy's results as discontinued operations. For the 9-months ended September 30, 2011, income from discontinued operations, net of taxes was $1 million. 
Before I discuss our results by segment, I want to address the cost of restoration in connection with Hurricane Irene, as summarized on Slide 16. As Joe discussed, the impact of Hurricane Irene on our service territories was severe. The total incremental cost of our restoration efforts is currently estimated to be $47 million. In the third quarter of 2011, $24 million of this cost was deferred as a regulatory asset and $6 million of this cost was expensed resulting in earnings decrease of $0.02 per share. The balance of the restoration cost was charged to capital. Since a large portion of the cost incurred related to services provided by third parties for which we have not yet been billed, costs have been estimated and are subject to change. We believe that all of the restoration costs incurred are recoverable. Recovery of the expenses incurred in excess of the storm restoration expenses currently embedded in base rates will be pursued during the current cycle of distribution rate cases. 
A summary of the drivers of our financial results can be found on Slides 17 and 18. For the third quarter of 2011, Power Delivery earnings were $0.29 per share, compared to $0.41 per share for the third quarter of 2010 excluding special items. By far, the largest driver of the reduction in earnings quarter over quarter, was a higher operation and maintenance spending, which decreased earnings by $0.11 per share. The increase in O&M was largely due to higher reliability and preventive maintenance cost, as well as the impact of Hurricane Irene as I just discussed. Lower weather-related sales versus the prior year, decreased quarterly earnings by $0.01 per share. Cooling degree days decreased by 6% quarter-over-quarter. The weather for the quarter versus normal weather increased earnings by $0.02 per share. Keep in mind that our distribution revenue in Maryland and the District of Columbia, which represents approximately 2/3 of total distribution revenue, is decoupled from consumption. Year-to-date, Power Delivery earnings were $0.82 per share in 2011, compared to $0.79 per share for the 9-months ended September 2010, excluding special items. Higher distribution and transmission revenue due to higher rates, higher default electricity supply margins and favorable income tax adjustments drove the increase in earnings. Our largest offsetting factor was higher operation and maintenance expense, which decreased earnings by $0.22 per share. As in the quarter, reliability and preventive maintenance spending and Hurricane restoration costs drove the higher operation and maintenance expense. 
At our Analyst Conference in April, we provided a forecast of 2011 Power Delivery O&M expense of $818 million. During the second quarter earnings call, we revised that estimate to $850 million. We now expect Power Delivery O&M will be approximately $897 million with reliability initiatives, system restoration activities and customer communications driving a significant portion of the increase. However, note that approximately $18 million of this expense will be offset by lower corporate costs. This level of O&M spending is contemplated in our earnings guidance range. 
Looking ahead to 2012, we anticipate O&M spending will be in line with our current projections for 2011 excluding major storm costs, which are about $16 million, year-to-date. Pepco Energy Services third quarter earnings were $0.04 per share compared to $0.03 per share for the 2010 quarter. The increase in earnings for the quarter was due to a higher Energy Services revenue partially offset by lower retail electricity sales volumes resulting from the ongoing wind down of Retail Energy Supply business and mark-to market losses on derivative contracts. Year-to-date, earnings were $0.12 per share compared to $0.14 per share for the 9 months ended September 2010. The decrease in earnings due to lower retail electricity sales volume and mark-to-market losses on derivative contracts was partially offset by higher Energy Services revenue and lower credit related costs. Note that the third quarter includes $3 million of net mark-to-market losses, compared to $1 million of net mark-to-market gains for the 2010 quarter. For the 9-months ended September 30, 2011, mark to market losses was $7 million as compared to losses of $1 million in the 2010 period. 
In our other nonregulated segments, third quarter earnings were $0.02 per share, compared to $0.04 per share in the 2010 quarter. The decrease in earnings was largely due to the impact of a tax law change in the District of Columbia, which I will discuss in more detail shortly. Year-to-date earnings were $0.13 per share, compared to $0.09 per share for the 2010 period. The increase in earnings was primarily due to a tax benefit resulting from the settlement with the IRS for prior tax years, which occurred in the second quarter of 2011. 
In our corporate and other segment, which is mainly unallocated corporate costs, earnings declined by $0.04 per share quarter-over-quarter excluding special items primarily due to the effect of favorable income tax adjustments in the 2010 quarter. For the year-to-date periods, earnings improved by $0.01 per share in 2011, compared to the prior-year excluding special items. The earnings improvement result of primarily from lower interest rates expense in the 2011 period, the effect of favorable income tax adjustments in the 2010 period was a partially offsetting factor. 
Turning back to tax law change I referenced earlier. On June 14, the Council of the District of Columbia approved the fiscal year 2012 Budget Support Act of 2011. The Act includes a unitary tax provision under which all commonly controlled subsidiary Pepco holdings will be included in the District of Columbia income tax filing. This new reporting method became law on September 14th and is effective for tax years beginning on or after December 31, 2010. The effects of the tax law change lowered Pepco Holdings earnings by $5 million after-tax in the third quarter of 2011. This impact is comprised of additional state income tax expense of $2 million, which impacts all lines of business. In addition, we recalculated the equity investment and certain cross-border energy leases as a result of modified state tax cash flows option, which resulted in a $3 million after-tax charge. 
Turning to our earnings guidance, as seen on Slide 19. We are narrowing our 2011 earnings guidance range to $1.15 to $1.25 per share from $1.10 to $1.25 per share. The guidance range excludes the results of discontinued operation and assumes normal weather conditions for the remainder of the year. The range excludes the net mark-to-market effects of economic hedging activities, associated with the Retail Energy Supply business of Pepco Energy Services and also excludes the impact of the tax law change in the District of Columbia that I just discussed. 
Now let me turn it back to Joe Rigby, for some closing remarks."

2011 has been a year of significant challenge and significant progress. But we are not yet satisfied with the status of reliability or the timing of MAP. We are pleased with our strategy, our progress on the Smart Grid and the improvements we have made in reliability and storm restoration. To be sure, we have spent a considerable amount of O&M and capital making steady improvements, which will place us in good stead with our customers and regulators. We've been able to accommodate this level of expenditures and still plan to deliver earnings within our earnings guidance range. Tony mentioned we will continue to spend a comparable level of O&M for 2012 excluding major storms to improve reliability with customer service. We will file a rate cases to recover these costs and to earn a return on our rate base growth. We believe every dollar we spend is prudent, and should therefore be recovered. We will continue to aggressively pursue the reduction of regulatory lag and I am confident we will create value for our customers and investors.

Where you get out to the much more difficult increments of kind of moving the ball up feel a little bit towards the end is where we're concerned but I do think that we have not had a significant level of discussion with the staff and the commission on this.

Earnings from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2011 were $80 million compared to $21 million for the third quarter of 2010. Excluding special items for the 2010 quarter, earnings would have been $116 million. Our operating results reflect continued progress on executing our strategic plan, including our efforts to improve system reliability and customer service. Our results for both 2011 and 2010 quarters reflect Conectiv Energy's results as discontinued operations. Tony will discuss the financial results on our operating segment performance in more detail but first, I'd like to address some topics of interest. 
Improving system reliability remains a top priority for our company. As shown on Slide 3, we continue to make good progress in advancing infrastructure improvements and performance system maintenance focused primarily in the Pepco region that will reduce power outages and improve service for our customers. Since the launching of our Reliability Enhancement Plan last fall for Pepco, we have trimmed trees along more than 2,600 miles of power lines, replaced or upgraded more than 230 miles of underground cable, and added more than 125 automated switches that will reroute power more effectively during storms. Our Reliability Enhancement Plan is on track and we are beginning to see positive trends in the operating performance of our electric system as is demonstrated by improved outage frequency and outage duration statistics for Pepco. 
In addition to our efforts to improve system reliability, we have made several enhancements to our emergency restoration process that will improve customer communications during major storms, such as increasing our call center staff and phone system capability, conducting more frequent customer outreach and expanding the use of mobile applications for outage information and reporting. 
Turning to Slide 4, our reliability improvement efforts were tested with the arrival of Hurricane Irene in late August. The high winds and driving rains caused significant damage to the electric system throughout our service territories. Approximately 445,000 of our customers were without power at the peak of the storm, or about 25% of our electric customers. About half of the outages occurred in the Pepco service territory. 98% of the customers were restored in a little over 2 days after the storm seized. After restoration was complete, a survey showed that customers gave Pepco good marks on its handling of storm preparedness, restoration and communications. Tony will discuss the cost of our restoration efforts and the recovery of those costs later on this call. 
As we are making progress in advancing our Reliability Enhancement Plan, we also are continuing to dialogue with our regulators regarding system reliability and standards. 
Turning to Slide 5, we are awaiting the decision in the Maryland proceeding initiated in August 2010 to investigate the reliability of Pepco's distribution system. Certain parties to this case have recommended the imposition of a variety of sanctions and various reporting requirements. As I have stated, we are committed to improving the reliability of Pepco's electric service. However, while we cannot predict the outcome of the case, we will oppose the sanctions requested by the other parties, which we believe are not supported by the record. 
Also in Maryland, as seen on Slide 6, the rulemaking to establish reliability standards applicable to all electric utilities in the state continues to move forward. The proceeding involves All Maryland electric utilities that Commissioned staff, People's Council and other interested parties. The working group met weekly through October, and the commissioned staff issued a report with proposed draft standards on October 27. The report proposes benchmarks for service interruptions, downed wire response, customer communications, vegetation management and equipment inspection, among other activities. We are in the process of reviewing the proposed standards and we'll file our comments to the commission on November 16. We will have an opportunity to discuss our comments in front of the commission during rulemaking sessions that are scheduled for December 8th and 9th. According to the legislation, passed by the Maryland General Assembly, regulations must be adopted by July 1, 2012. We are participants in the process and support the development of objective, fair standards with reasonable penalties and the timely recovery of the investments necessary to meet these standards. In the District of Columbia, the commission adopted new reliability standards in July. The new rules require improvement in reliability performance on an annual basis beginning in 2013 and continuing through 2020. Again, we support objective fair standards. What we believe the regulations in their current form are flawed because they proposed an inconsistent method to calculate reliability. Furthermore, we currently believe the standards as adopted may not be realistically achievable at an acceptable cost over the longer term. As a result, we filed an application for reconsideration of the regulations with the commission on August 8, which is still pending. Our application requested the commission to convene a working group process that considers fully all the relevant issues and allows the commission to adopt reliability benchmarks that will require a meaningful level of reliability, yet also be reasonably be achievable through the use of cost-effective reliability enhancement measures. 
We continue to make progress on our Blueprint for the Future initiatives. The Status by Jurisdiction can be seen on Slide 7. The advanced meter installation and activation for electric customers is largely complete in Delaware. The initial functionality includes remote meter reading, the availability of account, specific energy use of information and outage detection. In the District of Columbia, about 60% of the advanced meters have been installed and our goal is to complete the installations by early next year. 
Meter activation is underway and is expected to be completed by mid-2012. In June, we began installing advanced meters for Pepco's customers in Maryland, and we expect to complete installations by the end of 2012. The commissions in Delaware, the District of Columbia and Maryland have approved the establishment of regulatory assets to defer AMI-related costs and the accrual of return at the authorized rates of return on the deferred cost, until such time as the cost and accrued returns can be incorporated in customer rates. 
The AMI outage detection functionality proved useful during Hurricane Irene restoration efforts. We were able to obtain the AMI meters in Delaware and get data that allowed us to clear outage orders, thereby eliminating the need to dispatch crews to several hundred potential outage locations. Proposals are pending in Delaware and the District of Columbia that request permission to implement dynamic pricing plans for customers. Under the proposed Critical Peak Rebate structure, the plans would reward Standard Offer Service customers for lowering their energy use during critical peak periods when energy demand and the cost of supply and electricity are higher. Decisions on the proposals are expected by year end. This Critical Peak Rebate structure has been approved in concept in Maryland, and the tariff details are currently being developed by a working group. Subject to approval, and phase-in implementation for residential customers in Delaware, the District of Columbia, Pepco's Maryland customers is targeted to begin in 2012 and continuing to 2013. 
Turning to our regulatory filings as seen on Slide 8. Atlantic City Electric filed a rate case in New Jersey on August 5th, requesting an annual revenue increase of $59 million based on a return on equity of 10.75%. Of the requested $59 million increase, approximately $5 million relates to an increase in sales and used taxes and, therefore, does not impact earnings. A prehearing conference was held on October 19th and a procedural schedule should be issued shortly. 
On October 18, Atlantic City Electric filed a separate request in New Jersey for the approval of a continuance and expansion of the recently completed infrastructure investment program. While helping to stimulate the New Jersey economy, the program reduces regulatory lag by allowing recovery on non-revenue-generating infrastructure investment capital expenditures through a special rate outside of the normal rate recovery mechanism of the base rate filing. Under the proposed expansion of the program, Atlantic City Electric would recover reliability-related capital expenditures of approximately $69 million in 2012, $94 million in 2013 and $81 million in 2014. 
As shown on Slide 9, the Phase 2 proceeding of Delmarva Power's electric distribution base rate case in Maryland concluded on October 17. In the Phase 2 proceeding, a working group including Delmarva Power, Commission staff and the People's Council examined the need for and design of regulatory lag reduction mechanisms. Although consensus was reached among the parties of the working group, the proceeding did provide an opportunity to further educate the parties on the cause and effects of regulatory lag and to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of various regulatory lag reduction mechanisms. Delmarva Power is preparing to file a rate case in Maryland in December in order to continue its efforts to close the gap between its earned and authorized return. We plan to again request commission approval of regulatory lag reduction mechanisms in this case. 
Turning to Pepco's base rate case in the District of Columbia, as seen on Slide 10. The procedural schedule has been set for the case with hearings beginning on January 30 and a decision expected in the second quarter of 2012. The filing seeks approval of an annual rate increase of approximately $42 million based on a 10.75% return on equity. Recall that there'll be requested $42 million increase, approximately $10 million relates to AMI-related cost. Since we have generally been earning a return on these costs since they were incurred, recovery of the cost through rates has a positive cash flow impact but does not affect earnings. Like Delmarva Power's filing in Maryland, this filing includes a comprehensive discussion on the topic of regulatory lag and its negative effects. The filing request approval of a reliability investment recovery mechanism, which provides full and timely recovery of future capital investments related to distribution system reliability. The filing also requests that the commission adapt fully forecasted test periods. 
We remain on track with our preparations to file 3 additional rate cases in December, as shown on Slide 11. As I've noted, Delmarva Power plans to file a case in Maryland, as well as an electric case in Delaware. Pepco also plans to file a case in Maryland. Note that the filing schedule is tentative. In each of our jurisdictions, we plan to include in our rate case a comprehensive discussion on the topic of regulatory lag, as well as proposals to minimize lag. 
As I've noted previously, reducing regulatory lag is a significant focus. Our preference is to achieve this by adopting mechanisms that negate need for frequent rate cases, which we view as costly and inefficient. However, we have a deep and experienced regulatory staff that can execute a regulatory strategy that includes frequent cases, if need be, in order to return returns at/or close to what the commissions have authorized. 
The status of the Mid-Atlantic Power Pathway, or MAPP project, can be seen on Slide 12. As we have previously reported, PJM provided us notice in August, on August 18, that the scheduled in-service date for the MAPP project has been delayed from 2015 to the 2019 to 2021 timeframe. This delay takes into account changes in demand response, generation retirements and additions, as well as a revised load forecast for the PJM region that is lower than forecast used in previous PJM studies. The exact revised in-service date will be evaluated as part of PJM's 2012 Regional Transmission Expansion Plan review process. Given the delay in the end service date, we have suspended most permitting, engineering and environmental studies. However, with PJM support, we plan to complete right-of-way and land acquisition in Dorchester County and some permitting and environmental activities at an estimated cost of approximately $5 million in each of 2011 and 2012. 
Slide 13 shows the forecasted annual capital expenditures for Power Delivery from 2012 through 2016. The forecast assumes a MAPP in-service date of 2020. Total expenditures over the 5-year period are estimated to be $5.6 billion, with 28% of the total expenditures spent on FERC-regulated transmission projects. 
At Pepco Energy Services, the profitable wind down of the Retail Energy Supply business is on track and we continue to make good progress in growing the Energy Services business. 
As shown on Slide 14, Pepco Energy Services signed $38 million of new energy efficiency contracts in the third quarter of 2011, including an $11 million energy performance contract with the Virginia Department of Military Affairs. This project consists of the installation of a number of energy conservation measures for 22 armories and military facilities. Construction began last month and is projected to be completed in 2013. 
Looking ahead to business development efforts. We have undertaken over the past 2 years our show in results, with the prospective project development pipeline of $511 million, up 14% since the beginning of the year. We believe the benefits of energy efficiency provide long-term growth opportunities for this business and we can grow Pepco Energy Services in a manner that is consistent with our lower risk profile. 
At this point, let me turn it over to Tony Kamerick. Tony?"

I'll recap our earnings, address our performance by operating segment, and discuss some topics of interest. We will then open the call to your questions. 
As shown on Slide 15, earnings from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2011 were $80 million, or $0.35 per share, compared to $21 million, or $0.09 per share, for the third quarter of last year. Excluding special items as identified in our earnings release and slides, earnings from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2010 would have been $116 million, or $0.52 per share. For the 9 months ended September 30, 2011, earnings from continuing operations were $237 million, or $1.05 per share, compared to $125 million, or $0.56 per share, for the 2010 period. Excluding special items for the 9 months ended September 30, 2010, earnings from continuing operations would have been $220 million, or $0.99 per share. 
Our results show Conectiv Energy's results as discontinued operations. For the 9 months ended September 30, 2011, income from discontinued operations net of taxes was $1 million. 
Before I discuss our results by segment, I want to address the cost of restoration in connection with Hurricane Irene, as summarized on Slide 16. As Joe discussed, the impact of Hurricane Irene on our service territories was severe. The total incremental cost of our restoration efforts is currently estimated to be $47 million. In the third quarter of 2011, $24 million of this cost was deferred as a regulatory asset and $6 million of this cost was expensed, resulting in an earnings decrease of $0.02 per share. The balance of the restoration cost was charged to capital. Since a large portion of the cost incurred relate to services provided by third parties, for which we have not yet been billed, costs have been estimated and are subject to change. We believe that all of the restoration costs incurred are recoverable. Recovery of the expenses incurred in excess of the storm restoration expenses currently embedded in base rates will be pursued during the current cycle of distribution rate cases. 
A summary of the drivers of our financial results can be found on Slides 17 and 18. For the third quarter of 2011, Power Delivery earnings were $0.29 per share compared to $0.41 per share for the third quarter of 2010 excluding special items. By far, the largest driver of the reduction in earnings quarter-over-quarter was the higher operation and maintenance spending, which decreased earnings by $0.11 per share. The increase in O&M was largely due to higher reliability and preventive maintenance cost, as well as the impact of Hurricane Irene as, I just discussed. Lower weather-related sales versus the prior year decreased quarterly earnings by $0.01 per share. Cooling degree days decreased by 6% quarter-over-quarter. The weather for the quarter versus normal weather increased earnings by $0.02 per share. Keep in mind that our distribution revenue in Maryland and the District of Columbia, which represents approximately 2/3 of total distribution revenue, is decoupled from consumption. Year-to-date, Power Delivery earnings were $0.82 per share in 2011 compared to $0.79 per share for the 9-months ended September 2010, excluding special items. Higher distribution and transmission revenue due to higher rates, higher default electricity supply margins and favorable income tax adjustments drove the increase in earnings. The largest offsetting factor was higher operation and maintenance expense, which decreased earnings by $0.22 per share. As in the quarter, reliability and preventive maintenance spending and hurricane restoration costs drove the higher operation and maintenance expense. 
At our Analyst Conference in April, we've provided a forecast of 2011 Power Delivery O&M expense of $818 million. During the second quarter earnings call, we revised that estimate to $850 million. We now expect Power Delivery O&M will be approximately $897 million with reliability initiatives, system restoration activities and customer communications driving a significant portion of the increase. However, note that approximately $18 million of this expense will be offset by lower corporate costs. This level of O&M spending is contemplated in our earnings guidance range. 
Looking ahead to 2012, we anticipate O&M spending will be in line with our current projections for 2011 excluding major storm costs, which are about $16 million year-to-date. Pepco Energy Services' third quarter earnings were $0.04 per share compared to $0.03 per share for the 2010 quarter. The increase in earnings for the quarter was due to higher Energy Services revenue partially offset by lower retail electricity sales volumes resulting from the ongoing wind down of the Retail Energy Supply business and mark-to market losses on derivative contracts. Year-to-date, earnings were $0.12 per share compared to $0.14 per share for the 9 months ended September 2010. The decrease in earnings due to lower retail electricity sales volume and mark-to-market losses on derivative contracts was partially offset by higher Energy Services revenue and lower credit-related costs. Note that the third quarter includes $3 million of net mark-to-market losses compared to $1 million of net mark-to-market gains for the 2010 quarter. For the 9 months ended September 30, 2011, mark-to-market losses were $7 million as compared to losses of $1 million in the 2010 period. 
In our other non-regulated segment, third quarter earnings were $0.02 per share compared to $0.04 per share in the 2010 quarter. The decrease in earnings was largely due to the impact of a tax law change in the District of Columbia, which I will discuss in more detail shortly. Year-to-date earnings were $0.13 per share compared to $0.09 per share for the 2010 period. The increase in earnings was primarily due to a tax benefit resulting from the settlement with the IRS for prior tax years, which occurred in the second quarter of 2011. 
In our corporate and other segment, which is mainly unallocated corporate costs, earnings declined by $0.04 per share quarter-over-quarter excluding special items, primarily due to the effect of favorable income tax adjustments in the 2010 quarter. For the year-to-date periods, earnings improved by $0.01 per share in 2011 compared to the prior year excluding special items. The earnings improvement resulted primarily from lower interest expense in the 2011 period. The effect of favorable income tax adjustments in the 2010 period was a partially offsetting factor. 
Turning back to tax law change I referenced earlier. On June 14, the Council of the District of Columbia approved the Fiscal Year 2012 Budget Support Act of 2011. The Act includes a unitary tax provision under which all commonly controlled subsidiaries of Pepco holdings will be included in the District of Columbia income tax filing. This new reporting method became law on September 14 and is effective for tax years beginning on or after December 31, 2010. The effects of the tax law change lowered Pepco Holdings earnings by $5 million after-tax in the third quarter of 2011. This impact is comprised of additional state income tax expense of $2 million, which impacts all lines of business. In addition, we recalculated the equity investment and certain cross-border energy leases as a result of modified state tax cash flow assumptions, which resulted in a $3 million after-tax charge. 
Turning to our earnings guidance, as seen on Slide 19. They are narrowing our 2011 earnings guidance range to $1.15 to $1.25 per share from $1.10 to $1.25 per share. The guidance range excludes the results of discontinued operation and assumes normal weather conditions for the remainder of the year. The range excludes the net mark-to-market effects of economic hedging activities associated with the Retail Energy Supply business of Pepco Energy Services and also excludes the impact of the tax law change in the District of Columbia that I just discussed. 
Now let me turn it back to Joe Rigby, for some closing remarks."

Before we open the call to your questions, I'd like to offer my perspective on where we stand. 
2011 has been a year of significant challenge and significant progress, but we are not yet satisfied with the status of reliability or the timing of MAPP. We are pleased with our strategy, our progress on the Smart Grid and the improvements we have made in reliability and storm restoration. To be sure, we have spent a considerable amount of O&M and capital, making necessary improvements, which will place us in good stead with our customers and regulators. We've been able to accommodate this level of expenditures and still plan to deliver earnings within our earnings guidance range. Tony mentioned we will continue to spend a comparable level of O&M for 2012 excluding major storms to improve reliability and customer service. We will file rate cases to recover these costs and to earn a return on our rate base growth. We believe every dollar we spend is prudent, and should therefore be recovered. We will continue to aggressively pursue the reduction of regulatory lag, and I am confident we will create value for our customers and investors. And as you think about our future, I want to remind you that we are committed to the dividend, as it is an important component to our value proposition. 
And with that, we'd like to open the call to your questions."

So maybe just give us a feel of where we are in that trajectory particularly with a number of reliability proceeding still ongoing. Is this still an upward trajectory?

And one of the things that we wanted to do was to try to get as much of this work on as fast as we could because of this -- the direct impact that has ultimately on our regulatory outcomes. So what we're doing particularly, let's say, for example, in the State of Maryland is we're effectively putting a 4-year Tree Trimming cycle into a 2 calendar year period of '11 and '12. And that's why you've seen this kind of ramp-up, for example. Our best view right now is -- and we want to try to be as helpful to all of you as we can. Because we look at 2012 being pretty similar to where we think we're going to end up in '11, I don't -- I wouldn't want to hazard a guess necessarily that it's going to go down. It could, but I think that part of what is all going to play into this is the -- are the evolving reliability standards that we're going to size our spend to make sure that we're meeting those standards.

Earnings from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2011 were $80 million compared to $21 million for the third quarter of 2010. Excluding special items for the 2010 quarter, earnings would have been $116 million. Our operating results reflect continued progress on executing our strategic plan, including our efforts to improve system reliability and customer service. Our results for both 2011 and 2010 quarters reflect Conectiv Energy's results as discontinued operations. Tony will discuss the financial results on our operating segment performance in more detail but first, I'd like to address some topics of interest. 
Improving system reliability remains a top priority for our company. As shown on Slide 3, we continue to make good progress in advancing infrastructure improvements and performance system maintenance focused primarily in the Pepco region that will reduce power outages and improve service for our customers. Since launching of our Reliability Enhancement Plan last fall for Pepco, we have trimmed trees along more than 2,600 miles of power lines, replaced or upgraded more than 230 miles of underground cable, and added more than 125 automated switches that will reroute power more effectively during storms. Our Reliability Enhancement Plan is on track and we are beginning to see positive trends in the operating performance of our electric system as is demonstrated by improved outage frequency and outage duration statistics for Pepco. 
In addition to our efforts to improve system reliability, we have made several enhancements to our emergency restoration process that will improve customer communications during major storms, such as increasing our call center staff and phone system capability, conducting more frequent customer outreach and expanding the use of mobile applications for outage information and reporting. 
Turning to Slide 4, our reliability improvement efforts were tested with the arrival of Hurricane Irene in late August. The high winds and driving rains caused significant damage to the electric system throughout our service territories. Approximately 445,000 of our customers were without power at the peak of the storm, or about 25% of our electric customers. About half of the outages occurred in the Pepco service territory. 98% of the customers were restored in a little over 2 days after the storm seized. After restoration was complete, a survey showed that customers gave Pepco good marks on its handling of storm preparedness, restoration and communications. Tony will discuss the cost of our restoration efforts and the recovery of those costs later on this call. 
As we are making progress in advancing our Reliability Enhancement Plan, we also are continuing to dialogue with our regulators regarding system reliability and standards. 
Turning to Slide 5, we are awaiting the decision in the Maryland proceeding initiated in August 2010 to investigate the reliability of Pepco's distribution system. Certain parties to this case have recommended the imposition of a variety of sanctions and various reporting requirements. As I have stated, we are committed to improving the reliability of Pepco's electric service. However, while we cannot predict the outcome of the case, we will oppose the sanctions requested by the other parties, which we believe are not supported by the record. 
Also in Maryland, as seen on Slide 6, the rulemaking to establish reliability standards applicable to all electric utilities in the state continues to move forward. The proceeding involves All Maryland electric utilities that Commissioned staff, People's Council and other interested parties. The working group met weekly through October, and the commissioned staff issued a report with proposed draft standards on October 27. The report proposes benchmarks for service interruptions, downed wire response, customer communications, vegetation management and equipment inspection, among other activities. We are in the process of reviewing the proposed standards and we'll file our comments to the commission on November 16. We will have an opportunity to discuss our comments in front of the commission during rulemaking sessions that are scheduled for December 8th and 9th. According to the legislation, passed by the Maryland General Assembly, regulations must be adopted by July 1, 2012. We are participants in the process and support the development of objective, fair standards with reasonable penalties and the timely recovery of the investments necessary to meet these standards. In the District of Columbia, the commission adopted new reliability standards in July. The new rules require improvement in reliability performance on an annual basis beginning in 2013 and continuing through 2020. Again, we support objective fair standards. What we believe the regulations in their current form are flawed because they proposed an inconsistent method to calculate reliability. Furthermore, we currently believe the standards as adopted may not be realistically achievable at an acceptable cost over the longer term. As a result, we filed an application for reconsideration of the regulations with the commission on August 8, which is still pending. Our application requested the commission to convene a working group process that considers fully all the relevant issues and allows the commission to adopt reliability benchmarks that will require a meaningful level of reliability, yet also be reasonably achievable through the use of cost-effective reliability-enhancement measures. 
We continue to make progress on our Blueprint for the Future initiatives. The Status by Jurisdiction can be seen on Slide 7. The advanced meter installation and activation for electric customers is largely complete in Delaware. The initial functionality includes remote meter reading, the availability of account, specific energy use of information and outage detection. In the District of Columbia, about 60% of the advanced meters have been installed and our goal is to complete the installations by early next year. 
Meter activation is underway and is expected to be completed by mid-2012. In June, we began installing advanced meters for Pepco's customers in Maryland, and we expect to complete installations by the end of 2012. The commissions in Delaware, the District of Columbia and Maryland have approved the establishment of regulatory assets to defer AMI-related costs and the accrual of return at the authorized rates of return on the deferred cost, until such time as the cost and accrued returns can be incorporated in customer rates. 
The AMI outage detection functionality proved useful during Hurricane Irene restoration efforts. We were able to ping the AMI meters in Delaware and get data that allowed us to clear outage orders, thereby eliminating the need to dispatch crews to several hundred potential outage locations. Proposals are pending in Delaware and the District of Columbia that request permission to implement dynamic pricing plans for customers. Under the proposed Critical Peak Rebate structure, the plans would reward Standard Offer Service customers for lowering their energy use during critical peak periods when energy demand and the cost of supply and electricity are higher. Decisions on the proposals are expected by year end. This Critical Peak Rebate structure has been approved in concept in Maryland, and the tariff details are currently being developed by a working group. Subject to approval, and phase-in implementation for residential customers in Delaware, the District of Columbia, Pepco's Maryland customers is targeted to begin in 2012 and continuing to 2013. 
Turning to our regulatory filings as seen on Slide 8. Atlantic City Electric filed a rate case in New Jersey on August 5th, requesting an annual revenue increase of $59 million based on a return on equity of 10.75%. Of the requested $59 million increase, approximately $5 million relates to an increase in sales and used taxes and, therefore, does not impact earnings. A prehearing conference was held on October 19th and a procedural schedule should be issued shortly. 
On October 18, Atlantic City Electric filed a separate request in New Jersey for the approval of a continuance and expansion of the recently completed infrastructure investment program. While helping to stimulate the New Jersey economy, the program reduces regulatory lag by allowing recovery on non-revenue-generating infrastructure investment capital expenditures through a special rate outside of the normal rate recovery mechanism of the base rate filing. Under the proposed expansion of the program, Atlantic City Electric would recover reliability-related capital expenditures of approximately $69 million in 2012, $94 million in 2013 and $81 million in 2014. 
As shown on Slide 9, the Phase 2 proceeding of Delmarva Power's electric distribution base rate case in Maryland concluded on October 17. In the Phase 2 proceeding, a working group including Delmarva Power, Commission staff and the People's Council examined the need for, and design of, regulatory lag reduction mechanisms. Although consensus was reached among the parties of the working group, the proceeding did provide an opportunity to further educate the parties on the cause and effects of regulatory lag and to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of various regulatory lag reduction mechanisms. Delmarva Power is preparing to file a rate case in Maryland in December in order to continue its efforts to close the gap between its earned and authorized return. We plan to again request commission approval of regulatory lag reduction mechanisms in this case. 
Turning to Pepco's base rate case in the District of Columbia, as seen on Slide 10. The procedural schedule has been set for the case with hearings beginning on January 30 and a decision expected in the second quarter of 2012. The filing seeks approval of an annual rate increase of approximately $42 million based on a 10.75% return on equity. Recall that of the requested $42 million increase, approximately $10 million relates to AMI-related cost. Since we have generally been earning a return on these costs since they were incurred, recovery of the cost through rates has a positive cash flow impact but does not affect earnings. Like Delmarva Power's filing in Maryland, this filing includes a comprehensive discussion on the topic of regulatory lag and its negative effects. The filing request approval of a reliability investment recovery mechanism, which provides full and timely recovery of future capital investments related to distribution system reliability. The filing also requests that the commission adapt fully forecasted test periods. 
We remain on track with our preparations to file 3 additional rate cases in December, as shown on Slide 11. As I've noted, Delmarva Power plans to file a case in Maryland, as well as an electric case in Delaware. Pepco also plans to file a case in Maryland. Note that the filing schedule is tentative. In each of our jurisdictions, we plan to include in our rate case a comprehensive discussion on the topic of regulatory lag, as well as proposals to minimize lag. 
As I've noted previously, reducing regulatory lag is a significant focus. Our preference is to achieve this by adopting mechanisms that negate need for frequent rate cases, which we view as costly and inefficient. However, we have a deep and experienced regulatory staff that can execute a regulatory strategy that includes frequent cases, if need be, in order to return returns at/or close to what the commissions have authorized. 
The status of the Mid-Atlantic Power Pathway, or MAPP project, can be seen on Slide 12. As we have previously reported, PJM provided us notice in August, on August 18, that the scheduled in-service date for the MAPP project has been delayed from 2015 to the 2019 to 2021 timeframe. This delay takes into account changes in demand response, generation retirements and additions, as well as a revised load forecast for the PJM region that is lower than forecast used in previous PJM studies. The exact revised in-service date will be evaluated as part of PJM's 2012 Regional Transmission Expansion Plan review process. Given the delay in the end service date, we have suspended most permitting, engineering and environmental studies. However, with PJM support, we plan to complete right-of-way and land acquisition in Dorchester County and some permitting and environmental activities at an estimated cost of approximately $5 million in each of 2011 and 2012. 
Slide 13 shows the forecasted annual capital expenditures for Power Delivery from 2012 through 2016. The forecast assumes a MAPP in-service date of 2020. Total expenditures over the 5-year period are estimated to be $5.6 billion, with 28% of the total expenditures spent on FERC-regulated transmission projects. 
At Pepco Energy Services, the profitable wind down of the Retail Energy Supply business is on track and we continue to make good progress in growing the Energy Services business. 
As shown on Slide 14, Pepco Energy Services signed $38 million of new energy efficiency contracts in the third quarter of 2011, including an $11 million energy performance contract with the Virginia Department of Military Affairs. This project consists of the installation of a number of energy conservation measures for 22 armories and military facilities. Construction began last month and is projected to be completed in 2013. 
Looking ahead to business development efforts. We have undertaken over the past 2 years our show in results, with the prospective project development pipeline of $511 million, up 14% since the beginning of the year. We believe the benefits of energy efficiency provide long-term growth opportunities for this business and we can grow Pepco Energy Services in a manner that is consistent with our lower risk profile. 
At this point, let me turn it over to Tony Kamerick. Tony?"

I'll recap our earnings, address our performance by operating segment, and discuss some topics of interest. We will then open the call to your questions. 
As shown on Slide 15, earnings from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2011 were $80 million, or $0.35 per share, compared to $21 million, or $0.09 per share, for the third quarter of last year. Excluding special items as identified in our earnings release and slides, earnings from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2010 would have been $116 million, or $0.52 per share. For the 9 months ended September 30, 2011, earnings from continuing operations were $237 million, or $1.05 per share, compared to $125 million, or $0.56 per share, for the 2010 period. Excluding special items for the 9 months ended September 30, 2010, earnings from continuing operations would have been $220 million, or $0.99 per share. 
Our results show Conectiv Energy's results as discontinued operations. For the 9 months ended September 30, 2011, income from discontinued operations net of taxes was $1 million. 
Before I discuss our results by segment, I want to address the cost of restoration in connection with Hurricane Irene, as summarized on Slide 16. As Joe discussed, the impact of Hurricane Irene on our service territories was severe. The total incremental cost of our restoration efforts is currently estimated to be $47 million. In the third quarter of 2011, $24 million of this cost was deferred as a regulatory asset and $6 million of this cost was expensed, resulting in an earnings decrease of $0.02 per share. The balance of the restoration cost was charged to capital. Since a large portion of the cost incurred relate to services provided by third parties, for which we have not yet been billed, costs have been estimated and are subject to change. We believe that all of the restoration costs incurred are recoverable. Recovery of the expenses incurred in excess of the storm restoration expenses currently embedded in base rates will be pursued during the current cycle of distribution rate cases. 
A summary of the drivers of our financial results can be found on Slides 17 and 18. For the third quarter of 2011, Power Delivery earnings were $0.29 per share compared to $0.41 per share for the third quarter of 2010 excluding special items. By far, the largest driver of the reduction in earnings quarter-over-quarter was the higher operation and maintenance spending, which decreased earnings by $0.11 per share. The increase in O&M was largely due to higher reliability and preventive maintenance costs, as well as the impact of Hurricane Irene as, I just discussed. Lower weather-related sales versus the prior year decreased quarterly earnings by $0.01 per share. Cooling degree days decreased by 6% quarter-over-quarter. The weather for the quarter versus normal weather increased earnings by $0.02 per share. Keep in mind that our distribution revenue in Maryland and the District of Columbia, which represents approximately 2/3 of total distribution revenue, is decoupled from consumption. Year-to-date, Power Delivery earnings were $0.82 per share in 2011 compared to $0.79 per share for the 9-months ended September 2010, excluding special items. Higher distribution and transmission revenue due to higher rates, higher default electricity supply margins and favorable income tax adjustments drove the increase in earnings. The largest offsetting factor was higher operation and maintenance expense, which decreased earnings by $0.22 per share. As in the quarter, reliability and preventive maintenance spending and hurricane restoration costs drove the higher operation and maintenance expense. 
At our Analyst Conference in April, we've provided a forecast of 2011 Power Delivery O&M expense of $818 million. During the second quarter earnings call, we revised that estimate to $850 million. We now expect Power Delivery O&M will be approximately $897 million with reliability initiatives, system restoration activities and customer communications driving a significant portion of the increase. However, note that approximately $18 million of this expense will be offset by lower corporate costs. This level of O&M spending is contemplated in our earnings guidance range. 
Looking ahead to 2012, we anticipate O&M spending will be in line with our current projections for 2011 excluding major storm costs, which are about $16 million year-to-date. Pepco Energy Services' third quarter earnings were $0.04 per share compared to $0.03 per share for the 2010 quarter. The increase in earnings for the quarter was due to higher Energy Services revenue partially offset by lower retail electricity sales volumes resulting from the ongoing wind down of the Retail Energy Supply business and mark-to market losses on derivative contracts. Year-to-date, earnings were $0.12 per share compared to $0.14 per share for the 9 months ended September 2010. The decrease in earnings due to lower retail electricity sales volume and mark-to-market losses on derivative contracts was partially offset by higher Energy Services revenue and lower credit-related costs. Note that the third quarter includes $3 million of net mark-to-market losses compared to $1 million of net mark-to-market gains for the 2010 quarter. For the 9 months ended September 30, 2011, mark-to-market losses were $7 million as compared to losses of $1 million in the 2010 period. 
In our other non-regulated segment, third quarter earnings were $0.02 per share compared to $0.04 per share in the 2010 quarter. The decrease in earnings was largely due to the impact of a tax law change in the District of Columbia, which I will discuss in more detail shortly. Year-to-date earnings were $0.13 per share compared to $0.09 per share for the 2010 period. The increase in earnings was primarily due to a tax benefit resulting from the settlement with the IRS for prior tax years, which occurred in the second quarter of 2011. 
In our corporate and other segment, which is mainly unallocated corporate costs, earnings declined by $0.04 per share quarter-over-quarter excluding special items, primarily due to the effect of favorable income tax adjustments in the 2010 quarter. For the year-to-date periods, earnings improved by $0.01 per share in 2011 compared to the prior year excluding special items. The earnings improvement resulted primarily from lower interest expense in the 2011 period. The effect of favorable income tax adjustments in the 2010 period was a partially offsetting factor. 
Turning back to tax law change I referenced earlier. On June 14, the Council of the District of Columbia approved the Fiscal Year 2012 Budget Support Act of 2011. The Act includes a unitary tax provision under which all commonly controlled subsidiaries of Pepco holdings will be included in the District of Columbia income tax filing. This new reporting method became law on September 14 and is effective for tax years beginning on or after December 31, 2010. The effects of the tax law change lowered Pepco Holdings earnings by $5 million after-tax in the third quarter of 2011. This impact is comprised of additional state income tax expense of $2 million, which impacts all lines of business. In addition, we recalculated the equity investment and certain cross-border energy leases as a result of modified state tax cash flow assumptions, which resulted in a $3 million after-tax charge. 
Turning to our earnings guidance, as seen on Slide 19. They are narrowing our 2011 earnings guidance range to $1.15 to $1.25 per share from $1.10 to $1.25 per share. The guidance range excludes the results of discontinued operation and assumes normal weather conditions for the remainder of the year. The range excludes the net mark-to-market effects of economic hedging activities associated with the Retail Energy Supply business of Pepco Energy Services and also excludes the impact of the tax law change in the District of Columbia that I just discussed. 
Now let me turn it back to Joe Rigby, for some closing remarks."

Before we open the call to your questions, I'd like to offer my perspective on where we stand. 
2011 has been a year of significant challenge and significant progress, but we are not yet satisfied with the status of reliability or the timing of MAPP. We are pleased with our strategy, our progress on the Smart Grid and the improvements we have made in reliability and storm restoration. To be sure, we have spent a considerable amount of O&M and capital, making necessary improvements, which will place us in good stead with our customers and regulators. We've been able to accommodate this level of expenditures and still plan to deliver earnings within our earnings guidance range. Tony mentioned we will continue to spend a comparable level of O&M in 2012 excluding major storms to improve reliability and customer service. We will file rate cases to recover these costs and to earn a return on our rate base growth. We believe every dollar we spend is prudent, and should therefore be recovered. We will continue to aggressively pursue the reduction of regulatory lag, and I am confident we will create value for our customers and investors. And as you think about our future, I want to remind you that we are committed to the dividend, as it is an important component to our value proposition.

So while I would have certainly been happy if we had come to a consensus that put into place the mechanism, I wasn't necessarily surprised that we had the outcome we did. But in the alternative, we're going to just file rate cases because these are all prudent expenditures and it's very clear that in terms of what our customers expect, we need to make these investments.

We're also thinking, Ali, that if we can't cut into it more effectively, we may have to advance our rate cases to every 9 months instead of every 12 months. So we're looking at all possible avenues."

Earnings from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2011 were $80 million compared to $21 million for the third quarter of 2010. Excluding special items for the 2010 quarter, earnings would have been $116 million. Our operating results reflect continued progress on executing our strategic plan, including our efforts to improve system reliability and customer service. Our results for both 2011 and 2010 quarters reflect Conectiv Energy's results as discontinued operations. Tony will discuss the financial results on our operating segment performance in more detail but first, I'd like to address some topics of interest. 
Improving system reliability remains a top priority for our company. As shown on Slide 3, we continue to make good progress in advancing infrastructure improvements and performance system maintenance focused primarily in the Pepco region that will reduce power outages and improve service for our customers. Since launching of our Reliability Enhancement Plan last fall for Pepco, we have trimmed trees along more than 2,600 miles of power lines, replaced or upgraded more than 230 miles of underground cable, and added more than 125 automated switches that will reroute power more effectively during storms. Our Reliability Enhancement Plan is on track and we are beginning to see positive trends in the operating performance of our electric system as is demonstrated by improved outage frequency and outage duration statistics for Pepco. 
In addition to our efforts to improve system reliability, we have made several enhancements to our emergency restoration process that will improve customer communications during major storms, such as increasing our call center staff and phone system capability, conducting more frequent customer outreach and expanding the use of mobile applications for outage information and reporting. 
Turning to Slide 4, our reliability improvement efforts were tested with the arrival of Hurricane Irene in late August. The high winds and driving rains caused significant damage to the electric system throughout our service territories. Approximately 445,000 of our customers were without power at the peak of the storm, or about 25% of our electric customers. About half of the outages occurred in the Pepco service territory. 98% of the customers were restored in a little over 2 days after the storm seized. After restoration was complete, a survey showed that customers gave Pepco good marks on its handling of storm preparedness, restoration and communications. Tony will discuss the cost of our restoration efforts and the recovery of those costs later on this call. 
As we are making progress in advancing our Reliability Enhancement Plan, we also are continuing to dialogue with our regulators regarding system reliability and standards. 
Turning to Slide 5, we are awaiting the decision in the Maryland proceeding initiated in August 2010 to investigate the reliability of Pepco's distribution system. Certain parties to this case have recommended the imposition of a variety of sanctions and various reporting requirements. As I have stated, we are committed to improving the reliability of Pepco's electric service. However, while we cannot predict the outcome of the case, we will oppose the sanctions requested by the other parties, which we believe are not supported by the record. 
Also in Maryland, as seen on Slide 6, the rulemaking to establish reliability standards applicable to all electric utilities in the state continues to move forward. The proceeding involves All Maryland electric utilities that Commissioned staff, People's Council and other interested parties. The working group met weekly through October, and the commissioned staff issued a report with proposed draft standards on October 27. The report proposes benchmarks for service interruptions, downed wire response, customer communications, vegetation management and equipment inspection, among other activities. We are in the process of reviewing the proposed standards and we'll file our comments to the commission on November 16. We will have an opportunity to discuss our comments in front of the commission during rulemaking sessions that are scheduled for December 8th and 9th. According to the legislation, passed by the Maryland General Assembly, regulations must be adopted by July 1, 2012. We are participants in the process and support the development of objective, fair standards with reasonable penalties and the timely recovery of the investments necessary to meet these standards. In the District of Columbia, the commission adopted new reliability standards in July. The new rules require improvement in reliability performance on an annual basis beginning in 2013 and continuing through 2020. Again, we support objective fair standards. What we believe the regulations in their current form are flawed because they proposed an inconsistent method to calculate reliability. Furthermore, we currently believe the standards as adopted may not be realistically achievable at an acceptable cost over the longer term. As a result, we filed an application for reconsideration of the regulations with the commission on August 8, which is still pending. Our application requested the commission to convene a working group process that considers fully all the relevant issues and allows the commission to adopt reliability benchmarks that will require a meaningful level of reliability, yet also be reasonably achievable through the use of cost-effective reliability-enhancement measures. 
We continue to make progress on our Blueprint for the Future initiatives. The Status by Jurisdiction can be seen on Slide 7. The advanced meter installation and activation for electric customers is largely complete in Delaware. The initial functionality includes remote meter reading, the availability of account, specific energy use of information and outage detection. In the District of Columbia, about 60% of the advanced meters have been installed and our goal is to complete the installations by early next year. 
Meter activation is underway and is expected to be completed by mid-2012. In June, we began installing advanced meters for Pepco's customers in Maryland, and we expect to complete installations by the end of 2012. The commissions in Delaware, the District of Columbia and Maryland have approved the establishment of regulatory assets to defer AMI-related costs and the accrual of return at the authorized rates of return on the deferred cost, until such time as the cost and accrued returns can be incorporated in customer rates. 
The AMI outage detection functionality proved useful during Hurricane Irene restoration efforts. We were able to ping the AMI meters in Delaware and get data that allowed us to clear outage orders, thereby eliminating the need to dispatch crews to several hundred potential outage locations. Proposals are pending in Delaware and the District of Columbia that request permission to implement dynamic pricing plans for customers. Under the proposed Critical Peak Rebate structure, the plans would reward Standard Offer Service customers for lowering their energy use during critical peak periods when energy demand and the cost of supply and electricity are higher. Decisions on the proposals are expected by year end. This Critical Peak Rebate structure has been approved in concept in Maryland, and the tariff details are currently being developed by a working group. Subject to approval, and phase-in implementation for residential customers in Delaware, the District of Columbia, Pepco's Maryland customers is targeted to begin in 2012 and continuing to 2013. 
Turning to our regulatory filings as seen on Slide 8. Atlantic City Electric filed a rate case in New Jersey on August 5th, requesting an annual revenue increase of $59 million based on a return on equity of 10.75%. Of the requested $59 million increase, approximately $5 million relates to an increase in sales and used taxes and, therefore, does not impact earnings. A prehearing conference was held on October 19th and a procedural schedule should be issued shortly. 
On October 18, Atlantic City Electric filed a separate request in New Jersey for the approval of a continuance and expansion of the recently completed infrastructure investment program. While helping to stimulate the New Jersey economy, the program reduces regulatory lag by allowing recovery on non-revenue-generating infrastructure investment capital expenditures through a special rate outside of the normal rate recovery mechanism of the base rate filing. Under the proposed expansion of the program, Atlantic City Electric would recover reliability-related capital expenditures of approximately $69 million in 2012, $94 million in 2013 and $81 million in 2014. 
As shown on Slide 9, the Phase 2 proceeding of Delmarva Power's electric distribution base rate case in Maryland concluded on October 17. In the Phase 2 proceeding, a working group including Delmarva Power, Commission staff and the People's Council examined the need for, and design of, regulatory lag reduction mechanisms. Although consensus was reached among the parties of the working group, the proceeding did provide an opportunity to further educate the parties on the cause and effects of regulatory lag and to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of various regulatory lag reduction mechanisms. Delmarva Power is preparing to file a rate case in Maryland in December in order to continue its efforts to close the gap between its earned and authorized return. We plan to again request commission approval of regulatory lag reduction mechanisms in this case. 
Turning to Pepco's base rate case in the District of Columbia, as seen on Slide 10. The procedural schedule has been set for the case with hearings beginning on January 30 and a decision expected in the second quarter of 2012. The filing seeks approval of an annual rate increase of approximately $42 million based on a 10.75% return on equity. Recall that of the requested $42 million increase, approximately $10 million relates to AMI-related cost. Since we have generally been earning a return on these costs since they were incurred, recovery of the cost through rates has a positive cash flow impact but does not affect earnings. Like Delmarva Power's filing in Maryland, this filing includes a comprehensive discussion on the topic of regulatory lag and its negative effects. The filing request approval of a reliability investment recovery mechanism, which provides full and timely recovery of future capital investments related to distribution system reliability. The filing also requests that the commission adapt fully forecasted test periods. 
We remain on track with our preparations to file 3 additional rate cases in December, as shown on Slide 11. As I've noted, Delmarva Power plans to file a case in Maryland, as well as an electric case in Delaware. Pepco also plans to file a case in Maryland. Note that the filing schedule is tentative. In each of our jurisdictions, we plan to include in our rate case a comprehensive discussion on the topic of regulatory lag, as well as proposals to minimize lag. 
As I've noted previously, reducing regulatory lag is a significant focus. Our preference is to achieve this by adopting mechanisms that negate need for frequent rate cases, which we view as costly and inefficient. However, we have a deep and experienced regulatory staff that can execute a regulatory strategy that includes frequent cases, if need be, in order to return returns at/or close to what the commissions have authorized. 
The status of the Mid-Atlantic Power Pathway, or MAPP project, can be seen on Slide 12. As we have previously reported, PJM provided us notice in August, on August 18, that the scheduled in-service date for the MAPP project has been delayed from 2015 to the 2019 to 2021 timeframe. This delay takes into account changes in demand response, generation retirements and additions, as well as a revised load forecast for the PJM region that is lower than forecast used in previous PJM studies. The exact revised in-service date will be evaluated as part of PJM's 2012 Regional Transmission Expansion Plan review process. Given the delay in the end service date, we have suspended most permitting, engineering and environmental studies. However, with PJM support, we plan to complete right-of-way and land acquisition in Dorchester County and some permitting and environmental activities at an estimated cost of approximately $5 million in each of 2011 and 2012. 
Slide 13 shows the forecasted annual capital expenditures for Power Delivery from 2012 through 2016. The forecast assumes a MAPP in-service date of 2020. Total expenditures over the 5-year period are estimated to be $5.6 billion, with 28% of the total expenditures spent on FERC-regulated transmission projects. 
At Pepco Energy Services, the profitable wind down of the Retail Energy Supply business is on track and we continue to make good progress in growing the Energy Services business. 
As shown on Slide 14, Pepco Energy Services signed $38 million of new energy efficiency contracts in the third quarter of 2011, including an $11 million energy performance contract with the Virginia Department of Military Affairs. This project consists of the installation of a number of energy conservation measures for 22 armories and military facilities. Construction began last month and is projected to be completed in 2013. 
Looking ahead to business development efforts. We have undertaken over the past 2 years our show in results, with the prospective project development pipeline of $511 million, up 14% since the beginning of the year. We believe the benefits of energy efficiency provide long-term growth opportunities for this business and we can grow Pepco Energy Services in a manner that is consistent with our lower risk profile. 
At this point, let me turn it over to Tony Kamerick. Tony?"

I'll recap our earnings, address our performance by operating segment, and discuss some topics of interest. We will then open the call to your questions. 
As shown on Slide 15, earnings from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2011 were $80 million, or $0.35 per share, compared to $21 million, or $0.09 per share, for the third quarter of last year. Excluding special items as identified in our earnings release and slides, earnings from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2010 would have been $116 million, or $0.52 per share. For the 9 months ended September 30, 2011, earnings from continuing operations were $237 million, or $1.05 per share, compared to $125 million, or $0.56 per share, for the 2010 period. Excluding special items for the 9 months ended September 30, 2010, earnings from continuing operations would have been $220 million, or $0.99 per share. 
Our results show Conectiv Energy's results as discontinued operations. For the 9 months ended September 30, 2011, income from discontinued operations net of taxes was $1 million. 
Before I discuss our results by segment, I want to address the cost of restoration in connection with Hurricane Irene, as summarized on Slide 16. As Joe discussed, the impact of Hurricane Irene on our service territories was severe. The total incremental cost of our restoration efforts is currently estimated to be $47 million. In the third quarter of 2011, $24 million of this cost was deferred as a regulatory asset and $6 million of this cost was expensed, resulting in an earnings decrease of $0.02 per share. The balance of the restoration cost was charged to capital. Since a large portion of the cost incurred relate to services provided by third parties, for which we have not yet been billed, costs have been estimated and are subject to change. We believe that all of the restoration costs incurred are recoverable. Recovery of the expenses incurred in excess of the storm restoration expenses currently embedded in base rates will be pursued during the current cycle of distribution rate cases. 
A summary of the drivers of our financial results can be found on Slides 17 and 18. For the third quarter of 2011, Power Delivery earnings were $0.29 per share compared to $0.41 per share for the third quarter of 2010 excluding special items. By far, the largest driver of the reduction in earnings quarter-over-quarter was the higher operation and maintenance spending, which decreased earnings by $0.11 per share. The increase in O&M was largely due to higher reliability and preventive maintenance costs, as well as the impact of Hurricane Irene as, I just discussed. Lower weather-related sales versus the prior year decreased quarterly earnings by $0.01 per share. Cooling degree days decreased by 6% quarter-over-quarter. The weather for the quarter versus normal weather increased earnings by $0.02 per share. Keep in mind that our distribution revenue in Maryland and the District of Columbia, which represents approximately 2/3 of total distribution revenue, is decoupled from consumption. Year-to-date, Power Delivery earnings were $0.82 per share in 2011 compared to $0.79 per share for the 9-months ended September 2010, excluding special items. Higher distribution and transmission revenue due to higher rates, higher default electricity supply margins and favorable income tax adjustments drove the increase in earnings. The largest offsetting factor was higher operation and maintenance expense, which decreased earnings by $0.22 per share. As in the quarter, reliability and preventive maintenance spending and hurricane restoration costs drove the higher operation and maintenance expense. 
At our Analyst Conference in April, we've provided a forecast of 2011 Power Delivery O&M expense of $818 million. During the second quarter earnings call, we revised that estimate to $850 million. We now expect Power Delivery O&M will be approximately $897 million with reliability initiatives, system restoration activities and customer communications driving a significant portion of the increase. However, note that approximately $18 million of this expense will be offset by lower corporate costs. This level of O&M spending is contemplated in our earnings guidance range. 
Looking ahead to 2012, we anticipate O&M spending will be in line with our current projections for 2011 excluding major storm costs, which are about $16 million year-to-date. Pepco Energy Services' third quarter earnings were $0.04 per share compared to $0.03 per share for the 2010 quarter. The increase in earnings for the quarter was due to higher Energy Services revenue partially offset by lower retail electricity sales volumes resulting from the ongoing wind down of the Retail Energy Supply business and mark-to market losses on derivative contracts. Year-to-date, earnings were $0.12 per share compared to $0.14 per share for the 9 months ended September 2010. The decrease in earnings due to lower retail electricity sales volume and mark-to-market losses on derivative contracts was partially offset by higher Energy Services revenue and lower credit-related costs. Note that the third quarter includes $3 million of net mark-to-market losses compared to $1 million of net mark-to-market gains for the 2010 quarter. For the 9 months ended September 30, 2011, mark-to-market losses were $7 million as compared to losses of $1 million in the 2010 period. 
In our other non-regulated segment, third quarter earnings were $0.02 per share compared to $0.04 per share in the 2010 quarter. The decrease in earnings was largely due to the impact of a tax law change in the District of Columbia, which I will discuss in more detail shortly. Year-to-date earnings were $0.13 per share compared to $0.09 per share for the 2010 period. The increase in earnings was primarily due to a tax benefit resulting from the settlement with the IRS for prior tax years, which occurred in the second quarter of 2011. 
In our corporate and other segment, which is mainly unallocated corporate costs, earnings declined by $0.04 per share quarter-over-quarter excluding special items, primarily due to the effect of favorable income tax adjustments in the 2010 quarter. For the year-to-date periods, earnings improved by $0.01 per share in 2011 compared to the prior year excluding special items. The earnings improvement resulted primarily from lower interest expense in the 2011 period. The effect of favorable income tax adjustments in the 2010 period was a partially offsetting factor. 
Turning back to tax law change I referenced earlier. On June 14, the Council of the District of Columbia approved the Fiscal Year 2012 Budget Support Act of 2011. The Act includes a unitary tax provision under which all commonly controlled subsidiaries of Pepco holdings will be included in the District of Columbia income tax filing. This new reporting method became law on September 14 and is effective for tax years beginning on or after December 31, 2010. The effects of the tax law change lowered Pepco Holdings earnings by $5 million after-tax in the third quarter of 2011. This impact is comprised of additional state income tax expense of $2 million, which impacts all lines of business. In addition, we recalculated the equity investment and certain cross-border energy leases as a result of modified state tax cash flow assumptions, which resulted in a $3 million after-tax charge. 
Turning to our earnings guidance, as seen on Slide 19. They are narrowing our 2011 earnings guidance range to $1.15 to $1.25 per share from $1.10 to $1.25 per share. The guidance range excludes the results of discontinued operation and assumes normal weather conditions for the remainder of the year. The range excludes the net mark-to-market effects of economic hedging activities associated with the Retail Energy Supply business of Pepco Energy Services and also excludes the impact of the tax law change in the District of Columbia that I just discussed. 
Now let me turn it back to Joe Rigby, for some closing remarks."

Before we open the call to your questions, I'd like to offer my perspective on where we stand. 
2011 has been a year of significant challenge and significant progress, but we are not yet satisfied with the status of reliability or the timing of MAPP. We are pleased with our strategy, our progress on the Smart Grid and the improvements we have made in reliability and storm restoration. To be sure, we have spent a considerable amount of O&M and capital, making necessary improvements, which will place us in good stead with our customers and regulators. We've been able to accommodate this level of expenditures and still plan to deliver earnings within our earnings guidance range. Tony mentioned we will continue to spend a comparable level of O&M in 2012 excluding major storms to improve reliability and customer service. We will file rate cases to recover these costs and to earn a return on our rate base growth. We believe every dollar we spend is prudent, and should therefore be recovered. We will continue to aggressively pursue the reduction of regulatory lag, and I am confident we will create value for our customers and investors. And as you think about our future, I want to remind you that we are committed to the dividend, as it is an important component to our value proposition.
