You can see from our press release that we turned in solid performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. This performance reflects SAIC's focus on growth in the most attractive and profitable elements of our portfolio and commitment to build our pipeline for future growth. During the quarter, we delivered double-digit growth in operating income and earnings per share. Despite market challenges, we expanded our pipeline of opportunities, and we continued to grow the value of submitted proposals and contract backlog, each increasing at double-digit rates compared with the same quarter a year ago.
For the call today, I'll cover market conditions, highlight recent business development results, talk about acquisitions and divestitures, discuss our CityTime contract, touch upon our community outreach program and share special recognition we received. Then Mark will provide the financial details.
As we have discussed with you before, the government solutions and services market witnessed a lengthening of the acquisition cycle in government fiscal 2010. And as we expected, this longer cycle persists in government fiscal 2011. We are encouraged by the passage of the federal FY '11 budget and expect that will improve the funding environment on a short-term basis. However, we also expect the longer acquisition cycle to continue in the government fiscal 2012.  It is also important to note that announced changes in the Pentagon leadership will likely lead to some changes in spending priorities.  These market conditions continue to make the timing of new awards difficult to project, but we have responded to these conditions by increasingly focusing resources on aggressively pursuing new business.
Regarding our contract awards, bookings totaled $3.6 billion in the first quarter and produced a net book-to-bill ratio of 1.3. This ratio reflects our key win of the 10-year NASA Integrated Communications Services contract, which added $1.2 billion to our bookings. This is an important win for maintaining our base activity in supporting this critical mission for our NASA customers. We ended the quarter with $18 billion in total backlog, of which $5 billion was funded. As compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2011, total backlog increased by 14%. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter of achieving a book-to-bill ratio at or above 1.0, validating our strategy to be more aggressive in our business development area.
A central factor to growing our bookings in backlog was maintaining high win rates. In Q1, we achieved a 72% total dollar win rate on business opportunities pursued and awarded. This win rate is higher than a year ago, despite a more aggressive pace of submitted and increasing competition. Additionally, we continued our trend of increasing submitted proposals awaiting decision, now at a new peak of $29 billion including nearly $20 billion in ID/IQ bids and the remainder in definite-delivery bids. This is over $9 billion higher than Q4 and over $11 billion higher than Q1 a year ago, which provides a strong basis for continued growth in backlog in fiscal year 12.
Our focus On winning larger opportunities continues to yield excellent results. We won 12 opportunities valued at more than $100 million each in the first quarter of FY '12. This is a 100% increase compared with Q1 of FY '11, when we won just 6 opportunities valued at more than $100 million.  As presented in our press release today, there were many significant awards this quarter. At this point let we make -- take a moment to highlight some specific business development achievements. 
The NASA Integrated Communications Services contract provides managerial and technical expertise in support of the Office of the Chief Information Officer for corporate admission communications needs at NASA, including local area network management at all NASA centers. This is the first time that NASA has awarded a follow-on contract for this award for this work to the incumbent contractor. The competition for this very large contract was intense, and yet it was awarded to SAIC without contest by any other competitors, a clear indication of the exceptional value proposed in SAIC's offer.
Also during this quarter, SAIC continued to generate significant awards from our differentiated offerings and established year-over-year revenue growth in our intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance business. Our delivery of quick-reaction capabilities in providing persistent surveillance, processing, exploitation and dissemination solutions in a very demanding military and intelligence environment is generating increased demand. As examples during this past quarter, we were awarded $76 million of additional ceiling on the grid's ID/IQ contract with the Army Geospatial Center, primarily focused on the Buckeye collection system.  Also during this quarter, we were selected to receive a $279 million non-ID/IQ airborne ISR award by the U.S. Army Engineering Research and Development Center. This award is in final negotiations for work to be completed by September 2012. 
In addition to our NASA and ISR wins, we are seeing good progress in our other high-growth areas. Examples of this progress include our recent geothermal win, which is our second recent contract award, in the renewable energy design build projects, our health business' capture of the TRICARE Military Health System electronic health record IT support contract that provides more momentum to our growing electronic medical health records area, and our capture of the space Naval Warfare System Center Scientific Pacific cyberspace operations support ID/IQ contracts, which provides a large vehicle to deliver a variety of Cybersecurity solutions.
We also reached 2 important milestones that enable future growth. First, our Reveal baggage inspection system passed the report 75% Mast test at TSA, positioning Reveal for equipment reset and upgrade orders. Second this quarter, we are launching our new cybersecurity platform, the CloudShield CS-4000 product. As we all know, Internet Protocol-enabled devices are exploding and the adoption of cloud computing is on the rise. This creates tremendous opportunities for innovation solutions in many markets including telemedicine for health care, Smart Grid for energy and delivery of essential government services. 
At the same time, the cybersecurity threat is evolving at a high rate. Consequently, critical infrastructures in business have to be able to defend their networks from a wide range of persistent threats. To this end, we are launching our latest CloudShield platform, the CS-4000, which will enable government-grade security across the agencies and into the commercial markets. Unlike proprietary hardware platforms, the CloudShield platforms allows partners to build and deploy applications to counter unique and emerging threats, capabilities desperately needed in this dynamic market. We expect these 2 developments to be an important part of our growth in the coming years.
Moving on to acquisitions and divestitures. During the first quarter, we continued to pursue an active and disciplined M&A program to identify strategic growth opportunities for our company. Shortly after the end of the first quarter, we announced that we acquired power transmission and distribution engineering business of Patrick Engineering Service. The acquisition will enhance SAIC's energy and Smart Grid services portfolio, adding additional TNT engineering services to the company's existing capabilities and a growing market. Patrick Energy Services is also currently working on Smart Grid projects for transmission infrastructure owners.  The acquisition will enable us, SAIC, to better serve customers, including investor-owned utilities, public power providers and transmission operators. 
On the divestiture side, as I mentioned at our last earnings call, we previously signed an agreement to sell our operations that are primarily focused on providing specialized IT services to international oil and gas companies as well as their related international subsidiaries. These operations, historically included in our Commercial segment, and do not align well with our current strategy. We expect to complete the sale of these operations in the second quarter of this fiscal year. 
Now I will turn to the topic of our CityTime contract with the City of New York. SAIC is the prime contractor under the CityTime program to provide a custom, fully-automated workforce management system. The system is now essentially complete so -- supporting more than 163,000 city employees in nearly 7 departments and agencies -- excuse me, 70 departments and agencies. As you may have seen the news reports, SAIC's former program manager for the CityTime program has been charged by the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York with conspiring to the fraud city and SAIC by receiving illegal kickbacks from the program for his own personal gain. We provided a description on the status of the CityTime situation as an exhibit to the 8-K we filed today with our earnings release. We obviously are taking this matter very seriously. 
The individual who is subject of the charges had been on mandatory administrative leave from SAIC since December, when it was announced that certain non-SAIC individuals working on the CityTime program were arrested and the U.S. Attorney's investigation was made public. Since then, the company has discovered that it could not validate all the time recorded to the contract by the CityTime program manager, and SAIC terminated his employment as of May 23. We have offered to voluntary refund the city approximately $2.5 million, representing all this employee's time that was directly billed to the city. Shortly thereafter, the charges against the former program manager were filed. We have not been aware of these charges prior to that time. The U.S. Attorney's investigation is ongoing and we are cooperating with that investigation. 
The City of New York is also conducting an investigation regarding the contract. At this time the company does not know the full extent or scope of these investigations and cannot predict their outcomes. The City has stated that it intends to pursue the recovery of any CityTime related costs that were improperly charged to the City, but has not yet filed any claims against the company or requested reimbursement of payments previously made to the company. 
The alleged behavior of our former employee is counter to everything we stands for and worked to achieve everyday. We will continue to cooperate in these investigations and act appropriately with the City in connection with this matter. We understand your interest in the situation. And for that reason, we have included a detailed statement in our 8-K filing along with our press release. But there's really nothing else we can add at this point, given the fact that the investigations are still ongoing. So we ask you to respect the fact that we cannot say any more on this subject at this time.
Before I turn the discussion over to Mark, I want to close by sharing 2 other items, one on our work in the community and another on a special recognition we received. SAIC is committed to being a strong partner in our communities, and we have a special focus on helping motivate kids in K-12 to be interested in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Stem. Renewing the interest in science and technology is vital to our country and also to SAIC's future. 
I'm especially proud that the impact of our employees are making with organizations like First. First is a not-for-profit public charity that motivates young people to pursue education and career opportunities in science while building self-confidence and life skills. During this year's first robotics competition season, our employees worked with over 90 teams from across the country to build robots that competed in what I like to call the varsity sport of the mind. SAIC also sponsored 8 regional championships, as well as the international championship in St. Louis, which I attended personally. Let me tell you, these are impressive events and impressive young people. What you see in these events are thousands of kids, parents, teachers and mentors all focused on getting their robots to compete with the very challenging environment. What you don't see at these events are the many, many hours of effort that each participant has invested to get to the competition itself. That's where we get the impact, and that's why I'm so proud of SAIC's employees for supporting this endeavor with thousands of volunteer hours.
Second, SAIC recently received the 2011 Dwight D. Eisenhower Award for Excellence from the Small Business Administration. The award is given in recognition of exemplary commitment to using small businesses as subcontractors and suppliers. SAIC received the award in the research and development category. During government fiscal year 2010, SAIC subcontracted more than $2.2 billion in work to small businesses, accounting for approximately 20% of SAIC's total revenue for the same period. The company's commitment to small business has resulted in nearly an 80% increase in the amount of dollars subcontracted by SAIC to small business over the past 4 years.
Mark will now cover the financial details for the first quarter of fiscal 2011."
110741,131262290,133598,"SAIC, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Jun 02, 2011",2011-06-02,"Earnings Calls","Leidos Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Walt, and good afternoon. I'm going to first discuss our consolidated top line and operating margin results for the first quarter, then I'll break that down into our new we defined operating segments. After that, I'll move on to earnings per sh",1640,"Thank you, Walt, and good afternoon. I'm going to first discuss our consolidated top line and operating margin results for the first quarter, then I'll break that down into our new we defined operating segments. After that, I'll move on to earnings per share and cash flow and then finish up with guidance for this fiscal year. 
As Walt discussed in our first quarter, we grew our revenue by a modest amount and delivered strong performance on the other key financial metrics, operating margin, earnings per share growth, operating cash flow and new business awards. I'll say it's encouraging to achieve these results in a market that has continued to be unpredictable and fiscally challenged, most particularly, how we rebalanced our resources to focus on building long-term growth enablers while at the same time delivering balanced financial results. 
Our consolidated revenues for the first quarter of fiscal '12 grew 2% with internal growth at 1%. Operating margins were strong at 8.6% for the quarter, up 80 basis points over the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations grew 13% to $0.36. This reflected top line growth, the improved profitability and EPS lift from share repurchases, partially offset by a higher but normalized tax rate and higher interest expense. Finally, operating cash flow came in at about $155 million, up 18% over the same period last year and well exceeding income from continuing operations.
A little more color on the top line revenues. IN the first quarter, we saw accelerated growth in our ISR business area. That's Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, particularly from quick-reaction capabilities we're delivering in support of airborne ISR missions. Our health information technology business has picked up its revenue growth pace and our C-4 area, primarily in various systems, engineering and integration programs continued to contribute strongly to growth. We saw a contraction offset to this growth in our logistics, readiness and sustainment area, most significantly from reductions in the BCTM program. That's Brigade, Combat Team Modernization. We also saw a contraction across the space, particularly in IT services. 
products were down year-over-year on a light shipments schedule, which is expected to reverse course in the coming three quarters. We also had one less business day in the quarter compared to last year, which accounts for about a 2% revenue contraction compared to last year's first quarter.
As well, total backlog at the end of the quarter was $18 billion, up nicely. backlog, however, came in at $5 billion, down about 8% from last year due to a slowdown in the process for funding specific accounts and programs following the April passage of the government fiscal '11 federal budget. We expect that condition to improve in time. 
Operating margin improved by 80 basis points over last year as a result of several factors. This included 20 basis points from improvement arising from the sale of real estate, as we continued to monetize certain elements of our real estate holdings. However, the most significant impact to margins came from contract performance across the board. This performance reflects cost reductions we have made, coupled with successful delivery of completed programs or milestones, enabling higher profits and/or award fee scores. Importantly, our cost reductions were primarily in business support functions, allowing us to concurrently increase investment in revenue-producing activities such as business development and internal research and development, while delivering improved profitability year-over-year.
I'll now cover the segment operating results for our recently defined 4 operating segments. As a reminder as Paul said up front, these are the Defense Solutions segment, the Health, Energy and Civil Solutions segment, Intelligence and Cybersecurity Solutions segment and the Corporate segment.
Revenues for the Defense Solutions segment grew 2% during Q1 over a year ago, all of which was from internal growth. We accomplished this growth with a number of existing contracts, which include a large system and software upgrade and maintenance program for the Army base in Huntsville and a systems engineering solutions program for the U.S. Navy. Growth in these areas was offset by about a 25% reduction in revenues for the BCTM program that I mentioned earlier and a scheduled contract wind down for the contract we have at the City of New York. 
The Defense Solutions segment operating margin was 7.9% in Q1, an improvement of 30 basis points over Q1 of last year. The increase is largely due to effective cost management and program performance. Our focus for this segment is to protect our base, leverage our strong portfolio of ID/IQ contracts and expand our market presence, such as our efforts to capture a role on the Ground Combat Vehicle program, which we expect will be decided quite soon.
Our Health, Energy and Civil Solutions segment revenues decreased 4% during Q1 compared to a year ago. Internal revenues contracted 8%, went down 8%. The primary drivers of the revenue contraction for the quarter were on the civil solutions side. Timing of deliveries of our nonintrusive inspection systems for both cargo and baggage screening applications are more heavily weighted towards the second half of this fiscal year compared to last year. Additionally, we saw reduced revenues, as expected, in certain sensitive programs such as with NASA. 
Our energy business was essentially flat but is showing signs of improvement, with the recent awards for design-build projects in the renewable energy area and a growing pipeline of new opportunities as well. On positive side, our health information technology area, as I mentioned up front primarily focused on the federal sector, currently produced internal the revenue growth approaching 10%.
Operating margin for the Health, Energy and Civil Solutions segment was 8.4% in Q1, 100 basis points lower than a year ago. This decline in operating margin was mainly driven by the timing-related reduction in deliveries of our higher-margin nonintrusive inspection systems and also increased amortization expense due to the Reveal acquisition we made and also increased internal research and development investment related to the development of new homeland security products.
The Intelligence and Cybersecurity Solutions segment revenues increased 7% during Q1 over last year, all of which was from internal growth. This growth was associated with increased activity on new and existing programs in areas of mission-critical intelligence analysis; manned and unmanned airborne surveillance; and processing, exploitation and dissemination programs. Our contributions to programs of high national security priority have countered some of the effects of systemic program delays, in-sourcing and other growth inhibitors we've experienced over the last year or 2. 
business development investments over the past year and are agile and responsive solution to essential to re-introduce growth back into this area. Cybersecurity for the quarter was essentially flat on continued delays in ramping up new or existing contracts and also on lower material buys.
Operating margin for the Intelligence and Cybersecurity Solutions segment was 9.5%, an improvement of 200 basis points compared to a year ago. This increase was attributable primarily to strong program performance, increased sales of proprietary products and cost savings from internal streamlining actions. 
The Corporate and Other segment operating loss decreased by $5 million compared to Q1 of last year, primarily from a $6 million gain on the sale of real estate that I mentioned up front.
That completes the view of the segments. For other P&L items, we had a high tax rate this quarter as expected, higher than last year. That's more reflective of our normative rate of about 37.5%. We also had a higher interest expense, as planned, from the $750 million bond offering completed near the end of fiscal '11 back in December.  Earnings per share from continuing operations grew 13% over the prior year quarter, which was comprised of 13% increase in operating income and 8% increase from the lower share count attributed to share repurchases and offset by about 5% for higher taxes and 3% primarily from higher interest expense.
Cash flow from operations and free cash flow was healthy this quarter, with operating cash flow at about $155 million and free cash flow at about $145 million. Days sales outstanding increased by 2 days year-over-year to 72. We continued cash deployments in the form of share repurchases, which totaled about $250 million in the quarter representing a buyback of about 14.5 million shares. These repurchases, coupled with those we made last December and January, completed our goal to repurchase 300 million of shares to offset the dilution from the recent $750 million bond offering. This negates any adverse earnings per share impact from the offering for fiscal '12, yet provides a net $450 million of new capital, for application to growth or other shareholder value-creation opportunities that are available to us.
That covers Q1 performance. Now, let me finish up with forward guidance. Last quarter, we revised our revenue and cash flow expectations for this fiscal year to reflect the recently announced divestiture. In that, we kept our earnings per share expectation unchanged and raised our operating cash flow expectations, with no changes to those expectations today. 
As disclosed in today's release, our expectations for fiscal '12 revenues are $11.0 billion to $11.5 billion, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.35 to $1.46; and cash flows from continuing operations at or above $600 million. Please also note that our normal seasonal increase in revenues from Q1 to Q2 is not expected to occur that significantly this year as we have in the past, due to program reductions and wind-downs during Q2 as well as some continued impact from the continuing resolution and recent budget challenges in Congress. Our expectation is that the second half of this year will deliver the bulk of our internal revenue growth for the year, as ramp-up occurs on some recently awarded contracts and given the expected timing of product sales. With that, I'll turn it back to Walt."

You can see from our press release that we turned in solid performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. This performance reflects SAIC's focus on growth in the most attractive and profitable elements of our portfolio and commitment to build our pipeline for future growth. 
During the quarter, we delivered double-digit growth in operating income and earnings per share. Despite market challenges, we expanded our pipeline of opportunities, and we continued to grow the value of submitted proposals and contract backlog, each increasing at double-digit rates compared with the same quarter a year ago.
For the call today, I'll cover market conditions, highlight recent business development results, talk about acquisitions and divestitures, discuss our CityTime contract, touch upon our community outreach program and share a special recognition we received. Then Mark will provide the financial details.
As we have discussed with you before, the government solutions and services market witnessed a lengthening of the acquisition cycle in government fiscal 2010. And as we expected, this longer cycle persists in government fiscal 2011. We are encouraged by the passage of the federal FY '11 budget and expect that will improve the funding environment on a short-term basis. However, we also expect the longer acquisition cycle to continue into government fiscal 2012. 
It is also important to note that announced changes in the Pentagon leadership will likely lead to some changes in spending priorities. These market conditions continue to make the timing of new awards difficult to predict, but we have responded to these conditions by increasingly focusing resources on aggressively pursuing new business.
Regarding our contract awards, bookings totaled $3.6 billion in the first quarter and produced a net book-to-bill ratio of 1.3. This ratio reflects our key win on the 10-year NASA Integrated Communications Services contract, which added $1.2 billion to our bookings. This is an important win for maintaining our base activity in supporting this critical mission for our NASA customers. 
We ended the quarter with $18 billion in total backlog, of which $5 billion was funded. As compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2011, total backlog increased by 14%. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter of achieving a book-to-bill ratio at or above 1.0, validating our strategy to be more aggressive in our business development area.
A central factor to growing our bookings and backlog was maintaining high win rates. In Q1, we achieved a 72% total dollar win rate on business opportunities pursued and awarded. This win rate is higher than a year ago despite a more aggressive pace of bids submitted and increasing competition. Additionally, we continued our trend of increasing submitted proposals awaiting decision, now at a new peak of $29 billion, including nearly $20 billion in ID/IQ bids and the remainder in definite-delivery bids. This is over $9 billion higher than Q4 and over $11 billion higher than Q1 a year ago, which provides a strong basis for continued growth in backlog in fiscal year 12.
Our focus on winning larger opportunities continues to yield excellent results. We won 12 opportunities valued at more than $100 million each in the first quarter of FY '12. This is a 100% increase compared with Q1 of FY '11, when we won just 6 opportunities valued at more than $100 million. As presented in our press release today, there were many significant awards this quarter. At this point, let me make -- take a moment to highlight some specific business development achievements. 
The NASA Integrated Communications Services contract provides managerial and technical expertise in support of the Office of the Chief Information Officer for corporate admission communications needs at NASA, including local area network management at all NASA centers. This is the first time that NASA has awarded a follow-on contract for this award for this work to the incumbent contractor. The competition for this very large contract was intense, and yet it was awarded to SAIC without protest by any other competitors, a clear indication of the exceptional value proposed in SAIC's offer.
Also during this quarter, SAIC continued to generate significant awards from our differentiated offerings and established year-over-year revenue growth in our Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance business. Our delivery of quick-reaction capabilities in providing persistent surveillance, processing, exploitation and dissemination solutions in a very demanding military and intelligence environment is generating increased demand. 
As examples, during this past quarter, we were awarded $76 million of additional ceiling on the grid's ID/IQ contract with the Army Geospatial Center, primarily focused on the BuckEye collection system.  Also during this quarter, we were selected to receive a $279 million non-ID/IQ airborne ISR award by the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center. This award is in final negotiations for work to be completed by September 2012. In addition to our NASA and ISR wins, we are seeing good progress in our other high-growth areas. Examples of this progress include our Gradient geothermal win, which is our second recent contract award in the renewable energy design build projects. 
Our Health business' capture of the TRICARE Military Health System electronic health record IT support contract that provides more momentum to our growing electronic medical health records area. And our capture of the Space and Naval Warfare System Center Pacific cyberspace operations support ID/IQ contract, which provides a large vehicle to deliver a variety of cybersecurity solutions.
We also reached 2 important milestones that enable future growth. First, our Reveal baggage inspection system passed the required 75% threat mass test at TSA, positioning Reveal for equipment reset and upgrade orders. Second, this quarter we are launching our new cybersecurity platform, the CloudShield CS-4000 product. 
As we all know, Internet Protocol-enabled devices are exploding, and the adoption of cloud computing is on the rise. This creates tremendous opportunities for innovative solutions in many markets, including telemedicine for health care, smart grid for energy and delivery of essential government services. At the same time, the cybersecurity threat is evolving at a high rate. 
Consequently, critical infrastructures and business have to be able to defend their networks from a wide range of persistent threats. To this end, we are launching our latest CloudShield platform, the CS-4000, which will enable government-grade security across the agencies and into the commercial markets. Unlike proprietary hardware platforms, the CloudShield platform allows partners to build and deploy applications to counter unique and often emerging threats, capabilities desperately needed in this dynamic market. We expect these 2 developments to be an important part of our growth in the coming years.
Moving on to acquisitions and divestitures. During the first quarter, we continued to pursue an active and disciplined M&A program to identify strategic growth opportunities for our company. Shortly after the end of the first quarter, we announced that we acquired the power transmission and distribution engineering business of Patrick Engineering Service. 
The acquisition will enhance SAIC's energy and smart grid services portfolio, adding additional T&D engineering services to the company's existing capabilities in a growing market. Patrick Energy Services is also currently working on smart grid projects for transmission infrastructure owners. The acquisition will enable SAIC to better serve customers, including investor-owned utilities, public power providers and transmission operators. 
On the divestiture side, as I mentioned at our last earnings call, we previously signed an agreement to sell our operations that are primarily focused on providing specialized IT services to international oil and gas companies as well as a few related international subsidiaries. These operations were historically included in our Commercial segment and do not align well with our current strategy. We expect to complete the sale of these operations in the second quarter of this fiscal year. 
Now I will turn to the topic of our CityTime contract with the City of New York. SAIC is the prime contractor under the CityTime program to provide a custom, fully-automated workforce management system. The system is now essentially complete supporting more than 163,000 city employees in nearly 7 departments and agencies -- excuse me, 70 departments and agencies. 
As you may have seen in news reports, SAIC's former program manager for the CityTime program has been charged by the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York with conspiring to defraud the city and SAIC by receiving illegal kickbacks from the program for his own personal gain. We provided a description on the status of the CityTime situation as an exhibit to the 8-K we filed today with our earnings release. We obviously are taking this matter very seriously. 
The individual who is subject of the charges had been on mandatory administrative leave from SAIC since December when it was announced that certain non-SAIC individuals working on the CityTime program were arrested and the U.S. Attorney's investigation was made public. Since then, the company has discovered that it could not validate all the time recorded to the contract by this CityTime program manager, and SAIC terminated his employment as of May 23. 
We have offered to voluntarily refund the city approximately $2.5 million, representing all this employee's time that was directly billed to the city. Shortly thereafter, the charges against the former program manager were filed. We have not been aware of these charges prior to that time. The U.S. Attorney's investigation is ongoing, and we are cooperating with that investigation. 
The City of New York is also conducting an investigation regarding the contract. At this time the company does not know the full extent or scope of these investigations and cannot predict their outcomes. The city has stated that it intends to pursue the recovery of any CityTime-related costs that were improperly charged to the city, but has not yet filed any claims against the company or requested reimbursement of payments previously made to the company. 
The alleged behavior of our former employee is counter to everything we stand for and work to achieve everyday. We will continue to cooperate in these investigations and act appropriately with the city in connection with this matter. We understand your interest in this situation, and for that reason, we have included a detailed statement in our 8-K filing along with our press release. But there's really nothing else we can add at this point given the fact that the investigations are still ongoing. So we ask you to respect the fact that we cannot say any more on this subject at this time.
Before I turn the discussion over to Mark, I want to close by sharing 2 other items, one on our work in the community and another on a special recognition we received. SAIC is committed to being a strong partner in our communities, and we have a special focus on helping motivate kids in K-12 to be interested in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM. Renewing the interest in science and technology with our youth is vital to our country and also to SAIC's future. 
I'm especially proud that the impact our employees are making with organizations like FIRST. FIRST is a not-for-profit public charity that motivates young people to pursue education and career opportunities in science while building self-confidence and life skills. During this year's FIRST Robotics Competition season, our employees worked with over 90 teams from across the country to build robots that competed in what I like to call the varsity sport of the mind. 
SAIC also sponsored 8 regional championships as well as the international championship in St. Louis, which I attended personally. Let me tell you, these are impressive events and impressive young people. What you see at these events are thousands of kids, parents, teachers and mentors all focused on getting their robots to compete in a very challenging environment. What you don't see at these events are the many, many hours of effort that each participant has invested to get to the competition itself. That's where we get the impact, and that's why I'm so proud of SAIC's employees for supporting this endeavor with thousands of volunteer hours.
Second, SAIC recently received the 2011 Dwight D. Eisenhower Award for Excellence from the Small Business Administration. The award is given in recognition of exemplary commitment to using small businesses as subcontractors and suppliers. SAIC received the award in the research and development category. During government fiscal year 2010, SAIC subcontracted more than $2.2 billion in work to small businesses, accounting for approximately 20% of SAIC's total revenue for the same period. The company's commitment to small business has resulted in nearly an 80% increase in the amount of dollars subcontracted by SAIC to small business over the past 4 years.
Mark will now cover the financial details for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 (sic) [2012]."
110741,131262290,133640,"SAIC, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Jun 02, 2011",2011-06-02,"Earnings Calls","Leidos Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Walt, and good afternoon. I'm going to first discuss our consolidated top line and operating margin results for the first quarter, then I'll break that down into our new redefined operating segments. After that, I'll move on to the earnings per",1648,"Thank you, Walt, and good afternoon. I'm going to first discuss our consolidated top line and operating margin results for the first quarter, then I'll break that down into our new redefined operating segments. After that, I'll move on to the earnings per share and cash flow and then finish up with guidance for this fiscal year. 
As Walt discussed, in our first quarter, we grew our revenue by a modest amount and delivered strong performance on the other key financial metrics: operating margin, earnings per share growth, operating cash flow and new business awards. I'll say it's encouraging to achieve these results in a market that has continued to be unpredictable and fiscally challenged, most particularly, how we rebalanced our resources to focus on building long-term growth enablers while at the same time delivering balanced financial results. 
Our consolidated revenues for the first quarter of fiscal '12 grew 2%, with internal growth at 1%. Operating margins were strong at 8.6% for the quarter, up 80 basis points over the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations grew 13% to $0.36. This reflected top line growth, improved profitability and EPS lift from share repurchases, partially offset by a higher but normalized tax rate and higher interest expense. Finally, operating cash flow came in at about $155 million, up 18% over the same period last year and well exceeding income from continuing operations.
A little more color on the top line revenues. In the first quarter, we saw accelerated growth in our ISR business area; that's Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, particularly from quick-reaction capabilities we are delivering in support of airborne ISR missions. Our Health Information Technology business has picked up its revenue growth pace, and our C4 area, primarily in various systems engineering and integration programs, continued to contribute strongly to growth. We saw a contraction offsetting this growth in our logistics, readiness and sustainment area, most significantly from reductions in the BCTM program; that's Brigade Combat Team Modernization. We also saw a contraction across the fed civ [federal civilian] space, particularly in IT services. 
Security products were down year-over-year on a late shipment schedule, which is expected to reverse course in the coming three quarters. We also had 1 less business day in the quarter compared to last year, which accounts for about a 2% revenue contraction compared to last year's first quarter.
As Walt indicated, total backlog at the end of the quarter was $18 billion, up nicely. Funded backlog, however, came in at $5 billion, down about 8% from last year due to a slowdown in the process for funding specific accounts and programs following the April passage of the government fiscal '11 federal budget. We expect that condition to improve with time. 
Operating margin improved by 80 basis points over last year as a result of several factors. This included 20 basis points from improvement arising from the sale of real estate as we continue to monetize certain elements of our real estate holdings. However, the most significant impact to margins came from contract performance across the board. 
This performance reflects cost reductions we have made, coupled with successful delivery of completed programs or milestones, enabling higher profits and/or award fee scores. Importantly, our cost reductions were primarily in business support functions, allowing us to concurrently increase investment in revenue-producing activities such as business development and internal research and development, while delivering improved profitability year-over-year.
I'll now cover the segment operating results for our recently defined 4 operating segments. As a reminder, as Paul said upfront, these are the Defense Solutions segment; the Health, Energy and Civil Solutions segment; Intelligence and Cybersecurity Solutions segment; and the Corporate segment.
Revenues for the Defense Solutions segment grew 2% during Q1 over a year ago, all of which was from internal growth. We accomplished this growth through a number of existing contracts, which include a large system and software upgrade and maintenance program for the Army based in Huntsville, and a systems engineering solutions program for the U.S. Navy. Growth in these areas was offset by about a 25% reduction in revenues for the BCTM program that I mentioned earlier and a scheduled contract wind down for the contract we have with the City of New York. 
The Defense Solutions segment operating margin was 7.9% in Q1, an improvement of 30 basis points over Q1 of last year. The increase is largely due to effective cost management and certain program performance. Our focus for this segment is to protect our base, leverage our strong portfolio of ID/IQ contracts and expand our market presence, such as our efforts to capture a role on the Ground Combat Vehicle program, which we expect will be decided quite soon.
Our Health, Energy and Civil Solutions segment revenues decreased 4% during Q1 compared to a year ago. Internal revenues contracted 8%, went down 8%. The primary drivers of the revenue contraction for the quarter were on the civil solutions side. Timing of deliveries of our nonintrusive inspection systems for both cargo and baggage screening applications are more heavily weighted towards the second half of this fiscal year compared to last year. Additionally, we saw reduced revenues as expected in certain fed civ programs such as with NASA. 
Our Energy business was essentially flat but is showing signs of improvement with recent awards for design-build projects in the renewable energy area and the growing pipeline of new opportunities as well. On a positive side, our Health Information Technology area, as I mentioned upfront, primarily focused on the federal sector, currently produced internal revenue growth approaching 10%.
Operating margin for the Health, Energy and Civil Solutions segment was 8.4% in Q1, 100 basis points lower than a year ago. This decline in operating margin was mainly driven by the timing-related reduction in deliveries of our higher margin nonintrusive inspection systems and also increased amortization expense due to the Reveal acquisition we made and also increased internal research and development investment related to the development of new homeland security products.
The Intelligence and Cybersecurity Solutions segment revenues increased 7% during Q1 over last year, all of which was from internal growth. This growth was associated with increased activity on new and existing programs in areas of mission-critical intelligence analysis; manned and unmanned airborne surveillance; and processing, exploitation and dissemination programs. Our contributions to programs of high national security priority have countered some of the effects of systemic program delays, in-sourcing and other growth inhibitors we've experienced over the last year or 2. 
Standard business development investments over the past year and our agile and responsive solutions were essential to reintroduce growth back into this area. Cybersecurity for the quarter was essentially flat on continued delays in ramping up new or existing contracts and also on lower material buys.
Operating margin for the Intelligence and Cybersecurity Solutions segment was 9.5%, an improvement of 200 basis points compared to a year ago. This increase was attributable primarily to strong program performance, increased sales of proprietary products and cost savings from internal streamlining actions. The Corporate and Other segment operating loss decreased by $5 million compared to Q1 of last year, primarily from a $6 million gain on the sale of real estate that I mentioned up front.
That completes the view of the segments. For other P&L items, we had a high tax rate this quarter as expected, higher than last year. That's more reflective of our normative rate of about 37.5%. We also had a higher interest expense as planned from the $750 million bond offering completed near the end of fiscal '11 back in December. Earnings per share from continuing operations grew 13% over the prior year quarter, which was comprised of 13% increase in operating income and 8% increase from the lower share count attributed to share repurchases and offset by about 5% for higher taxes and 3% primarily from higher interest expense.
Cash flow from operations and free cash flow was healthy this quarter, with operating cash flow at about $155 million and free cash flow at about $145 million. Days sales outstanding increased by 2 days year-over-year to 72. We continued cash deployments in the form of share repurchases, which totaled about $250 million in the quarter, representing a buyback of about 14.5 million shares. 
These repurchases, coupled with those made last December and January, completed our goal to repurchase $300 million of shares to offset the dilution from the recent $750 million bond offering. This negates any adverse earnings per share impact from the offering for fiscal '12, yet provides a net $450 million of new capital for application to growth or other shareholder value-creation opportunities that are available to us.
That covers Q1 performance. Now let me finish up with forward guidance. Last quarter, we revised our revenue and cash flow expectations for this fiscal year to reflect the recently announced divestiture. In that, we kept our earnings per share expectations unchanged and raised our operating cash flow expectations. We have no changes to those expectations today. 
As disclosed in today's release, our expectations for fiscal '12 revenues are $11.0 billion to $11.5 billion, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.35 to $1.46 and cash flows from continuing operations at or above $600 million. Please also note that our normal seasonal increase in revenues from Q1 to Q2 is not expected to occur as significantly this year as we have in the past due to program reductions and wind downs during Q2 as well as some continued impact from the continuing resolution and recent budget challenges in Congress. Our expectation is that the second half of this year will deliver the bulk of our internal revenue growth for the year as ramp-up occurs on some recently awarded contracts and given the expected timing of product sales. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Walt."

We are encouraged by the passage of the federal FY '11 budget and expect that will improve the funding environment on a short-term basis. However, we also expect the longer acquisition cycle to continue into government fiscal 2012. 
It is also important to note that announced changes in the Pentagon leadership will likely lead to some changes in spending priorities. These market conditions continue to make the timing of new awards difficult to predict, but we have responded to these conditions by increasingly focusing resources on aggressively pursuing new business.
Regarding our contract awards, bookings totaled $3.6 billion in the first quarter and produced a net book-to-bill ratio of 1.3. This ratio reflects our key win on the 10-year NASA Integrated Communications Services contract, which added $1.2 billion to our bookings. This is an important win for maintaining our base activity in supporting this critical mission for our NASA customers. 
We ended the quarter with $18 billion in total backlog, of which $5 billion was funded. As compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2011, total backlog increased by 14%. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter of achieving a book-to-bill ratio at or above 1.0, validating our strategy to be more aggressive in our business development area.
A central factor to growing our bookings and backlog was maintaining high win rates. In Q1, we achieved a 72% total dollar win rate on business opportunities pursued and awarded. This win rate is higher than a year ago despite a more aggressive pace of bids submitted and increasing competition. Additionally, we continued our trend of increasing submitted proposals awaiting decision, now at a new peak of $29 billion, including nearly $20 billion in ID/IQ bids and the remainder in definite-delivery bids. This is over $9 billion higher than Q4 and over $11 billion higher than Q1 a year ago, which provides a strong basis for continued growth in backlog in fiscal year 12.
Our focus on winning larger opportunities continues to yield excellent results. We won 12 opportunities valued at more than $100 million each in the first quarter of FY '12. This is a 100% increase compared with Q1 of FY '11, when we won just 6 opportunities valued at more than $100 million. As presented in our press release today, there were many significant awards this quarter. At this point, let me make -- take a moment to highlight some specific business development achievements. 
The NASA Integrated Communications Services contract provides managerial and technical expertise in support of the Office of the Chief Information Officer for corporate admission communications needs at NASA, including local area network management at all NASA centers. This is the first time that NASA has awarded a follow-on contract for this award for this work to the incumbent contractor. The competition for this very large contract was intense, and yet it was awarded to SAIC without protest by any other competitors, a clear indication of the exceptional value proposed in SAIC's offer.
Also during this quarter, SAIC continued to generate significant awards from our differentiated offerings and established year-over-year revenue growth in our Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance business. Our delivery of quick-reaction capabilities in providing persistent surveillance, processing, exploitation and dissemination solutions in a very demanding military and intelligence environment is generating increased demand. 
As examples, during this past quarter, we were awarded $76 million of additional ceiling on the grid's ID/IQ contract with the Army Geospatial Center, primarily focused on the BuckEye collection system.  Also during this quarter, we were selected to receive a $279 million non-ID/IQ airborne ISR award by the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center. This award is in final negotiations for work to be completed by September 2012. In addition to our NASA and ISR wins, we are seeing good progress in our other high-growth areas. Examples of this progress include our Gradient geothermal win, which is our second recent contract award in the renewable energy design build projects. 
Our Health business' capture of the TRICARE Military Health System electronic health record IT support contract that provides more momentum to our growing electronic medical health records area. And our capture of the Space and Naval Warfare System Center Pacific cyberspace operations support ID/IQ contract, which provides a large vehicle to deliver a variety of cybersecurity solutions.
We also reached 2 important milestones that enable future growth. First, our Reveal baggage inspection system passed the required 75% threat mass test at TSA, positioning Reveal for equipment reset and upgrade orders. Second, this quarter we are launching our new cybersecurity platform, the CloudShield CS-4000 product. 
As we all know, Internet Protocol-enabled devices are exploding, and the adoption of cloud computing is on the rise. This creates tremendous opportunities for innovative solutions in many markets, including telemedicine for health care, smart grid for energy and delivery of essential government services. At the same time, the cybersecurity threat is evolving at a high rate. 
Consequently, critical infrastructures and business have to be able to defend their networks from a wide range of persistent threats. To this end, we are launching our latest CloudShield platform, the CS-4000, which will enable government-grade security across the agencies and into the commercial markets. Unlike proprietary hardware platforms, the CloudShield platform allows partners to build and deploy applications to counter unique and often emerging threats, capabilities desperately needed in this dynamic market. We expect these 2 developments to be an important part of our growth in the coming years.
Moving on to acquisitions and divestitures. During the first quarter, we continued to pursue an active and disciplined M&A program to identify strategic growth opportunities for our company. Shortly after the end of the first quarter, we announced that we acquired the power transmission and distribution engineering business of Patrick Engineering Service. 
The acquisition will enhance SAIC's energy and smart grid services portfolio, adding additional T&D engineering services to the company's existing capabilities in a growing market. Patrick Energy Services is also currently working on smart grid projects for transmission infrastructure owners. The acquisition will enable SAIC to better serve customers, including investor-owned utilities, public power providers and transmission operators. 
On the divestiture side, as I mentioned at our last earnings call, we previously signed an agreement to sell our operations that are primarily focused on providing specialized IT services to international oil and gas companies as well as a few related international subsidiaries. These operations were historically included in our Commercial segment and do not align well with our current strategy. We expect to complete the sale of these operations in the second quarter of this fiscal year. 
Now I will turn to the topic of our CityTime contract with the City of New York. SAIC is the prime contractor under the CityTime program to provide a custom, fully-automated workforce management system. The system is now essentially complete supporting more than 163,000 city employees in nearly 7 departments and agencies -- excuse me, 70 departments and agencies. 
As you may have seen in news reports, SAIC's former program manager for the CityTime program has been charged by the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York with conspiring to defraud the city and SAIC by receiving illegal kickbacks from the program for his own personal gain. We provided a description on the status of the CityTime situation as an exhibit to the 8-K we filed today with our earnings release. We obviously are taking this matter very seriously. 
The individual who is subject of the charges had been on mandatory administrative leave from SAIC since December when it was announced that certain non-SAIC individuals working on the CityTime program were arrested and the U.S. Attorney's investigation was made public. Since then, the company has discovered that it could not validate all the time recorded to the contract by this CityTime program manager, and SAIC terminated his employment as of May 23. 
We have offered to voluntarily refund the city approximately $2.5 million, representing all this employee's time that was directly billed to the city. Shortly thereafter, the charges against the former program manager were filed. We had not been aware of these charges prior to that time. The U.S. Attorney's investigation is ongoing, and we are cooperating with that investigation. 
The City of New York is also conducting an investigation regarding the contract. At this time the company does not know the full extent or scope of these investigations and cannot predict their outcomes. The city has stated that it intends to pursue the recovery of any CityTime-related costs that were improperly charged to the city, but has not yet filed any claims against the company or requested reimbursement of payments previously made to the company. 
The alleged behavior of our former employee is counter to everything we stand for and work to achieve every day. We will continue to cooperate in these investigations and act appropriately with the city in connection with this matter. We understand your interest in this situation, and for that reason, we have included a detailed statement in our 8-K filing along with our press release. But there's really nothing else we can add at this point given the fact that the investigations are still ongoing. So we ask you to respect the fact that we cannot say any more on this subject at this time.
Before I turn the discussion over to Mark, I want to close by sharing 2 other items, one on our work in the community and another on a special recognition we received. SAIC is committed to being a strong partner in our communities, and we have a special focus on helping motivate kids in K-12 to be interested in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM. Renewing the interest in science and technology with our youth is vital to our country and also to SAIC's future. 
I'm especially proud of the impact our employees are making with organizations like FIRST. FIRST is a not-for-profit public charity that motivates young people to pursue education and career opportunities in science while building self-confidence and life skills. During this year's FIRST Robotics Competition season, our employees worked with over 90 teams from across the country to build robots that competed in what I like to call the varsity sport of the mind. 
SAIC also sponsored 8 regional championships as well as the international championship in St. Louis, which I attended personally. Let me tell you, these are impressive events and impressive young people. What you see at these events are thousands of kids, parents, teachers and mentors all focused on getting their robots to compete in a very challenging environment. What you don't see at these events are the many, many hours of effort that each participant has invested to get to the competition itself. That's where we get the impact, and that's why I'm so proud of SAIC's employees for supporting this endeavor with thousands of volunteer hours.
Second, SAIC recently received the 2011 Dwight D. Eisenhower Award for Excellence from the Small Business Administration. The award is given in recognition of exemplary commitment to using small businesses as subcontractors and suppliers. SAIC received the award in the research and development category. During government fiscal year 2010, SAIC subcontracted more than $2.2 billion in work to small businesses, accounting for approximately 20% of SAIC's total revenue for the same period. The company's commitment to small business has resulted in nearly an 80% increase in the amount of dollars subcontracted by SAIC to small business over the past 4 years.
Mark will now cover the financial details for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 (sic) [2012]."
110741,131262290,133670,"SAIC, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Jun 02, 2011",2011-06-02,"Earnings Calls","Leidos Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Walt, and good afternoon. I'm going to first discuss our consolidated top line and operating margin results for the first quarter, then I'll break that down into our new redefined operating segments. After that, I'll move on to the earnings per",1648,"Thank you, Walt, and good afternoon. I'm going to first discuss our consolidated top line and operating margin results for the first quarter, then I'll break that down into our new redefined operating segments. After that, I'll move on to the earnings per share and cash flow and then finish up with guidance for this fiscal year. 
As Walt discussed, in our first quarter, we grew our revenue by a modest amount and delivered strong performance on the other key financial metrics: operating margin, earnings per share growth, operating cash flow and new business awards. I'll say it's encouraging to achieve these results in a market that has continued to be unpredictable and fiscally challenged, most particularly, how we rebalanced our resources to focus on building long-term growth enablers while at the same time delivering balanced financial results. 
Our consolidated revenues for the first quarter of fiscal '12 grew 2%, with internal growth at 1%. Operating margins were strong at 8.6% for the quarter, up 80 basis points over the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations grew 13% to $0.36. This reflected top line growth, improved profitability and EPS lift from share repurchases, partially offset by a higher but normalized tax rate and higher interest expense. Finally, operating cash flow came in at about $155 million, up 18% over the same period last year and well exceeding income from continuing operations.
A little more color on the top line revenues. In the first quarter, we saw accelerated growth in our ISR business area; that's Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, particularly from quick-reaction capabilities we are delivering in support of airborne ISR missions. Our Health Information Technology business has picked up its revenue growth pace, and our C4 area, primarily in various systems engineering and integration programs, continued to contribute strongly to growth. We saw a contraction offsetting this growth in our logistics, readiness and sustainment area, most significantly from reductions in the BCTM program; that's Brigade Combat Team Modernization. We also saw a contraction across the fed civ [federal civilian] space, particularly in IT services. 
Security products were down year-over-year on a late shipment schedule, which is expected to reverse course in the coming three quarters. We also had 1 less business day in the quarter compared to last year, which accounts for about a 2% revenue contraction compared to last year's first quarter.
As Walt indicated, total backlog at the end of the quarter was $18 billion, up nicely. Funded backlog, however, came in at $5 billion, down about 8% from last year due to a slowdown in the process for funding specific accounts and programs following the April passage of the government fiscal '11 federal budget. We expect that condition to improve with time. 
Operating margin improved by 80 basis points over last year as a result of several factors. This included 20 basis points from improvement arising from the sale of real estate as we continue to monetize certain elements of our real estate holdings. However, the most significant impact to margins came from contract performance across the board. 
This performance reflects cost reductions we have made, coupled with successful delivery of completed programs or milestones, enabling higher profits and/or award fee scores. Importantly, our cost reductions were primarily in business support functions, allowing us to concurrently increase investment in revenue-producing activities such as business development and internal research and development, while delivering improved profitability year-over-year.
I'll now cover the segment operating results for our recently defined 4 operating segments. As a reminder, as Paul said upfront, these are the Defense Solutions segment; the Health, Energy and Civil Solutions segment; Intelligence and Cybersecurity Solutions segment; and the Corporate segment.
Revenues for the Defense Solutions segment grew 2% during Q1 over a year ago, all of which was from internal growth. We accomplished this growth through a number of existing contracts, which include a large system and software upgrade and maintenance program for the Army based in Huntsville, and a systems engineering solutions program for the U.S. Navy. Growth in these areas was offset by about a 25% reduction in revenues for the BCTM program that I mentioned earlier and a scheduled contract wind down for the contract we have with the City of New York. 
The Defense Solutions segment operating margin was 7.9% in Q1, an improvement of 30 basis points over Q1 of last year. The increase is largely due to effective cost management and certain program performance. Our focus for this segment is to protect our base, leverage our strong portfolio of ID/IQ contracts and expand our market presence, such as our efforts to capture a role on the Ground Combat Vehicle program, which we expect will be decided quite soon.
Our Health, Energy and Civil Solutions segment revenues decreased 4% during Q1 compared to a year ago. Internal revenues contracted 8%, went down 8%. The primary drivers of the revenue contraction for the quarter were on the civil solutions side. Timing of deliveries of our nonintrusive inspection systems for both cargo and baggage screening applications are more heavily weighted towards the second half of this fiscal year compared to last year. Additionally, we saw reduced revenues as expected in certain fed civ programs such as with NASA. 
Our Energy business was essentially flat but is showing signs of improvement with recent awards for design-build projects in the renewable energy area and the growing pipeline of new opportunities as well. On a positive side, our Health Information Technology area, as I mentioned upfront, primarily focused on the federal sector, currently produced internal revenue growth approaching 10%.
Operating margin for the Health, Energy and Civil Solutions segment was 8.4% in Q1, 100 basis points lower than a year ago. This decline in operating margin was mainly driven by the timing-related reduction in deliveries of our higher margin nonintrusive inspection systems and also increased amortization expense due to the Reveal acquisition we made and also increased internal research and development investment related to the development of new homeland security products.
The Intelligence and Cybersecurity Solutions segment revenues increased 7% during Q1 over last year, all of which was from internal growth. This growth was associated with increased activity on new and existing programs in areas of mission-critical intelligence analysis; manned and unmanned airborne surveillance; and processing, exploitation and dissemination programs. Our contributions to programs of high national security priority have countered some of the effects of systemic program delays, in-sourcing and other growth inhibitors we've experienced over the last year or 2. 
Standard business development investments over the past year and our agile and responsive solutions were essential to reintroduce growth back into this area. Cybersecurity for the quarter was essentially flat on continued delays in ramping up new or existing contracts and also on lower material buys.
Operating margin for the Intelligence and Cybersecurity Solutions segment was 9.5%, an improvement of 200 basis points compared to a year ago. This increase was attributable primarily to strong program performance, increased sales of proprietary products and cost savings from internal streamlining actions. The Corporate and Other segment operating loss decreased by $5 million compared to Q1 of last year, primarily from a $6 million gain on the sale of real estate that I mentioned up front.
That completes the view of the segments. For other P&L items, we had a high tax rate this quarter as expected, higher than last year. That's more reflective of our normative rate of about 37.5%. We also had a higher interest expense as planned from the $750 million bond offering completed near the end of fiscal '11 back in December. Earnings per share from continuing operations grew 13% over the prior year quarter, which was comprised of 13% increase in operating income and 8% increase from the lower share count attributed to share repurchases and offset by about 5% for higher taxes and 3% primarily from higher interest expense.
Cash flow from operations and free cash flow was healthy this quarter, with operating cash flow at about $155 million and free cash flow at about $145 million. Days sales outstanding increased by 2 days year-over-year to 72. We continued cash deployments in the form of share repurchases, which totaled about $250 million in the quarter, representing a buyback of about 14.5 million shares. 
These repurchases, coupled with those made last December and January, completed our goal to repurchase $300 million of shares to offset the dilution from the recent $750 million bond offering. This negates any adverse earnings per share impact from the offering for fiscal '12, yet provides a net $450 million of new capital for application to growth or other shareholder value-creation opportunities that are available to us.
That covers Q1 performance. Now let me finish up with forward guidance. Last quarter, we revised our revenue and cash flow expectations for this fiscal year to reflect the recently announced divestiture. In that, we kept our earnings per share expectations unchanged and raised our operating cash flow expectations. We have no changes to those expectations today. 
As disclosed in today's release, our expectations for fiscal '12 revenues are $11.0 billion to $11.5 billion, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.35 to $1.46 and cash flows from continuing operations at or above $600 million. Please also note that our normal seasonal increase in revenues from Q1 to Q2 is not expected to occur as significantly this year as we have in the past due to program reductions and wind downs during Q2 as well as some continued impact from the continuing resolution and recent budget challenges in Congress. Our expectation is that the second half of this year will deliver the bulk of our internal revenue growth for the year as ramp-up occurs on some recently awarded contracts and given the expected timing of product sales. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Walt."

With respect to D&T and R&D, we do expect Stu and his team to ramp that up over the course of the year, and that could have an impact to his margins. I think the answer to that will largely depend on his revenue projection. So there's a lot of pipeline outstanding in bids. And if we perform well on the revenue front, it may not have an adverse effect to the margins. If there are ongoing delays or funding issues in that area, we probably will decide to continue that level of investment and that could have an adverse effect to the margins, but all within the plan we have for the year and the guidance we've given."

And we intend to reinvest that as we've done for the past couple of years, mostly in revenue-producing initiatives and also to remain competitive on the pricing side."

For the call today, I'll cover market conditions, highlight recent business development results, talk about acquisitions and divestitures and share a special recognition SAIC recently received. And Mark will",1363,"Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. For the call today, I'll cover market conditions, highlight recent business development results, talk about acquisitions and divestitures and share a special recognition SAIC recently received. And Mark will provide the financial details. And of course, we will take your questions. 
At the outset, while continued uncertainty in the markets we serve adversely impacted our performance this quarter, I am encouraged by our contract win rate, our increasing pipeline of new opportunities, our record level of outstanding proposals awaiting decision and the growth we are seeing in our energy and health market areas. Additionally, we are hopeful that the work of the so-called supercommittee of Congress will set us on the path of increased budget certainty into the next year. 
With that said in the short term, as you can see from our earnings release, we continue to experience challenges in converting new contract awards to revenue. The overall federal government acquisition process and the ability and willingness of our customers to ramp up new programs and provide funding for existing programs continues to be negatively impacted by the uncertainty caused by the government budget situation. As a result, spending levels since government fiscal year '11 budget revolutions were enacted have been below our expectations. As Mark will cover later, revenues contracted in the quarter. And we are reducing our expectations for the year to reflect the short-term outlook, which is impacted by the current government uncertainty. 
The overall government solutions and services market is entering a period where we expect spending to be flat for the next couple of years, most likely low single-digit declines and spending for each of the several years afterwards, as our country makes but tough but necessary spending decisions to reduce the federal deficit. This view broadly reflects the $350 billion in defense reductions over the next 10 years that have been enacted by the government plus up to another $500 billion over 10 years that is on the high side of expected reductions, with the second tranche to be decided by the Congressional special commission by this December. These numbers reflect reductions to previous OMB spending estimates, which projected increases in defense spending over the next 10 years. The effect of these cuts, in essence, reduce the previously planned growth in the DoD budget and results in a relatively flat to modest decline compared with today's spending levels. 
Importantly, short-term instability issues aside, this long-term defense spending outlook is consistent with the view we've previously shared and is consistent with our current strategy in whatever manner the macrobudget challenges are resolved, we continue to believe there will be areas of growth in the markets we serve in order to provide solutions to our country's most critical and pressing missions. We are continuing to invest in those areas to ensure we bring the best solutions for customers in support of these missions. 
Regarding our contract awards, bookings totaled $2.3 billion in the second quarter and produced a net book to bill ratio of 0.9. Combined with the 1.3 book to bill we achieved in the first quarter, we have produced a Q2 year-to-date book to bill ratio of 1.1, which is respectable and encouraging in this contracting environment. This ratio reflects our key recompete win on the 10-year NASA Integrated Communications Services contract in the first quarter, along with 6 additional ways of large definite delivery contracts, each in excess of $100 million so far this year. 
We ended the quarter with $17.7 billion in total backlog, of which $5.3 billion was funded. As compared with the first quarter, funding backlog increased by 5%. As compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2011, total backlog increased by 12%. 
I am very encouraged that we achieved a 65% total dollar win rate on business opportunities pursued and awarded through the second quarter. Our high win rate is attributable to our well-targeted investments in business development. This win rate is slightly ahead of last year's first half, which is also encouraging considering the increased amount of bids submitted and the increasing competition. Additionally, submitted proposals awaiting decision continued to increase and now stand at a new peak of $29.2 billion, including $20.3 billion in ID/IQ bids and $8.9 billion in definite delivery bids. This is over $10 billion higher in Q2 a year ago, which should produce growth when the procurement and funding environment stabilizes. 
Our focus on winning larger opportunities continues to yield positive results. We won 6 opportunities valued at more than $100 million each in the second quarter of this year. We added to the 12 opportunities of this size won in the first quarter. That represents a 50% increase in greater than $100 million awards compared with the first half of last year. More additional wins of this size have been achieved following the end of the second quarter. That brings the total of greater than $100 million wins for the year to 22, 7 of which have been definite delivery awards.  
As you can see, in our earnings release today, they are significant awards in this quarter.  Let me take a moment to highlight 2 of these wins, and each of which has an expected value to SAIC of greater than $100 million. Integrated Justice Systems International LLC, a joint venture of SAIC and Tetra Tech, received a multiple award ID/IQ contract to provide worldwide civilian employees and criminal justice assistance to the Department of State's Bureau of International Law and Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs. The 5-year contract has a ceiling of $10 billion for all awardees. This award is important as it represents our first major win in what we referred to as a Smart Power business area with more in the pipeline. 
SAIC also received a multiple award ID/IQ contract to provide broad range of IT services to the Department of Veterans Affairs under the Transformation 21 Total Technology program. The 5-year contract has a ceiling value of $12 billion. 
I would now like to take a moment to highlight SAIC's approach for driving growth in the health IT business to become a leading systems integrator and professional services company in the federal and commercial health markets. In driving towards this goal, we intend to maintain our leadership position in the Military Health System, to expand our presence in Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Health and Human Services. leverage our information integration data analytics, cybersecurity, cloud and modeling and simulation capabilities to drive new health solutions-based offerings for both federal and commercial health clients, and capitalize on new opportunities as federal and commercial health markets converge. We are investing our capital in this growth area, most recently through our acquisition of Vitalize Consulting Solutions, Inc, a leading private provider of clinical business and information technology services for healthcare enterprises. The addition of Vitalize will expand SAIC's health solutions portfolio in both commercial and federal markets to help customers better address electronic health records implementation. The combination of Vitalize's expertise and integrating commercial off-the-shelf software for electronic health records and systems for SAIC's information integration data analytics and cybersecurity capabilities creates a powerful combination in the marketplace. 
As a quick update to the divestiture announced early in the year during the second quarter, the company completed the sale of its operations focused on providing IT services to oil and gas companies to Wipro Ltd, with proceeds of about $170 million. We plan to redeploy those proceeds consistent with our overall best deployment strategy, which will include targeted M&A in our strategic growth markets. 
Before I turn to the discussion over to Mark, I want to close by sharing a special recognition SAIC recently received. SAIC was awarded the Champions of Veterans Enterprise Award from the National Veteran Small Business Coalition for exemplary commitment to working with veteran-owned small businesses. The award is given in recognition of SAIC's strong support and use of veteran-owned and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses as subcontractors and suppliers. It is the only award given to the industry by veteran-owned small business community. With that, Mark will now cover the financial details for the second quarter of fiscal 2012."
110741,138627401,164762,"SAIC, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 31, 2011",2011-08-31,"Earnings Calls","Leidos Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Walt. As discussed, we saw a 7% internal contraction in revenues in the second quarter, 2 percentage points of which were attributable to the VirnetX royalty payment we received last year in, which of course did not recur this year. Revenue con",1148,"Thank you, Walt. As discussed, we saw a 7% internal contraction in revenues in the second quarter, 2 percentage points of which were attributable to the VirnetX royalty payment we received last year in, which of course did not recur this year. Revenue contraction was driven by foreseen lower product deliveries and anticipated reductions in programs like the Brigade Combat Team Modernization, BCTM, and also finishing up our installation of CityTime. We also saw reduced demand for materials under existing programs, lower ramp-ups on recently awarded contracts and slippage on new award decisions. These 3 elements are indicative of the ongoing stressed business conditions in the government acquisition process, which in our view did not materially improve since the passage of the government's fiscal '11 defense budget in April. 
On the positive side, the revenue decline did not have much of an impact on operating profitability, where performance in relatively stable labor-based revenues enabled margins above 8%. Consistent with our strategy and our conviction that some of these conditions are temporary, we continued year-over-year and sequential spending increases in business development, internal R&D to produce business prospects for the long term. Revenue contraction was concentrated outside of our target strategic growth areas, particularly in systems engineering and technical assistance speed up and lower-end contracted services categories. 
We did see growth in some areas. Our energy business grew about 11% and our health business grew about 4%. Operating margins were 8.1% for the quarter, reflecting strong program performance across the enterprise, a relatively mix of higher-margin product deliveries and as I said, increased business development and internal R&D costs. 
As mentioned in the earnings release, w did execute the planned sale of a property in Northern Virginia resulting in a $21 million operating gain. On the other hand, we reached a proposed settlement agreement on the NCCIPS legal case, that's N-C-C-I-P-S and recorded a $22 million charge in Q2 to resolve that matter. part of that charge as nondeductible for tax purposes, explaining the effective tax being slightly above our normative rate in 
Q2. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations contracted 24% over the prior year quarter. VirnetX royalty from last year was the primary cause for this reduction. Absent that item, EPS from continuing operations would have essentially been flat year-over-year. Excluding the royalty, we had about 8 percentage points of EPS erosion from lower revenues, higher interest expense, the higher tax rate. This was offset by an 8% lift in EPS from a reduced share count from our ongoing share repurchase program. 
cash flow for the second quarter came in at $56 million, down about $50 million from last year. This decrease was primarily attributable to absence of royalty payment but also an uptick in day sales outstanding, DSOs. DSOs were 74 days at the end of the quarter, up from 66 days a year ago. There were several contributing reasons for this, including payment delays on some individual contracts, foreseen start-up activities on new energy contracts and negotiated government withholds tied to more lengthy and rigorous DCAA audit programs. 
Capital deployment, we acquired about 10 million shares in the quarter under our ongoing buyback program and completed the Patrick engineering acquisition, together totaling about $200 million in funds used for these purposes. closed the Vitalize acquisition just after the second quarter. 
Now I'll cover the operating results from our 4 segments: Defense Solutions; Health, Energy and Civil Solutions; Intelligence and Cybersecurity Solutions; and the Corporate and Other segment. Revenues from the Defense Solutions segment decreased 6% in Q2 compared with last year. The revenue decline was really attributed to the foreseen wind-down of the CityTime contract and reduced activity on the BCTM program I mentioned earlier. Government acquisition delays and less demand for materials constrained revenues that were planned to offset those declines.  Defense Solutions segment operating margin was 8.1% for the quarter, an increase of 10 basis points over Q2 last year. The increase continues to be driven by effective cost management and strong program performance. 
Revenues for Health, Energy and Civil Solutions segment decreased 2% in the quarter aided by acquisitions. Internal revenues contracted 7%. Drivers of revenue contraction were concentrated on the federal civil solutions side, where we've seen a particularly stressed funding environment and also a slow quarter in the timing of deliveries of security product sales, which are expected to increase for the remainder of this fiscal year. previously mentioned, we experienced positive revenue growth in our energy and health markets, which we expect to be bolstered in future quarters by the recent Patrick Energy Services and Vitalize Consulting acquisitions. Operating margin for this segment was 9.1% in Q2, consistent with last year despite increased amortization expense, lower product sales and higher internal R&D spending primarily focused on next-generation security product systems. Cost efficiency gains enabled that offset. 
The Intelligence and Cybersecurity Solutions segment total and internal revenues decreased 1% compared with last year. The decline was primarily due to the conclusion of an integrated security system contract in theater, partially offset by growth on certain intelligence analysis and airborne surveillance programs with DoD customers. Operating margin for the segment was 8.9%, an improvement of 80 basis points compared to a year ago. Similar to the first quarter of this fiscal year, we continue to see higher margins attributable to increased sales of intelligence proprietary products, strong contract fee performance, cost savings from internal streamlining actions. Cost savings were reinvested to increase internal R&D to build discriminators in the ISR space. 
the Corporate and Other segment, revenues declined in the second quarter due to the episodic revenues from the VirnetX royalty payment last year. segment does not normally have revenues. Corporate and Other segment had unallocated corporate costs of $14 million in the quarter, fairly normative, arising from recurring costs like unallowable [ph] and stock option expenses. 
That covers Q2 financial performance. Now I'll turn on to forward guidance. you'll see in our second quarter 10-Q filing, which we plan to file either tonight or tomorrow, we fully disclosed of the current situation and risks associated with the CityTime contract. As the disclosure provides, we believe a loss on this matter is probable, but we cannot reasonably estimate the amount at this time. Therefore, there's no estimate of loss in the following guidance provided. 
This quarter, we're updating our revenue and earnings per share guidance to reflect our second quarter results and the more cautious view of the short-term market conditions during the remainder of this fiscal year. The revenue we now expect full year revenues to come in between $10.6 billion and $11.0 billion. Our corresponding range for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations on the lower revenue expectations is $1.30 to $1.40 per share. The estimate for operating cash flow remains unchanged from the previous guidance at $600 million or above. I'll hand it back to Walt"

I think for the budgeting purposes, I think the budget that the government will have is going to be pretty well understood especially under a CR. It's going to be essentially what we have in FY '11. I think that the -- and we expect that decisions will start to increase. When we look at the amount of decisions that were made in the first half of the year in big programs, and there are about 30 programs in the first half of the year that got decided, which we did very, very well on even though they were not have ramped up as quickly as we would have liked, we see a significant higher number of pending decisions, almost 2:1 in the second half of the year. Now again, we expect those decisions get made. But if the ramping up doesn't, if tax condition doesn't change and what we've assumed here that there is no change in that condition, that is what's kind of predicating how we think about revenue in the second half. So we think it's not just the case of the budget and funding. It is a case of both the willingness and ability of converting those wins into revenue and having active contracting and the government's willingness to let that funding go. And so we've got a lot of good indicators. But we've tried to say, ""Hey, if nothing changes on the funding of existing programs and new programs from what we saw in the second quarter, then that will shape our thinking around guidance."

110741,138627401,164811,"SAIC, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 31, 2011",2011-08-31,"Earnings Calls","Leidos Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. For the call today, I'll cover market conditions, highlight recent business development results, talk about acquisitions and divestitures, and share a special recognition that SAIC recently received. And Mark",1362,"Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. For the call today, I'll cover market conditions, highlight recent business development results, talk about acquisitions and divestitures, and share a special recognition that SAIC recently received. And Mark will provide the financial details. And of course, we will take your questions. 
At the outset, while continued uncertainty in the markets we serve adversely impacted our performance this quarter, I am encouraged by our contract win rate, our increasing pipeline of new opportunities, our record level of outstanding proposals awaiting decision, and the growth we are seeing in our energy and health market areas. Additionally, we are hopeful that the work of the so-called super committee of Congress will set us on the path of increased budget certainty into the next year. 
With that said in the short term, as you can see from our earnings release, we continue to experience challenges in converting new contract awards to revenue. The overall federal government acquisition process and the ability and willingness of our customers to ramp up new programs and provide funding for existing programs continues to be negatively impacted by the uncertainty caused by the government budget situation. As a result, spending levels since April government fiscal year '11 budget resolutions were enacted, have been below our expectations. 
As Mark will cover later, revenues contracted in the quarter, and we are reducing our expectations for the year to reflect the short-term outlook, which is impacted by the current government uncertainty. 
The overall government solutions and services market is entering a period where we expect spending to be flat for the next couple of years, most likely low single-digit declines and spending for each of the several years afterwards, as our country makes the tough but necessary spending decisions to reduce the federal deficit. 
This view broadly reflects the $350 billion in defense reductions over the next 10 years that have been enacted by the government, plus up to another $500 billion over 10 years that is on the high side of expected reductions, with the second tranche to be decided by the Congressional special commission by this December. 
These numbers reflect reductions to previous OMB spending estimates, which projected increases in defense spending over the next 10 years. The effect of these cuts, in essence, renews the previously planned growth in the DoD budget and results in a relatively flat to modest decline compared with today's spending levels. 
Importantly, short-term instability issues aside, this long-term defense spending outlook is consistent with the view we've previously shared and is consistent with our current strategy in whatever manner the macrobudget challenges are resolved, we continue to believe there will be areas of growth in the markets we serve in order to provide solutions to our country's most critical and pressing missions. We are continuing to invest in those areas to ensure we bring the best solutions for customers in support of these missions. 
Regarding our contract awards, bookings totaled $2.3 billion in the second quarter and produced a net book-to-bill ratio of 0.9. Combined with the 1.3 book to bill we achieved in the first quarter, we have produced a Q2 year-to-date book-to-bill ratio of 1.1, which is respectable and encouraging in this contracting environment. This ratio reflects our key recompete win on the 10-year NASA Integrated Communications Services contract in the first quarter, along with 6 additional wins of large definite delivery contracts, each in excess of $100 million so far this year. 
We ended the quarter with $17.7 billion in total backlog, of which $5.3 billion was funded. As compared with the first quarter, funding backlog increased by 5%. As compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2011, total backlog increased by 12%. 
I am very encouraged that we achieved a 65% total dollar win rate on business opportunities pursued and awarded through the second quarter. Our high win rate is attributable to our well-targeted investments in business development. This win rate is slightly ahead of last year's first half, which is also encouraging, considering the increased amount of bids submitted and the increasing competition. 
Additionally, submitted proposals awaiting decision continued to increase and now stand at a new peak of $29.2 billion, including $20.3 billion in ID/IQ bids and $8.9 billion in definite delivery bids. This is over $10 billion higher in Q2 a year ago, which should produce growth when the procurement and funding environment stabilizes. 
Our focus on winning larger opportunities continues to yield positive results. We won 6 opportunities valued at more than $100 million each in the second quarter of this year. We added to the 12 opportunities of this size won in the first quarter. That represents a 50% increase in greater than $100 million awards compared with the first half of last year. 4 additional wins of this size have been achieved following the end of the second quarter. That brings the total of greater than $100 million wins for the year to 22, 7 of which have been definite delivery awards.  
As you can see, in our earnings release today, they were significant awards in this quarter.  Let me take a moment to highlight 2 of these wins, that each of which has an expected value to SAIC of greater than $100 million. Integrated Justice Systems International LLC, a joint venture of SAIC and Tetra Tech, received a multiple award ID/IQ contract to provide worldwide civilian employees and criminal justice assistance to the Department of State's Bureau of International Law and Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs. The 5-year contract has a ceiling of $10 billion for all awardees. This award is important as it represents our first major win in what we refer to as a Smart Power business area with more in the pipeline. 
SAIC also received a multiple award ID/IQ contract to provide broad range of IT services to the Department of Veterans Affairs under the Transformation 21 Total Technology program. The 5-year contract has a ceiling value of $12 billion. 
I would now like to take a moment to highlight SAIC's approach for driving growth in the health IT business to become a leading systems integrator and professional services company in the federal and commercial health markets. In driving towards this goal, we intend to maintain our leadership position in the Military Health System, and expand our position at Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Health and Human Services; leverage our information integration data analytics, cybersecurity, cloud, and modeling and simulation capabilities to drive new health solutions-based offerings for both federal and commercial health clients; and capitalize on new opportunities as federal and commercial health markets converge. 
We are investing our capital in this growth area, most recently through our acquisition of Vitalize Consulting Solutions, Inc., a leading prime provider of clinical business and information technology services for healthcare enterprises. The addition of Vitalize will expand SAIC's health solutions portfolio in both commercial and federal markets to help customers better address electronic health records implementation. The combination of Vitalize's expertise and integrating commercial off-the-shelf software for electronic health records and systems with SAIC's information integration data analytics, and cybersecurity capabilities creates a powerful combination in the marketplace. 
As a quick update to the divestiture announced early in the year during the second quarter, the company completed a sale of its operations focused on providing IT services to oil and gas companies to Wipro Ltd., or proceeds of about $170 million. We plan to redeploy those proceeds consistent with our overall cash deployment strategy, which will include targeted M&A in our strategic growth markets. 
Before I turn to the discussion over to Mark, I want to close by sharing a special recognition SAIC recently received. SAIC was awarded the Champions of Veterans Enterprise Award from the National Veteran Small Business Coalition for exemplary commitment to working with veteran-owned small businesses. The award is given in recognition of SAIC's strong support and use of veteran-owned and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses as subcontractors and suppliers. It is the only award given to the industry by veteran-owned small business community. With that, Mark will now cover the financial details for the second quarter of fiscal 2012."
110741,138627401,164811,"SAIC, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 31, 2011",2011-08-31,"Earnings Calls","Leidos Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Walt. As discussed, we saw a 7% internal contraction in revenues in the second quarter, 2 percentage points of which were attributable to the VirnetX royalty payment we received last year, which of course did not recur this year. Revenue cont",1163,"Thank you, Walt. As discussed, we saw a 7% internal contraction in revenues in the second quarter, 2 percentage points of which were attributable to the VirnetX royalty payment we received last year, which of course did not recur this year. 
Revenue contraction was driven by foreseen lower product deliveries and anticipated reductions in programs like the Brigade Combat Team Modernization, BCTM, and also finishing up our installation of CityTime. We also saw reduced demand for materials under existing programs, lower ramp-ups on recently awarded contracts and slippage on new award decisions. These 3 elements are indicative of the ongoing stressed business conditions in the government acquisition process, which in our view did not materially improve since the passage of the government's fiscal '11 defense budget in April. 
On the positive side, the revenue decline did not have much of an impact on operating profitability, where performance and relatively stable labor-based revenues enabled margins above 8%. Consistent with our strategy and our conviction that some of these conditions are temporary, we continued year-over-year and sequential spending increases in business development, in internal R&D to produce business prospects for the long term. Revenue contraction was concentrated outside of our target strategic growth areas, particularly in systems engineering and technical assistance, SETA,  and lower-end contracted services categories. 
We did see growth in some areas. Our energy business grew about 11% and our health business grew about 4%. Our operating margins were 8.1% for the quarter, reflecting strong program performance across the enterprise, a relatively light mix of higher-margin product deliveries and as I said, increased business development and internal R&D costs. 
As mentioned in the earnings release, we did execute the planned sale of a property in Northern Virginia, resulting in a $21 million operating gain. On the other hand, we reached a proposed settlement agreement on the NCCIPS legal case, that's N-C-C-I-P-S and recorded a $22 million charge in Q2 to resolve that matter. We deemed part of that charge as nondeductible for tax purposes, explaining the effective tax being slightly above our normative rate in Q2. 
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations contracted 24% over the prior year quarter. The VirnetX royalty last year was the primary cause for this reduction. Absent that item, EPS from continuing operations would have essentially been flat year-over-year. Excluding the royalty, we had about 8 percentage points of EPS erosion from lower revenues, higher interest expense, and a higher tax rate. This was offset by an 8% lift in EPS from a reduced share count from our ongoing share repurchase program. 
Operating cash flow for the second quarter came in at $56 million, down about $50 million from last year. This decrease was primarily attributable to absence of the royalty payment but also an uptick in day sales outstanding, DSOs. DSOs were 74 days at the end of the quarter, up from 66 days a year ago. There were several contributing reasons for this, including payment delays on some individual contracts, foreseen start-up activities on new energy contracts and negotiated government withholds tied to more lengthy and rigorous DCAA audit programs. 
In capital deployment, we acquired about 10 million shares in the quarter under our ongoing buyback program and completed the Patrick engineering acquisition, together totaling about $200 million in funds used for these purposes. We closed the Vitalize acquisition just after the second quarter. 
I'll now cover the operating results from our 4 segments: Defense Solutions; Health, Energy and Civil Solutions; Intelligence and Cybersecurity Solutions; and the Corporate and Other segment. Revenues for the Defense Solutions segment decreased 6% in Q2 compared with last year. This revenue decline was mainly attributed to the foreseen wind-down of the CityTime contract and reduced activity on the BCTM program I mentioned earlier. Government acquisition delays and less demand for materials constrained revenues that were planned to offset those declines. 
The Defense Solutions segment operating margin was 8.1% for the quarter, an increase of 10 basis points over Q2 last year. The increase continues to be driven by effective cost management and strong program performance. 
Revenues for Health, Energy and Civil Solutions segment decreased 2% in the quarter aided by acquisitions. Internal revenues contracted 7%. Drivers of the revenue contraction were concentrated on the federal civil solutions side, where we've seen a particularly stressed funding environment and also a slow quarter in the timing of deliveries of security product sales, which are expected to increase for the remainder of this fiscal year.
As previously mentioned, we experienced positive revenue growth in our energy and health markets, which we expect to be bolstered in future quarters by the recent Patrick Energy Services and Vitalize Consulting acquisitions. 
Operating margin for this segment was 9.1% in Q2, consistent with last year despite increased amortization expense, lower product sales and higher internal R&D spending primarily focused on next-generation security product systems. Cost efficiency gains enabled that offset. 
The Intelligence and Cybersecurity Solutions segment total and internal revenues decreased 1% compared with last year. This decline was primarily due to the conclusion of an integrated security system contract in theater, partially offset by growth on certain intelligence analysis and airborne surveillance programs with DoD customers. 
Operating margin for the segment was 8.9%, an improvement of 80 basis points compared to a year ago. Similar to the first quarter of this fiscal year, we continued to see higher margins attributable to increased sales of intelligence proprietary products, strong contract fee performance, and cost savings from internal streamlining actions. Cost savings were reinvested to increase internal R&D to build discriminators in the ISR space. 
For the Corporate and Other segment, revenues declined in the second quarter due to the episodic revenues from the VirnetX royalty payment last year. This segment does not normally have revenues. The corporate and other segment had unallocated corporate cost of $14 million in the quarter, fairly normative, arising from recurring costs like unallowable and stock option expenses. 
That covers Q2 financial performance. Now I'll turn on to forward guidance. you'll see in our second quarter 10-Q filing, which we plan to file either tonight or tomorrow, we fully disclosed the current situation and risks associated with the CityTime contract. As the disclosure provides, we believe a loss on this matter is probable, but we cannot reasonably estimate the amount at this time. Therefore, there's no estimate of loss in the following guidance provided. 
This quarter, we're updating our revenue and earnings per share guidance to reflect our second quarter results and a more cautious view of the short-term market conditions during the remainder of this fiscal year. The revenue we now expect full year revenues to come in between $10.6 billion and $11.0 billion. 
Our corresponding range for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations on the lower revenue expectations is $1.30 to $1.40 per share. Our estimate for operating cash flow remains unchanged from the previous guidance at $600 million or above. With that, I'll hand it back to Walt."

And we're also winding down some programs that have had very attractive margins over the history, BCTM being one of them but others as well. And so that reflects a little bit of a headwind there.

I think for budgeting purposes, I think the budget that the government will have is going to be pretty well understood especially under a CR. It's going to be essentially what we have in FY '11. I think that the -- and we expect that decisions will start to increase. When we look at the amount of decisions that were made in the first half of the year on big programs, and there were about 30 programs in the first half of the year that got decided, which we did very, very well on even though they were not have ramped up as quickly as we would have liked, we see a significant higher number of pending decisions, almost 2:1 in the second half of the year. Now again, we expect those decisions get made. But if the ramping up doesn't, if that condition doesn't change and what we've assumed here that there is no change in that condition, that is what's kind of predicating how we think about revenue in the second half. So we think it's not just a case of the budget and the funding. It is a case of both the willingness and ability of converting those wins into revenue and having active contracting and the government's willingness to let that funding go. And so we've got a lot of good indicators. But we've tried to say, ""Hey, if nothing changes on the funding of existing programs and new programs from what we saw in the second quarter, then that has shaped our thinking around guidance."

110741,138627401,164835,"SAIC, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 31, 2011",2011-08-31,"Earnings Calls","Leidos Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. For the call today, I'll cover market conditions, highlight recent business development results, talk about acquisitions and divestitures, and share a special recognition that SAIC recently received. And Mark",1366,"Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. For the call today, I'll cover market conditions, highlight recent business development results, talk about acquisitions and divestitures, and share a special recognition that SAIC recently received. And Mark will provide the financial details. And of course, we will take your questions. 
At the outset, while continued uncertainty in the markets we serve adversely impacted our performance this quarter, I am encouraged by our contract win rate, our increasing pipeline of new opportunities, our record level of outstanding proposals awaiting decision, and the growth we are seeing in our energy and health market areas. Additionally, we are hopeful that the work of the so-called super committee of Congress will set us on the path of increased budget certainty into the next year. 
With that said in the short term, as you can see from our earnings release, we continue to experience challenges in converting new contract awards to revenue. The overall federal government acquisition process and the ability and willingness of our customers to ramp up new programs and provide funding for existing programs continues to be negatively impacted by the uncertainty caused by the government budget situation. As a result, spending levels since April, government fiscal year '11 budget resolutions were enacted, have been below our expectations. 
As Mark will cover later, revenues contracted in the quarter, and we are reducing our expectations for the year to reflect the short-term outlook, which is impacted by the current government uncertainty. 
The overall government solutions and services market is entering a period where we expect spending to be flat for the next couple of years. Then most likely low single-digit declines and spending for each of the several years afterwards, as our country makes the tough but necessary spending decisions to reduce the federal deficit. 
This view broadly reflects the $350 billion in defense reductions over the next 10 years that have been enacted by the government, plus up to another $500 billion over 10 years that is on the high side of expected reductions, with the second tranche to be decided by the Congressional special commission by this December. 
These numbers reflect reductions to previous OMB spending estimates, which projected increases in defense spending over the next 10 years. The effect of these cuts, in essence, renews the previously planned growth in the DoD budget and results in a relatively flat to modest decline compared with today's spending levels. 
Importantly, short-term instability issues aside, this long-term defense spending outlook is consistent with the view we've previously shared and is consistent with our current strategy in whatever manner the macrobudget challenges are resolved, we continue to believe there will be areas of growth in the markets we serve in order to provide solutions to our country's most critical and pressing missions. We are continuing to invest in those areas to ensure we bring the best solutions to our customers in support of these missions. 
Regarding our contract awards, bookings totaled $2.3 billion in the second quarter and produced a net book-to-bill ratio of 0.9. Combined with the 1.3 book to bill we achieved in the first quarter, we have produced a Q2 year-to-date book-to-bill ratio of 1.1, which is respectable and encouraging in this contracting environment. This ratio reflects our key recompete win on the 10-year NASA Integrated Communications Services contract in the first quarter, along with 6 additional wins of large definite delivery contracts, each in excess of $100 million so far this year. 
We ended the quarter with $17.7 billion in total backlog, of which $5.3 billion was funded. As compared with the first quarter, funding backlog increased by 5%. As compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2011, total backlog increased by 12%. 
I am very encouraged that we achieved a 65% total dollar win rate on business opportunities pursued and awarded through the second quarter. Our high win rate is attributable to our well-targeted investments in business development. This win rate is slightly ahead of last year's first half, which is also encouraging, considering the increased amount of bids submitted and the increasing competition. 
Additionally, submitted proposals awaiting decision continued to increase and now stand at a new peak of $29.2 billion, including $20.3 billion in ID/IQ bids and $8.9 billion in definite delivery bids. This is over $10 billion higher in Q2 a year ago, which should produce growth when the procurement and funding environment stabilizes. 
Our focus on winning larger opportunities continues to yield positive results. We won 6 opportunities valued at more than $100 million each in the second quarter of this year. We added to the 12 opportunities of this size won in the first quarter. That represents a 50% increase in greater than $100 million awards compared with the first half of last year. 4 additional wins of this size have been achieved following the end of the second quarter. That brings the total of greater than $100 million wins for the year to 22, 7 of which have been definite delivery awards.  
As you can see, in our earnings release today, they were significant awards in this quarter. Let me take a moment to highlight 2 of these wins, that each of which has an expected value to SAIC of greater than $100 million. Integrated Justice Systems International LLC, a joint venture of SAIC and Tetra Tech, received a multiple award ID/IQ contract to provide worldwide civilian employees and criminal justice assistance to the Department of State's Bureau of International Law and Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs. The 5-year contract has a ceiling of $10 billion for all awardees. This award is important as it represents our first major win in what we refer to as a Smart Power business area with more in the pipeline. 
SAIC also received a multiple award ID/IQ contract to provide broad range of IT services to the Department of Veterans Affairs under the Transformation 21 Total Technology program. The 5-year contract has a ceiling value of $12 billion. 
I would now like to take a moment to highlight SAIC's approach for driving growth in the health IT business to become a leading systems integrator and professional services company in the federal and commercial health markets. In driving towards this goal, we intend to maintain our leadership position in the Military Health System, and expand our position at Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Health and Human Services; leverage our information integration data analytics, cyber security, cloud, and modeling and simulation capabilities to drive new health solutions-based offerings for both federal and commercial health clients; and capitalize on new opportunities as federal and commercial health markets converge. 
We are investing our capital in this strategic growth area, most recently through our acquisition of Vitalize Consulting Solutions, Inc., a leading prime provider of clinical business and information technology services for healthcare enterprises. The addition of Vitalize will expand SAIC's health solutions portfolio in both commercial and federal markets to help customers better address electronic health records implementation. The combination of Vitalize's expertise and integrating commercial off-the-shelf software for electronic health records and systems with SAIC's information integration data analytics, and cyber security capabilities creates a powerful combination in the marketplace. 
As a quick update to the divestiture announced early in the year during the second quarter, the company completed a sale of its operations focused on providing IT services to oil and gas companies to Wipro Ltd., or proceeds of about $170 million. We plan to redeploy those proceeds consistent with our overall cash deployment strategy, which will include targeted M&A in our strategic growth markets. 
Before I turn the discussion over to Mark, I want to close by sharing a special recognition SAIC recently received. SAIC was awarded the Champions of Veterans Enterprise Award from the National Veteran Small Business Coalition for exemplary commitment to working with veteran-owned small businesses. The award is given in recognition of SAIC's strong support and use of veteran-owned and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses as subcontractors and suppliers. It is the only award given to the industry by veteran-owned small business community. With that, Mark will now cover the financial details for the second quarter of fiscal 2012."
110741,138627401,164835,"SAIC, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 31, 2011",2011-08-31,"Earnings Calls","Leidos Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Walt. As discussed, we saw a 7% internal contraction in revenues in the second quarter, 2 percentage points of which were attributable to the VirnetX royalty payment we received last year, which of course did not recur this year. Revenue cont",1166,"Thank you, Walt. As discussed, we saw a 7% internal contraction in revenues in the second quarter, 2 percentage points of which were attributable to the VirnetX royalty payment we received last year, which of course did not recur this year. 
Revenue contraction was driven by foreseen lower product deliveries and anticipated reductions in programs like the Brigade Combat Team Modernization, BCTM, and also finishing up our installation of CityTime. We also saw reduced demand for materials under existing programs, lower ramp-ups on recently awarded contracts and slippage on new award decisions. These 3 elements are indicative of the ongoing stressed business conditions in the government acquisition process, which in our view did not materially improve since the passage of the government's fiscal '11 defense budget in April. 
On the positive side, the revenue decline did not have much of an impact on operating profitability, where performance and relatively stable labor-based revenues enabled margins above 8%. Consistent with our strategy and our conviction that some of these conditions are temporary, we continued year-over-year and sequential spending increases in business development, in internal R&D to produce business prospects for the long term. Revenue contraction was concentrated outside of our target strategic growth areas, particularly in systems engineering and technical assistance, SETA, and lower-end contracted services categories. 
We did see growth in some areas. Our energy business grew about 11% and our health business grew about 4%. Our operating margins were 8.1% for the quarter, reflecting strong program performance across the enterprise, a relatively light mix of higher-margin product deliveries and as I said, increased business development and internal R&D costs. 
As mentioned in the earnings release, we did execute the planned sale of a property in Northern Virginia, resulting in a $21 million operating gain. On the other hand, we reached a proposed settlement agreement on the NCCIPS legal case, that's N-C-C-I-P-S and recorded a $22 million charge in Q2 to resolve that matter. We deemed part of that charge as nondeductible for tax purposes, explaining the effective tax rate [ph] being slightly above our normative rate in Q2. 
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations contracted 24% over the prior year quarter. The VirnetX royalty last year was the primary cause for this reduction. Absent that item, EPS from continuing operations would have essentially been flat year-over-year. Excluding the royalty, we had about 8 percentage points of EPS erosion from lower revenues, higher interest expense, and a higher tax rate. This was offset by an 8% lift in EPS from a reduced share count from our ongoing share repurchase program. 
Operating cash flow for the second quarter came in at $56 million, down about $50 million from last year. This decrease was primarily attributable to absence of the royalty payment but also an uptick in day sales outstanding, DSOs. DSOs were 74 days at the end of the quarter, up from 66 days a year ago. There were several contributing reasons for this, including payment delays on some individual contracts, foreseen start-up activities on new energy contracts and negotiated government withholds tied to more lengthy and rigorous DCAA audit programs. 
In capital deployment, we acquired about 10 million shares in the quarter under our ongoing buyback program and completed the Patrick engineering acquisition, together totaling about $200 million in funds used for these purposes. We closed the Vitalize acquisition just after the second quarter. 
I'll now cover the operating results for our 4 segments: Defense Solutions; Health, Energy and Civil Solutions; Intelligence and Cybersecurity Solutions; and the Corporate and Other segment. Revenues for the Defense Solutions segment decreased 6% in Q2 compared with last year. This revenue decline was mainly attributed to the foreseen wind-down of the CityTime contract and reduced activity on the BCTM program I mentioned earlier. Government acquisition delays and less demand for materials constrained new revenues that were planned to offset those declines. 
The Defense Solutions segment operating margin was 8.1% for the quarter, an increase of 10 basis points over Q2 last year. The increase continues to be driven by effective cost management and strong program performance. 
Revenues for Health, Energy and Civil Solutions segment decreased 2% in the quarter aided by acquisitions. Internal revenues contracted 7%. Drivers of the revenue contraction were concentrated on the federal civil solutions side, where we've seen a particularly stressed funding environment and also a slow quarter in the timing of deliveries of security product sales, which are expected to increase through the remainder of this fiscal year.
As previously mentioned, we experienced positive revenue growth in our energy and health markets, which we expect to be bolstered in future quarters by the recent Patrick Energy Services and Vitalize Consulting acquisitions. 
Operating margin for this segment was 9.1% in Q2, consistent with last year despite increased amortization expense, lower product sales and higher internal R&D spending primarily focused on next-generation security product systems. Cost efficiency gains enabled that offset. 
The Intelligence and Cybersecurity Solutions segment total and internal revenues decreased 1% compared with last year. This decline was primarily due to the conclusion of an integrated security system contract in theater, partially offset by growth on certain intelligence analysis and airborne surveillance programs with DoD customers. 
Operating margin for the segment was 8.9%, an improvement of 80 basis points compared to a year ago. Similar to the first quarter of this fiscal year, we continued to see higher margins attributable to increased sales of intelligence proprietary products, strong contract fee performance, and cost savings from internal streamlining actions. Cost savings were reinvested to increase internal R&D to build discriminators in the ISR space. 
For the Corporate and Other segment, revenues declined in the second quarter due to the episodic revenues from the VirnetX royalty payment last year. This segment does not normally have revenues. The Corporate and Other segment had unallocated corporate cost of $14 million in the quarter, fairly normative, arising from recurring costs like unallowable and stock option expenses. 
That covers Q2 financial performance. Now I'll turn on to forward guidance. you'll see in our second quarter 10-Q filing, which we plan to file either tonight or tomorrow, we fully disclosed the current situation and risks associated with the CityTime contract. As the disclosure provides, we believe a loss on this matter is probable, but we cannot reasonably estimate the amount at this time. Therefore, there's no estimate of loss in the following guidance provided. 
This quarter, we're updating our revenue and earnings per share guidance to reflect our second quarter results and a more cautious view of the short-term market conditions during the remainder of this fiscal year. The revenue we now expect full year revenues to come in between $10.6 billion and $11.0 billion. 
Our corresponding range for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations on the lower revenue expectations is $1.30 to $1.40 per share. Our estimate for operating cash flow remains unchanged from the previous guidance at $600 million or above. With that, I'll hand it back to Walt."

And we're also winding down some programs that have had very attractive margins over the history, BCTM being one of them but others as well. And so that reflects a little bit of a headwind there.

I think for budgeting purposes, I think the budget that the government will have is going to be pretty well understood especially under a CR. It's going to be essentially what we have in FY '11. I think that the -- and we expect that decisions will start to increase. When we look at the amount of decisions that were made in the first half of the year on big programs, and there were about 30 programs in the first half of the year that got decided, which we did very, very well on even though they may not have ramped up as quickly as we would have liked, we see a significant higher number of pending decisions, almost 2:1 in the second half of the year. Now again, we expect those decisions get made. But if the ramping up doesn't, if that condition doesn't change and what we've assumed here that there is no change in that condition, that is what's kind of predicating how we think about revenue in the second half. So we think it's not just a case of the budget and the funding. It is a case of both the willingness and ability of converting those wins into revenue and having active contracting and the government's willingness to let that funding go. And so we've got a lot of good indicators. But we've tried to say, ""Hey, if nothing changes on the funding of existing programs and new programs from what we saw in the second quarter, then that has shaped our thinking around guidance."

For the call today, I'll cover market conditions, speak to the [indiscernible] investigation, highlight recent business development results, review acquisitions [indiscernible] then Mark will provide the financial details. [indiscernible] we will take your questions. 
While uncertainty in the markets continue to present challenges to our financial performance this quarter, I am encouraged by our business development results, including our increasing pipeline of new opportunities, record level of submitted proposals awaiting decision, increasing number of large wins, uptick in awards and targeted strategic growth areas and improvement in book-to-bill performance. 
I am also very proud of our employees who continue to deliver outstanding value to our customers. One of the great strengths of SAIC is our culture of focusing on customer success. Our culture is one of strong customer affinity for more than 40 years and an unparalleled understanding of customer mission. 
The overall federal government acquisition process continues to be negatively impacted by the uncertainty caused by the government budget situation. As a result, revenues remained flat in the quarter. Looking ahead, our expectation for the year are for revenues to meet the outlook we shared with you during last quarter's earnings call. 
I would next like to update you on CityTime, the workforce management system that is currently being used by more than 65 New York City municipal agencies. As we've disclosed previously, the U.S. Attorney's Office is conducting a criminal investigation relating to the CityTime program. 2 former SAIC employees, along with other contractors on this program, have been charged with conspiring to defraud the City of New York for their own profit by taking kickbacks and increasing the cost of the program. The 2 former SAIC employees have also been charged with defrauding SAIC by depriving it of their honest services. 
One of these former SAIC employees has pleaded guilty to multiple charges, including taking millions of dollars in kickbacks from an SAIC subcontractor. The company is continuing to cooperate with the U.S. Attorney's investigation but cannot predict its outcome. 
After a comprehensive review of the CityTime program, including a review of management performance, a group president, a deputy group president and a business unit general manager responsible for management and oversight of the CityTime program were removed and are no longer with the company. The company is not aware of any evidence that these individuals had any personal involvement in the CityTime fraud. 
In addition to taking these personnel actions, the company engaged an outside law firm to assist company leadership in conducting a comprehensive review of key policies and practices and direct enhancement to strengthen the company's culture of ethics, accountability and compliance. As a result of this systemic review, the implementation of process improvements and control enhancements by the company is now underway. 
In addition, a special committee of the Board of Directors that is overseeing the company's response to CityTime has engaged an independent company Guidepost Solutions and specifically its chairman, Bart Schwartz, to undertake its own review that monitor the efforts the company is making in response to this matter. 
Based on developments related to the CityTime matter since our last quarterly filing, the company now estimates that its loss relating to the CityTime program will be at least $232 million. Accordingly, we have taken a loss provision for that amount this quarter. An updated description of the CityTime matter will be included in the 10-Q, which were filed this week. 
Turning to market conditions. While there has been a large volume of rhetoric and speculation regarding the federal budgeting process, the overall government solutions and services market outlook remains unchanged since we spoke with you last. Our customers are being told to do more with less or at a minimum to hold the line. As a result, we expect spending to be flat at best for the next couple of years, with low single-digit spending declines in the following out years. 
We continue to believe there will be areas of nominal growth such as intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, cyber security, logistics readiness and sustainment; energy; and health IT. We have and will continue to invest in these areas to provide our customers with the solutions they require. 
Moving on to our business development results. Bookings totaled $3.8 billion in the third quarter and produced a net book-to-bill ratio of 1.3. Combined with a book-to-bill ratio we achieved in the first 2 quarters, we have produced a solid year-to-date book-to-bill ratio of 1.2, which reflect the strength of our strategy and people. 
We ended the quarter with $18 billion in total backlog. $6.3 billion was funded, up nearly $1 billion or 19% from the second quarter. And as compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2011, total backlog increased by 16%. 
I am very encouraged that we have achieved the 63% total dollar win rate on business opportunities pursued and awarded through the third quarter. Our high win rate is attributable to strong program execution and well-targeted investments in business development. This win rate is consistent with last year's, reflecting positive results of these targeted investments considering the increased amount of bids submitted and increasing competition. 
Additionally, submitted proposals awaiting decision continued to increase and now stand at a new peak of $30.6 billion, consisting of $21.7 billion in ID/IQ bids and $8.9 billion indefinite-delivery bids. This is $7.6 billion higher than Q3 a year ago, which we expect will produce growth when these procurements are decided. 
Our focus on winning larger opportunities continues to yield positive results. We won 13 opportunities valued at more than $100 million in the third quarter of FY '12. When added to the 18 opportunities of this size we won in the first half of the year, this represents a 55% increase compared with the first 3 quarters of last year. 
Recently, we won 4 additional large programs following the end of the third quarter, which brings the total of greater than $100 million wins for the fiscal year to 35 compared to 26 for all of last year, a record for us. 
There were many significant awards this quarter. Let me take a moment to highlight 2 of these wins, each of which has expected value to SAIC of greater than $100 million. These are just 2 examples of SAIC's continuing to bring the best solution at the best value to our customers. 
First, SAIC was awarded the Tire Successor Initiative contract by the Defense Logistics Agency. This competitively won single award ID/IQ has an estimated value of $1.1 billion over 7 years. Under this contract, SAIC will provide end-to-end wide chain management for all U.S. Military land vehicle and aircraft tires. 
Previously, SAIC had been a subcontractor to Michelin for only land vehicle tires. With this win, SAIC has significantly enhanced its position as a leading logistics contractor for the Defense Logistics Agency. 
Also during the third quarter, SAIC was awarded 2 task order contracts totaling nearly $600 million for ongoing sustainment of mine-resistant ambush-protected or MRAP vehicles in both Kuwait and Afghanistan. Like the Tire Successor Initiative contract, this win on the MRAP joint logistics integrator contract demonstrates the kind of progress SAIC is making toward realizing the exceptional results we have targeted in our strategic growth area of logistics readiness and sustainment. 
I would now like to take a few moments to highlight an exciting development in SAIC's approach for driving growth in cyber security, namely our recently announced strategic partner alliance with McAfee, the world's largest dedicated security technology company. 
This strategic alliance will enable SAIC and McAfee to offer a new combination of cyber security solutions to meet the sophisticated threats faced by large, complex enterprises around the world. Cyber threats are outpacing the traditional hardware-based defense and depth models by an alarming margin at a time when critical data more commonly moves beyond the enterprise network to mobile endpoints. 
McAfee technology, combined with SAIC solution-based deployment approach, and our CloudShield CS4000 security solution, will offer advanced security across the network by using reprogrammable hardware platforms that intelligently adapt to anticipate, detect, remediate cyber threats in sophisticated network infrastructures. This more agile capability allows enterprises to select virtualized services and applications based on their unique threats and desired security posture, an alternative approach that is long overdue. 
Corporate leaders and governments understand cyber security is an enterprise risk that continues to evolve, and our companies need solutions that can adapt to this changing environment. The same is true of enterprises who must adapt to protect national security. Financial institutions share robust capabilities in order to guard billions of dollars in transactions; the health industry, which is moving toward digital health record; energy companies adapting smart grid technology and telecommunications companies that must ensure quality of service while also shielding millions of consumers from fraudulent activities. 
The coupling of McAfee's industry-leading security products with SAIC's CloudShield security products provides both companies with greatly experienced access to new markets and overall stronger combined solutions. 
Moving on to acquisitions. We completed in the quarter the acquisition of Vitalize Consulting Services (sic) [Solutions], a leading provider of clinical business and information technology services for health enterprises. The deal enables SAIC to expand in commercial health provider market and leverage its information integration and data analytics expertise with VCS's healthcare IT and clinical workforce optimization capabilities to further grow as commercial and federal health markets converge. Approximately 600 VCS employees joined SAIC. 
Before I turn the discussion over to Mark, I want to share several special recognitions. The first accomplishment I would like to recognize is the successful launch of SAIC's commercially-hosted infrared payload or CHIRP sensor into space. The CHIRP sensor was integrated onto a commercial telecommunications satellite, the first time on national security payload has been hosted on a commercial satellite. The CHIRP sensor uses an electrooptical telescope to persistently view a quarter of the earth from geosynchronous orbit. Its a wide field of view infrared sensor is used to sense bright spots on the surface of the earth that aid in the early warning of missile launching and to support other military missions. 
The sensor is remotely commanded and monitored from the SAIC-developed CHIRP Mission Analysis Center or CMAC, in Seal Beach, California. This program is an example how the government can achieve significant savings by taking advantage of commercially-hosted payloads based upon a more agile development environment and allows us to plan and implement space missions on shorter schedules compared to the time it takes to procure an entire satellite in as short as 24 months. 
CHIRP was successfully powered on, on October 23 and is currently undergoing orbit testing. First successful collections occurred on October 24. As recently reported in Aviation Week and Space Technology, the Air Force is impressed with the results so far. 
Second, I'm happy to recognize that in November, a team from SAIC won NASA's prestigious Spaceflight Awareness Award for our design and building a high-technology fiber acoustic test facility that will support development of NASA's New Orion space system. 
Third and also in cyber security, SAIC founded the Maryland Cyber Security Challenging Conference in October, with 312 challengers split into 15 teams across professionals, colleges and high schools. Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley helped the launch the event, and 3 weeks ago, NSA Director General Keith Alexander and University of Maryland Baltimore County President, Freeman Hrabowski, recognized the awardees at a dinner in their honor on November 18. 
Fourth, I would like to recognize that SAIC is a proud founding partner and continuing supporter of Cyber Patriot, the nation's largest and fastest-growing high school cyber security challenge competition, which is building the next generation of cyber security professionals. This year's competition got underway on October with over 1,000 teams, representing all 50 states and will conclude in March 2012. 
Fifth, I'm glad to recognize that SAIC has been ranked one of the top 100 military employers by G.I. Jobs Magazine in recognition of our long-term commitment to hiring former military members and our progressive policies to reserve and guard members called to active duty. SAIC presently employs over 8,000 former military members, including over 2,300 disabled veterans. 
Finally, I would like to point out that SAIC was recognized again this year on Newsweek's annual Green Rankings, rising to 44 among the greenest 500 companies in the United States, up from 192 last year. SAIC recently announced its goal to reduce operational greenhouse emissions 25% by 2020, reinforcing its commitment to sustainable business practices and other corporate responsibility initiatives. 
Also, I'd like to update you on the CEO succession process. The Board of Directors has established a special committee to identify and assess both internal and external candidates for the CEO position. Their work is well underway, with the expectation that a new CEO will be in place not later than my planned retirement date of June 15, 2012. We should note that since my retirement announcement and through my last day at SAIC, I continue to remain fully engaged and committed to executing my role as CEO, ensuring we focus on creating enduring shareholder value. 
In closing, I would like to emphasize once again that SAIC prides itself on its history of ethics and integrity. While some aspects of our third quarter performance were overshadowed by CityTime, we performed well in new business development and cash flow while continuing to provide strong execution on programs of national significance, demonstrating the underlying strength of SAIC and its employees. 
Mark will now cover the financial details for the third quarter of fiscal 2012."
110741,142590409,199512,"SAIC, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Dec 06, 2011",2011-12-06,"Earnings Calls","Leidos Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Walt. As mentioned in today's release, our results for the third quarter were pretty much as expected before considering the effects of the loss provision concerning CityTime. The CityTime loss provision was recorded as a $52 million reduction",1614,"Thank you, Walt. As mentioned in today's release, our results for the third quarter were pretty much as expected before considering the effects of the loss provision concerning CityTime. The CityTime loss provision was recorded as a $52 million reduction to revenue and $180 million charge to SG&A expense, aggregating to a $230 million pretax loss. 
We reflected a large portion of the charge to SG&A as nondeductible for tax purposes, which is why the effective tax rate was well above normal for the quarter. Consequently, the loss provision had a material impact from the financial results for the third quarter and for the full fiscal year 2012 expected results. We have provided a pro forma set of statements in today's earnings release to show our results with and without this item. 
As Walt discussed, total revenues were flat in the quarter, comprised of 2% growth from acquisitions, offset by 2% internal revenue contraction. All of the internal revenue contraction was attributable to the $52 million revenue reduction related to the CityTime loss provision. 
We continue to generate growth in select areas of the business that are more attractive in today's market. However, that growth was offset by wind-downs of a few larger programs completed earlier this year and brought our contraction primarily in certain defense and federal civilian areas. 
Overall, the 5 parts of the business we call our strategic growth areas: Cyber, ISR, energy, logistics readiness and sustainability and health rose internally in revenues 6% over last year, with ISR and cyber being the most significant favorable drivers. 
We recorded an operating loss of $17 million for the quarter, driven by the $232 million pretax CityTime loss provision. Operating income excluding the loss provision was $215 million or 7.5% of revenue. Within that, we also took a $19 million impairment asset charge related to certain technologies from our CloudShield acquisition made in 2010. That accounted for about 70 basis points of operating margin. 
Margin excluding both the CityTime loss provision and the impairment charge exceeded 8% in the third quarter, a level consistent with profitability in the first and second quarter. Within that, it's important to note we concurrently and significantly increased research and development investments all year, which we believe will offer margin enhancement opportunities in future years. 
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations resulted in a loss of $0.27 per share this quarter, with the CityTime loss provision having a $0.62 per share impact. x CityTime, earnings per share was $0.35. 
Operating cash flow for the third quarter came in at $423 million, bringing year-to-date cash flow to well above $600 million. Much of this stemmed from a 3-day sequential improvement in days sales outstanding during the quarter, which finished at 71 days. 
The areas of capital deployment we acquired about 3 million shares in the beginning of the quarter under our ongoing buyback program and completed the Vitalize Consulting acquisition, together totaling about $240 million in funds used in the period. 
Now let me cover our operating results for our 4 segments. Revenues for the Defense Solutions segment decreased by 8% in the third quarter compared with last year. More than 1/2 of the revenue decline was from the revenue portion of the loss provision related to CityTime, the effects of which were entirely reflected in this segment, the Defense Solutions segment. 
The remainder of the revenue contraction was from the wind-down of the U.S. Army Brigade Combat Team Modernization Contract, BCTM, which ended in the third quarter and other reduced activity on an infrastructure support services program. Offsetting these declines, we continue to ramp up in our Department of State Vanguard Enterprise Network IT program and now continue to drive growth on our AMCOM systems and software maintenance program for the U.S. Army. 
We also experienced solid growth in our logistics business, driven by a material resupply purchases and additional work on combat vehicle integration and maintenance activities. 
Defense Solutions segment had an operating loss of $133 million, reflecting the CityTime loss provision. Excluding CityTime, the segment had operating income of $99 million or 8.5% of revenues. 
Revenue for our Health, Energy and Civil Solutions segment increased 6% during the third quarter compared to a year ago, driven mainly by revenue from the acquisition of Vitalize Consulting. Internal revenues grew 1%, which reflects increases in several areas: delivery of nonintrusive inspection systems; design, build activities related to geothermal power plant construction; healthcare, IT and consulting services and increased disaster recovery support services. These were offset by declines in various federal civilian programs, including those supporting NASA. 
Operating margin for the Health, Energy and Civil Solutions segment improved to 10.6% in the third quarter, reflecting increased deliveries of nonintrusive inspection systems and higher healthcare IT consultant services, that's primarily from the Vitalize acquisition. Both of those have higher profitability relative to other business areas in the segment. 
Intelligence and Cybersecurity Solutions segment total and internal revenues increased 5% compared with last year. This increase was primarily driven by increased activity on our airborne surveillance programs, increased materials deliveries under an existing processing exploitation and dissemination contract and increased cyber security program activities as well. These increases were partially offset by declines in activity on a variety of programs, particularly with DoD customers in the areas of intelligence analysis and maritime ISR. 
Operating margin for the Intelligence and Cybersecurity Solutions segment was 5.6%, down significantly from previous quarters. Decline in operating margin was entirely driven by the $19 million impairment charge on the purchased intangibles related to CloudShield and also increased investment in R&D and bid and proposal expenses, which was partially offset by revenue growth and increased sales of higher-margin proprietary products in the ISR arena. 
The impairment charge was primarily associated with lower-than-expected sales of certain CloudShield products. We, however, remain optimistic and committed to the future prospects of CloudShield. In particular, we recently completed next-generation deep packet inspection technology embodied in the CS 4000 system or the foundation of that confidence. We believe our recently announced strategic partnering alliance with McAfee is a catalyst for increased sales across both commercial clients and our installed government business space. 
Corporate and Other segment had unallocated corporate costs of $16 million in the quarter, arising from recurring costs like stock options and other unallowable expenses. That covers my remarks on the third quarter. I'll now finish up with our forward guidance for the remainder of fiscal '12. That, of course, ends on January 31, 2012. 
As you'll see in our third quarter 10-Q filing, we have fully disclosed the lists associated with the CityTime contract. However, with risk of additional possible losses, fiscal '12 guidance does not include any charges beyond the $232 million CityTime loss provision we took during the third quarter. 
Also, given the difficulty of determining the timing of any payments with respect to the CityTime matter, our cash flow guidance excludes any payment assumption for this fiscal year. 
Finally, we are continuing to provide guidance on a GAAP basis consistent with past practice, which include the impact of CityTime. However, given the nature and magnitude of this item, we provided guidance on a pro forma basis without CityTime to show expected results of more normalized business activities. 
Within that, our fiscal '12 cap guidance for revenue and cash flow are unchanged from last quarter whereas earnings per share is reduced $0.60 for the full year effect of the CityTime loss provision taken this quarter. That is the only change to fiscal '12 guidance at this time. 
Accordingly, we expect full year fiscal '12 revenues to come in between $10.6 billion and $11 billion and operating cash flow at $600 million or above. GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is being adjusted $0.60 downward to $0.70 to $0.80 per share full year guidance. Guidance for EPS on a pro forma basis, which excludes CityTime remains the same $1.30 to $1.40 range that we provided in our last Q2 earnings call. 
Thus for fiscal 2013, we have historically provided initial guidance at this point in time during our third quarter earnings release. Going forward, we are changing our cadence to initiate guidance for our next new fiscal year to our fourth quarter earnings release. We will have the benefit of having completed the previous fiscal year and will provide more time to evaluate developments in the federal budget cycle. Accordingly, we are not providing fiscal '13 guidance today but we'll plan to do so in March. 
To summarize my remarks, we had some special nonrecurring charges this quarter which will likely capture the headlines. However, performance across our broader business space showed both improvement and strength. Excluding the 2 special items, CityTime and the impairment, internal revenue growth was flat quarter-over-quarter, reversing course from contraction in the first half of the year. On that same basis, operating profits have stayed above 8% all year while we have increased our R&D investment of well over 50% year-over-year. This reflects our view that building capabilities in differentiated technology will be increasingly important in this market. The improved days sales outstanding by 3 days during the third quarter and have delivered almost $600 million and free cash flow so far this year. 
Finally, our focus on strategic growth areas in larger contracts has yielded record wins in the $100 million-plus category and a new peak in the value of bids outstanding as Walt mentioned earlier. These are the performance metrics that better reflect the commitment and focus of the people of SAIC, which will continue to be the basis of our confidence and sound financial execution going forward. 
With that, I'll now turn it back over to Walt."

The additional IR&D that we've used this year and BNP that we've used this year and the allocation of our SG&A has been focused on those higher -- potentially higher growth areas, and we believe those growth areas, notwithstanding the budget downturn will continue to have an enduring nature, and so that's how we are dealing with, from a strategic standpoint, dealing with the inevitable downturn in the budget.

For the call today, I'll cover market conditions, speak to the ongoing CityTime investigation, highlight recent business development results, review acquisitions and share several special recognitions, then Mark will provide the financial details and then we will take your questions. 
While uncertainty in the markets continue to present challenges to our financial performance this quarter, I am encouraged by our business development results, including our increasing pipeline of new opportunities, record level of submitted proposals awaiting decision, increasing number of large wins, uptick in awards and targeted strategic growth areas and improvement in book-to-bill performance. 
I am also very proud of our employees who continue to deliver outstanding value to our customers. One of the great strengths of SAIC is our culture of focusing on customer success. Our culture is one of strong customer affinity for more than 40 years and an unparalleled understanding of customer mission. 
The overall federal government acquisition process continues to be negatively impacted by the uncertainty caused by the government budget situation. As a result, revenues remained flat in the quarter. Looking ahead, our expectation for the year are for revenues to meet the outlook we shared with you during last quarter's earnings call. 
I would next like to update you on CityTime, the workforce management system that is currently being used by more than 65 New York City municipal agencies. As we've disclosed previously, the U.S. Attorney's office is conducting a criminal investigation relating to the CityTime program. Two former SAIC employees, along with other contractors on this program, have been charged with conspiring to defraud the City of New York for their own profit by taking kickbacks and increasing the cost of the program. The 2 former SAIC employees have also been charged with defrauding SAIC by depriving it of their honest services. 
One of these former SAIC employees has pleaded guilty to multiple charges, including taking millions of dollars in kickbacks from an SAIC subcontractor. The company is continuing to cooperate with the U.S. Attorney's investigation, but cannot predict its outcome. 
After a comprehensive review of the CityTime program, including a review of management performance, a group president, a deputy group president and a business unit general manager responsible for management and oversight of the CityTime program were removed and are no longer with the company. The company is not aware of any evidence that these individuals had any personal involvement in the CityTime fraud. 
In addition to taking these personnel actions, the company engaged an outside law firm to assist company leadership in conducting a comprehensive review of key policies and practices and to recommend enhancement to strengthen the company's culture of ethics, accountability and compliance. As a result of this systemic review, the implementation of process improvements and control enhancements by the company is now underway. 
In addition, a special committee of the Board of Directors that is overseeing the company's response to CityTime has engaged an independent company, Guidepost Solutions, and specifically its chairman, Bart Schwartz, to undertake its own review and monitor the efforts the company is making in response to this matter. 
Based on developments related to the CityTime matter since our last quarterly filing, the company now estimates that its loss relating to the CityTime program will be at least $232 million. Accordingly, we have taken a loss provision for that amount this quarter. An updated description of the CityTime matter will be included in the 10-Q, which we will file this week. 
Turning to market conditions. While there has been a large volume of rhetoric and speculation regarding the federal budgeting process, the overall government solutions and services market outlook remains unchanged since we spoke with you last. Our customers are being told to do more with less or at a minimum to hold the line. As a result, we expect spending to be flat at best for the next couple of years, with low single-digit spending declines in the following out years. 
We continue to believe there will be areas of nominal growth such as intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; cybersecurity; logistics, readiness and sustainment; energy; and health IT. We have and we'll continue to invest in these areas to provide our customers with the solutions they require. 
Moving on to our business development results. Bookings totaled $3.8 billion in the third quarter and produced a net book-to-bill ratio of 1.3. Combined with the book-to-bill ratio we achieved in the first 2 quarters, we have produced a solid year-to-date book-to-bill ratio of 1.2, which reflect the strength of our strategy and people. 
We ended the quarter with $18 billion in total backlog. $6.3 billion was funded, up nearly $1 billion or 19% from the second quarter. And as compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2011, total backlog increased by 16%. 
I am very encouraged that we have achieved the 63% total dollar win rate on business opportunities pursued and awarded through the third quarter. Our high win rate is attributable to strong program execution and well-targeted investments and business development. This win rate is consistent with last year's, reflecting positive results of these targeted investments considering the increased amount of bids submitted and increasing competition. 
Additionally, submitted proposals awaiting decision continued to increase and now stand at a new peak of $30.6 billion, consisting of $21.7 billion in ID/IQ bids and $8.9 billion indefinite delivery bids. This is $7.6 billion higher than Q3 a year ago, which we expect will produce growth when these procurements are decided. 
Our focus on winning larger opportunities continues to yield positive results. We won 13 opportunities valued at more than $100 million in the third quarter of FY '12. When added to the 18 opportunities of this size we won in the first half of the year, this represents a 55% increase compared with the first 3 quarters of last year. 
Recently, we won 4 additional large programs following the end of the third quarter, which brings the total of greater than $100 million wins for the fiscal year to 35 compared to 26 for all of last year, a record for us.
There were many significant awards this quarter. Let me take a moment to highlight 2 of these wins, each of which has an expected value to SAIC of greater than $100 million. These are just 2 examples of SAIC's continuing to bring the best solution at the best value to our customer.
First, SAIC was awarded the Tire Successor Initiative contract by the Defense Logistics Agency. This competitively won single award ID/IQ has an estimated value of $1.1 billion over 7 years. Under this contract, SAIC will provide end-to-end wide chain management for all U.S. Military land vehicle and aircraft tires. 
Previously, SAIC had been a subcontractor to Michelin for only land vehicle tires. With this win, SAIC has significantly enhanced its position as a leading logistics contractor for the Defense Logistics Agency. 
Also during the third quarter, SAIC was awarded 2 task order contracts totaling nearly $600 million for ongoing sustainment of Mine-Resistant-Ambush-Protected or MRAP vehicles in both Kuwait and Afghanistan. Like the Tire Successor Initiative contract, this win on the MRAP joint logistics integrator contract demonstrates the kind of progress SAIC is making toward realizing the exceptional results we have targeted in our strategic growth area of logistics, readiness and sustainment. 
I would now like to take a few moments to highlight an exciting development in SAIC's approach for driving growth in cybersecurity, namely our recently announced strategic partnering alliance with McAfee, the world's largest dedicated security technology company. 
This strategic alliance will enable SAIC and McAfee to offer a new combination of cybersecurity solutions to meet the sophisticated threats faced by large, complex enterprises around the world. Cyber threats are outpacing the traditional hardware-based defense and depth models by an alarming margin at a time when critical data more commonly moves beyond the enterprise network to mobile endpoints. 
McAfee technology, combined with SAIC solution-based deployment approach, and our CloudShield CS-4000 security solution, will offer advanced security across the network by using reprogrammable hardware platforms that intelligently adapt to anticipate, detect, remediate cyber threats in sophisticated network infrastructures. This more agile capability allows enterprises to select virtualized services and applications based on their unique threats and desired security posture, an alternative approach that is long overdue. 
Corporate leaders and governments understand cyber security is an enterprise risk that continues to evolve, and their companies need solutions that can adapt to this changing environment. The same is true of enterprises who must adapt to protect national security. Financial institutions led by share [ph] robust capabilities in order to guard billions of dollars in transactions. The health industry, which is moving toward digital health record; energy companies adapting smart grid technology; and telecommunications companies that must ensure quality of service while also shielding millions of customers from fraudulent activities. 
The coupling of McAfee's industry-leading security products with SAIC's CloudShield security products provides both companies with greatly expanded access to new markets and overall stronger combined solutions. 
Moving on to acquisitions. We completed in the quarter the acquisition of Vitalize Consulting Services (sic) [Solutions], a leading provider of clinical business and information technology services for health enterprises. The deal enables SAIC to expand in the commercial health provider market and leverage its information integration and data analytics expertise with VCS's healthcare IT and clinical workforce optimization capabilities to further grow as commercial and federal health markets converge. Approximately 600 VCS employees joined SAIC. 
Before I turn the discussion over to Mark, I want to share several special recognitions. First accomplishment I would like to recognize is the successful launch of SAIC's Commercially Hosted Infrared Payload or CHIRP sensor into space. The CHIRP sensor was integrated onto a commercial telecommunications satellite, the first time a national security payload has been hosted on a commercial satellite. The CHIRP sensor uses an electro-optical telescope to persistently view a quarter of the earth from geosynchronous orbit, so a wide-field-of-view infrared sensor is used to sense bright spots on the surface of the earth that aid in the early warning of missile launches and to support other military missions. 
The sensor is remotely commanded and monitored from the SAIC-developed CHIRP Mission Analysis Center or CMAC in Seal Beach, California. This program is an example how the government can achieve significant savings by taking advantage of commercially hosted payloads based upon a more agile development environment and allows us to plan and implement space missions on shorter schedules compared to the time it takes to procure an entire satellite in as short as 24 months. 
CHIRP was successfully powered on, on October 23 and is currently undergoing orbit testing. First successful collections occurred on October 24. As recently reported in Aviation Week & Space Technology, the Air Force is impressed with the results so far. 
Second, I'm happy to recognize that in November, a team from SAIC won NASA's prestigious Space Flight Awareness Award for our design and building a high-technology fiber acoustic test facility that will support development of NASA's New Orion space system. 
Third and also in cybersecurity, SAIC founded the Maryland Cybersecurity Challenge and Conference in October, with 312 challengers split into 15 teams across professionals, colleges and high schools. Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley helped launch the event, and 3 weeks ago, NSA Director, General Keith Alexander, and University of Maryland, Baltimore County President, Freeman Hrabowski, recognized the awardees at a dinner in their honor on November 18. 
Fourth, I would like to recognize that SAIC is a proud founding partner and continuing supporter of Cyber Patriot, the nation's largest and fastest-growing high school cybersecurity challenge competition, which is building the next generation of cybersecurity professionals. This year's competition got underway on October with over 1,000 teams, representing all 50 states and will conclude in March 2012. 
Fifth, I'm glad to recognize that SAIC has been ranked one of the top 100 military employers by G.I. Jobs Magazine in recognition of our long-term commitment to hiring former military members and our progressive policies to reserve and guard members called to active duty. SAIC presently employs over 8,000 former military members, including over 2,300 disabled veterans. 
Finally, I would like to point out that SAIC has recognized again this year on Newsweek's Annual Green Rankings, rising to 44 among the greenest 500 companies in the United States, up from 192 last year. SAIC recently announced its goal to reduce operational greenhouse emissions 25% by 2020, reinforcing its commitment to sustainable business practices and other corporate responsibility initiatives. 
Also, I'd like to update you on the CEO succession process. The Board of Directors has established a special committee to identify and assess both internal and external candidates for the CEO position. Their work is well underway, with the expectation that a new CEO will be in place not later than my planned retirement date of June 15, 2012. We should note that since my retirement announcement and through my last day at SAIC, I continue to remain fully engaged and committed to executing my role as CEO, ensuring we focus on creating enduring shareholder value. 
In closing, I would like to emphasize once again that SAIC prides itself on its history of ethics and integrity. While some aspects of our third quarter performance were overshadowed by CityTime, we performed well in new business development and cash flow, while continuing to provide strong execution on programs of national significance, demonstrating the underlying strength of SAIC and its employees. 
Mark will now cover the financial details for the third quarter of fiscal 2012."
110741,142590409,199565,"SAIC, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Dec 06, 2011",2011-12-06,"Earnings Calls","Leidos Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Walt. As mentioned in today's release, our results for the third quarter were pretty much as expected before considering the effects of the loss provision concerning CityTime. The CityTime loss provision was recorded as a $52 million reduction",1611,"Thank you, Walt. As mentioned in today's release, our results for the third quarter were pretty much as expected before considering the effects of the loss provision concerning CityTime. The CityTime loss provision was recorded as a $52 million reduction to revenue and $180 million charge to SG&A expense, aggregating to a $230 million pretax loss. 
We reflected a large portion of the charge to SG&A as nondeductible for tax purposes, which is why the effective tax rate was well above normal for the quarter. Consequently, the loss provision had a material impact from the financial results for the third quarter and for the full fiscal year 2012 expected results. We have provided a pro forma set of statements in today's earnings release to show our results with and without this item. 
As Walt discussed, total revenues were flat in the quarter, comprised of 2% growth from acquisitions, offset by 2% internal revenue contraction. All of the internal revenue contraction was attributable to the $52 million revenue reduction related to the CityTime loss provision. 
We continue to generate growth in select areas of the business that are more attractive in today's market. However, that growth was offset by wind downs of a few larger programs completed earlier this year and brought our contraction primarily in certain defense and federal civilian areas. 
Overall, the 5 parts of the business we call our strategic growth areas: cyber; ISR; energy, logistics, readiness and sustainment; and health rose internally in revenues 6% over last year, with ISR and cyber being the most significant favorable drivers. 
We recorded an operating loss of $17 million for the quarter, driven by the $232 million pretax CityTime loss provision. Operating income excluding the loss provision was $215 million or 7.5% of revenue. Within that, we also took a $19 million impairment asset charge related to certain technologies from our CloudShield acquisition made in 2010. That accounted for about 70 basis points of operating margin. 
Margin excluding both the CityTime loss provision and the impairment charge exceeded 8% in the third quarter, a level consistent with profitability in the first and second quarter. Within that, it's important to note we concurrently and significantly increased research and development investments all year, which we believe will offer margin enhancement opportunities in future years. 
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations resulted in a loss of $0.27 per share this quarter, with the CityTime loss provision having a $0.62 per share impact. Ex-CityTime, earnings per share was $0.35. 
Operating cash flow for the third quarter came in at $423 million, bringing year-to-date operating cash flow to well above $600 million. Much of this stemmed from a 3-day sequential improvement in days sales outstanding during the quarter, which finished at 71 days. 
The areas of capital deployment, we acquired about 3 million shares in the beginning of the quarter under our ongoing buyback program and completed the Vitalize Consulting acquisition, together totaling about $240 million in funds used in the period. 
Now let me cover our operating results for our 4 segments. Revenues for the Defense Solutions segment decreased by 8% in the third quarter compared with last year. More than half of the revenue decline was from the revenue portion of the loss provision related to CityTime, the effects of which were entirely reflected in this segment, the Defense Solutions segment. 
Remainder of the revenue contraction was from the wind down of the U.S. Army Brigade Combat Team Modernization Contract, BCTM, which ended in the third quarter and other reduced activity on an infrastructure support services program. Offsetting these declines, we continue to ramp up in our Department of State Vanguard enterprise network IT program, and now continue to drive growth on our AMCOM systems and software maintenance program for the U.S. Army. 
We also experienced solid growth in our logistics business, driven by a material resupply purchases and additional work on combat vehicle integration and maintenance activities. 
Defense Solutions segment had an operating loss of $133 million, reflecting the CityTime loss provision. Excluding CityTime, the segment had operating income of $99 million or 8.5% of revenues. 
Revenue for our Health, Energy and Civil Solutions segment increased 6% during the third quarter compared to a year ago, driven mainly by revenue from the acquisition of Vitalize Consulting. Internal revenues grew 1%, which reflects increases in several areas: delivery of nonintrusive inspection systems; DesignBuild activities related to geothermal power plant construction; healthcare IT consulting services; and increased disaster recovery support services. These were offset by declines in various federal civilian programs, including those supporting NASA. 
Operating margin for the Health, Energy and Civil Solutions segment improved to 10.6% in the third quarter, reflecting increased deliveries of nonintrusive inspection systems and higher healthcare IT consulting services, that's primarily from the Vitalize acquisition. Both of those have higher profitability relative to other business areas in the segment. 
Intelligence and Cybersecurity Solutions segment total and internal revenues increased 5% compared with last year. This increase was primarily driven by increased activity on our airborne surveillance programs, increased materials deliveries under an existing processing, exploitation and dissemination contract and increased cybersecurity program activities as well. These increases were partially offset by a decline in activity on a variety of programs, particularly with DoD customers in the areas of intelligence analysis and maritime ISR. 
Operating margin for the Intelligence and Cybersecurity Solutions segment was 5.6%, down significantly from previous quarters. Decline in operating margin was entirely driven by the $19 million impairment charge on the purchased intangibles related to CloudShield and also increased investment in R&D and bid and proposal expenses, which was partially offset by revenue growth and increased sales of higher margin proprietary products in the ISR arena. 
The impairment charge was primarily associated with lower-than-expected sales of certain CloudShield products. We, however, remain optimistic and committed to the future prospects of CloudShield. In particular, we recently completed next-generation deep packet inspection technology embodied in the CS-4000 system or the foundation of that confidence. We believe our recently announced strategic partnering alliance with McAfee is a catalyst for increased sales across both the commercial clients and our installed government business space. 
Corporate and Other segment had unallocated corporate costs of $16 million in the quarter, arising from recurring costs like stock options and other unallowable expenses. That covers my remarks on the third quarter. I'll now finish up with our forward guidance for the remainder of fiscal '12 that, of course, ends on January 31, 2012. 
As you'll see in our third quarter 10-Q filing, we have fully disclosed the lists associated with the CityTime contract. However, for risk of possible additional losses, fiscal '12 guidance does not include any charges beyond the $232 million CityTime loss provision we took during the third quarter. 
Also given the difficulty of determining the timing of any payments with respect to the CityTime matter, our cash flow guidance excludes any payment assumption this fiscal year. 
Finally, we are continuing to provide guidance on a GAAP basis consistent with the past practice, which includes the impact of CityTime. However, given the nature and magnitude of this item, we provided guidance on a pro forma basis without CityTime to show expected results of more normalized business activities. 
Within that, our fiscal '12 GAAP guidance for revenue and cash flow are unchanged from last quarter, whereas earnings per share is reduced $0.60 for the full year effect of the CityTime loss provision taken this quarter. That is the only change to fiscal '12 guidance at this time. 
Accordingly, we expect full year fiscal '12 revenues to come in between $10.6 billion and $11 billion and operating cash flow at $600 million or above. GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is being adjusted $0.60 downward to $0.70 to $0.80 per share full year guidance. Guidance for EPS on a pro forma basis, which excludes CityTime remains the same, $1.30 to $1.40 range that we provided in our last Q2 earnings call. 
As for fiscal 2013, we have historically provided initial guidance at this point in time during our third quarter earnings release. Going forward, we are changing our cadence to initiate guidance for our next new fiscal year to our fourth quarter earnings release where we'll have the benefit of having completed the previous fiscal year and will provide more time to evaluate developments in the federal budget cycle. Accordingly, we are not providing fiscal '13 guidance today, but we'll plan to do so in March. 
To summarize my remarks, we had some special nonrecurring charges this quarter, which will likely capture the headlines. However, performance across our broader business space showed both improvement and strength. Excluding the 2 special items, CityTime and the impairment, internal revenue growth was flat quarter-over-quarter, reversing course from contraction in the first half of the year. On that same basis, operating profits have stayed above 8% all year, while we have increased IR&D investments of well over 50% year-over-year. This reflects our view that building capabilities in differentiated technology will be increasingly important in this market. The improved days sales outstanding by 3 days during the third quarter have delivered almost $600 million in free cash flow so far this year. 
Finally, our focus on strategic growth areas and larger contracts has yielded record wins in the $100 million-plus category and a new peak in the value of bids outstanding as Walt mentioned earlier. These are the performance metrics that better reflect the commitment and focus of the people of SAIC, which will continue to be the basis of our confidence and sound financial execution going forward. 
With that, I'll now turn it back to Walt."

So that said, I think we've had pretty consistent profitability to include the gross margin coupled with the pretty efficient absorption of our SG&A all year and strong performance on the fixed price and award fee areas to keep us above that 8% that I referred to."

We do -- we have been planning for the last couple of years that the budgets will flatten and tip in the 2012 and 2013 time frame, that's exactly what's happening. And the way we've dealt with that is we have put more and more emphasis, especially on our investments, on areas within our markets that we believe will be enduring and offer higher growth opportunities in the market as a whole, and those are the ones that we covered earlier. Those are within national security, ISR, logistics, readiness and sustainment, cybersecurity and then our health IT business and our energy business, and I think that's how we're dealing with the inevitable budget reductions. And that's very consistent with what we've said for the last 24 months. And frankly, I think we're starting to see that pay off. The additional IR&D that we've used this year and BNP that we've used this year and the allocation of our SG&A has been focused on those higher -- potentially higher growth areas, and we believe those growth areas, notwithstanding the budget downturn, will continue to have an enduring nature, and so that's how we are dealing with, from a strategic standpoint, dealing with the inevitable downturn in the budget. At the same time, we have continued to take cost out of our infrastructure and starting with our project alignment activities several years ago and that continues. So becoming more cost efficient, targeting our investments to the potentially higher growth areas within a declining budget is exactly how we're approaching that condition."

But actually, based on the experience we're seeing in the market and the comments Walt made earlier, the historical projection we've had in the past or historical distribution of revenues from Q3 to Q4, that general pattern, we expect to be the case, so we expect Q4 will be a downtick from Q3 by some measure. That's in part due to a lesser number of productive workdays and holidays. But on the other hand, we have, as Walt said, we've got some good opening backlog and some good momentum and some areas ramping up. So expect a downtick, but not too different than historical trends."

For the call today, I'll cover market conditions, speak to the ongoing CityTime investigation, highlight recent business development results, review acquisitions and share several special recognitions, then Mark will provide the financial details and then we will take your questions. 
While uncertainty in the markets continue to present challenges to our financial performance this quarter, I am encouraged by our business development results, including our increasing pipeline of new opportunities, record level of submitted proposals awaiting decision, increasing number of large wins, uptick in awards and targeted strategic growth areas and improvement in book-to-bill performance. 
I am also very proud of our employees who continue to deliver outstanding value to our customers. One of the great strengths of SAIC is our culture of focusing on customer success. Our culture is one of strong customer affinity for more than 40 years and an unparalleled understanding of customer mission. 
The overall federal government acquisition process continues to be negatively impacted by the uncertainty caused by the government budget situation. As a result, revenues remained flat in the quarter. Looking ahead, our expectation for the year are for revenues to meet the outlook we shared with you during last quarter's earnings call. 
I would next like to update you on CityTime, the workforce management system that is currently being used by more than 65 New York City municipal agencies. As we've disclosed previously, the U.S. Attorney's office is conducting a criminal investigation relating to the CityTime program. Two former SAIC employees, along with other contractors on this program, have been charged with conspiring to defraud the City of New York for their own profit by taking kickbacks and increasing the cost of the program. The 2 former SAIC employees have also been charged with defrauding SAIC by depriving it of their honest services. 
One of these former SAIC employees has pleaded guilty to multiple charges, including taking millions of dollars in kickbacks from an SAIC subcontractor. The company is continuing to cooperate with the U.S. Attorney's investigation, but cannot predict its outcome. 
After a comprehensive review of the CityTime program, including a review of management performance, a group president, a deputy group president and a business unit general manager responsible for management and oversight of the CityTime program were removed and are no longer with the company. The company is not aware of any evidence that these individuals had any personal involvement in the CityTime fraud. 
In addition to taking these personnel actions, the company engaged an outside law firm to assist company leadership in conducting a comprehensive review of key policies and practices and to recommend enhancement to strengthen the company's culture of ethics, accountability and compliance. As a result of this systemic review, the implementation of process improvements and control enhancements by the company is now underway. 
In addition, a special committee of the Board of Directors that is overseeing the company's response to CityTime has engaged an independent company, Guidepost Solutions, and specifically its chairman, Bart Schwartz, to undertake its own review and monitor the efforts the company is making in response to this matter. 
Based on developments related to the CityTime matter since our last quarterly filing, the company now estimates that its loss relating to the CityTime program will be at least $232 million. Accordingly, we have taken a loss provision for that amount this quarter. An updated description of the CityTime matter will be included in the 10-Q, which we will file this week. 
Turning to market conditions. While there has been a large volume of rhetoric and speculation regarding the federal budgeting process, the overall government solutions and services market outlook remains unchanged since we spoke with you last. Our customers are being told to do more with less or at a minimum to hold the line. As a result, we expect spending to be flat at best for the next couple of years, with low single-digit spending declines in the following out years. 
We continue to believe there will be areas of nominal growth such as intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; cybersecurity; logistics, readiness and sustainment; energy; and health IT. We have and will continue to invest in these areas to provide our customers with the solutions they require. 
Moving on to our business development results. Bookings totaled $3.8 billion in the third quarter and produced a net book-to-bill ratio of 1.3. Combined with the book-to-bill ratio we achieved in the first 2 quarters, we have produced a solid year-to-date book-to-bill ratio of 1.2, which reflect the strength of our strategy and people. 
We ended the quarter with $18 billion in total backlog. $6.3 billion was funded, up nearly $1 billion or 19% from the second quarter. And as compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2011, total backlog increased by 16%. 
I am very encouraged that we have achieved the 63% total dollar win rate on business opportunities pursued and awarded through the third quarter. Our high win rate is attributable to strong program execution and well-targeted investments and business development. This win rate is consistent with last year's, reflecting positive results of these targeted investments considering the increased amount of bids submitted and increasing competition. 
Additionally, submitted proposals awaiting decision continued to increase and now stand at a new peak of $30.6 billion, consisting of $21.7 billion in ID/IQ bids and $8.9 billion in definite delivery bids. This is $7.6 billion higher than Q3 a year ago, which we expect will produce growth when these procurements are decided. 
Our focus on winning larger opportunities continues to yield positive results. We won 13 opportunities valued at more than $100 million in the third quarter of FY '12. When added to the 18 opportunities of this size we won in the first half of the year, this represents a 55% increase compared with the first 3 quarters of last year. 
Recently, we won 4 additional large programs following the end of the third quarter, which brings the total of greater than $100 million wins for the fiscal year to 35 compared to 26 for all of last year, a record for us.
There were many significant awards this quarter. Let me take a moment to highlight 2 of these wins, each of which has an expected value to SAIC of greater than $100 million. These are just 2 examples of SAIC's continuing to bring the best solution at the best value to our customer.
First, SAIC was awarded the Tire Successor Initiative contract by the Defense Logistics Agency. This competitively won single award ID/IQ has an estimated value of $1.1 billion over 7 years. Under this contract, SAIC will provide end-to-end supply chain management for all U.S. Military land vehicle and aircraft tires. 
Previously, SAIC had been a subcontractor to Michelin for only land vehicle tires. With this win, SAIC has significantly enhanced its position as a leading logistics contractor for the Defense Logistics Agency. 
Also during the third quarter, SAIC was awarded 2 task order contracts totaling nearly $600 million for ongoing sustainment of Mine-Resistant-Ambush-Protected or MRAP vehicles in both Kuwait and Afghanistan. Like the Tire Successor Initiative contract, this win on the MRAP joint logistics integrator contract demonstrates the kind of progress SAIC is making toward realizing the exceptional results we have targeted in our strategic growth area of logistics, readiness and sustainment. 
I would now like to take a few moments to highlight an exciting development in SAIC's approach for driving growth in cybersecurity, namely our recently announced strategic partnering alliance with McAfee, the world's largest dedicated security technology company. 
This strategic alliance will enable SAIC and McAfee to offer a new combination of cybersecurity solutions to meet the sophisticated threats faced by large, complex enterprises around the world. Cyber threats are outpacing the traditional hardware-based defense and depth models by an alarming margin at a time when critical data more commonly moves beyond the enterprise network to mobile endpoints. 
McAfee technology, combined with SAIC solution-based deployment approach, and our CloudShield CS-4000 security solution, will offer advanced security across the network by using reprogrammable hardware platforms that intelligently adapt to anticipate, detect, remediate cyber threats in sophisticated network infrastructures. This more agile capability allows enterprises to select virtualized services and applications based on their unique threats and desired security posture, an alternative approach that is long overdue. 
Corporate leaders and governments understand cyber security is an enterprise risk that continues to evolve, and their companies need solutions that can adapt to this changing environment. The same is true of enterprises who must adapt to protect national security. Financial institutions led by share [ph] robust capabilities in order to guard billions of dollars in transactions. The health industry, which is moving toward digital health record; energy companies adapting smart grid technology; and telecommunications companies that must ensure quality of service while also shielding millions of customers from fraudulent activities. 
The coupling of McAfee's industry-leading security products with SAIC's CloudShield security products provides both companies with greatly expanded access to new markets and overall stronger combined solutions. 
Moving on to acquisitions. We completed in the quarter the acquisition of Vitalize Consulting Services (sic) [Solutions], a leading provider of clinical business and information technology services for health enterprises. The deal enables SAIC to expand in the commercial health provider market and leverage its information integration and data analytics expertise with VCS's healthcare IT and clinical workforce optimization capabilities to further grow as commercial and federal health markets converge. Approximately 600 VCS employees joined SAIC. 
Before I turn the discussion over to Mark, I want to share several special recognitions. The first accomplishment I would like to recognize is the successful launch of SAIC's Commercially Hosted Infrared Payload or CHIRP sensor into space. The CHIRP sensor was integrated onto a commercial telecommunications satellite, the first time a national security payload has been hosted on a commercial satellite. The CHIRP sensor uses an electro-optical telescope to persistently view a quarter of the earth from geosynchronous orbit. It's wide-field-of-view infrared sensor is used to sense bright spots on the surface of the earth that aid in the early warning of missile launches and to support other military missions. 
The sensor is remotely commanded and monitored from the SAIC-developed CHIRP Mission Analysis Center or CMAC in Seal Beach, California. This program is an example how the government can achieve significant savings by taking advantage of commercially hosted payloads based upon a more agile development environment and allows us to plan and implement space missions on shorter schedules compared to the time it takes to procure an entire satellite in as short as 24 months. 
CHIRP was successfully powered on, on October 23 and is currently undergoing orbit testing. First successful collections occurred on October 24. As recently reported in Aviation Week & Space Technology, the Air Force is impressed with the results so far. 
Second, I'm happy to recognize that in November, a team from SAIC won NASA's prestigious Space Flight Awareness Award for our design in building a high-technology fiber acoustic test facility that will support development of NASA's New Orion space system. 
Third and also in cybersecurity, SAIC founded the Maryland Cybersecurity Challenge and Conference in October, with 312 challengers split into 52 teams across professionals, colleges and high schools. Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley helped launch the event, and 3 weeks ago, NSA Director, General Keith Alexander, and University of Maryland, Baltimore County President, Freeman Hrabowski, recognized the awardees at a dinner in their honor on November 18. 
Fourth, I would like to recognize that SAIC is a proud founding partner and continuing supporter of Cyber Patriot, the nation's largest and fastest-growing high school cybersecurity challenge competition, which is building the next generation of cybersecurity professionals. This year's competition got underway on October with over 1,000 teams, representing all 50 states and will conclude in March 2012. 
Fifth, I'm glad to recognize that SAIC has been ranked one of the top 100 military employers by G.I. Jobs Magazine in recognition of our long-term commitment to hiring former military members and our progressive policies for reserve and guard members called to active duty. SAIC presently employs over 8,000 former military members, including over 2,300 disabled veterans. 
Finally, I would like to point out that SAIC has recognized again this year on Newsweek's Annual Green Rankings, rising to 44 among the greenest 500 companies in the United States, up from 192 last year. SAIC recently announced its goal to reduce operational greenhouse emissions 25% by 2020, reinforcing its commitment to sustainable business practices and other corporate responsibility initiatives. 
Also, I'd like to update you on the CEO succession process. The Board of Directors has established a special committee to identify and assess both internal and external candidates for the CEO position. Their work is well underway, with the expectation that a new CEO will be in place not later than my planned retirement date of June 15, 2012. We should note that since my retirement announcement and through my last day at SAIC, I continue to remain fully engaged and committed to executing my role as CEO, ensuring we focus on creating enduring shareholder value. 
In closing, I would like to emphasize once again that SAIC prides itself on its history of ethics and integrity. While some aspects of our third quarter performance were overshadowed by CityTime, we performed well in new business development and cash flow, while continuing to provide strong execution on programs of national significance, demonstrating the underlying strength of SAIC and its employees. 
Mark will now cover the financial details for the third quarter of fiscal 2012."
110741,142590409,199602,"SAIC, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Dec 06, 2011",2011-12-06,"Earnings Calls","Leidos Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Walt. As mentioned in today's release, our results for the third quarter were pretty much as expected before considering the effects of the loss provision concerning CityTime. The CityTime loss provision was recorded as a $52 million reduction",1616,"Thank you, Walt. As mentioned in today's release, our results for the third quarter were pretty much as expected before considering the effects of the loss provision concerning CityTime. The CityTime loss provision was recorded as a $52 million reduction to revenue and $180 million charge to SG&A expense, aggregating to a $230 million pretax loss. 
We reflected a large portion of the charge to SG&A as nondeductible for tax purposes, which is why the effective tax rate was well above normal for the quarter. Consequently, the loss provision had a material impact from the financial results for the third quarter and for the full fiscal year 2012 expected results. We have provided a pro forma set of statements in today's earnings release to show our results with and without this item. 
As Walt discussed, total revenues were flat in the quarter, comprised of 2% growth from acquisitions, offset by 2% internal revenue contraction. All of the internal revenue contraction was attributable to the $52 million revenue reduction related to the CityTime loss provision. 
We continue to generate growth in select areas of the business that are more attractive in today's market. However, that growth was offset by wind downs of a few larger programs completed earlier this year and brought our contraction primarily in certain defense and federal civilian areas. 
Overall, the 5 parts of the business we call our strategic growth areas: cyber; ISR; energy, logistics, readiness and sustainment; and health rose internally in revenues 6% over last year, with ISR and cyber being the most significant favorable drivers. 
We recorded an operating loss of $17 million for the quarter, driven by the $232 million pretax CityTime loss provision. Operating income excluding the loss provision was $215 million or 7.5% of revenue. Within that, we also took a $19 million impairment asset charge related to certain technologies from our CloudShield acquisition made in 2010. That accounted for about 70 basis points of operating margin. 
Margin excluding both the CityTime loss provision and the impairment charge exceeded 8% in the third quarter, a level consistent with profitability in the first and second quarter. Within that, it's important to note we concurrently and significantly increased research and development investments all year, which we believe will offer margin enhancement opportunities in future years. 
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations resulted in a loss of $0.27 per share this quarter, with the CityTime loss provision having a $0.62 per share impact. Ex-CityTime, earnings per share was $0.35. 
Operating cash flow for the third quarter came in at $423 million, bringing year-to-date operating cash flow to well above $600 million. Much of this stemmed from a 3-day sequential improvement in days sales outstanding during the quarter, which finished at 71 days. 
The areas of capital deployment, we acquired about 3 million shares in the beginning of the quarter under our ongoing buyback program and completed the Vitalize Consulting acquisition, together totaling about $240 million in funds used in the period. 
Now let me cover our operating results for our 4 segments. Revenues for the Defense Solutions segment decreased by 8% in the third quarter compared with last year. More than half of the revenue decline was from the revenue portion of the loss provision related to CityTime, the effects of which were entirely reflected in this segment, the Defense Solutions segment. 
Remainder of the revenue contraction was from the wind down of the U.S. Army Brigade Combat Team Modernization Contract, BCTM, which ended in the third quarter and other reduced activity on an infrastructure support services program. Offsetting these declines, we continue to ramp up in our Department of State Vanguard enterprise network IT program, and now continue to drive growth on our AMCOM systems and software maintenance program for the U.S. Army. 
We also experienced solid growth in our logistics business, driven by a material resupply purchases and additional work on combat vehicle integration and maintenance activities. 
The Defense Solutions segment had an operating loss of $133 million, reflecting the CityTime loss provision. Excluding CityTime, the segment had operating income of $99 million or 8.5% of revenues. 
Revenue for our Health, Energy and Civil Solutions segment increased 6% during the third quarter compared to a year ago, driven mainly by revenue from the acquisition of Vitalize Consulting. Internal revenues grew 1%, which reflects increases in several areas: delivery of nonintrusive inspection systems; DesignBuild activities related to geothermal power plant construction; healthcare IT consulting services; and increased disaster recovery support services. These were offset by declines in various federal civilian programs, including those supporting NASA. 
Operating margin for the Health, Energy and Civil Solutions segment improved to 10.6% in the third quarter, reflecting increased deliveries of nonintrusive inspection systems and higher healthcare IT consulting services. That's primarily from the Vitalize acquisition. Both of those have higher profitability relative to other business areas in the segment. 
The Intelligence and Cybersecurity Solutions segment total and internal revenues increased 5% compared with last year. This increase was primarily driven by increased activity on our airborne surveillance programs, increased materials deliveries under an existing processing, exploitation and dissemination contract and increased cybersecurity program activities as well. These increases were partially offset by a decline in activity on a variety of programs, particularly with DoD customers in the areas of intelligence analysis and maritime ISR. 
Operating margin for the Intelligence and Cybersecurity Solutions segment was 5.6%, down significantly from previous quarters. The decline in operating margin was entirely driven by the $19 million impairment charge on the purchased intangibles related to CloudShield and also increased investment in R&D and bid and proposal expenses. This was partially offset by revenue growth and increased sales of higher margin proprietary products in the ISR arena. 
The impairment charge was primarily associated with lower-than-expected sales of certain CloudShield products. We, however, remain optimistic and committed to the future prospects of CloudShield. In particular, we recently completed next-generation deep packet inspection technology embodied in the CS-4000 system or the foundation of that confidence. We believe our recently announced strategic partnering alliance with McAfee is a catalyst for increased sales across both the commercial clients and our installed government business space. 
The Corporate and Other segment had unallocated corporate costs of $16 million in the quarter, arising from recurring costs like stock options and other unallowable expenses. That covers my remarks on the third quarter. I'll now finish up with our forward guidance for the remainder of fiscal '12. That, of course, ends on January 31, 2012. 
As you'll see in our third quarter 10-Q filing, we have fully disclosed the lists associated with the CityTime contract. While there's risk of possible additional losses, fiscal '12 guidance does not include any charges beyond the $232 million CityTime loss provision we took during the third quarter. 
Also given the difficulty of determining the timing of any payments with respect to the CityTime matter, our cash flow guidance excludes any payment assumption this fiscal year. 
Finally, we are continuing to provide guidance on a GAAP basis consistent with past practice, which includes the impact of CityTime. However, given the nature and magnitude of this item, we provided guidance on a pro forma basis without CityTime to show expected results of more normalized business activities. 
Given that, our fiscal '12 GAAP guidance for revenue and cash flow are unchanged from last quarter, whereas earnings per share is reduced $0.60 for the full year effect of the CityTime loss provision taken this quarter. That is the only change to fiscal '12 guidance at this time. 
Accordingly, we expect full year fiscal '12 revenues to come in between $10.6 billion and $11 billion and operating cash flow at $600 million or above. GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is being adjusted $0.60 downward to $0.70 to $0.80 per share full year guidance. Guidance for EPS on a pro forma basis, which excludes CityTime remains at the same, $1.30 to $1.40 range that we provided in our last Q2 earnings call. 
As for fiscal 2013, we have historically provided initial guidance at this point in time during our third quarter earnings release. Going forward, we are changing our cadence to initiate guidance for our next new fiscal year to our fourth quarter earnings release where we'll have the benefit of having completed the previous fiscal year and will provide more time to evaluate developments in the federal budget cycle. Accordingly, we are not providing fiscal '13 guidance today, but we'll plan to do so in March. 
To summarize my remarks, we had some special nonrecurring charges this quarter, which will likely capture the headlines. However, performance across our broader business space showed both improvement and strength. Excluding the 2 special items, CityTime and the impairment, internal revenue growth was flat quarter-over-quarter, reversing course from contraction in the first half of the year. On that same basis, operating profits have stayed above 8% all year, while we have increased IR&D investments by well over 50% year-over-year. This reflects our view that building capabilities in differentiated technology will be increasingly important in this market. We improved days sales outstanding by 3 days during the third quarter and have delivered almost $600 million in free cash flow so far this year. 
Finally, our focus on strategic growth areas and larger contracts has yielded record wins in the $100 million-plus category and a new peak in the value of bids outstanding as Walt mentioned earlier. These are the performance metrics that better reflect the commitment and focus of the people of SAIC, which will continue to be the basis of our confidence and sound financial execution going forward. 
With that, I'll now turn it back to Walt."

And that's very consistent with what we've said for the last 24 months. And frankly, I think we're starting to see that pay off. The additional IR&D that we've used this year and BNP that we've used this year and the allocation of our SG&A has been focused on those higher -- potentially higher growth areas, and we believe those growth areas, notwithstanding the budget downturn, will continue to have an enduring nature, and so that's how we are dealing with, from a strategic standpoint, dealing with the inevitable downturn in the budget. At the same time, we have continued to take cost out of our infrastructure and starting with our project alignment activities several years ago and that continues.

For the call today, I'll cover market conditions, speak to the ongoing CityTime investigation, highlight recent business development results, review acquisitions and share several special recognitions, then Mark will provide the financial details and then we will take your questions. 
While uncertainty in the markets continue to present challenges to our financial performance this quarter, I am encouraged by our business development results, including our increasing pipeline of new opportunities, record level of submitted proposals awaiting decision, increasing number of large wins, uptick in awards and targeted strategic growth areas and improvement in book-to-bill performance. 
I am also very proud of our employees who continue to deliver outstanding value to our customers. One of the great strengths of SAIC is our culture of focusing on customer success. Our culture is one of strong customer affinity for more than 40 years and an unparalleled understanding of customer mission. 
The overall federal government acquisition process continues to be negatively impacted by the uncertainty caused by the government budget situation. As a result, revenues remained flat in the quarter. Looking ahead, our expectation for the year are for revenues to meet the outlook we shared with you during last quarter's earnings call. 
I would next like to update you on CityTime, the workforce management system that is currently being used by more than 65 New York City municipal agencies. As we've disclosed previously, the U.S. Attorney's office is conducting a criminal investigation relating to the CityTime program. Two former SAIC employees, along with other contractors on this program, have been charged with conspiring to defraud the City of New York for their own profit by taking kickbacks and increasing the cost of the program. The 2 former SAIC employees have also been charged with defrauding SAIC by depriving it of their honest services. 
One of these former SAIC employees has pleaded guilty to multiple charges, including taking millions of dollars in kickbacks from an SAIC subcontractor. The company is continuing to cooperate with the U.S. Attorney's investigation, but cannot predict its outcome. 
After a comprehensive review of the CityTime program, including a review of management performance, a group president, a deputy group president and a business unit general manager responsible for management and oversight of the CityTime program were removed and are no longer with the company. The company is not aware of any evidence that these individuals had any personal involvement in the CityTime fraud. 
In addition to taking these personnel actions, the company engaged an outside law firm to assist company leadership in conducting a comprehensive review of key policies and practices and to recommend enhancement to strengthen the company's culture of ethics, accountability and compliance. As a result of this systemic review, the implementation of process improvements and control enhancements by the company is now underway. 
In addition, a special committee of the Board of Directors that is overseeing the company's response to CityTime has engaged an independent company, Guidepost Solutions, and specifically its chairman, Bart Schwartz, to undertake its own review and monitor the efforts the company is making in response to this matter. 
Based on developments related to the CityTime matter since our last quarterly filing, the company now estimates that its loss relating to the CityTime program will be at least $232 million. Accordingly, we have taken a loss provision for that amount this quarter. An updated description of the CityTime matter will be included in the 10-Q, which we will file this week. 
Turning to market conditions. While there has been a large volume of rhetoric and speculation regarding the federal budgeting process, the overall government solutions and services market outlook remains unchanged since we spoke with you last. Our customers are being told to do more with less or at a minimum to hold the line. As a result, we expect spending to be flat at best for the next couple of years, with low single-digit spending declines in the following out years. 
We continue to believe there will be areas of nominal growth such as intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; cybersecurity; logistics, readiness and sustainment; energy; and health IT. We have and will continue to invest in these areas to provide our customers with the solutions they require. 
Moving on to our business development results. Bookings totaled $3.8 billion in the third quarter and produced a net book-to-bill ratio of 1.3. Combined with the book-to-bill ratio we achieved in the first 2 quarters, we have produced a solid year-to-date book-to-bill ratio of 1.2, which reflect the strength of our strategy and people. 
We ended the quarter with $18 billion in total backlog. $6.3 billion was funded, up nearly $1 billion or 19% from the second quarter. And as compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2011, total backlog increased by 16%. 
I am very encouraged that we have achieved the 63% total dollar win rate on business opportunities pursued and awarded through the third quarter. Our high win rate is attributable to strong program execution and well-targeted investments and business development. This win rate is consistent with last year's, reflecting positive results of these targeted investments considering the increased amount of bids submitted and increasing competition. 
Additionally, submitted proposals awaiting decision continued to increase and now stand at a new peak of $30.6 billion, consisting of $21.7 billion in ID/IQ bids and $8.9 billion in definite delivery bids. This is $7.6 billion higher than Q3 a year ago, which we expect will produce growth when these procurements are decided. 
Our focus on winning larger opportunities continues to yield positive results. We won 13 opportunities valued at more than $100 million in the third quarter of FY '12. When added to the 18 opportunities of this size we won in the first half of the year, this represents a 55% increase compared with the first 3 quarters of last year. 
Recently, we won 4 additional large programs following the end of the third quarter, which brings the total of greater than $100 million wins for the fiscal year to 35 compared to 26 for all of last year, a record for us.
There were many significant awards this quarter. Let me take a moment to highlight 2 of these wins, each of which has an expected value to SAIC of greater than $100 million. These are just 2 examples of SAIC's continuing to bring the best solution at the best value to our customer.
First, SAIC was awarded the Tire Successor Initiative contract by the Defense Logistics Agency. This competitively won single award ID/IQ has an estimated value of $1.1 billion over 7 years. Under this contract, SAIC will provide end-to-end supply chain management for all U.S. Military land vehicle and aircraft tires. 
Previously, SAIC had been a subcontractor to Michelin for only land vehicle tires. With this win, SAIC has significantly enhanced its position as a leading logistics contractor for the Defense Logistics Agency. 
Also during the third quarter, SAIC was awarded 2 task order contracts totaling nearly $600 million for ongoing sustainment of Mine-Resistant-Ambush-Protected or MRAP vehicles in both Kuwait and Afghanistan. Like the Tire Successor Initiative contract, this win on the MRAP joint logistics integrator contract demonstrates the kind of progress SAIC is making toward realizing the exceptional results we have targeted in our strategic growth area of logistics, readiness and sustainment. 
I would now like to take a few moments to highlight an exciting development in SAIC's approach for driving growth in cybersecurity, namely our recently announced strategic partnering alliance with McAfee, the world's largest dedicated security technology company. 
This strategic alliance will enable SAIC and McAfee to offer a new combination of cybersecurity solutions to meet the sophisticated threats faced by large, complex enterprises around the world. Cyber threats are outpacing the traditional hardware-based defense and depth models by an alarming margin at a time when critical data more commonly moves beyond the enterprise network to mobile endpoints. 
McAfee technology, combined with SAIC solution-based deployment approach, and our CloudShield CS-4000 security solution, will offer advanced security across the network by using reprogrammable hardware platforms that intelligently adapt to anticipate, detect, remediate cyber threats in sophisticated network infrastructures. This more agile capability allows enterprises to select virtualized services and applications based on their unique threats and desired security posture, an alternative approach that is long overdue. 
Corporate leaders and governments understand cyber security is an enterprise risk that continues to evolve, and their companies need solutions that can adapt to this changing environment. The same is true of enterprises who must adapt to protect national security. Financial institutions led by share [ph] robust capabilities in order to guard billions of dollars in transactions. The health industry, which is moving toward digital health record; energy companies adapting smart grid technology; and telecommunications companies that must ensure quality of service while also shielding millions of customers from fraudulent activities. 
The coupling of McAfee's industry-leading security products with SAIC's CloudShield security products provides both companies with greatly expanded access to new markets and overall stronger combined solutions. 
Moving on to acquisitions. We completed in the quarter the acquisition of Vitalize Consulting Services (sic) [Solutions], a leading provider of clinical business and information technology services for health enterprises. The deal enables SAIC to expand in the commercial health provider market and leverage its information integration and data analytics expertise with VCS's healthcare IT and clinical workforce optimization capabilities to further grow as commercial and federal health markets converge. Approximately 600 VCS employees joined SAIC. 
Before I turn the discussion over to Mark, I want to share several special recognitions. The first accomplishment I would like to recognize is the successful launch of SAIC's Commercially Hosted Infrared Payload or CHIRP sensor into space. The CHIRP sensor was integrated onto a commercial telecommunications satellite, the first time a national security payload has been hosted on a commercial satellite. The CHIRP sensor uses an electro-optical telescope to persistently view a quarter of the earth from geosynchronous orbit. It's wide-field-of-view infrared sensor is used to sense bright spots on the surface of the earth that aid in the early warning of missile launches and to support other military missions. 
The sensor is remotely commanded and monitored from the SAIC-developed CHIRP Mission Analysis Center or CMAC in Seal Beach, California. This program is an example how the government can achieve significant savings by taking advantage of commercially hosted payloads based upon a more agile development environment and allows us to plan and implement space missions on shorter schedules compared to the time it takes to procure an entire satellite in as short as 24 months. 
CHIRP was successfully powered on, on October 23 and is currently undergoing orbit testing. First successful collections occurred on October 24. As recently reported in Aviation Week & Space Technology, the Air Force is impressed with the results so far. 
Second, I'm happy to recognize that in November, a team from SAIC won NASA's prestigious Space Flight Awareness Award for our design in building a high-technology fiber acoustic test facility that will support development of NASA's New Orion space system. 
Third and also in cybersecurity, SAIC founded the Maryland Cybersecurity Challenge and Conference in October, with 312 challengers split into 52 teams across professionals, colleges and high schools. Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley helped launch the event, and 3 weeks ago, NSA Director, General Keith Alexander, and University of Maryland, Baltimore County President, Freeman Hrabowski, recognized the awardees at a dinner in their honor on November 18. 
Fourth, I would like to recognize that SAIC is a proud founding partner and continuing supporter of Cyber Patriot, the nation's largest and fastest-growing high school cybersecurity challenge competition, which is building the next generation of cybersecurity professionals. This year's competition got underway on October with over 1,000 teams, representing all 50 states and will conclude in March 2012. 
Fifth, I'm glad to recognize that SAIC has been ranked one of the top 100 military employers by G.I. Jobs Magazine in recognition of our long-term commitment to hiring former military members and our progressive policies for reserve and guard members called to active duty. SAIC presently employs over 8,000 former military members, including over 2,300 disabled veterans. 
Finally, I would like to point out that SAIC has recognized again this year on Newsweek's Annual Green Rankings, rising to 44 among the greenest 500 companies in the United States, up from 192 last year. SAIC recently announced its goal to reduce operational greenhouse emissions 25% by 2020, reinforcing its commitment to sustainable business practices and other corporate responsibility initiatives. 
Also, I'd like to update you on the CEO succession process. The Board of Directors has established a special committee to identify and assess both internal and external candidates for the CEO position. Their work is well underway, with the expectation that a new CEO will be in place not later than my planned retirement date of June 15, 2012. We should note that since my retirement announcement and through my last day at SAIC, I continue to remain fully engaged and committed to executing my role as CEO, ensuring we focus on creating enduring shareholder value. 
In closing, I would like to emphasize once again that SAIC prides itself on its history of ethics and integrity. While some aspects of our third quarter performance were overshadowed by CityTime, we performed well in new business development and cash flow, while continuing to provide strong execution on programs of national significance, demonstrating the underlying strength of SAIC and its employees. 
Mark will now cover the financial details for the third quarter of fiscal 2012."

As mentioned in today's release, our results for the third quarter were pretty much as expected before considering the effects of the loss provision concerning CityTime. The CityTime loss provision was recorded as a $52 million reduction",1616,"Thank you, Walt. As mentioned in today's release, our results for the third quarter were pretty much as expected before considering the effects of the loss provision concerning CityTime. The CityTime loss provision was recorded as a $52 million reduction to revenue and $180 million charge to SG&A expense, aggregating to a $230 million pretax loss. 
We reflected a large portion of the charge to SG&A as nondeductible for tax purposes, which is why the effective tax rate was well above normal for the quarter. Consequently, the loss provision had a material impact from the financial results for the third quarter and for the full fiscal year 2012 expected results. We have provided a pro forma set of statements in today's earnings release to show our results with and without this item. 
As Walt discussed, total revenues were flat in the quarter, comprised of 2% growth from acquisitions, offset by 2% internal revenue contraction. All of the internal revenue contraction was attributable to the $52 million revenue reduction related to the CityTime loss provision. 
We continue to generate growth in select areas of the business that are more attractive in today's market. However, that growth was offset by wind downs of a few larger programs completed earlier this year and brought our contraction primarily in certain defense and federal civilian areas. 
Overall, the 5 parts of the business we call our strategic growth areas: cyber; ISR; energy, logistics, readiness and sustainment; and health rose internally in revenues 6% over last year, with ISR and cyber being the most significant favorable drivers. 
We recorded an operating loss of $17 million for the quarter, driven by the $232 million pretax CityTime loss provision. Operating income excluding the loss provision was $215 million or 7.5% of revenue. Within that, we also took a $19 million impairment asset charge related to certain technologies from our CloudShield acquisition made in 2010. That accounted for about 70 basis points of operating margin. 
Margin excluding both the CityTime loss provision and the impairment charge exceeded 8% in the third quarter, a level consistent with profitability in the first and second quarter. Within that, it's important to note we concurrently and significantly increased research and development investments all year, which we believe will offer margin enhancement opportunities in future years. 
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations resulted in a loss of $0.27 per share this quarter, with the CityTime loss provision having a $0.62 per share impact. Ex-CityTime, earnings per share was $0.35. 
Operating cash flow for the third quarter came in at $423 million, bringing year-to-date operating cash flow to well above $600 million. Much of this stemmed from a 3-day sequential improvement in days sales outstanding during the quarter, which finished at 71 days. 
The areas of capital deployment, we acquired about 3 million shares in the beginning of the quarter under our ongoing buyback program and completed the Vitalize Consulting acquisition, together totaling about $240 million in funds used in the period. 
Now let me cover our operating results for our 4 segments. Revenues for the Defense Solutions segment decreased by 8% in the third quarter compared with last year. More than half of the revenue decline was from the revenue portion of the loss provision related to CityTime, the effects of which were entirely reflected in this segment, the Defense Solutions segment. 
Remainder of the revenue contraction was from the wind down of the U.S. Army Brigade Combat Team Modernization Contract, BCTM, which ended in the third quarter and other reduced activity on an infrastructure support services program. Offsetting these declines, we continue to ramp up in our Department of State Vanguard enterprise network IT program, and now continue to drive growth on our AMCOM systems and software maintenance program for the U.S. Army. 
We also experienced solid growth in our logistics business, driven by a material resupply purchases and additional work on combat vehicle integration and maintenance activities. 
The Defense Solutions segment had an operating loss of $133 million, reflecting the CityTime loss provision. Excluding CityTime, the segment had operating income of $99 million or 8.5% of revenues. 
Revenue for our Health, Energy and Civil Solutions segment increased 6% during the third quarter compared to a year ago, driven mainly by revenue from the acquisition of Vitalize Consulting. Internal revenues grew 1%, which reflects increases in several areas: delivery of nonintrusive inspection systems; DesignBuild activities related to geothermal power plant construction; healthcare IT consulting services; and increased disaster recovery support services. These were offset by declines in various federal civilian programs, including those supporting NASA. 
Operating margin for the Health, Energy and Civil Solutions segment improved to 10.6% in the third quarter, reflecting increased deliveries of nonintrusive inspection systems and higher healthcare IT consulting services. That's primarily from the Vitalize acquisition. Both of those have higher profitability relative to other business areas in the segment. 
The Intelligence and Cybersecurity Solutions segment total and internal revenues increased 5% compared with last year. This increase was primarily driven by increased activity on our airborne surveillance programs, increased materials deliveries under an existing processing, exploitation and dissemination contract and increased cybersecurity program activities as well. These increases were partially offset by a decline in activity on a variety of programs, particularly with DoD customers in the areas of intelligence analysis and maritime ISR. 
Operating margin for the Intelligence and Cybersecurity Solutions segment was 5.6%, down significantly from previous quarters. The decline in operating margin was entirely driven by the $19 million impairment charge on the purchased intangibles related to CloudShield and also increased investment in R&D and bid and proposal expenses. This was partially offset by revenue growth and increased sales of higher margin proprietary products in the ISR arena. 
The impairment charge was primarily associated with lower-than-expected sales of certain CloudShield products. We, however, remain optimistic and committed to the future prospects of CloudShield. In particular, we recently completed next-generation deep packet inspection technology embodied in the CS-4000 system or the foundation of that confidence. We believe our recently announced strategic partnering alliance with McAfee is a catalyst for increased sales across both the commercial clients and our installed government business space. 
The Corporate and Other segment had unallocated corporate costs of $16 million in the quarter, arising from recurring costs like stock options and other unallowable expenses. That covers my remarks on the third quarter. I'll now finish up with our forward guidance for the remainder of fiscal '12. That, of course, ends on January 31, 2012. 
As you'll see in our third quarter 10-Q filing, we have fully disclosed the lists associated with the CityTime contract. While there's risk of possible additional losses, fiscal '12 guidance does not include any charges beyond the $232 million CityTime loss provision we took during the third quarter. 
Also given the difficulty of determining the timing of any payments with respect to the CityTime matter, our cash flow guidance excludes any payment assumption this fiscal year. 
Finally, we are continuing to provide guidance on a GAAP basis consistent with past practice, which includes the impact of CityTime. However, given the nature and magnitude of this item, we provided guidance on a pro forma basis without CityTime to show expected results of more normalized business activities. 
Given that our fiscal '12 GAAP guidance for revenue and cash flow are unchanged from last quarter, whereas earnings per share is reduced $0.60 for the full year effect of the CityTime loss provision taken this quarter. That is the only change to fiscal '12 guidance at this time. 
Accordingly, we expect full year fiscal '12 revenues to come in between $10.6 billion and $11 billion and operating cash flow at $600 million or above. GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is being adjusted $0.60 downward to $0.70 to $0.80 per share full year guidance. Guidance for EPS on a pro forma basis, which excludes CityTime remains at the same, $1.30 to $1.40 range that we provided in our last Q2 earnings call. 
As for fiscal 2013, we have historically provided initial guidance at this point in time during our third quarter earnings release. Going forward, we are changing our cadence to initiate guidance for our next new fiscal year to our fourth quarter earnings release where we'll have the benefit of having completed the previous fiscal year and will provide more time to evaluate developments in the federal budget cycle. Accordingly, we are not providing fiscal '13 guidance today, but we'll plan to do so in March. 
To summarize my remarks, we had some special nonrecurring charges this quarter, which will likely capture the headlines. However, performance across our broader business space showed both improvement and strength. Excluding the 2 special items, CityTime and the impairment, internal revenue growth was flat quarter-over-quarter, reversing course from contraction in the first half of the year. On that same basis, operating profits have stayed above 8% all year, while we have increased IR&D investments by well over 50% year-over-year. This reflects our view that building capabilities in differentiated technology will be increasingly important in this market. We improved days sales outstanding by 3 days during the third quarter and have delivered almost $600 million in free cash flow so far this year. 
Finally, our focus on strategic growth areas and larger contracts has yielded record wins in the $100 million-plus category and a new peak in the value of bids outstanding as Walt mentioned earlier. These are the performance metrics that better reflect the commitment and focus of the people of SAIC, which will continue to be the basis of our confidence and sound financial execution going forward. 
With that, I'll now turn it back to Walt."

The additional IR&D that we've used this year and BNP that we've used this year and the allocation of our SG&A has been focused on those higher -- potentially higher growth areas, and we believe those growth areas, notwithstanding the budget downturn, will continue to have an enduring nature, and so that's how we are dealing with, from a strategic standpoint, dealing with the inevitable downturn in the budget.

But as Walt said, this is an ongoing matter and there could be changes to that as we hopefully reach a resolution. There's some outstanding receivable that would be baked into the process, so it doesn't exactly agree to the provision in our books. But for orders of magnitude, the provision is a reasonable proxy of the cash flow other than the receivable we have which is $40 million. And what we're saying in the guidance is while it's certainly possible that a resolution happens this fiscal year, we would not call that likely, and that the sort of resolution and eventual payments and cash outflows would be next fiscal year. And so as a result of that, we decided not to put it in this year's cash flow guidance, but we were clear to state that assumption just in case a faster resolution does occur."
