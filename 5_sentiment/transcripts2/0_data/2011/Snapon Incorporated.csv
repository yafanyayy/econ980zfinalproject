As we look at our fourth quarter, we're once again encouraged both by our financial performance and by our advancements in the areas we've identified as being of strategic importance. Overall, volumes in the quarter",2476,"Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everyone. As we look at our fourth quarter, we're once again encouraged both by our financial performance and by our advancements in the areas we've identified as being of strategic importance. Overall, volumes in the quarter are up 13.6% and the gains were widely spread across customer bases, across operating units and across geographies. Operating earnings rose nearly 44% and the overall margin of 13 1/2% increased 270 basis points from last year powered by expansion in the operating company as well us by the ramp up in our Financial Services profitability. Excluding the Financial Services operations, the 12.6% operating margin was up well over the 11.5% registered in 2009. Importantly, I think the results confirmed continuing progress, and the building momentum. It was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales increases, and these results represent the largest of those gains. Also the operating margins were the highest of the year's, defining a bright line of progress throughout 2010. I believe it's clear that Snap-on closed out 2010 in a much stronger position than we entered the year. Of course, there was improvement in the overall global economic environment, and we've taken advantage. But we also strengthened our tactical execution driven by our commitment to the Snap-on Value Creation Processes, Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCIs as we call it, innovation, customer connection, quality and safety, they continued to drive improvement. And the good news is there's much more to gain, there's much more to go. Beyond that, we have achieved much more progress in those focus areas that we believe will be strategically decisive for our future, enhancing our franchisee network, expanding the company's presence with repair shop owners and managers, rolling the Snap-on brand out of the garage, expanding into other mission-critical areas or arenas and building our physical capabilities in emerging markets. We're making progress in each of those areas. 
Now let me for a moment touch on what we're seeing in the economy and the related sales activity. It's actually somewhat refreshing in a more straightforward discussion than we had in 2009. Most trends are in fact positive. Those areas that are already demonstrated signs of recovery continue to show progress. Take for example the Tools group, serving professional automotive technicians, that business returned to pre-downturn levels in the third quarter and the recovery was confirmed again in the fourth quarter. As part of that trend, activity in big-ticket items remain strong. These are longer payback products like handheld diagnostic units and undercar equipment or more discretionary items like tool storaging. We watch those particular sales trends because we believe they are reasonably accurate barometer of our customers' financial health and of their confidence. The strength in those big-ticket products was across the board with diagnostics and tools storage units driving increased sales to the Tools Group and undercar equipment especially high value bolstering sales in their systems and information group, which serves vehicle repair shop owners and managers. The trends here what were -- I think we can say that the trends here were consistently encouraging throughout 2010. Each quarter had year-over-year gains in all three big-ticket categories and the fourth quarter rise outpaced our overall sales increase.
We also continued to register recovered activity in the Industrial business with professional users in critical industries all across the globe. And beyond that, emerging markets have just continued to be robust and the fourth quarter with no exception. So the areas I just discussed were continuation of the positive trends we saw in the earlier periods, but we also saw some additional favorable signs in the space that have been slower to recover. For example, our business is tied in the automotive OEM dealerships. Although the North American dealership base continues to contract and is an ongoing challenge, we did see some considerable increases relating to essential tool distributions in both North America and Europe. In the fourth quarter we registered some solid gains as those customers became more willing to commit. In Europe, an area of mixed economies overall, we did see our strongest year-over-year increase in the fourth quarter, solid double digits. I already mentioned the continuing strength in undercar equipment in the region, but we also saw some strong comparisons in the northern and central countries of Europe like Sweden and Germany, and favorability in the Eastern emerging economies where we've added additional presence in Belarus and recently ramped up production in the Minsk facility. So there are real positives in Europe. But the South, especially Spain, hasn't changed. It's still week, and that's a market which is significant for us. It is a significant market for Snap-on. So overall, we registered an encouraging quarter and that was encouraging while still fighting the headwinds generated by our major markets in the south of Europe and by the consolidation of the OEM dealership space. Now I'll provide some highlights for each of the segments and mention some of the progress we made in our strategic areas of focus. Commercial and Industrial, or C&I, posted a volume increased from 2009 of 15.4%. The operating earnings were up over $18 million recovering smartly to 12.6% of sales from the 6.8% registered last year. We're gaining position in the C&I and we're also seeing the benefits we're gaining position in C&I and we're also seeing the benefits from RCI and from restructuring actions. 
Speaking of RCI, one of the real highlights in the quarter was a recognition of our powertool plant in Murphy North Carolina as one of North America's 10 best [Audio Gap] It's an annual competition conducted by IndustryWeek magazine with which Snap-on has some experience. Our Milwaukee hand-tool plant was a finalist last year. Excellence in manufacturing is sought out and evaluated. And the judges like what they saw in Snap-on Murphy. IndustryWeek in their comments highlighted the breadth and depth of the RCI culture at Murphy as a key driver in that plant's excellence. Endorsements like that only come from hard work and dedication. So I congratulate and I thank the associates at our Murphy's for this success.
The C&I segment is also where we see clear one-way from growth and leveraging our powerful brand to further penetrate market outside of automotive repair. Snap-on progress in serving new customers in critical industries is quite evident in our Industrial business' fourth quarter performance. Sales were up there about 17% from last year with particular strength in international markets and that capped of a gain of over 20% for the full year. That progress was driven by both an increasingly clear customer focus and also by innovative new products specifically aimed at solutions for those particular segments, products such as the large tools for mining, tethered tools for working at heights and aerospace and energy industries and products with advanced technology like the automated tool control unit or ATC for the aviation industry. You remember that I mentioned the launch of ATC last quarter and the reception since has been enthusiastic. Beyond that, we also established important partnerships with technical schools focus on automotive, aviation and alternative energy. We're putting Snap-on in the ground-floor couriers for those critical industries. We're confident it'll pay off and make them Snap-on customers for life. All of those, all of those products helped drive our business and improve our great position in this strategic arena. Also us in the C&I group, is where we have our Asian and emerging markets businesses. We spent the past few years building physicals in those geographies. During 2010, we expanded plans and launched new products designed specifically for those markets, from automotive hand held diagnostics to professional brand of hand tools. We're building physicals primarily to serve the local markets, but they're powered by Snap-on technology and expertise that reflect our history and legacy of innovation and productivity and that gives us an advantage in those fragmented but growing markets. We can particularly see that growth in China and India at increases at a rapid pace in both markets. And I believe when you think of emerging markets, it's worth noting that the repair cycle is just getting started in those economies, and there's much more opportunity for Snap-on in that arena. Overall in the quarter and throughout 2010, the advances in C&I were marked by solid volume gains and improved profitability all across the group, and we see those businesses clearly moving forward along an extended runway for growth. 
Moving onto the Tools group where we served professional automotive technicians. As I said, it's back above prerecession levels. Big-ticket activity is strong. The overall year-over-year fourth quarter volume gain of 12.8% was led by the U.S. The operating margin was 9.6%. And it offers a bit of complicated comparison because of non-comparable items both in 2009 and 2010. Aldo will provide some more detailed analysis. I'll just highlight that we recorded restructuring in the fourth quarter in the Tools group up $4.6 million. Absent that charge, the Tools group margin of 11.3% is in-line with the full-year result and includes our focus report to successfully maintain the strength of our franchising network. I do believe that the relatively modest decline in the Tools group volume during 2009 and then having it to be among the first to recover the testimony to the strength of our franchisees. We recognized that advantage as we went the turbulence. We were committed to maintaining and supporting the network through the difficulties and by all accounts, it worked. The key indicators of franchise health are quite positive, turnovers have been adduced, cash collections are strong and delinquencies are at low levels. The advantage that is the Snap-on franchisee network remains robust. I already spoke about big-ticket strengths. Here again early on, we said that these categories would lead us out of the downturn and they have. As I meet with the franchisees, their outlook is upbeat. We have record attendance at our annual conference earlier in the year, and over 2000 franchises made additional commitments to attend, refine field training program. And as I meet with them, they are quite excited about our new award-winning products. Some of those are high-tech innovations like the verdict handheld diagnostic unit and some are just great designs that demonstrate connection with our customers like low-profile racids, all-in-one wire strippers, crimpers and cutters or the compact clutch version of the cordless CT 561 impact wrench. These three items and many others all have one thing in common, they make work easier for technicians operating in an ever-changing and ever increasingly tight space, and they've helped the Tools group recovery. 
Aldo will talk in some detail about the results of the Financial Services segment, but I'll only say that we believe our in-house financing capabilities are unique advantage. It's a special Snap-on feature that makes our franchisee network stronger. Bringing Snap-on Credit home, after we entered a joint venture with CIT has been a smooth transition. No interruptions to our franchisees or to our end customers. We are confident that we could execute in integrating the credit company, and we did just that. And as evidence of that successful integration, the Financial Services operation is demonstrating the same strong profitability ramp up we always expected. Snap-on Credit has been a strategic strength. It's now becoming a significant profit contributor, and we believe it's only going to get better. 
Now for some discussion on Repair Systems and Information or the RCI group. Fourth quarter organic sales were up 16.8% and the operating margin was 19.7% both representing substantial improvements from last year. I already mentioned the big movers, undercar equipment continued its fourth quarter trends of double-digit year-over-year increases. We gain position in that arena around the world. We've also increased facilitation in essential tool activities through equipment solutions are EQS. The vehicle manufacturers are gaining more confidence as we go forward investing in service and we're playing our part. We continue to invest in RS&I because we see the opportunity to make strategic gains with repair shop owners and managers and to expand our presence within shops of varying types. For example, the RS&I group is expanding in the medium heavy truck is expanding in the medium- and heavy-duty truck repair, growing with investments in that segment. Growing and we're investing in truck repair information, essential diagnostic tools for diesel engines and diagnostic products aimed particularly at fleet. Truck is an area that's a natural fit for Snap-on, and we are on the upswing. During the fourth quarter, the progress was rewarded when Snap-on product was used by the American Trucking Association at the repair information source for their supertech competition. It's a great opportunity to further introduce our product to fleet customers and was a fine endorsement of Snap-on for the heavy truck segment. Also during the year, Mitchell 1, our business that provides shop and repair information launched new shop management software with expanded and integrated parts capabilities. The new offerings will make work easier for the shops and it's helping strengthen Mitchell 1 already substantial repair shop position. I'll just wrap up the RS&I discussion with a final word about innovation. Snap-on has received significant attention and recognition for new products in the last year. One is the Quadriga, a fully automated tire changer recently was the recipient of an innovation award from the professional tool and equipment news. Snap-on's cutting-edge 3D imaging technology along with Proto software around aligners is leading to gain in that important aligner segment, a crucial segment for the equipment business, and we have new wheel balancer technology. Technology the lasermax tire wear and helps predict tire replacement need. It's the first of its kind in the industry. Of course, as we've mentioned before, we have the fully functional VERDICT diagnostic handheld unit. It set a new standard with WiFi access, integration of Mitchell 1 repair information and wireless touchscreen all in the technician's hand that allows remote used by the technician from anywhere in the shop. These are productivity enhancing tools. They are also attractive, quite attractive to shop owners and managers and helping Snap-on expand its positions with that important customer base. And they were, in the fourth quarter, a big contributor to the fourth quarter and the full year RS&I achievement. So I'll can say, our fourth quarter was a furthering of a positive trend we've seen now for several periods. Organic sales were up over 13%, operating income up over 40% and this was against the headwinds generated by the continued weakness in Southern Europe and by the OEM dealership consolidations. Overall, we're encouraged by the results and by what they say about a clear runway for growth and we have going forward. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo for the financial review, then I'll make a few closing comments. Aldo?"

Net sales in the fourth quarter of $697 million increased to 12.7% year-over-year. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased to $83 million or 13.6%. The primary drivers behind the year-over-year sales increase include double-digit sales growth across many of our businesses including sales to franchisees in the United States, customers in critical industries in emerging markets, and increased facilitation program activities with automotive OEM dealerships. Including higher sales of essential tools. Sales of undercar equipment to repair facilities were also up significantly, driven by imaging alignment product sales gains across all major geographies. While continuing to be impacted by the challenging economic conditions throughout Southern Europe, sales in our European base handtool business also experienced year-over-year increases, particularly in Northern Europe. Consolidated gross profit of $319 million in the quarter increased $34.1 million from 2009 levels, driven by higher sales, favorable manufacturing utilization and savings from ongoing Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI initiatives and restructuring actions. These gross profit increases were partially offset by a $6.5 million of lower year-over-year LIFO related inventory valuation benefits. The higher LIFO benefits in 2009 resulted from inventory reductions including the liquidation of slow moving and excess inventories as we adjusted production to adjust to the weakened demand during the economic downturn. As a result, consolidated gross margin of 45.7% in the quarter decreased to 30 basis points from 46% last year. Operating increases expenses in the quarter were $231 million increased approximately $18 million from the prior year primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses including $4.1 million of higher U.S. pension expense largely due to the amortization of investment losses incurred in 2008 related to our domestic pension plan assets. Operating expenses were also impacted by $3.8 million of higher year-over-year performance-based incentive compensation expense and $1.7 million of higher stock-based mark-to-market expense. These operating expense increases were partially offset by $4.9 million of lower bad debt expense, $2.5 million of benefits from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives and the $1.6 million favorable currency effects. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 33.1% in the quarter improved 140 basis points from 34.5% last year. Restructuring cost in the fourth quarter of 2010 of $5.8 million compared to $6.7 million last year. Restructuring cost in 2010 include initial cost to consolidated our North American tool storage operations. For the full year, restructuring charges or $14.2 million in 2010 compared to $22 million incurred the last year. Financial Services operating earnings of $9.4 million in the quarter improved $13.2 million from the fourth quarter 2009 loss of $3.8 million. On a sequential basis, Financial Services operating earnings improved $4.4 million from third quarter 2010 levels. As evidenced by the continued quarter-over-quarter improvements in the sequential operating performance, we expected operating earnings from Financial Services will continue to improve as the on-book financed portfolio grows. We'll cover Financial Services in more detail in a few minutes. 
Interest expense of $40 million in the fourth quarter decreased slightly from 2009 levels, reflecting lower average debt levels partially offset by higher average interest rates. In December, we issued $250 million of 4.25% seven-year senior notes. The proceeds from these notes are being used for general corporate purposes, which may include the funding of Snap-on Credit on balance sheet financed portfolio and the August 2011 repayment of $200 million of debt upon its maturity. Incremental interest expense in the fourth quarter related to these notes was about $600,000. Going forward, interest expense associated with these new notes will approximate $2.7 million per quarter or about $0.03. Our fourth quarter of 2010 effective income tax rate of 30.1% compares favorably to 31.4% in the fourth quarter of last year. As noted in our earnings release, the fourth quarter 2010 effective income tax rate benefited primarily from non-recurring tax items including the late December extension of certain federal tax incentives. Finally, net earnings of in the quarter of $57.9 or $0.99 per diluted share including $0.06 from the non-recurring tax items increased $21.3 million or $0.36 per diluted share from fourth quarter 2009 levels. With that, let's now turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I group on Slide 7. Fourth quarter sales of $282 million improved 14 1/2% from fourth quarter 2009 levels. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased more than 15%. The year-over-year sales increase was again driven by higher sales across all operating units, particularly by our businesses serving customers in critical industries and emerging markets. Gross profit in the C&I segment of $108 million in the quarter increased 28.4% from 2009 levels. This $24 million gross profit increased is primarily due to higher sales, $4.8 million of lower restructuring costs and $3.1 million of savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives. The gross profit comparison also benefited from improving manufacturing utilization primarily in Europe as a result of increased production levels. Gross margin of 38.4% improved 420 basis points from 34.2% last year including 200 basis points from the lower restructuring costs. Operating expenses in the quarter of $72.6 million increased $5.3 million from 2009 levels primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses improved back 160 basis points year-over-year. Operating earnings of $35.4 million for the C&I segment in the fourth quarter of 2010 increased $18.6 million or more than doubled from 2009 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating margin in the C&I segment of 12.6% in the quarter improved 580 basis points from 6.8% last year. 
Turning now to Slide 8. On a worldwide basis, fourth quarter organic sales in the Snap-on Tools group increased 12.8% year-over-year including 15.2% increase in the United States and a 6.7% increase in the international franchise operations. Fourth quarter gross profit in the Snap-on Tools group was $107 million in both years. Gross profit contributions in 2010 from higher sales were more than offset by $6.5 million of lower year-over-year LIFO related inventory benefits and $4.6 million of higher restructuring costs. As mentioned earlier, the higher level of LIFO benefits in 2009 resulted from inventory reductions including the liquidation of slow moving and excess inventories as we adjusted production in response to the weakened demand. Gross margin in the Snap-on Tools group was 40% in the fourth quarter of 2010 as compared to 45.3% last year last year including the 440 basis point reduction from the year-over-year LIFO impacts and the higher restructuring costs. Operating expenses of $81.4 million in the quarter increased from $7.1 million from 2009 levels primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 30.4% improved 90 basis points from 31.3% last year. Including the impacts of lower LIFO-related inventory valuation benefits and higher restructuring costs, fourth quarter operating earnings for Snap-on Tools $25.8 million or 9.6% of sales compared to $33.1 million or 14% of sales last year. After adjusting for LIFO and restructuring in both years, operating income as a percentage of sales was comparable in both years. Turning to the repair systems and information or SNI group, showing on Slide 9. Fourth quarter sales of $232 million increased $30 million or 14.9% year-over-year. Excluding currency translation, sales increased 16.8% led by greater sales of undercar equipment in both the Americas and Europe, higher sales of diagnostics and Mitchell 1 information products and increased activity with automotive OEM dealerships primarily due to increased essential tool and facilitation program sales. Gross profit of $103 million in the quarter increased $10.4 million or 11.2% from 2009 levels, primarily due to higher sales and contributions from favorable manufacturing utilization as a result of increased production levels. As a percentage of sales, gross margin of 44% decreased 140 basis points from 46% last year. This is primarily due to shift in sales mix that included greater sales of lower margin essential tool and facilitation program sales to OEM dealerships. Operating expenses of $57.6 million in the quarter decreased slightly from 2009 levels as higher volume related, product development and other costs are more than offset by $3.6 million of lower bad debt expense and $2.2 million of savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives. Operating earnings of $45.7 million the quarter for RS&I segment increased $10.7 million or 30.6% from 2009 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating margin in the quarter of 19.7% improved 240 basis points from 17.3% last year. 
Now, turning to Slide 10. Financial Services operating earnings of $9.4 million in the fourth quarter compares favorably to both third quarter 2010 earnings of $5 million and to fourth quarter 2009 loss of $3.8 million. The $13.2 million year-over-year increase in operating earnings primarily reflects the higher revenue contributions from Snap-on Credit growing on financed portfolio. Originations in the quarter increased 7.5% compared to the prior year. 
Moving to Slide 11. As of 2010 year-end, our balance sheet includes gross financing receivables of $592 million from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operation and $141 million from our international finance subsidiaries for a total financing portfolio of $733 million. In the United States, $491 million or a 83% of the Snap-on Credit portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. Snap-on Credit also continues to manage the run-off portfolio contracts owned by CIT, which totaled $260 million at year-end, and which is down $57 million from third quarter 2010 levels and down $330 million from year-end 2009 levels. For the full year, the on-booked financing portfolio at Snap-on Credit grew about $325 million. Regarding financed portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to in line with our expectations. 
Now turning to Slide 12. Consolidated operating cash flow of $64.3 million for the quarter and $140.4 million for the year includes the effect of a $48 million discretionary cash contribution to our U.S. pension plans. Operating cash flow for the full year was also impacted by $112 million of higher levels of trade and other receivables and inventories as a result of increased sales and customer demand. Our year-end cash position of $572 million increased $212 million from third quarter 2010 levels primarily due to the proceeds from the December note issuance and cash flow from operations. These cash increases were partially offset by the funding of new loans originated by Snap-on Credit and capital expenditures. As a result, free cash flow from operating company was $25.8 million for the fourth quarter and $91.1 million for the full year. as anticipated, free cash flow from financial services was negative in 2010 as a result of funding new loan originations. We expect that the impact of loan originations of free cash will lessen over time once the on-book portfolio stabilizes. Capital expenditures of $28 million in the quarter $51 million for the full year included the continued expansion of our manufacturing capabilities and lower cost regions in emerging markets. Investments have focused on increased efficiency and cost reduction and improvements at our Kenosha, Wisconsin R&D facilities and headquarters. 
As seen on Slide 13, working capital metrics improved year-over-year. Day sales outstanding for trade receivables of 61 days at  2010 year-end improved from 63 days last year. On a trailing 12 month basis, inventory turns at 2010 year-end of 4.7x improved considerably from 4.1x last year. Net debt at the end of the quarter was $596 million. Our net debt to cap ratio of 30.1% compares to 22.2% last year and 29.2% at the end of third quarter, reflecting the $250 million December note issuance. Excluding the $107.8 million withheld for the previously disclosed dispute with CIT, our year-end net debt-to-cap ratio would have been 33.7%. In addition to our $572 million in cash and our cash flows from operations, we continue to maintain a $500 million revolving credit facility, a $100 million asset-backed securitization facility and $20 million of committed bank lines. In addition to these facilities, our current A2P2 short-term credit rating allows us to access the commercial paper markets should we choose to do so. As of 2010 year-end, no amount were outstanding under any of these facilities. This concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. 
Before turning the call back to Nick to provide his final thoughts, I'd like to mention some considerations for our 2011 outlook as covered in our press release. In 2011, we expect to incur $11 million of higher year-over-year pension expense, largely due to the amortization of investment losses incurred in 2008 related to our U.S. pension plan assets. Capital expenditures at 2011 are anticipated to be in the range of $55 million to $65 million, and we anticipate a full-year effective income tax rate of approximately 33%. And as discussed earlier, interest expense in our fourth quarter debt issuance will approximate $2.7 million or $0.03 per diluted share per quarter. With that, I'll now turn it back over to Nick."

First, the Snap-on Credit creation processes are continuing to drive improvement. We saw the results in a new products coming, in our profits and achievements like the Murphy factory being named in the top 10 and in our successful integration of the credit company. And we believe there is a long road of progress still to be traveled. Secondly, many of our businesses have recovered, returning to prerecession levels. At the same time, we do has selected areas particularly Southern Europe and the OEM dealership segment that have some way to go. Finally, we see in the results that our runways for growth are clear. We review substantially in the quarter while still facing the headwinds of Spain and the rest of Southern Europe and the OEM dealerships segment. Those increases were driven by decisive strategic gains, enhancing our franchise network, expanding with shop owners, extending to critical industries and building in emerging markets. And we can see further and expansive opportunities in each of those areas. Overall, I think you'll remember we said entering the recession that we would navigate the difficulties and emerge stronger than before. We believe the fourth quarter results continuing the trend defined through 2010 are evidence that we did just that. But most importantly, those results indicate that we're positioned quite well, Snap-on is positioned quite well to capitalize on the abundant opportunities for growth that stretch out before us.

And these are events which lead off the year. We hold them in January and then distributed around the country in places like Chicago and Deadwood, South Dakota and Phoenix and so on. And the attendance at those was a record, and the enthusiasm for the programs that are coming forward was very positive. So I'd have to say that the anecdotal reports from the individual dealers, I attended a couple of them myself, the anecdotal reports from the dealers seem to match up with the numbers to say that we're gaining position and then it looks like that, that group is getting its momentum moving forward positively.

I would say that you could you would be entitled to believe that over the last say, two or three years, we've learned a lot how to manage the franchise systems with lower cost associated with turbulence in the franchisees. and we've made a lot of attention to their profitability as well. So we boosted their profits at an average basis and then paid attention who's going in there and that all works pretty well. Actually, it's one of the things I just want to say a little bit more that it's one of the advantages of Snap-on and when we have a so many franchisees, you may have a big portion of the 3,500 people in the United States that are capable of running these franchisees. It's kind of a barrier to entry and tactical advantage that's hard to duplicate and hard to deal with for some of our competitors."

As we look at our fourth quarter, we're once again encouraged both by our financial performance and by our advancements in the areas we've identified as being of strategic importance. Overall, volumes in the quart",2468,"Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everyone. As we look at our fourth quarter, we're once again encouraged both by our financial performance and by our advancements in the areas we've identified as being of strategic importance. 
Overall, volumes in the quarter were up 13.6%, and the gains were widely spread across customer bases, across operating units and across geographies. Operating earnings rose nearly 44%, and the overall margin of 13 1/2% increased 270 basis points from last year powered by expansion in the operating company, as well us by the ramp up in our Financial Services profitability. Excluding the Financial Services operations, the 12.6% operating margin was up well over the 11.5% registered in 2009. 
Importantly, I think, the results confirmed continuing progress and the building momentum. It was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales increases, and these results represent the largest of those gains. Also the operating margins were the highest of the year's, defining a bright line of progress throughout 2010. I believe it's clear that Snap-on closed out 2010 in a much stronger position than when we entered the year. Of course, there was improvement in the overall global economic environment, and we've taken advantage. But we've also strengthened our tactical execution driven by our commitment to the Snap-on Value Creation Processes, Rapid Continuous Improvement, or RCIs as we call it, innovation, customer connection, quality and safety. They continued to drive improvement. And the good news is that there's much more to gain. There's much more to go. 
Beyond that, we've achieved much more progress in those focus areas that we believe will be strategically decisive for our future, enhancing our franchisee network, expanding the company's presence with repair shop owners and managers, rolling the Snap-on brand out of the garage, extending into other mission-critical areas or arenas and building our physical capabilities in emerging markets. We're making progress in each of those areas. 
Now let me for a moment touch on what we're seeing in the economy and the related sales activity. It's actually a somewhat refreshing and a more straightforward discussion than we had in 2009. Most trends are in fact positive. Those areas that already demonstrated signs of recovery continue to show progress. Take for example the Tools group, serving professional automotive technicians, that business returned to pre-downturn levels in the third quarter, and the recovery was confirmed again in the fourth quarter. 
As part of that trend, activity in big-ticket items remains strong. These are longer payback products like hand held diagnostic units and undercar equipment or more discretionary items like tool storaging. We watch those particular sales trends because we believe they are reasonably accurate barometer of our customers' financial health and of their confidence. 
The strength in those big-ticket products was across the board with diagnostics and tools storage units driving increased sales to the Tools group and undercar equipment, especially high-value aligners bolstering sales in the repair systems and information group, which serves vehicle repair shop owners and managers. I think we can say the trends here were consistently encouraging throughout 2010. Each quarter had year-over-year gains in all three big-ticket categories, and the fourth quarter rise outpaced our overall sales increase.
We also continued to register recovered activity in the Industrial business with professional users in critical industries all across the globe. And beyond that, emerging markets have just continued to be robust, and the fourth quarter was no exception. So the areas I just discussed were continuation of the positive trends we saw in the earlier periods. But we also saw some additional favorable signs in the spaces that have been slower to recover. 
For example, our business that are tied to automotive OEM dealerships. Although the North American dealership base continues to contract and it is an ongoing challenge, we did see some considerable increases relating to essential tool distributions in both North America and Europe. In the fourth quarter we registered some solid gains as those customers became more willing to commit. In Europe, an area of mixed economies overall, we did see our strongest year-over-year increase in the fourth quarter, solid double digits. 
I already mentioned the continuing strength in undercar equipment in the region, but we also saw strong comparisons in the northern and central countries of Europe like Sweden and Germany and favorability in the Eastern emerging economies where we've added additional presence in Belarus and recently ramped up our production in the Minsk facility. So there are real positives in Europe. 
But the south, especially Spain, hasn't changed. It's still weak, and that's a market which is significant for us. It is a significant market for Snap-on. So overall, we registered an encouraging quarter, and that was encouraging while still fighting the headwinds generated by our major markets in the south of Europe and by the consolidation of the OEM dealership space. 
Now I'll provide some highlights for each of the segments and mention some of the progress we made on our strategic areas of focus. Commercial and Industrial, or C&I, posted a volume increase from 2009 of 15.4%. The operating earnings were up over $18 million recovering smartly to 12.6% of sales from the 6.8% registered last year. We're gaining position in C&I, and we're also seeing the benefits from RCI and from restructuring actions. 
Speaking of RCI, one of the real highlights in the quarter was a recognition of our power tool plant in Murphy, North Carolina as one of North America's 10 best [Audio Gap] It's an annual competition conducted by IndustryWeek magazine with which Snap-on has some experience. Our Milwaukee hand tool plant was a finalist last year. Excellence in manufacturing is sought out and evaluated, and the judges liked what they saw in Snap-on Murphy. 
IndustryWeek, in their comments, highlighted the breadth and depth of the RCI culture at Murphy as a key driver in that plant's excellence. Endorsements like that only come from hard work and dedication. So I congratulate and I thank the associates at our Murphy's facility for this success.
The C&I segment is also where we see clear one way from growth and leveraging our powerful brand to further penetrate market outside of automotive repair. Snap-on progress in serving new customers in critical industries is quite evident in our Industrial business' fourth quarter performance. Sales were up there about 17% from last year, with particular strength in international markets and that capped of a gain of over 20% for the full year. That progress was driven by both an increasingly clear customer focus and also by innovative new products specifically aimed at solutions for those particular segments, products such as the large tools for mining, tethered tools for working at heights and aerospace and energy industries and products with advanced technology like the Automated Tool Control unit or ATC for the aviation industry. 
You might remember that I mentioned the launch of ATC last quarter, and the reception since has been enthusiastic. Beyond that, we also established important partnerships with technical schools focused on automotive, aviation and alternative energy. We're putting Snap-on in at the ground-floor of careers pretext in those critical industries. We're confident it will pay off and make them Snap-on customers for life. All of those products helped drive our improved and growing position in this strategic arena. 
Also in the C&I group is where we have our Asian and emerging markets businesses. We spent the past few years building physicals in those geographies. 
During 2010, we expanded plants and launched new products designed specifically for those markets, from automotive hand held diagnostics to professional brand of hand tools. We're building the physicals primarily to serve in the local markets, but they're powered by Snap-on technology and expertise that reflect our history and legacy of innovation and productivity, and that gives us an advantage in those fragmented but growing markets. 
We can particularly see that growth in China and India, as increases continued at a rapid pace in both those markets. And I believe when you think of emerging markets, it's worth noting that the repair cycle is just getting started in those economies, and there's much more opportunity for Snap-on in that arena. Overall on the quarter and throughout 2010, the advances in C&I were marked by solid volume gains and improved profitability all across the group, and we see those businesses clearly moving forward along an extended runway for growth. 
Moving onto the Tools group, where we served professional automotive technicians. As I said, it's back above prerecession levels. Big-ticket activity is strong. The overall year-over-year fourth quarter volume gain of 12.8% was led by the U.S.. The operating margin was 9.6%. And it offers a bit of a complicated comparison because of non-comparable items both in 2009 and 2010. Aldo will provide some more detailed analysis. 
I'll just highlight that we recorded restructuring in the fourth quarter in the Tools group of $4.6 million. Absent that charge, the Tools group margin of 11.3% is in line with the full-year result and includes our focused support to successfully maintain the strength of our franchising network. I do believe that the relatively modest decline in the Tools group volume during 2009 and then having to be among the first to recover is a testimony to the strength of our franchisees. We recognized that advantage as we went into the turbulence. We were committed to maintaining and supporting the network through the difficulties, and by all accounts, it worked. 
The key indicators of franchise health are quite positive. Turnovers have been reduced. Cash collections are strong and delinquencies are at low levels. The advantage that is that the Snap-on franchisee network remains robust. I already spoke about big-ticket strengths. Here again, early on, we said that these categories would lead us out of the downturn and they have. 
And as I meet with the franchisees, their outlook is upbeat. We have record attendance at our annual conference earlier in the year. Over 2,000 franchises made additional commitments to attend refine field training programs. And as I meet with them, they're quite excited about our new award-winning products. Some of those are high-tech innovations like the VERDICT hand held diagnostic unit, and some are just great designs that demonstrate connection with our customers like low-profile ratchets, all-in-one wire stripper, crimpers and cutters or the compact-clutch version of the cordless CT 561 impact wrench. These three items and many others all have one thing in common. They make work easier for technicians operating in an ever-changing and ever increasingly tight space, and they've helped create the Tools group recovery. 
Aldo will talk in some detail about the results of the Financial Services segment, but I'll only say that we believe our in-house financing capabilities are a unique advantage. It's a special Snap-on feature that makes our franchisee network stronger. Bringing Snap-on Credit home, after we entered a joint venture with CIT has been a smooth transition. No interruptions to our franchisees or to our end-customers. 
We are confident we could execute on integrating the credit company, and we did just that. And as evidence of that successful integration, the Financial Services operation is demonstrating the same strong profitability ramp up we always expected. Snap-on Credit has been a strategic strength. It's now becoming a significant profit contributor, and we believe it's only going to get better. 
Now for some discussion on Repair Systems and Information or the RS&I group. Fourth quarter organic sales were up 16.8%, and the operating margin was 19.7%, both representing substantial improvements from last year. I already mentioned the big movers. Undercar equipment continued its fourth quarter trends of double-digit year-over-year increases. We've gained position in that arena around the world. 
We've also increased facilitation and essential tools activity through equipment solutions or EQS. The vehicle manufacturers are gaining more confidence, as we go forward, investing in service, and we're playing our part. We continue to invest in RS&I because we see the opportunity to make strategic gains with repair shop owners and managers and to expand our presence within shops of varying types. 
For example, the RS&I group is expanding in medium and heavy-duty truck repair, growing with investments in that segment. And we're investing in truck repair information, essential diagnostic tools for diesel engines and diagnostics products aimed particularly at fleet. Truck is an area that's a natural fit for Snap-on, and we are on the upswing. During the fourth quarter, that progress was rewarded when Snap-on product was used by the American Trucking Association at the repair information source for their SuperTech competition. It's a great opportunity to further introduce our product to fleet customers, and it was a fine endorsement of Snap-on for the heavy truck segment. 
Also during the year, Mitchell 1, our business that provides shop and repair information, launched new shop management software with expanded and integrated parts capabilities. The new offerings will make work easier for the shops, and it's helping strengthen Mitchell 1's already substantial repair shop position. 
I'll just wrap up the RS&I discussion with a final word about innovation. Snap-on has received significant attention and recognition for new products in the last year. One is the Quadriga, a fully automated tire changer, recently was the recipient of an Innovation Award from Professional Tool and Equipment News. Snap-on's cutting-edge 3D imaging technology along with Pro 42 [ph] Software around aligners is leading to gain in that important Aligner segment, a crucial segment for the Equipment business. And we have new wheel balancer technology. Technology that laser max tire wear and helps predict tire replacement need. It's the first of its kind in the industry. And of course, as we've mentioned before, we have the fully functional VERDICT diagnostic hand held unit. It set a new standard with WiFi access, integration of Mitchell 1 repair information and a wireless touchscreen, all in the technician's hands that allows remote use by the technician from anywhere in the shop. These are productivity enhancing tools. They're also attractive, quite attractive to shop owners and managers and their helping Snap-on expand its position with that important customer base. And they were, in the fourth quarter, a big contributor to the fourth quarter and the full-year RS&I achievement. 
So I think I can say, our fourth quarter was a furthering of the positive trend we've seen now for several periods. Organic sales were up over 13%, operating income up over 40%, and this was against the headwinds generated by the continued weakness in southern Europe and by the OEM dealership consolidation. Overall, we're encouraged by the results and by what they say about the clear runway for growth we have going forward. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo for the financial review, then I'll make a few closing comments. Aldo?"

Net sales in the fourth quarter of $697 million increased to 12.7% year-over-year. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased to $83 million or 13.6%. The primary drivers behind the year-over-year sales increase include double-digit sales growth across many of our businesses including sales to franchisees in the United States, customers in critical industries and emerging markets, and increased facilitation program activities with automotive OEM dealerships, including higher sales of essential tools. Sales of undercar equipment to repair facilities were also up significantly, driven by imaging alignment product sales gains across all major geographies. While continuing to be impacted by challenging economic conditions throughout southern Europe, sales in our European-based Hand Tool business also experienced year-over-year increases, particularly in northern Europe. 
Consolidated gross profit of $319 million in the quarter increased $34.1 million from 2009 levels, driven by higher sales, favorable manufacturing utilization and savings from ongoing Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI initiatives and restructuring actions. These gross profit increases were partially offset by $6.5 million of lower year-over-year LIFO-related inventory valuation benefits. The higher LIFO benefits in 2009 resulted from inventory reductions including the liquidation of slow moving and excess inventories, as we adjusted production in response to the weakened demand during the economic downturn. As a result, consolidated gross margin of 45.7% in the quarter decreased to 30 basis points from 46% last year. 
Operating increases expenses in the quarter of $231 million increased approximately $18 million from the prior year primarily due to higher volume-related and other expenses including $4.1 million of higher U.S. pension expense largely due to the amortization of investment losses incurred in 2008 related to our domestic pension plan assets. Operating expenses were also impacted by $3.8 million of higher year-over-year performance-based incentive compensation expense and $1.7 million of higher stock-based mark-to-market expense. These operating expense increases were partially offset by $4.9 million of lower bad debt expense, $2.5 million of benefits from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives and $1.6 million favorable currency effects. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 33.1% in the quarter improved 140 basis points from 34.5% last year. 
Restructuring cost in the fourth quarter of 2010 of $5.8 million, compared to $6.7 million last year. Restructuring cost in 2010 include initial cost to consolidate our North American tool storage operations. For the full year, restructuring charges or $14.2 million in 2010, compared to $22 million incurred last year. 
Financial Services operating earnings of $9.4 million in the quarter improved $13.2 million from the fourth quarter 2009 loss of $3.8 million. On a sequential basis, Financial Services operating earnings improved $4.4 million from third quarter 2010 levels. As evidenced by the continued quarter-over-quarter improvements in the sequential operating performance, we expected operating earnings from Financial Services will continue to improve as the on-book finance Portfolio grows. We'll cover Financial Services in more detail in a few minutes. 
Interest expense of $14 million in the fourth quarter decreased slightly from 2009 levels, reflecting lower average debt levels partially offset by higher average interest rates. In December, we issued $250 million of 4.25% seven-year senior notes. The proceeds from these notes are being used for general corporate purposes, which may include the funding of Snap-on Credit on balance sheet finance portfolio and the August 2011 repayment of $200 million of debt upon its maturity. 
Incremental interest expense in the fourth quarter related to these notes was about $600,000. Going forward, interest expense associated with these new notes will approximate $2.7 million per quarter or about $0.03. 
Our fourth quarter of 2010 effective income tax rate of 30.1% compares favorably to 31.4% in the fourth quarter of last year. As noted in our earnings release, the fourth quarter 2010 effective income tax rate benefited primarily from non-recurring tax items including the late December extension of certain federal tax incentives. Finally, net earnings of in the quarter of $57.9 million or $0.99 per diluted share, including $0.06 from the non-recurring tax items, increased $21.3 million or $0.36 per diluted share from fourth quarter 2009 levels. 
With that, let's now turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I group on Slide 7. Fourth quarter sales of $282 million improved 14 1/2% from fourth quarter 2009 levels. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased more than 15%. The year-over-year sales increase was again driven by higher sales across all operating units, particularly by our businesses serving customers in critical industries and emerging markets. 
Gross profit in the C&I segment of $108 million in the quarter increased 28.4% from 2009 levels. This $24 million gross profit increase is primarily due to higher sales, $4.8 million of lower restructuring costs and $3.1 million of savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives. The gross profit comparison also benefited from improving manufacturing utilization, primarily in Europe, as a result of increased production levels. 
Gross margin of 38.4% improved 420 basis points from 34.2% last year including 200 basis points from the lower restructuring costs. Operating expenses in the quarter of $72.6 million increased $5.3 million from 2009 levels, primarily due to higher volume-related and other expenses. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses improved by 160 basis points year-over-year. 
Operating earnings of $35.4 million for the C&I segment in the fourth quarter of 2010 increased $18.6 million or more than doubled from 2009 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating margin in the C&I segment of 12.6% in the quarter improved 580 basis points from 6.8% last year. 
Turning now to Slide 8. On a worldwide basis, fourth quarter organic sales in the Snap-on Tools group increased 12.8% year-over-year including a 15.2% increase in the United States and a 6.7% increase in our international franchise operations. Fourth quarter gross profit in the Snap-on Tools group was $107 million in both years. Gross profit contributions in 2010 from higher sales were more than offset by $6.5 million of lower year-over-year LIFO-related inventory benefits and $4.6 million of higher restructuring costs. As mentioned earlier, the higher level of LIFO benefits in 2009 resulted from inventory reductions including the liquidation of slow moving and excess inventories, as we adjusted production in response to the weakened demand. 
Gross margin in the Snap-on Tools group was 40% in the fourth quarter of 2010, as compared to 45.3% last year, including a 440 basis point reduction from the year-over-year LIFO impacts and the higher restructuring costs. Operating expenses of $81.4 million in the quarter increased $7.1 million from 2009 levels, primarily due to higher volume-related and other expenses. 
As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 30.4% improved 90 basis points from 31.3% last year. Including the impacts of lower LIFO-related inventory valuation benefits and higher restructuring costs, fourth quarter operating earnings for Snap-on Tools was $25.8 million or 9.6% of sales, compared to $33.1 million or 14% of sales last year. After adjusting for LIFO and restructuring in both years, operating income as a percentage of sales was comparable in both years. 
Turning to the Repair Systems and Information or RS&I group, shown on Slide 9. Fourth quarter sales of $232 million increased $30 million or 14.9% year-over-year. Excluding currency translation, sales increased 16.8% led by greater sales of undercar equipment in both the Americas and Europe, higher sales of diagnostics and Mitchell 1 information products and increased activity with automotive OEM dealerships primarily due to increased essential tool and facilitation program sales. Gross profit of $103 million in the quarter increased $10.4 million or 11.2% from 2009 levels, primarily due to higher sales and contributions from favorable manufacturing utilization as a result of increased production levels. 
As a percentage of sales, gross margin of 44.6% in the quarter decreased 140 basis points from 46% last year. This is primarily due to a  shift in sales mix that included greater sales of lower margin essential tool and facilitation program sales to OEM dealerships. Operating expenses of $57.6 million in the quarter decreased slightly from 2009 levels as higher volume-related, product-development and other costs are more than offset by $3.6 million of lower bad debt expense and $2.2 million of savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives. 
Operating earnings of $45.7 million in the quarter for RS&I segment increased $10.7 million or 30.6% from 2009 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating margin in the quarter of 19.7% improved 240 basis points from 17.3% last year. 
Now turning to Slide 10. Financial Services operating earnings of $9.4 million in the fourth quarter compares favorably to both third quarter 2010 earnings of $5 million and to fourth quarter 2009 loss of $3.8 million. The $13.2 million year-over-year increase in operating earnings primarily reflects the higher revenue contributions from Snap-on Credit's growing on-book finance portfolio. Originations in the quarter increased 7.5% compared to the prior year. 
Moving to Slide 11. As of 2010 year-end, our balance sheet includes gross financing receivables of $592 million from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operation and $141 million from our international finance subsidiaries, for a total financing portfolio of $733 million. In the United States, $491 million or 83% of the Snap-on Credit portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. 
Snap-on Credit also continues to manage the run-off portfolio contracts owned by CIT, which totaled $260 million at year-end, and which is down $57 million from third quarter 2010 levels and down $330 million from year-end 2009 levels. For the full year, the on-book financing portfolio at Snap-on Credit grew about $325 million. Regarding finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations. 
Now turning to Slide 12. Consolidated operating cash flow of $64.3 million for the quarter and $140.4 million for the year includes the effect of a $48 million discretionary cash contribution to our U.S. pension plans. Operating cash flow for the full year was also impacted by $112 million of higher levels of trade and other receivables and inventories, as a result of increased sales and customer demand. Our year-end cash position of $572 million increased $212 million from third quarter 2010 levels primarily due to the proceeds from the December note issuance and cash flow from operations. 
These cash increases were partially offset by the funding of new loans originated by Snap-on Credit and capital expenditures. As a result, free cash flow from the operating company was $25.8 million for the fourth quarter and $91.1 million for the full year. As anticipated, free cash flow from financial services was negative in 2010 as a result of funding new loan originations. We expect that the impact of loan originations on free cash flow will lessen over time once the on-book portfolio stabilizes. 
Capital expenditures of $28 million in the quarter and $51 million for the full year included the continued expansion of our manufacturing capabilities and lower cost regions and emerging markets. Investments have focused on increased efficiency and cost reduction and improvements at our Kenosha, Wisconsin R&D facilities and headquarters. 
As seen on Slide 13, working capital metrics improved year-over-year. Day sales outstanding for trade receivables of 61 days at  2010 year-end improved from 63 days last year. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns at 2010 year-end of 4.7x improved considerably from 4.1x last year. 
Net debt at the end of the quarter was $598.6 million. Our net debt to cap ratio of 30.1% compares to 22.2% last year and 29.2% at the end of third quarter, reflecting the $250 million December note issuance. Excluding the $107.8 million withheld for the previously disclosed dispute with CIT, our year-end net debt-to-cap ratio would have been 33.7%. 
In addition to our $572 million in cash and our cash flows from operations, we continue to maintain a $500 million revolving credit facility, a $100 million asset-backed securitization facility and $20 million of committed bank loans. In addition to these facilities, our current A2P2 short-term credit rating allows us to access the commercial paper markets should we choose to do so. As of 2010 year-end, no amount were outstanding under any of these facilities. This concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. 
Before turning the call back to Nick to provide his final thoughts, I'd like to mention some considerations for our 2011 outlook as covered in our press release. In 2011, we expect to incur $11 million of higher year-over-year pension expense, largely due to the amortization of investment losses incurred in 2008 related to our U.S. pension plan assets. Capital expenditures at 2011 are anticipated to be in the range of $55 million to $65 million, and we anticipate a full-year effective income tax rate of approximately 33%. And as discussed earlier, interest expense in our fourth quarter debt issuance will approximate $2.7 million or $0.03 per diluted share per quarter. With that, I'll now turn it back over to Nick."

First, the Snap-on Value Creation Processes are continuing to drive improvement. We saw the results in our new products, in our profits and achievements like the Murphy factory being named in the top 10 and in our successful integration of the credit company. 
And we believe there is a long road of progress still to be traveled. 
Secondly, many of our businesses have recovered, returning to prerecession levels. At the same time, we do have selected areas particularly southern Europe and the OEM dealership segment that have some way to go. Finally, we see in the results that our runways for growth are clear. We review substantially in the quarter while still facing the headwinds of Spain and the rest of southern Europe and the OEM dealerships segment. Those increases were driven by decisive strategic gains, enhancing our franchise network, expanding with shop owners, extending to critical industries and building in emerging markets. And we can see further and expansive opportunities in each of those areas. 
Overall, I think you remember, we said, entering the recession, that we would navigate the difficulties and emerge stronger than before. We believe the fourth quarter results continuing the trend defined through 2010 are evidence that we did just that. But most importantly, those results indicate that Snap-on is positioned quite well to capitalize on the abundant opportunities for growth that stretch out before us. 
Now before I turn the call over to the operator, I want to finish by thanking our associates and our franchisees. I know many of you are listening. The fourth quarter and the full-year results were only possible because of your efforts on behalf of Snap-on and because of your commitment to our team. for all of that, for your continuing support of our company, you have my congratulations, and you have my thanks.

So I'd have to say that the anecdotal reports from the individual dealers -- I attended a couple of them myself -- the anecdotal reports from the dealers seem to match up with the numbers to say that we're gaining position.

As we look at our fourth quarter, we’re once again encouraged both by our financial performance and by our advancements in the areas we’ve identified as being of strategic importance.Overall volumes in the quart",2511,"Thanks Leslie. Good morning everyone. As we look at our fourth quarter, we’re once again encouraged both by our financial performance and by our advancements in the areas we’ve identified as being of strategic importance.
Overall volumes in the quarter were up 13.6% and the gains were widely spread across customer basis, across operating units, and across geographies. Operating earnings rose nearly 44% and the overall margin of 13.5% increased 270 basis points from last year powered by expansion in the operating company as well as by the ramp up in our financial services profitability. Excluding the financial services operation, the 12.6% operating margin was up well over the 11.5% registered in 2009.
Importantly, I think the results confirm continuing progress and the building momentum. It was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales increases and these results represent the largest of those gains.
Also, the operating margins were the highest of the years defining a bright line of progress throughout 2010. I believe it’s clear that Snap-on closed out 2010 in a much stronger position than when we entered the year.
Of course there was improvement in the overall global economic environment and we’ve taken advantage. But we’ve also strengthen our tactical execution driven by our commitment to the Snap-on value creation processes, rapid continuous improvement or RCIs we call it, innovation, customer connection, quality and safety. They continue to drive improvement and the good news is that there’s much more to gain, there is much more to go.
Beyond that, we’ve achieved a much more progress in those focused areas that we believe will be strategically decisive for our future, enhancing our franchisee network, expanding the company’s presence with repair shop owners and managers, rolling the Snap-on brand out of the garage, extending into other mission critical areas or arenas, and building our physical capabilities in emerging market. We’re making progress in each of those areas.
Now, let me for a moment, touch on what we’re seeing in the economy in the related sales activity. It’s actually somewhat refreshing and a more straight-forward discussion than we had in 2009, most trends are in fact positive.
Those areas that already demonstrated signs of recovery continue to show progress. Take for example, the tools group serving professional automotive technicians, that business return to pre-downturn levels in the third quarter and the recovery was confirmed again in the fourth quarter.
As part of the trend, activity in big ticket items remained strong. These are longer payback products like handheld diagnostic units and under car equipment or more discretionary items like tool storage units. We watch those particular sales trends because they, we believe there are reasonably accurate parameter for our customer’s financial health and of their confidence.
The strength in those big ticket products was across the aboard with diagnostics and tool storage units driving increased sales to the tools group and undercar equipment especially high value aligners bolstering sales in the repair systems and information group which serves vehicle repair shop owners and managers.
I think we can say, the trends here were consistently encouraging throughout 2010. Each quarter had a year-over-year gains in all three big ticket categories and the fourth quarter ride outpaced our overall sales increase.
We also continue to register recovered activity in the industrial business with professional users and critical industries all across the globe. And beyond that, emerging markets just continue to be robust and the fourth quarter was no exception.
So the areas I just discussed were a continuation of the positive trend we saw in the earlier period. But we also saw some additional favorable signs in the spaces that have been slower to recover. For example, our businesses that are tied to automotive OEM dealerships, although, the North American dealership base continues to contract and it’s an ongoing challenge, we did see some considerable increases relating to essential tool distributions in both North America and Europe.
In the fourth quarter, we’ve registered some gains as those customers became more willing to commit. In Europe, in area of mixed economies overall, we did see our strongest year-over-year increase in the fourth quarter, solid double-digit.
I already mentioned, the continuing strength in under car equipment in the region, but we also saw strong comparisons in Northern and Central countries of Europe like Sweden and Germany and favorability in the at Eastern emerging economies where we’ve added additional presence in Belarus and recently ramped our production in the (inaudible) facility.
So there are real positives in Europe, but the South especially Spain hasn’t changed. It’s still weak, and that’s a market which is significant for us, it’s a significant market for Snap-on. So overall, we registered an encouraging quarter and that was encouraging while still fighting the headwinds generated by our major markets in the South of Europe and by the consolidation of the OEM dealership space.
Now, I’ll provide some highlights for each of the segments and mention some of the progress we made on our strategic areas of focus. Commercial and Industrial or C&I posted a volume increase from 2009 of 15.4%. The operating earnings were up over $18 million recovering smartly to 12.6% of sales from the 6.8% registered last year. We’re gaining in C&I and we’re also seeing the benefits or gaining position in C&I and we’re also seeing the benefits from RCI and from restructuring actions.
Speaking of RCI, one of the real highlights in the quarter was a recognition of our power to plant in Murphy, North Carolina as one of North America’s 10 best (inaudible) it’s an annual competition conducted by industry week magazine with which Snap-on has some experience. Our Milwaukee hand tool plants was a plant was the finalist last year.
Excellence in manufacturing has sort out and evaluated and the judges like what they saw in Snap-on Murphy. Industry weakened in their comments highlighted the breadth and depth of the RCI culture at Murphy as a key driver in that plant excellence. Endorsements like that only come from hard work and dedication. So I can congratulate and I thank the associate that our Murphy facility for the success.
The C&I segment is also where we see clear runway for growth and leveraging our powerful brand to further penetrate market outside of automotive repair. Snap-on progress in serving new customers in critical industries is quite evident in our industrial businesses with auto performance. Sales were up there about 17% from last year with particular strength in international market and that capped up a gain of over 20% for the full year.
That progress was driven by both an increasingly clear customer focus and also by innovative new products specifically aimed at solutions for those particular segments. Products such as the large tools for mining, tether tools for working at heights in aerospace and energy industries and products with advanced technology, like the automotive tool control unit or ATC for the aviation industry. You might remember that I mentioned the launch of ATC last quarter and reception since has been enthusiastic.
Beyond that, we also established important partnerships with technical schools focused on automotive, aviation, and alternative energy. We are putting Snap-on in at the ground floor careers for techs in those critical industries with (inaudible) payoff and make them Snap-on customers for life. All of those, all of those products help drive our improved and growing position in this strategic arena.
Also on in the C&I group is where we have our Asian and emerging market businesses. We’ve spent the past few years building physicals in those geographies. During 2010, we expanded plans and launched new products designed specifically for those markets.
From automotive handheld diagnostics to professional brand of hand tools, we are building the physicals primarily to serve in the local markets, but they are powered by Snap-on technology and expertise that reflect our history and legacy of innovation and productivity, and that gives us an advantage in those fragmented but growing markets.
We can particularly see that growth in China and India and increases continued at a rapid pace in both those markets. I believe when you think of emerging markets, it’s worth noting that the repair cycle is just getting started in those economies and there is much more opportunity for Snap-on in that arena.
Overall in the quarter and throughout 2010, the advance in C&I were marked by solid volume gains and improved profitability all throughout the group and we see those businesses clearly moving forward along an extended runway for growth.
Moving on to the tools group where we serve professional or automotive technicians, as I said it’s back above pre-recession levels. Big ticket activity is strong, the overall year-over-year fourth quarter volume gain of 12.8% was led by the U.S., the operating margin was 9.6% and it offers a bit of a complicated comparison because of non-comparable items both in 2009 and 2010.
As I will provide some more detailed analysis, I’ll just highlight that we’re reportedly structuring in the fourth quarter in the tools group of $4.6 million, absent that charge the tools group margin of 11.3% is in inline with the full year result and includes our focus support to successfully maintain the strength of our franchising network.
I do believe that the relatively modest decline in the tools group volume during 2009 and then having it to be among first to recover is a testimony to the strength of our franchisee. We recognized that advantage as we went into the turbulence. We were committed to maintaining and supporting the network through the difficulties and by all accounts, it worked.
The key indicators of franchisee are quite positive, turnover has been reduced. Cash collections are strong and delinquencies are at low level. The advantage that is to the Snap-on franchisee network remains robust.
I already spoke about big ticket strength. If you regain early on, we said that these categories would lead us out of the downturn and they have. And as I meet with the franchisees their outlook is upbeat. We have record attendance at our annual conference earlier in the year. Over 2000 franchisees made additional commitments to attend, refined field training program and as I meet with them, they are quite excited about our new award winning products.
Some of those are high tech innovations like the VERDICT, like the VERDICT handheld diagnostic unit and some are just great designs that demonstrate connection with our customers like low profile ratchets, all in one wire stripper, crimpers, and cutters with a compact clutch version of the cordless CT561 impact wrench.
These three items and many others all have one thing in common, they make work easier for technicians operating in an ever changing and ever increasingly tight space and they help create the tools group recovery. Aldo will talk in some detail about the results of the financial services segment, but I’ll only say that we believe our in-house financing capabilities are a unique advantage. It’s a special Snap-on feature that makes our franchising network stronger.
Bringing Snap-on credit home after we ended the joint venture with CIT has been a smooth transition. No interruption to our franchisees or to our end customers. We were confident we could execute on integrating the credit company and we did just that.
As evidence of that successful integration the financial services operations is demonstrating the same strong profitability ramp up as we always expected. Snap-on credit has been a strategic strength, it’s now becoming a significant profit contributor and we believe it’s only going to get better.
Now for some discussion on repair systems and information or the RS&I group. Fourth quarter organic sales were up 16.8% and the operating margin was 19.7%, both representing substantial improvements from last year.
I already mentioned the big movers, undercar equipment continued its fourth quarter trend of double digit year-over-year increases with gain positioned in that arena around the world.
We’ve also increased facilitation in essential tools activity through equipment solutions or EQS. The vehicle manufacturers are gaining more confidence as we go forward investing in service and were playing our part.
We continue to invest in RS&I because we see the opportunity to make strategic gains with repair shop owners and managers and to expand our presence within shops of varying types. For example, the RS&I group is expanding in medium and heavy duty truck repair growing with investments in that segment.
Growing with and we’re investing in truck repair information, essential diagnostic tools for diesel engines, and diagnostics for products aimed particularly at fleets. Truck is an area that’s a natural fit for Snap-on and we are on the upswing. During the fourth quarter that progress was rewarded when Snap-on product was used by the American Trucking Association as the repair information source for their SuperTech competition. It’s a great opportunity to further introduce our product to fleet customers and was a fine endorsement of Snap-on for the heavy truck segment.
Also during the year Mitchell1 our business that provides shop and repair information launched new shop management software with expanded and integrated parts capabilities. The new offerings will make work easier for the shops and it’s helping strengthen Mitchell1’s already substantial repair shop position.
I’ll just wrap up the odds in my discussion with the final word about innovation. Snap-on received significant attention and recognition for new products in the last year. One is the Quadriga, a fully automated tire changer, recently was the recipient of an Innovation Award from the Professional Tool and Equipment news. Snap-on’s cutting edge 3D imaging technology along with Pro-42 software around the liners is leading to gain to that important aligner segment, a crucial segment for the equipment business.
We have new wheel balancing technology, technology that laser maps tire wear and helps predict tire replacement needs. It’s the first of its kind in the industry. Of course, as we have mentioned before we have the fully functional VERDICT diagnostic hand held unit, it set a new standard with Wi-Fi access, integration of Mitchell1 repair information and a wireless touch screen, all in the technician’s hand that allows remote use by the technician from anywhere in the shop.
These are productivity enhancing tools. They are also attractive, quite attractive to shop owners and managers and they are helping Snap-on expand its position with that important customer base and they were in the fourth quarter a big contributor to the fourth quarter and the full year RS&I achievement.
So I think you can say, our fourth quarter was a further in of the positive trend we see now for several periods. Organic sales were up over 13%, operating income up over 40%, and this was against the headwinds generated by the continued weakness in southern Europe and the OEM dealership consolidation.
Overall, we are encouraged by the results. And by what they say about the clear runway for growth we have going forward. Now I’ll turn the call over to Aldo for the financial review, then I’ll make a few closing comments. Aldo?

Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased $83 million or 13.6%.The primary drivers b",2170,"Thanks Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on slide 6. Net sales in the fourth quarter of $697 million increased 12.7% year-over-year. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased $83 million or 13.6%.
The primary drivers behind the year-over-year sales increase include double-digit sales growth across many of our businesses including sales to franchisees in the United States, customers in critical industries and emerging markets, an increased facilitation program activities with automotive OEM dealerships including higher sales of essential tools.
Sales of under car equipment to repair facilities were also up significantly, driven by imaging alignment product sales gains across all major geographies. While continuing to be impacted by challenging economic conditions throughout Southern Europe, sales in our European based hand-tool business also experienced year-over-year increases, particularly in Northern Europe.
Consolidated gross profit of $319 million in the quarter increased $34.1 million from 2009 levels, driven by higher sales, favorable manufacturing utilization, and savings from ongoing rapid continuous improvement in our RCI initiatives and restructuring actions.
These gross profit increases were partially offset by $6.5 million, of lower year-over-year LIFO related inventory evaluation benefits. The higher LIFO benefits in 2009, resulted from inventory reductions including the liquidation of slow moving and excess inventories as we adjusted production response to the weakened demand during the economic down turn. As a result, consolidated gross margin of 45.7% in the quarter decreased 30 basis points from 46% last year.
Operating expenses in the quarter of $231 million increased approximately $18 million from the prior year primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses, including $4.1 million of higher U.S. pension expense, largely due to the amortization of investment losses incurred in 2008 related to our domestic pension plan assets.
Operating expenses were also impacted by $3.8 million of higher year-over-year performance based incentive compensation expense and $1.7 million of higher stock based mark-to-market expense.
These operating expense increases were partially offset by $4.9 million of lower bad debt expense, $2.5 million of benefits from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives and $1.6 million of favorable currency effects.
As a percent of sales, operating expenses of 33.1% in the quarter improved 140 basis points from 34.5% last year. Restructuring cost in the fourth quarter of 2010 of $5.8 compared to $6.7 million last year. Restructuring cost in 2010 include initial cost to consolidate our North American tool storage operations. For the full year, restructuring charges of $14.2 million in 2010 compared to $22 million incurred last year.
Financial services operating earnings of $9.4 million in the quarter improved $13.2 million from the fourth quarter 2009 loss of $3.8 million. On a sequential basis financial services operating earnings improved $4.4 million from third quarter 2010 levels.
As evidenced by the continued quarter-over-quarter improvements in the sequential operating performance, we expect that operating earnings from financial services will continue to improve as the on-book finance portfolio grows. We’ll cover financial services in more detail in a few minutes.
Interest expense of $14 million in the fourth quarter decreased slightly from 2009 levels, reflecting lower average debt levels partially offset by higher average interest rates. In December, we issued $250 million of 4.25% 7-year senior notes. The proceeds from these notes are being used for general corporate purposes which may include the funding of Snap-on credits on-balance sheet finance portfolio and the August 2011 repayment of $200 million of debt upon its maturity.
Incremental interest expense in the fourth quarter related to these notes was about $600,000. Going forward, interest expense associated with these new notes will approximate $2.7 million per quarter or about $0.03.
Our fourth quarter 2010 effective income tax rate of 30.1% compares favorably to 31.4% in the fourth quarter of last year. As noted in our earnings release, the fourth quarter 2010 effective income tax rate benefited primarily from non recurring tax items including the late December extension of certain Federal tax incentives.
Finally net earnings in the quarter of $57.9 million and $0.99 per diluted share including $0.06 from the non recurring tax items increased $21.3 million or $0.36 per diluted share from fourth quarter 2009 levels.
With that let’s now turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I Group on slide 7, fourth quarter sales of $282 million improved 14.5% from fourth quarter 2009 levels. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased more than 15%. The year-over-year sales increase was again driven by higher sales across all operating units particularly by our business serving customers in critical industries and emerging markets.
Gross profit in the C&I segment of $108 million in the quarter increased 28.4% from 2009 levels. This $24 million gross profit increase is primarily due to higher sales, $4.8 million of lower restructuring cost, and $3.1 million of savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives.
The gross profit comparison also benefited from improving manufacturing utilization primarily in Europe, as a result of increased production levels. Gross margin of 38.4% improved 420 basis points from 34.2% last year, including 200 basis points from the lower restructuring cost.
Operating expenses in the quarter of $72.6 million increased $5.3 million from 2009 levels, primarily due to a higher volume related and other expenses. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses improved by 160 basis points year-over-year.
Operating earnings of $35.4 million for the C&I segment in the fourth quarter of 2010 increased $18.6 million or more than double from 2009 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating margin in the C&I segment of 12.6% in the quarter improved 580 basis points from 6.8% last year.
Turning now to slide 8. On a worldwide basis, fourth quarter organic sales in the Snap-on tools group increased 12.8% year-over-year, including a 15.2% increase in the United States and a 6.7% increase in our international franchise operations. Fourth quarter gross profit in the Snap-on tools group was a $107 million in both years.
Gross profit contributions in 2010 from higher sales were more than offset by $6.5 million of lower year-over-year LIFO related inventory benefits and $4.6 million of higher restructuring cost.
As mentioned earlier, the higher level of LIFO benefits in 2009 resulted from inventory reductions, including the liquidation of slow moving and excess inventories as we adjusted production response to the weakened demand.
Gross margin in the Snap-on tools group was 40% in the fourth quarter of 2010 as compared to 45.3% last year, including a 440 basis point reduction from the year-over-year LIFO impacts and the higher restructuring cost.
Operating expenses of $81.4 million in the quarter increased $7.1 million from 2009 levels primarily due to a higher volume related and other expenses. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 30.4% improved 90 basis points from 31.3% last year.
Including the impacts of lower LIFO related inventory evaluation benefits and higher restructuring cost, fourth quarter operating earnings for Snap-on tools was $25.8 million or 9.6% of sales compared to $33.1 million or 14% of sales last year. After adjusting for LIFO and restructuring in both years, operating income as a percentage of sales was comparable in both years.
Turning to Repair Systems and Information, our RS&I segment, shown on slide 9, fourth quarter sales of $232 million increased $30 million or 14.9% year-over-year. Excluding currency translation, sales increased 16.8% led by greater sales of under car equipment in both the Americas and Europe, higher sales of diagnostic and Mitchell1 information products and increased activity with automotive OEM dealerships primarily due to increased essential tool and facilitation program sales.
Gross profit of a $103 million in the quarter increased $10.4 million or 11.2% from 2009 levels, primarily due to higher sales and contributions from favorable manufacturing utilization as a result of increased production levels.
As a percentage of sales, gross margin of 44.6% in the quarter decreased a 140 basis points from 46% last year. This is primarily due to a shift in sales mix that include a greater sales of lower margin essential tool and facilitation program sales by OEM dealerships.
Operating expenses of $57.6 million in the quarter decreased slightly from 2009 levels as higher volume related product development and other cost were more than offset by $3.6 million of lower bad debt expense and $2.2 million of savings from ongoing RC&I restructuring initiatives.
Operating earnings of $45.7 million in the quarter for the RS&I segment increased $10.7 million or 30.6% from 2009 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating margins in the quarter of 19.7% improved 240 basis points from 17.3% last year.
Now, turning to slide 10, financial services’ operating earnings of $9.4 million in the fourth quarter, compares favorably to both third quarter 2010 earnings of $5 million and to the fourth quarter 2009 loss of $3.8 million.
The $13.2 million year-over-year increase in operating earnings primarily reflects the higher revenue contributions from Snap-on Credits growing on-book finance portfolio. Originations in the quarter increased 7.5% compared to the prior year.
Moving to slide 11, as of 2010 year end, our balance sheet includes gross financing receivables of $592 million from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operation and $141 million from our international finance subsidiaries, for a total financing portfolio of $733 million.
In the United States, $491 million or 83% of the Snap-on Credit portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. Snap-on Credit also continues to manage the run-off portfolio of contracts owned by CIT, which totaled $260 million at year end and which is down $57 million from third quarter 2010 levels and down $330 million from year end 2009 levels.
For the full year, the on-book financing portfolio at Snap-on Credit grew about $325 million. Regarding finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations.
Now, turning to slide 12. Consolidated operating cash flow of $64.3 million for the quarter and a $140.4 million for the year includes the effect of a $48 million discretionary cash contribution to our U.S. pension plans.
Operating cash flow for the full year was also impacted by a $112 million of higher levels of trade and other receivables and inventories as a result of increased sales and customer demand.
Our yearend cash position of $572 million increased $212 million from third quarter 2010 levels, primarily due to the proceeds from the December note issuance and cash flow from operations. These cash increases were partially offset by the funding of new loans originated by Snap-on Credit and capital expenditures.
As a result, free cash flow from the operating company was $25.8 million for the fourth quarter and $91.1 million for the full year. As anticipated, free cash flow from financial services was negative in 2010 as a result of funding new loan origination. We expect that the impact of loan origination on free cash flow were lessened over time once the on-book portfolio stabilizes.
Capital expenditures of $28 million in the quarter and $51 million for the full year included the continued expansion of our manufacturing capabilities in lower cost regions and emerging markets. Investments have focused on increased efficiency and cost reduction and improvements at our Kenosha, Wisconsin R&D facilities and headquarters.
As seen on slide 13, working capital metrics improved year-over-year. Day-sales outstanding for trade receivables of 61 days at 2010 year end improved from 63 days last year. On a trailing 12 month basis, inventory turns at 2010 year end of 4.7 times improved considerably from 4.1 times last year.
Net debt at the end of the quarter was $590.6 million [ph]. Our net debt to cap ratio of 30.1% compares to 22.2% last year and 29.2% at the end of the third quarter reflecting the $250 million December note issuance. Excluding the $107.8 million withheld for the previously disclosed dispute with CIT, our year end net debt to cap ratio would have been 33.7%.
In addition to our $572 million in cash and our cash flows from operations, we continue to maintain a $500 million revolving credit facility, a $100 million asset backed securitization facility, and $20 million of committed bank loans. In addition to these facilities, our current A2/P2 short-term credit rating allows us to access the commercial paper market should we choose to do so. As of 2010 year end, no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities.
This concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. Before turning the call back to Nick to provide his final thoughts, I’d like to mention some considerations for our 2011 outlook as covered in our press release.
In 2011, we expect to incur $11 million of higher year-over-year pension expense largely due to the amortization of investment losses incurred 2008 related to our U.S. pension plan assets.
Capital expenditures in 2011 are anticipated to be in the range of $55 million to $65 million and we anticipate a full year effective income tax rate of approximately 33%. And as discussed earlier, interest expense on our fourth quarter debt issuance were approximately $2.7 million or $0.03 per diluted share per quarter.
With that, I’ll now turn it back over to Nick.

And we believe, there is a long road of progress still to be traveled.
Secondly, many of our businesses have recovered returning to pre-recession levels, at the same time we do have selected areas, particularly Southern Europe in the OEM dealership segment that have some way to go.
Finally, we see in the results that our runways for growth are clear, we grew substantially in the quarter while still facing the headwinds of Spain and the rest of Southern Europe in the OEM dealership segment. Those increases were driven by decisive strategic gains enhancing our franchise network, expanding with shop owners, extending to critical industries, and building an emerging market and we can see further and expansive opportunities in each of those areas.
Overall, I think you’ll remember, we said entering the recession that we would navigate the difficulties and emerge stronger than before. We believe, the fourth quarter results continuing the trend defined to 2010 are evidence that we did just that. But most importantly, those result indicate that we are positioned quite well, Snap-on is positioned quite well to capitalize on the abundant opportunities for growth that stretch out before us.
Now, before I turn the call over to the operator I want to finish by thanking our associates and our franchisees. I know many of you’re listening. The fourth quarter and the full year results were only possible because of your efforts on behalf of Snap-on and because of your commitment to our team. For all of that, for your continuing support of our company you have my congratulations and you have my thanks.
Now, I’ll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator?

You know the story, 300 million cars in United States and are all - 45% are over 10 years old, 70 million in China and they are all new. So we haven’t actually seen our business as a broad fit, as an industry really grab hold yet. And that applies not only to automotive repair but also to aerospace and a number of different things.

So I have to say that the anecdotal reports from the individual dealers, I attended a couple of them myself. The anecdotal reports from the dealers seem to match up with the numbers to say that we are gaining position and this looks like that that group is getting its momentum moving forward positively.
It recovered from I think we are back to 2008 levels, so you can say we are at pre-recession levels. So the fourth quarter I think is a pretty good quarter for them.

As we look at our fourth quarter, we're once again encouraged both by our financial performance and by our advancements in the areas we've identified as being of strategic importance. Overall, volumes in the quart",2522,"Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everyone. As we look at our fourth quarter, we're once again encouraged both by our financial performance and by our advancements in the areas we've identified as being of strategic importance. 
Overall, volumes in the quarter were up 13.6%, and the gains were widely spread across customer bases, across operating units and across geographies. Operating earnings rose nearly 44%, and the overall margin of 13 1/2% increased 270 basis points from last year powered by expansion in the operating company, as well us by the ramp up in our Financial Services profitability. Excluding the Financial Services operations, the 12.6% operating margin was up well over the 11.5% registered in 2009. 
Importantly, I think, the results confirmed continuing progress and the building momentum. It was the fourth consecutive quarter of year over year sales increases, and these results represent the largest of those gains. Also the operating margins were the highest of the year's, defining a bright line of progress throughout 2010. I believe it's clear that Snap on closed out 2010 in a much stronger position than when we entered the year. Of course, there was improvement in the overall global economic environment, and we've taken advantage. But we've also strengthened our tactical execution driven by our commitment to the Snap on Value Creation Processes, Rapid Continuous Improvement, or RCIs as we call it, innovation, customer connection, quality and safety. They continue to drive improvement. And the good news is that there's much more to gain. There's much more to go. 
Beyond that, we've achieved much more progress in those focused areas that we believe will be strategically decisive for our future, enhancing our franchisee network, expanding the company's presence with repair shop owners and managers, rolling the Snap on brand out of the garage, extending into other mission critical areas or arenas and building our physical capabilities in emerging markets. We're making progress in each of those areas. 
Now let me for a moment touch on what we're seeing in the economy and the related sales activity. It's actually a somewhat refreshing and a more straightforward discussion than we had in 2009. Most trends are in fact positive. Those areas that already demonstrated signs of recovery continue to show progress. Take for example the Tools group, serving professional automotive technicians, that business returned to pre downturn levels in the third quarter, and the recovery was confirmed again in the fourth quarter. 
As part of that trend, activity in big ticket items remains strong. These are longer payback products like hand held diagnostic units and undercar equipment or more discretionary items like tool storage units. We watch those particular sales trends because we believe they are reasonably accurate barometer of our customers' financial health and of their confidence. 
 
The strength in those big ticket products was across the board with diagnostics and tool storage units driving increased sales to the Tools group and undercar equipment, especially high value aligners bolstering sales in the Repair Systems and Information Group, which serves vehicle repair shop owners and managers. I think we can say the trends here were consistently encouraging throughout 2010. Each quarter had year over year gains in all three big ticket categories, and the fourth quarter rise outpaced our overall sales increase. 
We also continued to register recovered activity in the Industrial business with professional users in critical industries all across the globe. And beyond that, emerging markets have just continued to be robust, and the fourth quarter was no exception. So the areas I just discussed were a continuation of the positive trends we saw in the earlier periods. But we also saw some additional favorable signs in the spaces that have been slower to recover. 
For example, our businesses that are tied to automotive OEM dealerships. Although the North American dealership base continues to contract and is an ongoing challenge, we did see some considerable increases relating to essential tool distributions in both North America and Europe. In the fourth quarter we registered some solid gains as those customers became more willing to commit. In Europe, an area of mixed economies overall, we did see our strongest year over year increase in the fourth quarter, solid double digits. 
I already mentioned the continuing strength in undercar equipment in the region, but we also saw strong comparisons in the northern and central countries of Europe like Sweden and Germany and favorability in the Eastern emerging economies where we've added additional presence in Belarus and recently ramped up our production in the Minsk facility. So there are real positives in Europe. 
But the south, especially Spain, hasn't changed. It's still weak, and that's a market which is significant for us. It is a significant market for Snap on. So overall, we registered an encouraging quarter, and that was encouraging while still fighting the headwinds generated by our major markets in the south of Europe and by the consolidation of the OEM dealership space. 
Now I'll provide some highlights for each of the segments and mention some of the progress we made on our strategic areas of focus. Commercial and Industrial, or C&I, posted a volume increase from 2009 of 15.4%. The operating earnings were up over $18 million recovering smartly to 12.6% of sales from the 6.8% registered last year. We're gaining position in C&I, and we're also seeing the benefits from RCI and from restructuring actions. 
Speaking of RCI, one of the real highlights in the quarter was a recognition of our power tool plant in Murphy, North Carolina as one of North America's 10 best [Audio Gap] It's an annual competition conducted by IndustryWeek magazine with which Snap on has some experience. Our Milwaukee hand tool plant was a finalist last year. Excellence in manufacturing is sought out and evaluated, and the judges liked what they saw in Snap on Murphy. 
IndustryWeek, in their comments, highlighted the breadth and depth of the RCI culture at Murphy as a key driver in that plant's excellence. Endorsements like that only come from hard work and dedication. So I congratulate and I thank the associates at our Murphy's facility for this success. 
The C&I segment is also where we see clear runway for growth and leveraging our powerful brand to further penetrate markets outside of automotive repair. Snap on progress in serving new customers in critical industries is quite evident in our Industrial business' fourth quarter performance. Sales were up there about 17% from last year, with particular strength in international markets and that capped of a gain of over 20% for the full year. That progress was driven by both an increasingly clear customer focus and also by innovative new products specifically aimed at solutions for those particular segments. Products such as the large tools for mining, tethered tools for working at heights in aerospace and energy industries and products with advanced technology like the Automated Tool Control unit or ATC for the aviation industry. 
You might remember that I mentioned the launch of ATC last quarter, and the reception since has been enthusiastic. Beyond that, we also established important partnerships with technical schools focused on automotive, aviation and alternative energy. We're putting Snap on in at the ground floor of careers for techs in those critical industries. We're confident it will pay off and make them Snap on customers for life. All of those products helped drive our improved and growing position in this strategic arena. 
Also in the C&I group is where we have our Asian and Emerging Markets businesses. We spent the past few years building physicals in those geographies. 
During 2010, we expanded plants and launched new products designed specifically for those markets, from automotive hand held diagnostics to professional brand of hand tools. We're building the physicals primarily to serve in the local markets, but they're powered by Snap on technology and expertise that reflect our history and legacy of innovation and productivity, and that gives us an advantage in those fragmented but growing markets. 
We can particularly see that growth in China and India, as increases continued at a rapid pace in both those markets. And I believe when you think of emerging markets, it's worth noting that the repair cycle is just getting started in those economies, and there's much more opportunity for Snap on in that arena. Overall in the quarter and throughout 2010, the advances in C&I were marked by solid volume gains and improved profitability all across the group, and we see those businesses clearly moving forward along an extended runway for growth. 
Moving onto the Tools group, where we serve professional automotive technicians. As I said, it's back above prerecession levels. Big ticket activity is strong. The overall year over year fourth quarter volume gain of 12.8% was led by the U.S.. The operating margin was 9.6%. And it offers a bit of a complicated comparison because of non comparable items both in 2009 and 2010. Aldo will provide some more detailed analysis. 
I'll just highlight that we recorded restructuring in the fourth quarter in the Tools group of $4.6 million. Absent that charge, the Tools group margin of 11.3% is in line with the full year result and includes our focused support to successfully maintain the strength of our franchising network. I do believe that the relatively modest decline in the Tools group volume during 2009 and then having it be among the first to recover is a testimony to the strength of our franchisees. We recognized that advantage as we went into the turbulence. We were committed to maintaining and supporting the network through the difficulties, and by all accounts, it worked. 
The key indicators of franchise health are quite positive. Turnovers have been reduced. Cash collections are strong and delinquencies are at low levels. The advantage that is the Snap on franchisee network remains robust. I already spoke about big ticket strength. Here again, early on, we said that these categories would lead us out of the downturn and they have. 
And as I meet with the franchisees, their outlook is upbeat. We have record attendance at our annual conference earlier in the year. Over 2,000 franchises made additional commitments to attend refined field training programs. And as I meet with them, they're quite excited about our new award winning products. Some of those are high tech innovations like the VERDICT hand held diagnostic unit, and some are just great designs that demonstrate connection with our customers like low profile ratchets, all in one wire stripper, crimpers and cutters or the compact clutch version of the cordless CT 561 impact wrench. These three items and many others all have one thing in common. They make work easier for technicians operating in an ever changing and ever increasingly tight space, and they've helped create the Tools group recovery. 
Aldo will talk in some detail about the results of the Financial Services segment, but I'll only say that we believe our in house financing capabilities are a unique advantage. It's a special Snap on feature that makes our franchisee network stronger. Bringing Snap on Credit home, after we entered a joint venture with CIT has been a smooth transition. No interruptions to our franchisees or to our end customers. 
We are confident we could execute on integrating the credit company, and we did just that. And as evidence of that successful integration, the Financial Services operation is demonstrating the same strong profitability ramp up we always expected. Snap on Credit has been a strategic strength. It's now becoming a significant profit contributor, and we believe it's only going to get better. 
Now for some discussion on Repair Systems and Information or the RS&I group. Fourth quarter organic sales were up 16.8%, and the operating margin was 19.7%, both representing substantial improvements from last year. I already mentioned the big movers. Undercar equipment continued its fourth quarter trend of double digit year over year increases. We've gained position in that arena around the world. 
We've also increased facilitation and essential tools activity through equipment solutions or EQS. The vehicle manufacturers are gaining more confidence as we go forward, investing in service, and we're playing our part. We continue to invest in RS&I because we see the opportunity to make strategic gains with repair shop owners and managers and to expand our presence within shops of varying types. 
For example, the RS&I group is expanding in medium and heavy duty truck repair, growing with investments in that segment. And we're investing in truck repair information, essential diagnostic tools for diesel engines and diagnostics products aimed particularly at fleet. Truck is an area that's a natural fit for Snap on, and we are on the upswing. During the fourth quarter, that progress was rewarded when Snap on product was used by the American Trucking Association at the repair information source for their SuperTech competition. It's a great opportunity to further introduce our product to fleet customers, and it was a fine endorsement of Snap on for the heavy truck segment. 
Also during the year, Mitchell 1, our business that provides shop and repair information, launched new shop management software with expanded and integrated parts capabilities. The new offerings will make work easier for the shops, and it's helping strengthen Mitchell 1's already substantial repair shop position. 
I'll just wrap up the RS&I discussion with a final word about innovation. Snap on has received significant attention and recognition for new products in the last year. One is the Quadriga, a fully automated tire changer, recently was the recipient of an Innovation Award from Professional Tool and Equipment News. Snap on's cutting edge 3D imaging technology along with Pro 42 software around aligners is leading to gain in that important Aligner segment, a crucial segment for the Equipment business. And we have new wheel balancer technology. Technology that laser maps tire wear and helps predict tire replacement need. It's the first of its kind in the industry. And of course, as we've mentioned before, we have the fully functional VERDICT diagnostic hand held unit. It set a new standard with WiFi access, integration of Mitchell 1 repair information and a wireless touchscreen, all in the technician's hands that allows remote use by the technician from anywhere in the shop. These are productivity enhancing tools. They're also attractive, quite attractive to shop owners and managers and their helping Snap on expand its position with that important customer base. And they were, in the fourth quarter, a big contributor to the fourth quarter and the full year RS&I achievement. 
So I think I can say, our fourth quarter was a furthering of the positive trend we've seen now for several periods. Organic sales were up over 13%, operating income up over 40%, and this was against the headwinds generated by the continued weakness in southern Europe and by the OEM dealership consolidation. Overall, we're encouraged by the results and by what they say about the clear runway for growth we have going forward. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo for the financial review, then I'll make a few closing comments. Aldo?"
303646,118491248,99148,"Snap-on Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2011",2011-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Snap-on Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Nick.

Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased to $83 million or 13.6%. The primary d",2220,"Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. 
Net sales in the fourth quarter of $697 million increased to 12.7% year over year. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased to $83 million or 13.6%. The primary drivers behind the year over year sales increase include double digit sales growth across many of our businesses including sales to franchisees in the United States, customers in critical industries and emerging markets, and increased facilitation program activities with automotive OEM dealerships, including higher sales of essential tools. Sales of undercar equipment to repair facilities were also up significantly, driven by imaging alignment product sales gains across all major geographies. While continuing to be impacted by challenging economic conditions throughout southern Europe, sales in our European based Hand Tool business also experienced year over year increases, particularly in northern Europe. 
Consolidated gross profit of $319 million in the quarter increased $34.1 million from 2009 levels, driven by higher sales, favorable manufacturing utilization and savings from ongoing Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI initiatives and restructuring actions. These gross profit increases were partially offset by $6.5 million of lower year over year LIFO related inventory valuation benefits. The higher LIFO benefits in 2009 resulted from inventory reductions including the liquidation of slow moving and excess inventories, as we adjusted production in response to the weakened demand during the economic downturn. As a result, consolidated gross margin of 45.7% in the quarter decreased to 30 basis points from 46% last year. 
Operating increases expenses in the quarter of $231 million increased approximately $18 million from the prior year primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses including $4.1 million of higher U.S. pension expense largely due to the amortization of investment losses incurred in 2008 related to our domestic pension plan assets. Operating expenses were also impacted by $3.8 million of higher year over year performance based incentive compensation expense and $1.7 million of higher stock based mark to market expense. These operating expense increases were partially offset by $4.9 million of lower bad debt expense, $2.5 million of benefits from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives and $1.6 million of favorable currency effects. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 33.1% in the quarter improved 140 basis points from 34.5% last year. 
Restructuring costs in the fourth quarter of 2010 of $5.8 million, compared to $6.7 million last year. Restructuring costs in 2010 include initial cost to consolidate our North American tool storage operations. For the full year, restructuring charges or $14.2 million in 2010, compared to $22 million incurred last year. 
Financial Services operating earnings of $9.4 million in the quarter improved $13.2 million from the fourth quarter 2009 loss of $3.8 million. On a sequential basis, Financial Services operating earnings improved $4.4 million from third quarter 2010 levels. As evidenced by the continued quarter over quarter improvements in the sequential operating performance, we expect that operating earnings from Financial Services will continue to improve as the on book Finance Portfolio grows. We'll cover Financial Services in more detail in a few minutes. 
Interest expense of $14 million in the fourth quarter decreased slightly from 2009 levels, reflecting lower average debt levels partially offset by higher average interest rates. In December, we issued $250 million of 4.25% seven year senior notes. The proceeds from these notes are being used for general corporate purposes, which may include the funding of Snap on Credit's on balance sheet finance portfolio and the August 2011 repayment of $200 million of debt upon its maturity. 
Incremental interest expense in the fourth quarter related to these notes was about $600,000. Going forward, interest expense associated with these new notes will approximate $2.7 million per quarter or about $0.03. 
Our fourth quarter of 2010 effective income tax rate of 30.1% compares favorably to 31.4% in the fourth quarter of last year. As noted in our earnings release, the fourth quarter 2010 effective income tax rate benefited primarily from non recurring tax items including the late December extension of certain federal tax incentives. Finally, net earnings in the quarter of $57.9 million or $0.99 per diluted share, including $0.06 from the non recurring tax items, increased $21.3 million or $0.36 per diluted share from fourth quarter 2009 levels. 
With that, let's now turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I group on Slide 7. Fourth quarter sales of $282 million improved 14 1/2% from fourth quarter 2009 levels. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased more than 15%. The year over year sales increase was again driven by higher sales across all operating units, particularly by our businesses serving customers in critical industries and emerging markets. 
Gross profit in the C&I segment of $108 million in the quarter increased 28.4% from 2009 levels. This $24 million gross profit increase is primarily due to higher sales, $4.8 million of lower restructuring costs and $3.1 million of savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives. The gross profit comparison also benefited from improving manufacturing utilization, primarily in Europe, as a result of increased production levels. 
Gross margin of 38.4% improved 420 basis points from 34.2% last year including 200 basis points from the lower restructuring costs. Operating expenses in the quarter of $72.6 million increased $5.3 million from 2009 levels, primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses improved by 160 basis points year over year. 
Operating earnings of $35.4 million for the C&I segment in the fourth quarter of 2010 increased $18.6 million or more than double from 2009 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating margin in the C&I segment of 12.6% in the quarter improved 580 basis points from 6.8% last year. 
Turning now to Slide 8. On a worldwide basis, fourth quarter organic sales in the Snap on Tools group increased 12.8% year over year including a 15.2% increase in the United States and a 6.7% increase in our international franchise operations. Fourth quarter gross profit in the Snap on Tools group was $107 million in both years. Gross profit contributions in 2010 from higher sales were more than offset by $6.5 million of lower year over year LIFO related inventory benefits and $4.6 million of higher restructuring costs. As mentioned earlier, the higher level of LIFO benefits in 2009 resulted from inventory reductions including the liquidation of slow moving and excess inventories, as we adjusted production in response to the weakened demand. 
Gross margin in the Snap on Tools group was 40% in the fourth quarter of 2010, as compared to 45.3% last year, including a 440 basis point reduction from the year over year LIFO impact and the higher restructuring costs. Operating expenses of $81.4 million in the quarter increased $7.1 million from 2009 levels, primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses. 
As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 30.4% improved 90 basis points from 31.3% last year. Including the impacts of lower LIFO related inventory valuation benefits and higher restructuring costs, fourth quarter operating earnings for Snap on Tools was $25.8 million or 9.6% of sales, compared to $33.1 million or 14% of sales last year. After adjusting for LIFO and restructuring in both years, operating income as a percentage of sales was comparable in both years. 
Turning to the Repair Systems and Information or RS&I group, shown on Slide 9. Fourth quarter sales of $232 million increased $30 million or 14.9% year over year. Excluding currency translation, sales increased 16.8% led by greater sales of undercar equipment in both the Americas and Europe, higher sales of diagnostics and Mitchell 1 information products and increased activity with automotive OEM dealerships primarily due to increased essential tool and facilitation program sales. Gross profit of $103 million in the quarter increased $10.4 million or 11.2% from 2009 levels, primarily due to higher sales and contributions from favorable manufacturing utilization as a result of increased production levels. 
As a percentage of sales, gross margin of 44.6% in the quarter decreased 140 basis points from 46% last year. This is primarily due to a  shift in sales mix that included greater sales of lower margin essential tool and facilitation program sales to OEM dealerships. Operating expenses of $57.6 million in the quarter decreased slightly from 2009 levels as higher volume related, product development and other costs were more than offset by $3.6 million of lower bad debt expense and $2.2 million of savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives. 
Operating earnings of $45.7 million in the quarter for the RS&I segment increased $10.7 million or 30.6% from 2009 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating margin in the quarter of 19.7% improved 240 basis points from 17.3% last year. 
Now turning to Slide 10. Financial Services operating earnings of $9.4 million in the fourth quarter compares favorably to both third quarter 2010 earnings of $5 million and to fourth quarter 2009 loss of $3.8 million. The $13.2 million year over year increase in operating earnings primarily reflects the higher revenue contributions from Snap on Credit's growing on book finance portfolio. Originations in the quarter increased 7.5% compared to the prior year. 
Moving to Slide 11. As of 2010 year end, our balance sheet includes gross financing receivables of $592 million from our U.S. Snap on Credit operation and $141 million from our international finance subsidiaries, for a total financing portfolio of $733 million. In the United States, $491 million or 83% of the Snap on Credit portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. 
Snap on Credit also continues to manage the run off portfolio contracts owned by CIT, which totaled $260 million at year end, and which is down $57 million from third quarter 2010 levels and down $330 million from year end 2009 levels. For the full year, the on book financing portfolio at Snap on Credit grew about $325 million. Regarding finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations. 
Now turning to Slide 12. Consolidated operating cash flow of $64.3 million for the quarter and $140.4 million for the year includes the effect of a $48 million discretionary cash contribution to our U.S. pension plans. Operating cash flow for the full year was also impacted by $112 million of higher levels of trade and other receivables and inventories, as a result of increased sales and customer demand. Our year end cash position of $572 million increased $212 million from third quarter 2010 levels primarily due to the proceeds from the December note issuance and cash flow from operations. 
These cash increases were partially offset by the funding of new loans originated by Snap on Credit and capital expenditures. As a result, free cash flow from the operating company was $25.8 million for the fourth quarter and $91.1 million for the full year. As anticipated, free cash flow from financial services was negative in 2010 as a result of funding new loan originations. We expect that the impact of loan originations on free cash flow will lessen over time once the on book portfolio stabilizes. 
Capital expenditures of $28 million in the quarter and $51 million for the full year included the continued expansion of our manufacturing capabilities in lower cost regions and emerging markets. Investments have focused on increased efficiency and cost reduction and improvements at our Kenosha, Wisconsin R&D facilities and headquarters. 
As seen on Slide 13, working capital metrics improved year over year. Day sales outstanding for trade receivables of 61 days at  2010 year end improved from 63 days last year. On a trailing 12 month basis, inventory turns at 2010 year end of 4.7x improved considerably from 4.1x last year. 
Net debt at the end of the quarter was $598.6 million. Our net debt to cap ratio of 30.1% compares to 22.2% last year and 29.2% at the end of third quarter, reflecting the $250 million December note issuance. Excluding the $107.8 million withheld for the previously disclosed dispute with CIT, our year end net debt to cap ratio would have been 33.7%. 
In addition to our $572 million in cash and our cash flows from operations, we continue to maintain a $500 million revolving credit facility, a $100 million asset backed securitization facility and $20 million of committed bank loans. In addition to these facilities, our current A2P2 short term credit rating allows us to access the commercial paper markets should we choose to do so. As of 2010 year end, no amount were outstanding under any of these facilities. This concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. 
Before turning the call back to Nick to provide his final thoughts, I'd like to mention some considerations for our 2011 outlook as covered in our press release. In 2011, we expect to incur $11 million of higher year over year pension expense, largely due to the amortization of investment losses incurred in 2008 related to our U.S. pension plan assets. Capital expenditures in 2011 are anticipated to be in the range of $55 million to $65 million, and we anticipate a full year effective income tax rate of approximately 33%. And as discussed earlier, interest expense on our fourth quarter debt issuance will approximate $2.7 million or $0.03 per diluted share per quarter. With that, I'll now turn it back over to Nick."

Look, we believe the message of our fourth quarter is three fold. First, the Snap on Value Creation Processes are continuing to drive improvement.

First, the Snap on Value Creation Processes are continuing to drive improvement. We saw the results in our new products, in our profits and achievements like the Murphy factory being named in the top 10 and in our successful integration of the credit company. 
And we believe there is a long road of progress still to be traveled. 
Secondly, many of our businesses have recovered, returning to prerecession levels. At the same time, we do have selected areas particularly southern Europe and the OEM dealership segment that have some way to go. Finally, we see in the results that our runways for growth are clear. We grew substantially in the quarter while still facing the headwinds of Spain and the rest of southern Europe and the OEM dealerships segment. Those increases were driven by decisive strategic gains, enhancing our franchise network, expanding with shop owners, extending to critical industries and building in emerging markets. And we can see further and expansive opportunities in each of those areas. 
Overall, I think you remember, we said, entering the recession that we would navigate the difficulties and emerge stronger than before. We believe that the fourth quarter results continuing the trends defined through 2010 are evidence that we did just that. But most importantly, those results indicate that Snap on is positioned quite well to capitalize on the abundant opportunities for growth that stretch out before us. 
Now before I turn the call over to the operator, I want to finish by thanking our associates and our franchisees. I know many of you are listening. The fourth quarter and the full year results were only possible because of your efforts on behalf of Snap on and because of your commitment to our team. For all of that, for your continuing support of our company, you have my congratulations, and you have my thanks. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator?"

Well, I'd say our first quarter results were positive. And I believe they once again confirmed clear progress and strengthening our strategic position and improving our operating execution. When you look at the fir",2274,"Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everybody. Well, I'd say our first quarter results were positive. And I believe they once again confirmed clear progress and strengthening our strategic position and improving our operating execution. When you look at the first quarter, you can be encouraged by the performance and quite positive regarding the Snap-on future. Volumes in the period were up 10% from last year. It was actually the best volume performance we've had in relation to previous session levels. Adjusted for FX are sales were nearly identical to the first quarter of 2008. Operating earnings were up more than 42% with a 12.6% operating margin before financial services, a 100 basis points higher than last year. And we registered $12.5 million earnings in the financial services and over $14 million increase. Consolidated operating margin of 13.9% was up 280 basis points in 2010. An environment, on the overall environment, I think it's fair to say that the landscape does not nearly as unpredicted in new ones as it has been in the passed couple of years. We believe we now have clear visibility and that alone is a positive for us. While there are some pockets of challenge as you would've expect when you have a global operations, there was broad progress in the vast majority of our business is that more than offset the few difficulties. For example, the business is serving you automated space showed considerable strength, you can see that reflected in the nearly 12% in volume increased up both Tools Group and Repair Assistance Systems and information or RASI group. These are businesses where we track the activity in what we call big-ticket items, high-value products, things like diagnostics, undercard equipment and tool storage units. As we've been saying, the customers willingness to make commitments to those types of buy, give off an insight into the financial health and into there confidence in the future. During the downturn, on the outlook wasn't certain, these products were particularly hard hit. They turned the corner in the middle of last year and an upward trend continued into the first quarter of 2011. So these recent results confirm that Big-ticket is back, and that optimism is strong. Also in new automotive space, we do have some activity that's tied directly to OEM dealerships. To OEM dealerships rather than independence. As a number of dealerships continue to strengthen in the U.S., it has created a headwind for us. As an offset, we've been increasing global essential collectively, which is driven by the OEMs and we've also been capturing electronic parts catalog business in adjacent markets so while the U.S. dealership rooftops are still contracting, the RS&I groups has been recording solid gains, capturing other businesses in over the coming the turmoil. From a geographic perspective, again it was an extension of what we've been seeing in the past few quarters. For example, in Europe we continue to see generally improvement, double-digit gains from normal region from our industrial division to the Big-ticket equipment products to our European hand tools business or SNA Europe. You know, it now seems that European weakness for us is limited to the South and especially Spain or SNA Europe does have a particularly strong presence. Spain was down a bit, again, even from last year it was already depressed levels. We are not just seeing much favorable movement in that market. Over all though, the general European improvement, especially in the U.K. and Scandinavia more than made up for Spain. 
Turning to our emerging markets, they also remain strong and the expansion in those arenas was another positive and Eastern Europe are four to five presence with a new Minsk plan helped drive significant increase in Belarus, and Russia and the Ukraine. And no surprise, Asia-Pacific had strong double-digit gains again, driven by increase penetration in India, Thailand and China. Related to Asia Pacific I think it's a topic of today, as you would expect, we saw some initial impact in the tragic events in Japan. We're down in that country by about 5%. We were fortunate that our associates and franchisees came through the earthquake and tsunami safely. Having said that, there is an unsettled business environment in Japan and going forward, any impact will be in place for an entire quarter rather than for only a month as was the case in the first quarter. However, for us sales in Japan are only a small percentage of the company's total volume and our most significant activity in that country tends to be outside of the Northeast where the most disruption is occurring. So while nobody can predict how the Japan market will play out, it we'll certainly be another hit for awhile. But, we demonstrated in the recent path that we've been able to overcome to manage the challenges by finding offsets we're increased opportunities present themselves. The other consideration related to Japan as component sourcing. Of course, like most companies we do have some exposure particularly in related to diagnostics products, but we're already working with suppliers to offset our mitigate in the short-term supply chain problems that and again, to find losses. So that's the overall market update. No major surprises and we think that it's favorable still a few headwinds, but fairly broad growth, carrying us through and driving overall games. Now I'll say a bit on each operating segment. The commercial industrial group or C&I or sales increased 10.3% including a couple of points due to foreign exchange. The operating margin was 11.6% up from 10.3% last year. I already spoke about favorable environment and growth in emerging markets in Europe, the C&I group is where most of that business or side and uplift in those geographies did a big groups growth. Let's speak for a moment about a critical industry. C&I is where we focus on extending the power of our capabilities in the critical industry as we said before, we see great opportunity for expansion in that effort and in this quarter, there were some strong positive improvements in the aerospace sector, we're building a strong position and Automated Tool Control or ATC has been a high-profile product that's provided a great boost. As mentioned it in the past, it's a new technology for this new application. Laser imaging, originally developed for the undercar aligners but control tools to make sure they're not left in aircraft engine. I guess I'd say that I can think of any task more critical than that. GC, the smart tool storage box gets a lot of exposure and attention. It's really the broad expansion of our product line more handtools, top products and power tools developed specifically for aerospace applications that drove double-digit volume growth in this area. We also straw strong increase also double digits in the critical natural resources arena. This industry is a natural fit for us. Professionals, performing critical tasks with the need for quality reliability and high cost of failure so we're pleased with that progress. Not expansion and critical industries is not just limited to the Snap-on Brand the industrial division, SNA Europe also go to suffering and large tools designed for critical mining industry under this strong Bahco brand and we are gaining positioned there. Our advancement in that space fuel some significant growth in the quarter, for example, in South America, Chile had a fine quarter led by the mining sector. So we continue to make progress in critical industries. And we saw solid growth in most of those segments. Like aerospace and natural resources, we also had evidence like lower military spending and field operations is sealed operations winding down around the globe. That was a partial offset to the many advancements in Europe, emerging markets in critical industries the aerospace and natural resources. This quarter, the C&I story is that broad growth, overcoming a few headwinds to again post solid sales and earnings increase in from the prior year. Moving to the Tools Group. where we serve professional automotive technicians, we have a strong quarter. Sales of $282 million, our record, up 13.5% from last year with 11% organic growth, the OI margin of 13.2% was up 230 basis points from 2010 and that 13.2% includes $2.8 million of restructuring. Mainly related to our tools storage plant consolidation, excluding those restructuring costs, the margin exceeded 14%. Though it's clear, the Tools Group is getting stronger. As focused to continued strength of big-ticket volumes and that's been supported by some green product launches. Customer connection and innovation, they're important element of our Snap-on Value Creation Processes, they keep delivering winning products, For example, our updated various handheld diagnostic unit has considered has generated considerable excitement in the period. The new version incorporates wireless technology. Various owners can now scan the legal system from anywhere in the shop. It's a productivity and enhancer that builds on our already market-leading position. And as you have a prior version of the various, there's an update kid is available and that also has a been well received. Last year, we launched the new verdict handheld in the U.S.. It's simply the most sophisticated diagnostic unit available anywhere and that launch, that product was a big it. Well, we took that product to the U.K., just this past month and it started out with the same strong reception just like the U.S. It's another strong step in solidifying Snap-on's leadership in that important European market. And while we're discussing the Tools Group, I think its important to highlight the strength of the van channel. We worked hard to support the network through the downturn. We identified that as being strategically important and we are investing to that end and it's paying off. We monitor a number of metrics to gauge that of our franchisees business and many of those indicators are at the best levels we've ever seen. Obviously, sales are up, all-time high and that helps. But importantly, franchisee turnovers down and keeps going in the right direction. Down. Loan delinquencies are at a low level and we've improved internally execution, all over the Corporation and an example is another of our Snap-on Value Creation Processes RCI helps us keep improving our complete and on-time delivery performance to the franchisee. So the van network better than ever before, but beyond the network, beyond the metrics, I'll tell you that when you talked to franchisees, when you speak with them enthusiasm is high. It still our annual tick up meetings held in each January this year, and each January. And this year we have the highest participation ever with over 80% of the franchisees attending and sales at these events this year were up over nearly 50% from 2010. So the channel appears healthy. And that's, coupled with a strong Snap-on Brand that are unique financed company we have a substantial advantage in this space. The results show that and we believe there's much more upside. Visible to the RS&I group were Snap-on is expanding our presence with a repair shop owners and managers. Organic sales increased 11.7% from last year, led by increases in undercar products and essential tool and facilities activity. The volume help drive operating margin to 18.9% up from 18.3% last year, we're ramping up are product development efforts especially in this group and it's paying off with better and expanding positions. This group is in fact viewing some of the big-ticket strength in the Tools Group with the Diagnostic Products I just mentioned through the van channel. Additionally related well to the big-ticket category, aligned our volumes, sold through the equipment division which is part of our RS&I were up double digits in both North America and in Europe. Our equipment operations, when you think about equipment it's also a key collaborating with our Asian team as we our take-out technology and capabilities to that region with products specifically designed for those markets and that process, that support that collaboration is working well as evidenced by the growth we're seeing in that emerging arena. i just said one more item for RS&I. And that's our expanded position in serving medium and heavy-duty truck market. We've been making investments because of the natural opportunity for Snap-on. For example, Mitchell, our business provides shop and repair information is expanded its offering beyond just cars into the truck segment and it's now gaining in commercial and truck fleets. An important part of our strategy all so working with a truck engine OEMs and our partnerships are growing through both Snap-on Business Solutions and EQS business we develop both handhelds and PC-based diagnostics products that serve as essential tools for the engine manufacturers deal networks and also served as a broadly versatile products for independent truck repair shops. That breadth new product is generating significant presence and it's helping us offset sum of the weakness inherent in the shrinking rooftops of the automotive OEM dealerships. For those of the highlights for the quarter considerable advancement and that core strategic areas we've identified as we decisive our future. Enhancing our franchise channel, expanding what shop owners and managers, extending out of the garage into critical industries and building on emerging markets. Of the results, they confirm progress in each of those areas and we're confident that those the strengthening initiatives when coupled with improvements driven by our Snap-on value creation will assure that the positive trend we already established and now reinforced with the first quarter results will continue for some time to come. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo for more detailed discussion of the financial results. Aldo?"

Regarding finance portfolio losses and delicacy terms, these continue to be in line with expectations. Now, turning to Slide 12, consolidated operating cash flow of $27.9 million for the quarter compares $10.4 million last year. Our quarter end cash position of $517 million decreased $55 million from year end levels, primarily due to the funding of new loans originated by Snap-on Credit, increased working investment in capital expenditures partially offset by higher net earnings.

They're still challenges with continuing weakness in Spain, the USA dealership consolidation and now the uncertainty surrounding Japan. Wishing all  there are always challenges and weaknesses. We've consistently demonstrated the ability to overcome headwinds. The improvements of this quarter are a testimony to the strength of the Snap-on Value Creation Processes, Rapid Continuous Improvement, innovation, customer connection, quality and safety. It's a solid framework that's propelled us forward and we believe it will continue to do so. We also said that we've invest in the areas that we believe are decisive for our future and represent major runways for growth. We're doing that and it's working. We said we've enhanced the van network. All the health metrics and the franchisees on the sales say the vans have never been better. Extend the critical industries, we saw a strong gains in aerospace and natural resources, expand with repair shops owners and managers our SN&I observed dealership consolidation and still grew strongly and build an emerging market, Eastern Europe and Asia Pacific are growing. Well ahead of GDP. I mentioned in the past that we're confident we we'll emerge from the downturn stronger than when we enter. While the first quarter did provide some strong evidence that we did just that. Volumes were back to the Q1 2008 levels at a constant currency and our up margin of 12.6% was 140 basis points higher than it was in the previous session period. And remember that in choosing that improvement we should go up higher pension costs where our and after all related to the financial crisis and that represented an additional 130 basis points of expense so our ongoing operating structure is significantly improve. All of that, Snap-on value creation, investment and decisive strategic positions that credit accompany contributing more as projected and the first quarter results, we believe those are strong signals that Snap-on is well-positioned for continued improvement to take full advantage of the broad run rates for growth that are now clearly evidenced before us in the quarters and years ahead. Before I close, I want to again express my appreciation and gratitude to all of our Associates and the franchisees for their commitment. I know many of you are listening into this call.

And then secondly, in Europe, as Europe came back, we saw raw material shortages in Europe and so we ask the Europeans to put in place a little more raw material and that so that we can serve the customer somewhat better so you'd be entitled to do that it's an idea that would come out as the world matures and we put behind us the consolidation into those storage and that's going to happen through the year and I believe there are material situation will stabilize in Europe as we go forward and that inventory will come out."

303646,129583928,117051,"Snap-on Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2011",2011-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Snap-on Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everybody. Well, I'd say our first quarter results were positive. And I believe they, once again, confirm clear progress in strengthening our strategic position and in improving our operating execution. When you look at the f",2293,"Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everybody. Well, I'd say our first quarter results were positive. And I believe they, once again, confirm clear progress in strengthening our strategic position and in improving our operating execution. When you look at the first quarter, you can be encouraged by the performance and quite positive regarding the Snap-on future. Volumes in the period were up 10% from last year. It was actually the best volume performance we've had in relation to pre-recession levels. Adjusted for FX, our sales were nearly identical to the first quarter of 2008. Operating earnings were up more than 42% with a 12.6% operating margin before financial services, 100 basis points higher than last year. And we registered $12.5 million in earnings from financial services, in over $14 million increase. Consolidated operating margin of 13.9% was up 280 basis points from 2010. On the environment, on the overall environment, I think it's fair to say that the landscape is not nearly as unpredicted in nuance as it has been over the past couple of years. We believe we now have clearer visibility and that alone is a positive for us. While there are some pockets of challenge as you would expect when you have a global operations, there was broad progress in the vast majority of our businesses that more than offset the few difficulties. For example, the businesses serving you automotive space showed considerable strength. You can see that reflected in the nearly 12% volume increase of both the Tools Group and the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I Group. These are businesses where we track the activity in what we call big-ticket items, high-value products, things like diagnostics, undercar equipment and tool storage units. As we've been saying, the customers' willingness to make commitments to those types of buys, give us an insight into their financial health and into their confidence in the future. During the downturn, when the outlook uncertain, these products were particularly hard hit. They turned the corner in the middle of last year and an upward trend continued into the first quarter of 2011. So these recent results confirm that big-ticket is back, and that optimism is strong. Also, in new automotive space, we do have some activity that's tied directly to OEM dealerships -- to OEM dealerships rather than independent. As the number of dealerships continue to shrink in the U.S., it has created a headwind for us. As an offset, we've been increasing global essential tool collectively, which is driven by the OEMs and we've also been capturing Electronic Parts Catalog business in adjacent markets. So while the U.S. dealership rooftops are still contracting, the RS&I groups has been recording solid gains, capturing other business and overcoming the turmoil. From a geographic perspective, again, it was an extension of what we've been seeing in the past few quarters. For example, in Europe, we continue to see a general improvement. Double-digit gains were the norm in the region from our industrial division to the big-ticket equipment products, to our European Hand Tools business or SNA Europe. It now seems that European weakness for us is limited to the South and especially Spain where SNA Europe does have a particularly strong presence. Spain was down a bit. Again, even from last year, it was already depressed levels. We're just not seeing much favorable movement in that market. Over all though, the general European improvement, especially in the U.K. and Scandinavia more than made up for Spain. 
Turning to our emerging markets. They also remain strong and the expansion in those arenas was another positive. In Eastern Europe, our fortified presence with our new Minsk plan helped drive significant increase in Belarus, in Russia and the Ukraine. And no surprise, Asia-Pacific had strong double-digit gains again, driven by increased penetration in India, Thailand and China. Related to Asia Pacific, I think it's the topic the day, as you would expect, we saw some initial impact from the tragic events in Japan. We're down in that country by about 5%. We were fortunate that our associates and franchisees came through the earthquake and tsunami safely. Having said that though, there is an unsettled business environment in Japan and going forward, any impact will be in place for an entire quarter rather than for only a month as was the case in the first quarter. However, for us, sales in Japan are only a small percentage of the company's total volume and our most significant activity in that country tends to be outside the northeast where the most disruption is occurring. So while nobody can predict how the Japan market will play out, it will certainly be another headwind for awhile. But we've demonstrated in the recent path that we've been able to overcome, to manage through challenges by finding offsets where increased opportunities present themselves. The other consideration related to Japan is component sourcing. Of course, like most companies, we do have some exposure particularly in related to the diagnostics product, but we're already working with suppliers to offset or to mitigate any short-term supply chain problems and again, to find offsets. So that's the overall market update. No major surprises and we think that's favorable. Still a few headwinds, but fairly broad growth carrying us through in driving overall gains. Now I'll say a bit on each operating segment. The commercial industrial group or C&I saw sales increase 10.3% including a couple of points due to foreign exchange. The operating margin was 11.6% up from 10.3% last year. I already spoke about the favorable environment and growth we saw in emerging markets in Europe. The C&I group is where most of that business resides and the uplift in those geographies did aid the group's growth. Let's speak for a moment about critical industries. C&I is where we're focused on extending the power of our brands and our capabilities into critical industries. And as we said before, we see great opportunity for expansion in that effort and in this quarter, there were some strong positive improvements. In the aerospace sector, we're building a strong position. And Automated Tool Control or ATC has been a high-profile product that's provided a great boost. I've mentioned it in the past, it's a new technology for this new application. Laser imaging, originally developed for the undercar aligners but used here to control tools, to make sure they're not left in aircraft engine. I guess I'd say that I can't think of any task more critical than that. GC, the smart tool storage box gets a lot of exposure and attention. It's really the broad expansion of our product line, more hand tools, torque products and power tools developed specifically for aerospace applications that the drove double-digit volume growth in this area. We also straw strong increase also double digits in the critical natural resources arena. This, in the industry, is a natural fit for us. Professionals performing critical tasks with the need for quality reliability in a high cost of failure. So we're pleased with that progress. Now the expansion in critical industries isn't just limited to the Snap-on brand on our industrial division, SNA Europe is also growing it's offering in large tools designed for the critical mining industry under this strong Bahco brand and we're gaining position there. Our advancement in that space fuel some significant growth in the quarter. For example, in South America, Chile had a fine quarter led by the mining sector. So we continue to make progress in critical industries and we saw solid growth in most of those segments like aerospace and natural resources. We also had headwinds like lower military spending and field operations at sealed operations winding down around the globe. That was a partial offset to the many advancements in Europe, emerging markets and in critical industries like aerospace and natural resources. This quarter, the C&I story is that broad growth, overcoming a few headwinds to, again, post solid sales and earnings increase from the prior year. Moving to the Tools Group where we serve professional automotive technicians, we had a strong quarter. Sales of $282 million, a record, up 13.5% from last year with 11% organic growth, the OI margin of 13.2% was up 230 basis points from 2010 and that 13.2% includes $2.8 million of restructuring mainly related to our tools storage plant consolidation. Excluding those restructuring costs, the margin exceeded 14%. Though it's clear, the Tools Group is getting stronger. I've spoke of the continued strength of big-ticket volumes and that's being supported by some great product launches. Customer connection and innovation, they're important elements of our Snap-on Value Creation Processes, they keep delivering winning products. For example, our updated VERUS handheld diagnostic unit has considered -- has generated considerable excitement in the period. The new version incorporates wireless technology. VERUS owners can now scan the vehicle system from anywhere in the shop. It's a productivity enhancer that builds on our already market-leading position. And if you have a prior version of the VERUS, there's an update -- an update kit is available and that's also been well received. Last year, we launched the new VERDICT handheld in the U.S. It's simply the most sophisticated diagnostic unit available anywhere and that launch, that product was a big it. Well, we took that product to the U.K. just this past month and it started out with the same strong reception just like the U.S. It's another strong step in solidifying Snap-on's leadership in that important European market. And while we're discussing the Tools Group, I think its important to highlight the strength of the van channel. We worked hard to support the network through the downturn. We identified that as being strategically important and we are investing to that end and it's paying off. We monitor a number of metrics to gauge the health of our franchisees business and many of those indicators are at the best levels we've ever seen. Obviously, sales are up, all-time high and that helps. But importantly, franchisee turnover is down and keeps going in the right direction, down. Loan delinquencies are at a low -- at low levels and we've improved internally execution all over the corporation. An example is another of our Snap-on Value Creation Processes, RCI helps us keep improving our complete and on-time delivery performance to the franchisees. So the van network, better than ever before. But beyond the network, beyond the metrics, I'll tell you that when you talk to franchisees, when you speak with them, enthusiasm is high. Consider our annual kick-off meetings that are held each January this year and -- at each January. And this year, we had the highest participation ever with over 80% of the franchisees attending and sales at these events this year were up nearly 50% from 2010. So the channel appears healthy. And when that's coupled with a strong Snap-on brand and our unique financed company, we have a substantial advantage in this space. The results show it and we believe there's much more upside. Let's move to the RS&I group where Snap-on is expanding our presence with repair shop owners and managers. Organic sales increased 11.7% from last year, led by increases in undercar products and essential tool and facilities -- facilitation activities. The volume helped drive operating margin of 18.9% up from 18.3% last year. We're ramping up our product development efforts especially in this group and it's paying off with better and expanding position. This group is in fact fueling some of the big-ticket strength in the Tools Group with the diagnostic products I just mentioned through the van channel. Additionally related, well, to big-ticket category, are liner volumes, sold through the equipment division which is part of our RS&I were up double digits in both North America and in Europe. And our equipment operations, when you think about equipment, it's also key at collaborating with our Asian team as we take our technology and capabilities to that region with products specifically designed for those markets and that process, that support, that collaboration is working well as evidenced by the growth we're seeing in that emerging arena. I'll just add one more item for RS&I and that's our expanding position in serving medium and heavy-duty truck market. We've been making investments because it's a natural opportunity for Snap-on. For example, Mitchell, our business that provides shop and repair information has expanded its offering beyond just cars into the Truck segment. And it's now gaining in commercial and truck fleets. An important part of our strategy also working with the truck engine OEMs and our partnerships here are growing through both Snap-on Business Solutions and EQS businesses. We've developed both handheld and PC-based diagnostics products that serve as essential tools for the engine manufacturers dealer networks and also served as broadly versatile products for independent truck repair shops. That breadth of new products is generating significant presence and it's helping us offset some of the weakness inherent in the shrinking rooftops of the automotive OEM dealerships. So those of the highlights for the quarter. Considerable advancement in the four strategic areas we've identified as being decisive for our future. Enhancing the franchise channel, expanding with shop owners and managers, extending out of the garage into critical industries and building in emerging markets. The results, they confirm progress in each of those areas and we're confident that those strengthening initiatives, when coupled with improvements driven by our Snap-on Value Creation, will assure that the positive trend we've already established and now reinforced with the first quarter results will continue for some time to come. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo for a more detailed discussion of the financial results. Aldo?"

Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Overall, revenue growth continued profitability increases in financial services in what we believe are significant benefits from our Snap-on Value Creation Processes generated a 5",1557,"Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Overall, revenue growth continued profitability increases in financial services in what we believe are significant benefits from our Snap-on Value Creation Processes generated a 52% improvement year-over-year net earnings and diluted earnings per share. Net sales in the first quarter of $694 million dollars increased $72 million or 11.6% year-over-year. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased 10%. We continue to realize year-over-year sales growth to broad our businesses including increase of sales of franchisees by the Snap-on Tools Group, increased sales to repair shop owners and managers by the repair systems and information on the RS&I group and increased at sales to a wide range of customers in emerging markets in critical industries in our commercial and industrial or C&I group. Consolidated gross profit of $331 million in the quarter increased $43 million from 2010 levels, as a result of higher sales, favorable manufacturing utilization, savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives and favorable foreign currency effects. Consolidated gross margin of 47.7% in the quarter increased 140 basis points from 46.3% last year. Operating expenses in the quarter of $243 million increased $27 million from 2010 levels, largely due to higher volume related and other expenses including: $6.8 million of increased performance-based and stock-based compensation including mark-to-market, $2.3 million of anticipated higher pension expense and $2.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects. These operating expense increases were partially offset by lower bad debt expense and benefits from ongoing RCI and other cost reduction initiatives. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses in the first quarter of 2011 were 35.1% as compared to 34.7% last year. Restructuring costs of $3 million in the first quarter were comparable to last year's $3.2 million. Financial services operating earnings of $12.5 million in the quarter improved $14.2 million from the first quarter 2010 loss of $1.7 million. On a sequential basis, Financial Services' operating earnings improved $3.1 million from fourth quarter 2010 levels. As expected, operating earnings from Financial Services continues to improve as our on-book finance portfolio grows. Interest expense of $16.3 million in the quarter increased $2.3 million from 2010 levels, mainly due to a higher average debt levels following last December's $250 million notes issuance. As anticipated, our first quarter 2011 effective income tax rate was 33% compared to 34.5% a year ago. Finally, net earnings in the first quarter of $56.2 million or $0.96 per diluted share increased $19.4 million or $0.33 per diluted share from 2010 levels. Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with C&I group on Slide 7, sales of $272 million for the first quarter improved 10.3% from 2010 levels. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased 8.4%. Continued higher sales to customers in emerging markets, increased sales in the segment's European-based Hand Tool business and continued sales progress in the critical industries of aerospace and natural resources more than offset lower year-over-year sales to the military. And as Dick mentioned, while our organic sales in Japan were down in the quarter, it did not significantly impact our overall results. Gross profit in the C&I segment of $103.6 million in the quarter, increased $14.9 million from 2010 levels, largely due to higher sales of favorable manufacturing utilization, savings from ongoing RCI restructuring initiatives and lower researcher costs. Gross margin of 38% in the quarter improved 210 basis points from 35.9% last year. Operating expenses of $72 million in the quarter increased $8.7 million from 2010 levels, primarily due to a higher volume related and other expenses in unfavorable foreign currency impacts. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses in the quarter were 26.4% as compared to 25.6% last year. First quarter operating earnings of $31.6 million for the C&I segment increased $6.2 million from 2010 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating margins in the C&I segment of 11.6% improved 130 basis points from 10.3% last year. Turning now to Slide 8, on a worldwide basis, first quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group increased 13.5% year-over-year, largely due to continued higher sales in the United States. On an organic basis, sales were up 11.7%. Gross profit in the Snap-on Tools Group of $125 million in the quarter, increased nearly $20 million from last year's levels. This increase includes contributions from higher sales and favorable manufacturing utilization and $1.7 million of favorable currency effects. These gross profit increases were partially offset by $2.3 million of higher restructuring costs, primarily due to the previously communicated consolidation of our North American Tools Storage operations into our Algona, Iowa facility. As a percentage of sales, gross margin of 44.3% improved 200 basis points from 42.3% last year. Operating expenses of $87.8 million in the quarter increased $9.6 million from 2010 levels primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 31.1%, improved 30 basis points from 2010 levels. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $37.1 million in the quarter increased $10.1 million or 37.4%, from the $27 million earned last year. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings of 13.2% increased 200

Turning to the RS&I group shown on Slide 9. First quarter sales of $227 million increased 12.3% year-over-year. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased 11.7% reflecting higher sales of undercar equipment and increased essential tool and facilitation program activity with automotive OEM dealerships. Gross profit of $102 million in the quarter increased $8.4 million from prior-year levels, primarily due to higher sales, lower restructuring cost and contributions from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives. As a percentage of sales, gross margin of 45% compared to 46.4% last year. The 140 basis point decline is largely due to higher rolls of growth in the sales of undercar equipment and essential tool and facilitation program sales. 
Operating expenses of $59.3 million in the quarter increased $2.6 million from 2010 levels. As higher volume related, product development and other costs were partially offset by savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses improved 200 basis points year-over-year. Operating earnings of $42.8 million for the RS&I segment increased $5.8 million from 2010 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating margins of 18.9% improved 60 basis points from 2010. Now turning to Slide 10. Financial Services operating earnings of $12.5 million in the first quarter compares favorably to both fourth quarter 2010 earnings of $9.4 million and to the first quarter 2010 loss of $1.7 million. The $14.2 million year-over-year increase in operating earnings primarily reflects the higher revenue contributions from our growing on-book finance portfolio. Originations of $145 million in the quarter increased 24.2% compared to the first quarter 2010 levels, reflecting improved approval rates in greater participation in our credit programs. Moving to Slide 11. As the first quarter end, our balance sheet includes $785 million of gross financing receivables including $640 million from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operation. In the United States, $530 million or 83% of the financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. Since 2010 year end, our total on-book financing portfolio has grown about $50 million and we expect for the full year 2011 that our on-book finance portfolio will increase approximately $130 million over 2010 year-end levels. Regarding finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations. Now turning to Slide 12. Consolidated operating cash flow of $27.9 million for the quarter compares $10.4 million last year. Our quarter end cash position of $517 million decreased $55 million from year end levels, primarily due to the funding of new loans originated by Snap-on Credit, increased working investment in capital expenditures partially offset by higher net earnings. Free cash flow in the quarter was $3 million from the operating company, and as expected, a negative $35 million from financial services reflecting the continued funding of new loan originations at Snap-on Credit. Capital expenditures totaled $18.6 million in the quarter, reflecting our continued commitment to planned strategic investments. As seen on Slide 13, day sales outstanding for trade receivables was 61 days at both first quarter and 2010 year end. As of quarter end, inventory levels were up $39 million versus 2010 year-end primary to support higher levels of customer demand and as a result of foreign currency translation. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 4.4x compared to 4.2x at the end of the first quarter of 2010, and 4.7x at 2010 year and. Net debt at the end of the quarter was $653.2 million, our net debt to cap ratio of 30.5% compares to 25.9% last year and 30.1% at 2010 year end, reflecting the $250 million December note issuance. Excluding the $107.8 million withheld for the previously disclosed disputed with CIT, our quarter end net-debt-to-cap ratio would have been 33.8%. In addition to our of $517 million in cash in cash flow from operations, we have more than $600 million in available credit facilities and our current A2P2 short-term credit rating allows us to access the commercial paper markets should we choose to do so. As of the first quarter end, no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities. This concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance, and I'll now turn the call back over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?"

There's still challenges with continuing weakness in Spain, the U.S. dealership consolidation and now the uncertainty surrounding Japan. There are always challenges and weaknesses. We've consistently demonstrated the ability to overcome headwinds. The improvements of this quarter are a testimony to the strength of the Snap-on Value Creation Processes, Rapid Continuous Improvement, innovation, customer connection, quality and safety. It's a solid framework that's propelled us forward and we believe it will continue to do so. We also said we would invest in the areas that we believe are decisive for our future and represent major runways for growth. We're doing that and it's working. We said we'd enhance the van network. All the health metrics and the franchisees themselves say the vans have never been better. Extend to critical industries. We saw strong gains in aerospace and natural resources. Expand with repair shops owners and managers. Our SN&I absorbed dealership consolidation and still grew strongly and build in emerging markets. Eastern Europe and Asia Pacific are growing well ahead of GDP. I mentioned in the past, that we're confident we'd emerge from the downturn stronger than when we entered, while the first quarter did provide some strong evidence that we did just that. Volumes were back to the Q1 2008 levels at constant currency. And our OpCo margin of 12.6% was 140 basis points higher than it was in that pre-recession period. And remember that in achieving that improvement, we shook off higher pension costs which are after all related to the financial crisis. And that represented an additional 130 basis points of expense. So our ongoing operating structure is significantly improved. All of that, Snap-on value creation, investments and decisive strategic positions, the credit company contributing more as projected and the first quarter results, we believe those are strong signals that Snap-on is well-positioned for continued improvement and to take full advantage of the broad runways for growth that are now clearly evident before us in the quarters and years ahead. Before I close, I want to again express my appreciation and gratitude to all our associates and franchisees for their commitment. I know many of you are listening into this call. You are responsible for the progress that's been made, that's been achieved and for the encouraging first quarter results. You have my congratulations and you have my thanks.

So overall, we feel pretty encouraged by the quarter in C&I. If you look at the way C&I behaves in the first quarter, you have in there the Asia-Pacific businesses which are generally down in the first quarter seasonality wise because of Chinese New Year. And you have the idea that the fourth quarter is a little bit up because you've got the sort of year end budget cycle plans through the industrial businesses.

So we came out of the box stronger. It is typical in Q1 because we have -- it reflects the growth on the Snap-on Tools Group more than anything else. Snap-on has a lot of what we call kick-off meetings in the first quarters. So a lot of the products that are featured in that program tends to led themselves to contract finance arrangements. So the first quarter tends to be a little bit more robust. But certainly, we came out strong so I'd say $865 million is a -- $870 million is a reasonable expectation for full year."

What we did here, and you'll be entitled to view this, we took special action around inventory because I directed the Tools Group to add inventory to offset to make sure that we had no disruption when we made the Tool storage plant consolidation in the United States. And that's happening now. So some of what you're seeing is that. And then secondly, in Europe, as Europe came back, we saw raw material shortages in Europe. And so we asked the Europeans to put in place a little more raw material and whip so that they can serve their customer somewhat better. So you'd be entitled to view that as an idea that, that would come out as the world matures and we put behind us the consolidation in Tool Storage and that's going to happen through the year.

We impose -- when we put that on an acquisition, we can make them better than they were before because those processes are tight and capable and value creating. Around safety and quality and customer connection and innovation Rapid Continuous Improvement, it did a lot for our company, and we acquired ProQuest, the Electronic Parts business in what? Late to almost early 2006, late 2007. That business has been rocked by dealership consolidations in the interim. And the Snap-on Value Creation system has wrung profitability out of that and allowed us to offset it. So we feel pretty confident, we can acquire somebody, one, and make them better just with Snap-on Value Creation and secondly, and secondly, we can add it to our -- because we're not looking at acquiring somebody that's sort of like -- that's unrelated to our business. We see ourselves saying, we can grow coherently. We're just -- we're taking the Snap-on brand out of the garage and into critical industries. So we would acquire a company that had a position and let's say aerospace, or natural resources and added it to the power of the Snap-on brand, there would be synergies beyond the idea of the processes we would bring to that company. And so there will be tremendous value created. So I'm not so worried about the multiple question."

303646,129583928,117059,"Snap-on Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2011",2011-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Snap-on Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everybody. Well, I'd say our first quarter results were positive. And I believe they once again confirm clear progress in strengthening our strategic position and in improving our operating execution. When you look at the fir",2290,"Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everybody. Well, I'd say our first quarter results were positive. And I believe they once again confirm clear progress in strengthening our strategic position and in improving our operating execution. When you look at the first quarter, you can be encouraged by the performance and quite positive regarding the Snap-on future. Volumes in the period were up 10% from last year. It was actually the best volume performance we've had in relation to pre-recession levels. Adjusted for FX, our sales were nearly identical to the first quarter of 2008. Operating earnings were up more than 42% with a 12.6% operating margin before financial services, 100 basis points higher than last year. And we registered $12.5 million in earnings from financial services, an over $14 million increase. Consolidated operating margin of 13.9% was up 280 basis points from 2010. On the overall environment, I think it's fair to say that the landscape is not nearly as unpredicted in nuance as it has been over the past couple of years. We believe we now have clearer visibility and that alone is a positive for us. While there are some pockets of challenge, as you would expect when you have a global operation, there was broad progress in the vast majority of our businesses that more than offset the few difficulties. For example, the businesses serving the automotive space showed considerable strength. You can see that reflected in the nearly 12% volume increase of both the Tools Group and the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I Group. These are businesses where we track the activity in what we call big-ticket items, high-value products, things like diagnostics, undercar equipment and tool storage units. As we've been saying, the customers' willingness to make commitments to those types of buys give us an insight into their financial health and into their confidence in the future. During the downturn when the outlook was uncertain, these products were particularly hard hit. They turned the corner in the middle of last year and an upward trend continued into the first quarter of 2011. So these recent results confirm that big-ticket is back and that optimism is strong. Also, in new automotive space, we do have some activity that's tied directly to OEM dealerships -- to OEM dealerships rather than independent. As the number of dealerships continue to shrink in the U.S., it has created a headwind for us. As an offset, we've been increasing global essential tool activity, which is driven by the OEMs and we've also been capturing Electronic Parts Catalog business in adjacent markets. So while the U.S. dealership rooftops are still contracting, the RS&I group has been recording solid gains, capturing other business and overcoming the turmoil. From a geographic perspective, again, it was an extension of what we've been seeing in the past few quarters. For example, in Europe, we continue to see a general improvement. Double-digit gains were the norm in the region from our industrial division to the big-ticket equipment products, to our European Hand Tools business or SNA Europe. It now seems that European weakness for us is limited to the South and especially Spain, where SNA Europe does have a particularly strong presence. Spain was down a bit again, even from last year's already depressed levels. We're just not seeing much favorable movement in that market. Overall though, the general European improvement, especially in the U.K. and Scandinavia more than made up for Spain. 
Turning to emerging markets. They also remain strong and the expansion in those arenas was another positive. In Eastern Europe, our fortified presence with our new Minsk plant helped drive significant increase in Belarus, in Russia and the Ukraine. And no surprise, Asia-Pacific had strong double-digit gains again, driven by increased penetration in India, Thailand and China. Related to Asia Pacific, I think it's the topic the day, as you would expect, we saw some initial impact from the tragic events in Japan. We're down in that country by about 5%. We were fortunate that our associates and franchisees came through the earthquake and tsunami safely. Having said that though, there is an unsettled business environment in Japan and going forward, any impact will be in place for an entire quarter rather than for only a month as was the case in the first quarter. However, for us, sales in Japan are only a small percentage of the company's total volume and our most significant activity in that country tends to be outside the northeast where the most disruption is occurring. So while nobody can predict how the Japan market will play out, it will certainly be another headwind for a while. But we've demonstrated in the recent path that we've been able to overcome, to manage through challenges by finding offsets where increased opportunities present themselves. The other consideration related to Japan is component sourcing. Of course, like most companies, we do have some exposure particularly as related to the diagnostics product, but we're already working with suppliers to offset or to mitigate any short-term supply chain problems and again, to find offsets. So that's the overall market update. No major surprises and we think that's favorable. Still a few headwinds, but fairly broad growth carrying us through in driving overall gains. 
Now I'll say a bit on each operating segment. The commercial industrial group or C&I saw sales increase 10.3%, including a couple of points due to foreign exchange. The operating margin was 11.6% up from 10.3% last year. I already spoke about the favorable environment and growth we saw in emerging markets in Europe. The C&I group is where most of that business resides and the uplift in those geographies did aid the group's growth. Let's speak for a moment about critical industries. C&I is where we're focused on extending the power of our brands and our capabilities into critical industries. And as we said before, we see great opportunity for expansion in that effort and in this quarter, there were some strong positive improvements. In the aerospace sector, we're building a strong position. And Automated Tool Control or ATC has been a high-profile product that's provided a great boost. I've mentioned it in the past, it's a new technology for this type of application. Laser imaging, originally developed for the undercar aligners but used here to control tools, to make sure they're not left in the aircraft engine. I guess I'd say that I can't think of any task more critical than that. GC, the smart tool storage box, gets a lot of exposure and attention. It's really the broad expansion of our product line, more hand tools, torque products and power tools developed specifically for aerospace applications that the drove double-digit volume growth in this area. We also saw strong increase, also double digits, in the critical natural resources arena. This industry's a natural fit for us. Professionals performing critical tasks with a need for quality and reliability and a high cost of failure. So we're pleased with that progress. Now the expansion in critical industries isn't just limited to the Snap-on brand on our industrial division, SNA Europe has also grown it's offering in large tools designed for the critical mining industry under this strong Bahco brand and we're gaining position there. Our advancements in that space fueled some significant growth in the quarter. For example, in South America, Chile had a fine quarter led by the mining sector. So we continued to make progress in critical industries and we saw solid growth in most of those segments, like aerospace and natural resources. We also had headwinds, like lower military spending and field operations as sealed operations wind down around the globe. That was a partial offset to the many advancements in Europe, emerging markets and in critical industries like aerospace and natural resources. This quarter, the C&I story is that broad growth, overcoming a few headwinds to again post solid sales and earnings increase from the prior year. Moving to the Tools Group, where we serve professional automotive technicians, we had a strong quarter. Sales of $282 million, a record, up 13.5% from last year with 11% organic growth. The OI margin of 13.2% was up 230 basis points from 2010 and that 13.2% includes $2.8 million of restructuring mainly related to our tools storage plant consolidation. Excluding those restructuring costs, the margin exceeded 14%. Though it's clear, the Tools Group is getting stronger.
I've spoke of the continued strength of big-ticket volumes and that's being supported by some great product launches. Customer connection and innovation, they're important elements of our Snap-on Value Creation Processes, they keep delivering winning products. For example, our updated VERUS handheld diagnostic unit has considered -- has generated considerable excitement in the period. The new version incorporates wireless technology. VERUS owners can now scan the vehicle system from anywhere in the shop. It's a productivity enhancer that builds on our already market-leading position. And if you have a prior version of the VERUS, there's an update -- an update kit is available and that's also been well received. Last year, we launched the new VERDICT handheld in the U.S. It's simply the most sophisticated diagnostic unit available anywhere and that launch, that product was a big it. Well, we took that product to the U.K. just this past month and it started out with the same strong reception, just like the U.S. It's another strong step in solidifying Snap-on's leadership in that important European market. And while we're discussing the Tools Group, I think it's important to highlight the strength of the van channel. We worked hard to support the network through the downturn. We identified that as being strategically important and we are investing to that end and it's paying off. We monitor a number of metrics to gauge the health of our franchisees business and many of those indicators are at the best levels we've ever seen. Obviously, sales are up, all-time high and that helps. But importantly, franchisee turnover is down and keeps going in the right direction, down. Loan delinquencies are at a low -- at low levels and we've improved internal execution all over the corporation. An example is another of our Snap-on Value Creation Processes, RCI, helps us keep improving our complete and on-time delivery performance to the franchisees. So the van network, better than ever before. But beyond the network, beyond the metrics, I'll tell you that when you talk to franchisees, when you speak with them, enthusiasm is high. Consider our annual kick-off meetings that are held each January this year and -- at each January. And this year, we had the highest participation ever with over 80% of the franchisees attending and sales at these events this year were up nearly 50% from 2010. So the channel appears healthy. And when that's coupled with our strong Snap-on brand and our unique finance company, we have a substantial advantage in this space. The results show it and we believe there's much more upside. 
Let's move to the RS&I group, where Snap-on is expanding our presence with repair shop owners and managers. Organic sales increased 11.7% from last year, led by increases in undercar products and essential tool and facilities -- facilitation activities. The volume helped drive operating margins 18.9%, up from 18.3% last year. We're ramping up our product development efforts especially in this group and it's paying off with better and expanding position. This group is in fact fueling some of the big-ticket strength in the Tools Group with the diagnostic products I just mentioned through the van channel. Additionally related, thought, to big-ticket category, are liner volumes, sold through the equipment division which is part of our RS&I, were up double digits in both North America and in Europe. And our equipment operations -- when you think about equipment, it's also key at collaborating with our Asian team as we take our technology and capabilities to that region with products specifically designed for those markets and that process, that support, that collaboration is working well, as evidenced by the growth we're seeing in that emerging arena.
I'll just add 1 more item for RS&I and that's our expanding position in serving the medium and heavy-duty truck market. We've been making investments because it's a natural opportunity for Snap-on. For example, Mitchell, our business that provides shop and repair information, has expanded its offering beyond just cars into the Truck segment. And it's now gaining in commercial and truck fleets. An important part of our strategy also working with the truck engine OEMs and our partnerships here are growing through both Snap-on Business Solutions and EQS businesses. We develop both handheld and PC-based diagnostics products that serve as essential tools for the engine manufacturers and dealer networks and also serve as broadly versatile products for independent truck repair shops. That breadth of new products is generating significant presence and it's helping us offset some of the weakness inherent in the shrinking rooftops of the automotive OEM dealerships. 
So those are the highlights for the quarter. Considerable advancement in the 4 strategic areas we've identified as being decisive for our future. Enhancing the franchise channel, expanding with shop owners and managers, extending out of the garage into critical industries and building emerging markets. The results, they confirm progress in each of those areas and we're confident that those strengthening initiatives, when coupled with the improvements driven by our Snap-on Value Creation, will assure that the positive trend we've already established and now reinforce with the first quarter results will continue for some time to come. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo for a more detailed discussion of the financial results. Aldo?"

Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Overall, revenue growth continued profitability increases in financial services and what we believe are significant benefits from our Snap-on Value Creation Processes generated a 52% improvement year-over-year net earnings and diluted earnings per share. Net sales in the first quarter of $694 million dollars increased $72 million or 11.6% year-over-year. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased 10%. We continued to realize year-over-year sales growth throughout our businesses, including increased sales to franchisees by the Snap-on Tools Group, increased sales to repair shop owners and managers by the Repair Systems and Information or the RS&I group and increased sales to a wide range of customers in emerging markets in critical industries in our Commercial and Industrial or C&I group. Consolidated gross profit of $331 million in the quarter increased $43 million from 2010 levels as a result of higher sales, favorable manufacturing utilization, savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives and favorable foreign currency effects. Consolidated gross margin of 47.7% in the quarter increased 140 basis points from 46.3% last year. Operating expenses in the quarter of $243 million increased $27 million from 2010 levels, largely due to higher volume related and other expenses including: $6.8 million of increased performance-based and stock-based compensation including mark-to-market, $2.3 million of anticipated higher pension expense and $2.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects. These operating expense increases were partially offset by lower bad debt expense and benefits from ongoing RCI and other cost reduction initiatives. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses in the first quarter of 2011 were 35.1% as compared to 34.7% last year. Restructuring costs of $3 million in the first quarter were comparable to last year's $3.2 million. Financial services operating earnings of $12.5 million in the quarter improved $14.2 million from the first quarter 2010 loss of $1.7 million. On a sequential basis, Financial Services' operating earnings improved $3.1 million from fourth quarter 2010 levels. As expected, operating earnings from Financial Services continues to improve as our on-book finance portfolio grows. Interest expense of $16.3 million in the quarter increased $2.3 million from 2010 levels, mainly due to a higher average debt levels following last December's $250 million notes issuance. As anticipated, our first quarter 2011 effective income tax rate was 33% compared to 34.5% a year ago. Finally, net earnings in the first quarter of $56.2 million or $0.96 per diluted share increased $19.4 million or $0.33 per diluted share from 2010 levels. 
Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with C&I group on Slide 7, sales of $272 million for the first quarter improved 10.3% from 2010 levels. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased 8.4%. Continued higher sales to customers in emerging markets, increased sales in the segment's European-based Hand Tool business and continued sales progress in the critical industries of aerospace and natural resources more than offset lower year-over-year sales to the military. And as Dick mentioned, while our organic sales in Japan were down in the quarter, it did not significantly impact our overall results. Gross profit in the C&I segment of $103.6 million in the quarter increased $14.9 million from 2010 levels, largely due to higher sales of favorable manufacturing utilization, savings from ongoing RCI restructuring initiatives and lower restructuring costs. Gross margin of 38% in the quarter improved 210 basis points from 35.9% last year. Operating expenses of $72 million in the quarter increased $8.7 million from 2010 levels, primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses and unfavorable foreign currency impacts. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses in the quarter were 26.4% as compared to 25.6% last year. First quarter operating earnings of $31.6 million for the C&I segment increased $6.2 million from 2010 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating margins in the C&I segment of 11.6% improved 130 basis points from 10.3% last year. 
Turning now to Slide 8. On a worldwide basis, first quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group increased 13.5% year-over-year, largely due to continued higher sales in the United States. On an organic basis, sales were up 11.7%. Gross profit in the Snap-on Tools Group of $125 million in the quarter increased nearly $20 million from last year's levels. This increase includes contributions from higher sales and favorable manufacturing utilization and $1.7 million of favorable currency effects. These gross profit increases were partially offset by $2.3 million of higher restructuring costs, primarily due to the previously communicated consolidation of our North American Tools Storage operations into our Algona, Iowa facility. As a percentage of sales, gross margin of 44.3% improved 200 basis points from 42.3% last year. Operating expenses of $87.8 million in the quarter increased $9.6 million from 2010 levels, primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 31.1% improved 30 basis points from 2010 levels. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $37.1 million in the quarter increased $10.1 million or 37.4% from the $27 million earned last year. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings of 13.2% increased 200 
[Audio Gap]
Turning to the RS&I group shown on Slide 9. First quarter sales of $227 million increased 12.3% year-over-year. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased 11.7%, reflecting higher sales of undercar equipment and increased essential tool and facilitation program activity with automotive OEM dealerships. Gross profit of $102 million in the quarter increased $8.4 million from prior-year levels, primarily due to higher sales, lower restructuring costs and contributions from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives. As a percentage of sales, gross margin of 45% compared to 46.4% last year. The 140 basis point decline is largely due to higher relative growth in the sales of undercar equipment and essential tool and facilitation program sales.
Operating expenses of $59.3 million in the quarter increased $2.6 million from 2010 levels, as higher volume related product development and other costs were partially offset by savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses improved 200 basis points year-over-year. Operating earnings of $42.8 million for the RS&I segment increased $5.8 million from 2010 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating margins of 18.9% improved 60 basis points from 2010. 
Now turning to Slide 10. Financial Services operating earnings of $12.5 million in the first quarter compares favorably to both fourth quarter 2010 earnings of $9.4 million and to the first quarter 2010 loss of $1.7 million. The $14.2 million year-over-year increase in operating earnings primarily reflects the higher revenue contributions from our growing on-book finance portfolio. Originations of $145 million in the quarter increased 24.2% compared to the first quarter 2010 levels, reflecting improved approval rates and greater participation in our credit programs. 
Moving to Slide 11. At the first quarter end, our balance sheet includes $785 million of gross financing receivables including $640 million from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operation. In the United States, $530 million or 83% of the financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. Since 2010 year end, our total on-book financing portfolio has grown about $50 million and we expect for the full year 2011 that our on-book finance portfolio will increase approximately $130 million over 2010 year-end levels. Regarding finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations. 
Now turning to Slide 12. Consolidated operating cash flow of $27.9 million for the quarter compares to $10.4 million last year. Our quarter end cash position of $517 million decreased $55 million from year-end levels, primarily due to the funding of new loans originated by Snap-on Credit, increased working investment in capital expenditures partially offset by higher net earnings. Free cash flow in the quarter was $3 million from the operating company, and as expected, a negative $35 million from financial services reflecting the continued funding of new loan originations at Snap-on Credit. Capital expenditures totaled $18.6 million in the quarter, reflecting our continued commitment to planned strategic investments. 
As seen on Slide 13, day sales outstanding for trade receivables was 61 days at both first quarter and 2010 year end. As of quarter end, inventory levels were up $39 million versus 2010 year end, primarily to support higher levels of customer demand and as a result of foreign currency translation. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 4.4x compared to 4.2x at the end of the first quarter of 2010 and 4.7x at 2010 year and. Net debt at the end of the quarter was $653.2 million. Our net debt to cap ratio of 30.5% compares to 25.9% last year and 30.1% at 2010 year end, reflecting the $250 million December note issuance. Excluding the $107.8 million withheld for the previously disclosed dispute with CIT, our quarter end net-debt-to-cap ratio would have been 33.8%. In addition to our of $517 million in cash and cash flow from operations, we have more than $600 million in available credit facilities and our current A2P2 short-term credit rating allows us to access the commercial paper markets, should we choose to do so. As of the first quarter end, no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities. 
This concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance, and I'll now turn the call back over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?"

There are still challenges with continuing weakness in Spain, the U.S. dealership consolidation and now the uncertainty surrounding Japan. There are always challenges and weaknesses. We've consistently demonstrated the ability to overcome headwinds. The improvements of this quarter are a testimony to the strength of the Snap-on Value Creation Processes, Rapid Continuous Improvement, innovation, customer connection, quality and safety. It's a solid framework that's propelled us forward and we believe it will continue to do so. 
We also said we would invest in the areas that we believe are decisive for our future and represent major runways for growth. We're doing that, and it's working. We said we'd enhance the van network. All the health metrics and the franchisees themselves say the vans have never been better. Extend to critical industries. We saw strong gains in aerospace and natural resources. Expand with repair shops owners and managers. Our SN&I absorbed dealership consolidation and still grew strongly and build in emerging markets. Eastern Europe and Asia Pacific are growing well ahead of GDP. I mentioned in the past that we're confident we'd emerge from the downturn stronger than when we entered, while the first quarter did provide some strong evidence that we did just that. Volumes were back to the Q1 2008 levels at constant currency. And our OpCo margin of 12.6% was 140 basis points higher than it was in that pre-recession period. And remember that in achieving that improvement, we shook off higher pension costs which are, after all, related to the financial crisis. And that represented an additional 130 basis points of expense. So our ongoing operating structure is significantly improved. 
All of that, Snap-on value creation, investments and decisive strategic positions, the credit company contributing more as projected and the first quarter results. We believe those are strong signals that Snap-on is well positioned for continued improvement and to take full advantage of the broad runways for growth that are now clearly evident before us in the quarters and years ahead. 
Before I close, I want to again express my appreciation and gratitude to all our associates and franchisees for their commitment. I know many of you are listening in to this call.

Snap-on has a lot of what we call kick-off meetings in the first quarter. So a lot of the products that are featured in that program tend to led themselves to contract finance arrangements.

Also in there there's a pocket of van leases and there's some long-term leasing of equipment. We don't usually see those terminate early or come to early payment. So those could be laggard to the portfolio. So the bulk of the extended credit will run off this year. The remainder of it could be a tail that hangs out there for a few years, but it will create much less noise in 2012 than what it does this year."

What we did here, and you'll be entitled to view this, we took special action around inventory because I directed the Tools Group to add inventory to offset to make sure that we had no disruption when we made the Tool storage plant consolidation in the United States. And that's happening now. So some of what you're seeing is that. And then secondly, in Europe, as Europe came back, we saw raw material shortages in Europe. And so we asked the Europeans to put in place a little more raw material and whip so that they can serve their customer somewhat better. So you'd be entitled to view that as an idea that, that would come out as the world matures and we put behind us the consolidation in Tool Storage and that's going to happen through the year.

We impose -- when we put that on an acquisition, we can make them better than they were before, because those processes are tight and capable and value creating around safety and quality and customer connection and innovation and Rapid Continuous Improvement. It did a lot for our company and we acquired ProQuest, the Electronic Parts business in what, late to almost early 2006, late 2007. That business has been rocked by dealership consolidations in the interim and the Snap-on Value Creation system has wrung profitability out of that and allowed us to offset it. So we feel pretty confident we can acquire somebody, 1, and make them better just with Snap-on Value Creation and secondly, and secondly, we can add it to our -- because we're not looking at acquiring somebody that's sort of like -- that's unrelated to our business. We see ourselves saying we can grow coherently. We're just -- we're taking the Snap-on brand out of the garage and into critical industries. So of we would acquire a company that had a position in, let's say aerospace or natural resources and added it to the power of the Snap-on brand, there would be synergies beyond the idea of the processes we would bring to that company.

303646,129583928,117109,"Snap-on Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2011",2011-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Snap-on Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everybody. Well, I'd say our first quarter results were positive. And I believe they once again confirm clear progress in strengthening our strategic position and in improving our operating execution. When you look at the fir",2289,"Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everybody. Well, I'd say our first quarter results were positive. And I believe they once again confirm clear progress in strengthening our strategic position and in improving our operating execution. When you look at the first quarter, you can be encouraged by the performance and quite positive regarding the Snap-on future. Volumes in the period were up 10% from last year. It was actually the best volume performance we've had in relation to pre-recession levels. Adjusted for FX, our sales were nearly identical to the first quarter of 2008. Operating earnings were up more than 42% with a 12.6% operating margin before financial services, 100 basis points higher than last year. And we registered $12.5 million in earnings from financial services, an over $14 million increase. Consolidated operating margin of 13.9% was up 280 basis points from 2010. On the overall environment, I think it's fair to say that the landscape is not nearly as unpredicted in nuance as it has been over the past couple of years. We believe we now have clearer visibility and that alone is a positive for us. While there are some pockets of challenge, as you would expect when you have a global operation, there was broad progress in the vast majority of our businesses that more than offset the few difficulties. For example, the businesses serving the automotive space showed considerable strength. You can see that reflected in the nearly 12% volume increase of both the Tools Group and the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I Group. These are businesses where we track the activity in what we call big-ticket items, high-value products, things like diagnostics, undercar equipment and tool storage units. As we've been saying, the customers' willingness to make commitments to those types of buys give us an insight into their financial health and into their confidence in the future. During the downturn when the outlook was uncertain, these products were particularly hard hit. They turned the corner in the middle of last year and an upward trend continued into the first quarter of 2011. So these recent results confirm that big-ticket is back and that optimism is strong. Also, in new automotive space, we do have some activity that's tied directly to OEM dealerships -- to OEM dealerships rather than independent. As the number of dealerships continue to shrink in the U.S., it has created a headwind for us. As an offset, we've been increasing global essential tool activity, which is driven by the OEMs and we've also been capturing Electronic Parts Catalog business in adjacent markets. So while the U.S. dealership rooftops are still contracting, the RS&I group has been recording solid gains, capturing other business and overcoming the turmoil. From a geographic perspective, again, it was an extension of what we've been seeing in the past few quarters. For example, in Europe, we continue to see a general improvement. Double-digit gains were the norm in the region from our industrial division to the big-ticket equipment products, to our European Hand Tools business or SNA Europe. It now seems that European weakness for us is limited to the South and especially Spain, where SNA Europe does have a particularly strong presence. Spain was down a bit again, even from last year's already depressed levels. We're just not seeing much favorable movement in that market. Overall though, the general European improvement, especially in the U.K. and Scandinavia more than made up for Spain. 
Turning to emerging markets. They also remain strong and the expansion in those arenas was another positive. In Eastern Europe, our fortified presence with our new Minsk plant helped drive significant increase in Belarus, in Russia and the Ukraine. And no surprise, Asia-Pacific had strong double-digit gains again, driven by increased penetration in India, Thailand and China. Related to Asia Pacific, I think it's the topic the day, as you would expect, we saw some initial impact from the tragic events in Japan. We're down in that country by about 5%. We were fortunate that our associates and franchisees came through the earthquake and tsunami safely. Having said that though, there is an unsettled business environment in Japan and going forward, any impact will be in place for an entire quarter rather than for only a month as was the case in the first quarter. However, for us, sales in Japan are only a small percentage of the company's total volume and our most significant activity in that country tends to be outside the northeast where the most disruption is occurring. So while nobody can predict how the Japan market will play out, it will certainly be another headwind for a while. But we've demonstrated in the recent path that we've been able to overcome, to manage through challenges by finding offsets where increased opportunities present themselves. The other consideration related to Japan is component sourcing. Of course, like most companies, we do have some exposure particularly as related to the diagnostics product, but we're already working with suppliers to offset or to mitigate any short-term supply chain problems and again, to find offsets. So that's the overall market update. No major surprises and we think that's favorable. Still a few headwinds, but fairly broad growth carrying us through in driving overall gains. 
Now I'll say a bit on each operating segment. The commercial industrial group or C&I saw sales increase 10.3%, including a couple of points due to foreign exchange. The operating margin was 11.6% up from 10.3% last year. I already spoke about the favorable environment and growth we saw in emerging markets in Europe. The C&I group is where most of that business resides and the uplift in those geographies did aid the group's growth. Let's speak for a moment about critical industries. C&I is where we're focused on extending the power of our brands and our capabilities into critical industries. And as we said before, we see great opportunity for expansion in that effort and in this quarter, there were some strong positive improvements. In the aerospace sector, we're building a strong position. And Automated Tool Control or ATC has been a high-profile product that's provided a great boost. I've mentioned it in the past, it's a new technology for this type of application. Laser imaging, originally developed for the undercar aligners but used here to control tools, to make sure they're not left in the aircraft engine. I guess I'd say that I can't think of any task more critical than that. GC, the smart tool storage box, gets a lot of exposure and attention. It's really the broad expansion of our product line, more hand tools, torque products and power tools developed specifically for aerospace applications that drove double-digit volume growth in this area. We also saw strong increase, also double digits, in the critical natural resources arena. This industry's a natural fit for us. Professionals performing critical tasks with a need for quality and reliability and a high cost of failure. So we're pleased with that progress. Now the expansion in critical industries isn't just limited to the Snap-on brand on our industrial division, SNA Europe has also grown it's offering in large tools designed for the critical mining industry under this strong Bahco brand and we're gaining position there. Our advancements in that space fueled some significant growth in the quarter. For example, in South America, Chile had a fine quarter led by the mining sector. So we continued to make progress in critical industries and we saw solid growth in most of those segments, like aerospace and natural resources. We also had headwinds, like lower military spending and field operations as sealed operations wind down around the globe. That was a partial offset to the many advancements in Europe, emerging markets and in critical industries like aerospace and natural resources. This quarter, the C&I story is that broad growth, overcoming a few headwinds to again post solid sales and earnings increase from the prior year. Moving to the Tools Group, where we serve professional automotive technicians, we had a strong quarter. Sales of $282 million, a record, up 13.5% from last year with 11% organic growth. The OI margin of 13.2% was up 230 basis points from 2010 and that 13.2% includes $2.8 million of restructuring mainly related to our tools storage plant consolidation. Excluding those restructuring costs, the margin exceeded 14%. Though it's clear, the Tools Group is getting stronger.
I've spoke of the continued strength of big-ticket volumes and that's being supported by some great product launches. Customer connection and innovation, they're important elements of our Snap-on Value Creation Processes, they keep delivering winning products. For example, our updated VERUS handheld diagnostic unit has considered -- has generated considerable excitement in the period. The new version incorporates wireless technology. VERUS owners can now scan the vehicle system from anywhere in the shop. It's a productivity enhancer that builds on our already market-leading position. And if you have a prior version of the VERUS, there's an update -- an update kit is available and that's also been well received. Last year, we launched the new VERDICT handheld in the U.S. It's simply the most sophisticated diagnostic unit available anywhere and that launch, that product was a big it. Well, we took that product to the U.K. just this past month and it started out with the same strong reception, just like the U.S. It's another strong step in solidifying Snap-on's leadership in that important European market. And while we're discussing the Tools Group, I think it's important to highlight the strength of the van channel. We worked hard to support the network through the downturn. We identified that as being strategically important and we are investing to that end and it's paying off. We monitor a number of metrics to gauge the health of our franchisees business and many of those indicators are at the best levels we've ever seen. Obviously, sales are up, all-time high and that helps. But importantly, franchisee turnover is down and keeps going in the right direction, down. Loan delinquencies are at a low -- at low levels and we've improved internal execution all over the corporation. An example is another of our Snap-on Value Creation Processes, RCI, helps us keep improving our complete and on-time delivery performance to the franchisees. So the van network, better than ever before. But beyond the network, beyond the metrics, I'll tell you that when you talk to franchisees, when you speak with them, enthusiasm is high. Consider our annual kick-off meetings that are held each January this year and -- at each January. And this year, we had the highest participation ever with over 80% of the franchisees attending and sales at these events this year were up nearly 50% from 2010. So the channel appears healthy. And when that's coupled with our strong Snap-on brand and our unique finance company, we have a substantial advantage in this space. The results show it and we believe there's much more upside. 
Let's move to the RS&I group, where Snap-on is expanding our presence with repair shop owners and managers. Organic sales increased 11.7% from last year, led by increases in undercar products and essential tool and facilities -- facilitation activities. The volume helped drive operating margins 18.9%, up from 18.3% last year. We're ramping up our product development efforts especially in this group and it's paying off with better and expanding position. This group is in fact fueling some of the big-ticket strength in the Tools Group with the diagnostic products I just mentioned through the van channel. Additionally related, thought, to big-ticket category, are liner volumes, sold through the equipment division which is part of our RS&I, were up double digits in both North America and in Europe. And our equipment operations -- when you think about equipment, it's also key at collaborating with our Asian team as we take our technology and capabilities to that region with products specifically designed for those markets and that process, that support, that collaboration is working well, as evidenced by the growth we're seeing in that emerging arena.
I'll just add 1 more item for RS&I and that's our expanding position in serving the medium and heavy-duty truck market. We've been making investments because it's a natural opportunity for Snap-on. For example, Mitchell, our business that provides shop and repair information, has expanded its offering beyond just cars into the Truck segment. And it's now gaining in commercial and truck fleets. An important part of our strategy also working with the truck engine OEMs and our partnerships here are growing through both Snap-on Business Solutions and EQS businesses. We develop both handheld and PC-based diagnostics products that serve as essential tools for the engine manufacturers and dealer networks and also serve as broadly versatile products for independent truck repair shops. That breadth of new products is generating significant presence and it's helping us offset some of the weakness inherent in the shrinking rooftops of the automotive OEM dealerships. 
So those are the highlights for the quarter. Considerable advancement in the 4 strategic areas we've identified as being decisive for our future. Enhancing the franchise channel, expanding with shop owners and managers, extending out of the garage into critical industries and building emerging markets. The results, they confirm progress in each of those areas and we're confident that those strengthening initiatives, when coupled with the improvements driven by our Snap-on Value Creation, will assure that the positive trend we've already established and now reinforce with the first quarter results will continue for some time to come. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo for a more detailed discussion of the financial results. Aldo?"

Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Overall, revenue growth continued profitability increases in financial services and what we believe are significant benefits from our Snap-on Value Creation Processes generated a 52% improvement year-over-year net earnings and diluted earnings per share. Net sales in the first quarter of $694 million dollars increased $72 million or 11.6% year-over-year. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased 10%. We continued to realize year-over-year sales growth throughout our businesses, including increased sales to franchisees by the Snap-on Tools Group, increased sales to repair shop owners and managers by the Repair Systems and Information or the RS&I group and increased sales to a wide range of customers in emerging markets in critical industries in our Commercial and Industrial or C&I group. Consolidated gross profit of $331 million in the quarter increased $43 million from 2010 levels as a result of higher sales, favorable manufacturing utilization, savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives and favorable foreign currency effects. Consolidated gross margin of 47.7% in the quarter increased 140 basis points from 46.3% last year. Operating expenses in the quarter of $243 million increased $27 million from 2010 levels, largely due to higher volume related and other expenses including: $6.8 million of increased performance-based and stock-based compensation including mark-to-market, $2.3 million of anticipated higher pension expense and $2.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects. These operating expense increases were partially offset by lower bad debt expense and benefits from ongoing RCI and other cost reduction initiatives. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses in the first quarter of 2011 were 35.1% as compared to 34.7% last year. Restructuring costs of $3 million in the first quarter were comparable to last year's $3.2 million. Financial services operating earnings of $12.5 million in the quarter improved $14.2 million from the first quarter 2010 loss of $1.7 million. On a sequential basis, Financial Services' operating earnings improved $3.1 million from fourth quarter 2010 levels. As expected, operating earnings from Financial Services continues to improve as our on-book finance portfolio grows. Interest expense of $16.3 million in the quarter increased $2.3 million from 2010 levels, mainly due to a higher average debt levels following last December's $250 million notes issuance. As anticipated, our first quarter 2011 effective income tax rate was 33% compared to 34.5% a year ago. Finally, net earnings in the first quarter of $56.2 million or $0.96 per diluted share increased $19.4 million or $0.33 per diluted share from 2010 levels. 
Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with C&I group on Slide 7, sales of $272 million for the first quarter improved 10.3% from 2010 levels. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased 8.4%. Continued higher sales to customers in emerging markets, increased sales in the segment's European-based Hand Tool business and continued sales progress in the critical industries of aerospace and natural resources more than offset lower year-over-year sales to the military. And as Dick mentioned, while our organic sales in Japan were down in the quarter, it did not significantly impact our overall results. Gross profit in the C&I segment of $103.6 million in the quarter increased $14.9 million from 2010 levels, largely due to higher sales of favorable manufacturing utilization, savings from ongoing RCI restructuring initiatives and lower restructuring costs. Gross margin of 38% in the quarter improved 210 basis points from 35.9% last year. Operating expenses of $72 million in the quarter increased $8.7 million from 2010 levels, primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses and unfavorable foreign currency impacts. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses in the quarter were 26.4% as compared to 25.6% last year. First quarter operating earnings of $31.6 million for the C&I segment increased $6.2 million from 2010 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating margins in the C&I segment of 11.6% improved 130 basis points from 10.3% last year. 
Turning now to Slide 8. On a worldwide basis, first quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group increased 13.5% year-over-year, largely due to continued higher sales in the United States. On an organic basis, sales were up 11.7%. Gross profit in the Snap-on Tools Group of $125 million in the quarter increased nearly $20 million from last year's levels. This increase includes contributions from higher sales and favorable manufacturing utilization and $1.7 million of favorable currency effects. These gross profit increases were partially offset by $2.3 million of higher restructuring costs, primarily due to the previously communicated consolidation of our North American Tools Storage operations into our Algona, Iowa facility. As a percentage of sales, gross margin of 44.3% improved 200 basis points from 42.3% last year. Operating expenses of $87.8 million in the quarter increased $9.6 million from 2010 levels, primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 31.1% improved 30 basis points from 2010 levels. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $37.1 million in the quarter increased $10.1 million or 37.4% from the $27 million earned last year. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings of 13.2% increased 200 
[Audio Gap]
Turning to the RS&I group shown on Slide 9. First quarter sales of $227 million increased 12.3% year-over-year. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased 11.7%, reflecting higher sales of undercar equipment and increased essential tool and facilitation program activity with automotive OEM dealerships. Gross profit of $102 million in the quarter increased $8.4 million from prior-year levels, primarily due to higher sales, lower restructuring costs and contributions from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives. As a percentage of sales, gross margin of 45% compared to 46.4% last year. The 140 basis point decline is largely due to higher relative growth in the sales of undercar equipment and essential tool and facilitation program sales.
Operating expenses of $59.3 million in the quarter increased $2.6 million from 2010 levels, as higher volume related product development and other costs were partially offset by savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses improved 200 basis points year-over-year. Operating earnings of $42.8 million for the RS&I segment increased $5.8 million from 2010 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating margins of 18.9% improved 60 basis points from 2010. 
Now turning to Slide 10. Financial Services operating earnings of $12.5 million in the first quarter compares favorably to both fourth quarter 2010 earnings of $9.4 million and to the first quarter 2010 loss of $1.7 million. The $14.2 million year-over-year increase in operating earnings primarily reflects the higher revenue contributions from our growing on-book finance portfolio. Originations of $145 million in the quarter increased 24.2% compared to the first quarter 2010 levels, reflecting improved approval rates and greater participation in our credit programs. 
Moving to Slide 11. At the first quarter end, our balance sheet includes $785 million of gross financing receivables including $640 million from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operation. In the United States, $530 million or 83% of the financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. Since 2010 year end, our total on-book financing portfolio has grown about $50 million and we expect for the full year 2011 that our on-book finance portfolio will increase approximately $130 million over 2010 year-end levels. Regarding finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations. 
Now turning to Slide 12. Consolidated operating cash flow of $27.9 million for the quarter compares to $10.4 million last year. Our quarter end cash position of $517 million decreased $55 million from year-end levels, primarily due to the funding of new loans originated by Snap-on Credit, increased working investment in capital expenditures partially offset by higher net earnings. Free cash flow in the quarter was $3 million from the operating company, and as expected, a negative $35 million from financial services reflecting the continued funding of new loan originations at Snap-on Credit. Capital expenditures totaled $18.6 million in the quarter, reflecting our continued commitment to planned strategic investments. 
As seen on Slide 13, day sales outstanding for trade receivables was 61 days at both first quarter and 2010 year end. As of quarter end, inventory levels were up $39 million versus 2010 year end, primarily to support higher levels of customer demand and as a result of foreign currency translation. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 4.4x compared to 4.2x at the end of the first quarter of 2010 and 4.7x at 2010 year and. Net debt at the end of the quarter was $653.2 million. Our net debt to cap ratio of 30.5% compares to 25.9% last year and 30.1% at 2010 year end, reflecting the $250 million December note issuance. Excluding the $107.8 million withheld for the previously disclosed dispute with CIT, our quarter end net-debt-to-cap ratio would have been 33.8%. In addition to our of $517 million in cash and cash flow from operations, we have more than $600 million in available credit facilities and our current A2P2 short-term credit rating allows us to access the commercial paper markets, should we choose to do so. As of the first quarter end, no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities. 
This concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance, and I'll now turn the call back over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?"

There are still challenges with continuing weakness in Spain, the U.S. dealership consolidation and now the uncertainty surrounding Japan. There are always challenges and weaknesses. We've consistently demonstrated the ability to overcome headwinds. The improvements of this quarter are a testimony to the strength of the Snap-on Value Creation Processes, Rapid Continuous Improvement, innovation, customer connection, quality and safety. It's a solid framework that's propelled us forward and we believe it will continue to do so. 
We also said we would invest in the areas that we believe are decisive for our future and represent major runways for growth. We're doing that, and it's working. We said we'd enhance the van network. All the health metrics and the franchisees themselves say the vans have never been better. Extend to critical industries. We saw strong gains in aerospace and natural resources. Expand with repair shops owners and managers. Our SN&I absorbed dealership consolidation and still grew strongly and build in emerging markets. Eastern Europe and Asia Pacific are growing well ahead of GDP. I mentioned in the past that we're confident we'd emerge from the downturn stronger than when we entered, while the first quarter did provide some strong evidence that we did just that. Volumes were back to the Q1 2008 levels at constant currency. And our OpCo margin of 12.6% was 140 basis points higher than it was in that pre-recession period. And remember that in achieving that improvement, we shook off higher pension costs which are, after all, related to the financial crisis. And that represented an additional 130 basis points of expense. So our ongoing operating structure is significantly improved. 
All of that, Snap-on value creation, investments and decisive strategic positions, the credit company contributing more as projected and the first quarter results. We believe those are strong signals that Snap-on is well positioned for continued improvement and to take full advantage of the broad runways for growth that are now clearly evident before us in the quarters and years ahead. 
Before I close, I want to again express my appreciation and gratitude to all our associates and franchisees for their commitment. I know many of you are listening in to this call.

Now gas prices can impact our franchisee base somewhat in that they drive and they have diesel fuel, but it's not a major factor.

But in terms of this, we see ourselves being able to price and we have been able to price when we've seen inflation here in this quarter."

And that's happening now. So some of what you're seeing is that. And then secondly, in Europe, as Europe came back, we saw raw material shortages in Europe. And so we asked the Europeans to put in place a little more raw material and whip so that they can serve their customer somewhat better. So you'd be entitled to view that as an idea that, that would come out as the world matures and we put behind us the consolidation in Tool Storage and that's going to happen through the year.

It did a lot for our company and we acquired ProQuest, the Electronic Parts business in what, late to almost early 2006, late 2007. That business has been rocked by dealership consolidations in the interim and the Snap-on Value Creation system has wrung profitability out of that and allowed us to offset it.

303646,137171262,144142,"Snap-on Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2011",2011-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Snap-on Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everybody. Well, the second quarter results were reasonably strong again. And I think it's safe to say that we're encouraged by the continued progress.

And I think it's safe to say that we're encouraged by the continued progress. Overall, sales in the quarter were up 12.2% from last year with some from exchange rate. Organically, volume rose by over 7%. The over all operating margin was 15.4% and operating income was up more than 44% from 2010 and both of those comparisons exclude the positive effect of the arbitration settlement with CIT. 
The 40% plus rise in operating income is similar to what we posted in the past couple of quarters so these results mark the continuation of an ongoing and strong trend. The profit increase included a $15.8 million rise in earnings from Financial Services, but the real highlight was the quarterly operating margin of 13.6% before financial services. That OI margin represents the highest level Snap-on has achieved in well over 15 years. Now we believe the operating performance and the trend clearly demonstrates the strength of our Snap-on Value Creation Processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and Rapid Continuous Improvement. It's a framework we apply everywhere at every level to improve our performance and our commitment to those principles and processes enabling our broad progress. 
Now, with respect to the macroeconomic environment, the various markets in which we operate, the second quarter was fairly unchanged from what we spoke about 3 months ago. I characterize our performance as widespread gains in most areas, more than overcoming those few continuing headwinds we mentioned in the past. I'll provide a bit of color on the quarter and cover the highlights for each of the operating groups. And then as usual, Aldo will offer a detailed financial review. 
From a geographic perspective, the same dynamics are present for our operations that have been in play for the past couple of quarters. In North America, no real change. Well, the overall 10% volume growth in the Tools Group reflects the same stable upward trend that we've become accustomed to in North America. Also, the big-ticket diagnostics and tool storage unit that are sold in the van channel remains strong and that's a continuing positive for us. Our undercar equipment, another big-ticket category was also up in North America, better than our overall sales increase. The same was true in our distribution and general industrial sales in the region. 
Moving to another area of strength, the emerging markets of Asia Pacific again this quarter we saw strong double-digit gains. It's no secret that those markets are expanding and we're taking advantage as we build presence and gain position. Throughout that jurisdiction, but especially in China, in India, in Indonesia, we're seeing growth, far above both GDP rates in the company's overall pace of growth. We continue to see progress in most of Europe in the established markets like the U.K., Sweden, Finland, and we're growing in the East. In the Eastern Europe, of course, in Russia. But also in other developing areas like Poland and in Turkey. And the gains we've seen are across business segments from big-ticket undercar equipment to industrial customers to SNA Europe. 
But the overall growth in that region was somewhat muted by the ongoing economic weakness in Southern Europe. You might remember that for Snap-on, these are large markets by way of SNA Europe and we're not seeing relief. Countries across the South like Spain and Portugal remained weak. But you know, that's no real surprise given the almost daily news from that region. Actually, when it comes to Europe, given the turbulence, we feel okay about no major changes for us in Europe over the past few quarters. Speaking of headwinds, another that we mentioned last quarter is Japan. The situation is there is fairly well known, it's unsettling as we thought it would be for a while. The good news is it's isolated and most people believe it's temporary. 
Now for the operating segment. For the operating segments and a view on the advances we've made in those strategic areas which we've identified as decisive for our future: expanding into critical industries, building in emerging markets, enhancing the franchise network and expanding in the repair garage. In Commercial-Industrial or the C&I group, sales were up 8.1% from 2010 levels. However, excluding the benefit from foreign exchange, volumes increased about 2%. The operating margin was 10.4%, up 50 basis points from last year. And as you expect from the geographic discussion I just provided, most areas here were up solidly. Widespread double-digit rises. Keep in mind, however, that C&I is where we see most of the impact of those fairly specific headwinds of Southern Europe, the unsettled situation in Japan, and the lower military spending which we discussed last quarter. So the story in C&I is robust gains in most areas, partially offset by the concentration of our external headwinds in this one segment. 
C&I operations outside those concentrated headwinds grew organically as double digits, very much in line with the gains in the Tools Group and in the Repair systems and information groups. From that perspective, we're encouraged by the progress our run rates from growth in C&I. And that progress can be seen in the volumes. The positive motion in Asia Pacific and in critical industries such as aerospace and natural resources. All these continued with their trend of strong double-digit growth. But more important than the sales in a particular quarter, we know that Snap-on is building expanded long-term presence in each of those strategic areas. Just last month the corporation had a strong showing at the Paris airshow. recognizes as the most prestigious aircraft expedition in the world and many of you know that our array of products for the aerospace sector is expanding. 
While in Paris, we highlighted the high-tech automated tools of AGC and our newly increased range of core products aimed at aerospace. And the response was very enthusiastic. It's that kind of growing presence that's generating the big gains we're seeing in this critical industry of aerospace. And the gains are being driven by customers through the industry from airlines for their fleet, to aircraft manufacturing facilities and into the maintenance and repair of overhaul shops or MRO facilities. 
And as you would expect, the opportunities here are across the globe and Snap-on is increasingly valued in this important sector. We feel encouraged by that . I've spoken in the past about the partnerships with technical schools and creating certification programs. We believe it's a great way for technicians of the future using Snap-on products. It's a great way to get the technicians of the future to use Snap-on products. To get them to see the quality and the professionalism of the Snap-on brand and ultimately for them to become Snap-on customers for life. WE continue to build those programs in the U.S. and internationally and across the wide range of disciplines from automotive repair, to critical power generation, to aerospace. And as part of that progress, an array of key technical schools across the U.S. have adopted Snap-on certification protocols. And that practice is expanding. Our sales and education were up over 20% again in the quarter. But more importantly, we believe those gains are setting the stage for future growth across all the critical industries. 
I already mentioned the rapid growth we're seeing in Asia Pacific but I'll just provide one example of our products that are helping to drive that expansion. During the quarter we released a new version of our diagnostics unit in China. The handheld includes a new touch screen interactive display, as well as expanded vehicle and system coverage. As you can imagine in China, with relatively recent development of the new car market, the repair wave is just starting to form. Our handheld unit is getting great reviews and is positioning Snap-on to ride that wave as it break. So that gives you a little insight into C&I, continued advancements in critical industries in emerging markets, significant gains would offset from a few concentrated headwinds in that segment. 
Moving to the Tools Group where we serve professional automotive technicians. Sales were up 13% including 3 points related to currency and the operating margin was 15.5%, up 300 basis points from last year. Sales of diagnostics products of the vans were up strongly. We're continuing to see the benefits of the successful launches of both our high-end VERDICT and our updated hand held unit. Those products are innovative, big-time productivity enhancers and they're driving a big-ticket strength across the Tools Group. We said we need to maintain and even in hands are van network. It's been a big focus for us and it's showing in the results. Again in this quarter, the franchisee help metrics are moving positively. Obviously, the sales are up but our franchisees are in a better overall financial shape, the turnover is low and we believe that the network is stronger than ever. We did get some validation of that progress in the quarter when franchisees direct published in their annual global franchisees, published its annual global franchisee report. The Snap-on franchisee proposition ranks sixth overall. The top-ranked tool company by a wide margin. And in fact, the top-ranked industrial company of any type. This is a publication that's a leading source of information for the franchisees industry in both North America and Europe, so it was a valuable endorsement for us. The rankings were based on several criteria including stability, growth, best practices and support and training. And those or areas that all have directly benefited from our focused efforts to enhance the channel and from the application of Snap-on Value Creation Processes. 
Now, I said repair information group. This is where we serve vehicle repair shop owners and managers and where we have a great opportunity to expand the Snap-on brand throughout the garage. and I posted a sales increase of 13.9%, just under 10% excluding currency. And the operating margin, it was 20.9%, a 150 basis points up from 19.4% last year. Related to the growth in our shops, our Equipment division was up in both North America and in Europe. Over the past several years, we've have done a number of innovative products and equipment and they're propelling us forward. The OEMs increasingly are directly signing on to these products and that additional exposure is a big plus particularly strong in the quarter were big-ticket alignment product, up more than double the group's growth rate. This is a product where we have a lead in imaging technology and we're taking advantage. 
Also, related to our expansion in the garage, we're increasingly seeing serving medium and heavy truck market with information and diagnostics. We launched a new pocket IQ handheld diagnostic unit specifically for the truck segment. It's designed for anyone diagnosing and repairing trucks from dealers, to fleet maintenance shops even to owners. We're also working with truck engine OEMs, lunching software for diagnostic testing for repair information and for reprogramming capability. The ease repair work across the entire line of OEM engine. And in the Independent repair sector, Mitchell 1. Mitchell 1's been making investments in truck repair and information for sometime. Now we're well-positioned and we're gaining in the truck software space. 
We've spoken in the past about our relatively small direct exposure to automotive OEMs. But obviously, as the rooftops in the U.S. decrease, our electronic parts catalog business to Snap-on Business Solutions has been impacted. But we're finding offsets both internationally and in adjacent markets. Areas like motorcycles and agriculture and we have made gains in those areas. Also related to this space, we continue to see increased activity in essential tool distributions. The OEMs are more freely commanding and that's helping drive some of the sales increases in RS&I. So that gives you a picture of what's going on in operating units. 
As I said in the beginning of my remarks here, the Snap-on Value Creation Processes are driving our progress: customer connection, building relationship with students, creating customers with for life, innovation, new diagnostics units in the U.S., in the U.K. and in China for cars for trucks. Undercar, new undercar equipment building on technology leadership winning new customers and products expanded to serve critical industries, automated tool control and wider tool offerings. And, of course, rapid continuous improvement for RCI, one of our biggest value creators. The operating income margin tells that story. 13.6% before financial services, up 140 basis points stronger than we've been in sometime. 
We believe we've come out of the downturn as a stronger company than when we entered and the Snap-on Value Creation Processes made it possible. Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo for our financial review. Aldo?"

Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Overall revenue growth increased profitability and financial services in what we believe are ongoing benefits from our Snap-on Value Creation Processes generated a 44% improvement",1754,"Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Overall revenue growth increased profitability and financial services in what we believe are ongoing benefits from our Snap-on Value Creation Processes generated a 44% improvement in year-over-year operating earnings. This operating earnings improvement excludes the $18 million arbitration settlement gain recorded during the quarter. The sales in the second quarter of $726.7 million increased $79.1 million by 12.2% year-over-year. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased 7.2%. We continue to realize year-over-year sales growth broadly across most of our business including increased sales to franchisees for the Snap-on Tools Group, higher sales to repair shop owners and managers by the repair systems and information group our RS&I, an increased sales for a wide range of customers in emerging markets and in critical industries in our commercial and industrial or C&I group. 
Consolidated gross profit of $342 million in the quarter increased $38.4% million from 2010 level. As a result of higher sales, $11.1 million of favorable foreign currency FX, savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives at $1.9 million of lower structuring costs. Consolidated gross margin of 47.1% in the quarter improved 20 basis points from Q2 of last year. Operating expenses in the quarter of $243.4 million increased $18.6 million from 2010 levels, largely due to $8.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency FX in higher volume related in other expenses including $4.2 million of anticipated higher pension expense. In the percentage of sales, operating expenses in the quarter of 33.5% improved 120 basis points from 34.7% last year. Restructuring cost of $1.9 million in the quarter compared to $3.1 million last year. Operating earnings from financial services of $17.5 million, before the arbitration settlement, improved to $15.8 million from second quarter 2010 levels. Sequentially, and as expected, financial services operating earnings continues to improve as our on-book financial portfolio grows. 
Interest expense of $16.3 million in the quarter increased $3.1 million from 2010 levels, mainly due to higher average debt levels following last December's $250 million notes issuance. Next month, we intend to repay $200 million of 6.25% notes upon the maturity with available cash. Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 34% was higher than last year's 31.2% rate. Primarily due to the mix of earnings including the impact of the arbitration settlement gain that is taxable in the United States. And finally, reported net earnings in the second quarter of 2011 were $78 million or $1.33 per diluted share. Absent of settlement gain, which contributed $0.19 per share, net earnings in the quarter was $66.9 million or $1.14 per diluted share. This represents an increase of 47.7% when compared with the $45.3 million or $0.78 per diluted share earned in the second quarter of last year. 
Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with a C&I group on Slide 7, sales of $279.7 million for the second quarter improve 8.1% from 2010 levels. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased 1.9%. Sales to a wide range of customers in emerging markets in critical industries were up considerably in the quarter. However, the rate of year-over-year organic sales growth in the C&I group was again affected by lower sales to the Military, continued weakness across Southern Europe and some impact in Japan from last quarter's natural disasters. Gross profit of $102.4 million in the quarter increased $9.8 million or 10.6% from 2010 levels. Primarily due to the higher sales of lower structuring costs, $4.2 million of favorable currency FX and $2.8 million of savings from ongoing restructuring RCI initiatives, partially offset by inflationary in other cost increases. 
Gross margin of 36.6% in the quarter grew 80 basis points from 35.8% last year. Operating expenses of $73.2 million in the quarter increased $6.1 million from 2010 levels, primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts, higher volume-related expenses and higher restructuring costs. In a percentage of sales, operating expenses in the quarter were 26.2% as compared to 25.9% last year. Second quarter operating earnings of $29.2 million for the C&I segment increased $3.7 million or 14.5% from 2010 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating margin in the C&I segment of 10.4% improved 50 basis points from 9.9% last year. 
Turning now to Slide 8. Second quarter sales of the Snap-on Tools Group increased 13% year-over-year, largely due to the continued higher sales in the U.S., and in an organic basis, sales were up 10%. Gross profit in the Snap-on Tools Group of $132.4 million in the quarter increased $17 million from last year's levels, primarily due to the higher sales led by increased sales of hand tools and agnostic products and favorable currency FX. These gross profit increases were partially offset by higher structuring costs for the previously communicated consolidation of our North American tools storage operations. As a percentage of sales, gross margin of 44.3% improved 60 basis points from 43.7% last year. 
Operating expenses of $86.2 million in the quarter increased $3.7 million from 2010 levels, primarily due to higher volume-related and other expenses and $1.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency FX, partially offset by $1.5 million of lower bad debt expense. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 28.8% in the quarter improved 240 basis points from 31.2% last year. Operating earnings for Snap-on Tools Group of $46.2 million in the quarter increased $13.2 million or 40% from the $33 million earned last year. And as a percentage of sales, operating earnings of 15.5% increased 300 basis points from 12.5% last year. 
Turning now to the RS&I group shown on Slide 9. Second quarter sales of $234.5 million increased 13.9% year-over-year. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased 9.7% reflecting continued higher sales to repair shop owners and managers. Gross profit of $107.4 million in the quarter increased $11.7 million from prior-year levels. Primarily due to higher sales and $3 million of favorable foreign currency FX. As a percentage of sales, gross margin of 45.8 declined 70 basis points from 2010 levels, reflecting the higher relative growth in sales of undercar equipment and essential tool and facilitation program. Operating expenses of $58.4 million in the quarter increased $2.7 million from 2010 levels, primarily due to higher volume related expenses and $2.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency FX. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 24.9% improved 220 basis points from 27.1% last year. Operating expenses of percentage of sales also benefits from the higher mix of undercar equipment and essential tool facilitation program sales which tend to exhibit lower operating expense levels relative to the other businesses within RS&I. Operating earnings of $49 million for the RS&I group increased $9 million or 22.5% from 2010 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating margin of 20.9% improved 150 basis points from 2010. 
Now, turning to Slide 10. Financial services operating earnings of $35.5 million in the quarter of 2011 include the previously discussed $18 million arbitration settlement gain. Excluding the settlement gain, operating earnings of $17.5 million in the quarter compares favorably to both first quarter earnings of $12.5 million and to fourth quarter earnings of $9.4 million. The $15.8 million year-over-year increase in operating earnings from $1.7 million last year to $17.5 million in the second quarter of 2011, we believe is testament to the earnings potential of our growing on-book finance portfolio. Originations of $153.1 million in the quarter increased 12% compared to last year's levels, reflecting increase sales in Snap-on tools, higher approval rates, as well as increased participation in our credit programs. 
Moving to Slide 11. As of the second quarter and our balance sheet includes $845 million of gross financing receivables including $697 million from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operation. In the United States $576 million or 83% of the financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. Since the beginning of 2011, our global on-book financing portfolio has grown over $110 million. In the remainder of the year, we expect that our on book finance portfolio will roughly increase by an additional $45 million. Regarding finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, this continue to be in line with our expectations. 
Now, turning to Slide 12. Net cash used by operating activities was $13.7 million in the quarter. This compares to net cash provided of $55.5 million in the second quarter of last year. This $69 million year-over-year net decrease primarily reflects the return of $89.8 million of cash previously withheld from CIT related to the arbitration settlement. This return of cash combined with the funding of higher inventory levels and new loans originated by Snap-on Credit were partially offset by higher net earnings. Similarly, our quarter end cash position of $418 million decreased $154 million from year-end levels primarily due to the funding of the loans originated by Snap-on Credit, the return of cash to CIT, and increased levels of working investment in capital expenditures partially offset by higher levels of net earnings in 2011. Free cash flow from financial services was, as expected, a negative $116 million primarily due to the return of cash to CIT and the continued funding of new loan originations at Snap-on Credit. Free cash flow from the operating company was a positive $81 million. Capital expenditures totaled $14.7 million in the quarter. 
As seen on Slide 13, day sales outstanding for trade receivables of 59 days at quarter end improved from 61 days at both first quarter and 2010 year end. Inventories increased $63 million from year end, primarily to support increased customer demand and to mitigate supply-chain disruption from both the recent natural disasters in Japan and the consolidation of our North American tools storage operations. Currency translation also contributed $12.9 million of the inventory increase. On a trailing 12 month basis, inventory turns to 4.3x compared to 4.4x at the end of Q1 and 4.7x at 2010 year-end, reflective of the higher inventory. By net debt-to-capital ratio 32.4% compared to the 30.1% at 2010 year-end and 28.3% last year. Year-over-year increase is primarily reflective of last December's $250 million bond issuance. In addition to our $418 million of cash and cash flow from operations, we have more than $600 million in available credit facilities in our current A2P2 short-term credit rating allows us to access the commercial paper markets should we choose to do so. As of second quarter end, no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities. This includes my remarks on the second quarter performance. And I'll now turn the an call back over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?"

Snap-on's potential is unfolding just the way we've been describing for some time. The Snap-on Value Creation Processes are driving improvements. Margins are up again, Opto by 140 basis point and the overall company by 320 basis points. And again this quarter, we're demonstrating progress along our strategic run rates for coherent growth. The van network has been enhanced. Cash collections are up, turnovers down and Snap-on was named top industrial franchised by Franchise Direct. We had expanded in the repair garage. Our sales continue their upward trend in our big-ticket diagnostics are increasing their penetration. The Snap-on presence in expanding further in critical industries. Sales continue to grow significantly in sectors like aerospace and natural resources and our presence in emerging markets keeps building. Our growth in China, India and Indonesia confirmed the opportunities. So that's our quarter. More evidence that Snap-on has considerable strength, capabilities and position, has much more run rate for growth and improvement. And as it embarked firmly on the path that we believe will continue our progress for some time to come.

So we find that to be pretty good for us and it's quite manageable. One of the problems with turnover is it could become very expensive. But at this level, we have the ability to manage it quite well. The way we see this is that we've invested all through the recession and try to help our franchisees in terms of continuous improvement. The productivity on the van, in terms of upgrading their system and in terms of giving them access to other opportunities like more efficient ways to ensure they're advanced, more efficient ways to communicate more, better ways to manage their vans from fuel consumption point of view. And we see all that coming through in these numbers. Now, in terms of the van side, I think the numbers are somewhere just south of 3,500. That's been growing gradually.

The first thing is, if you're thinking about the short term and you want to extrapolate off of this, I think what have to think for Snap-on, of course, for the Tools Group and for our business in general, is the second quarter is a good strong quarter for us. The third quarter is always uncertain. We have in the Tools Group the van dryers will take time off. They have to go on vacation sometimes. These usually go on the third quarter and we put the Snap-on Franchisee Conference in that, period. So if you're looking at the short term, I don't think you can extrapolate from second quarter onto the third quarter. We have to get that effect in the Tools Group and you have the effect in Europe of vacations which are always, in my experience, of indeterminate length depending on the year in Europe. So you have in the short term. In longer term, we feel very positive about our position in the Tools Group. I don't know if you can extrapolate off to 155 in the past, we have said that our target for operating margins for the entire corporation is around mid teens. And we thought the Tools Group would approach that in this second quarter, it got above that number. It started to go into the back end of that number. I don't know what you can make out of one quarter. But having said that, we feel very good about where the Tools business is today. That's not being driven by necessarily an extraordinarily rich mix of the business. It's simply being driven by RCI, by good strong sales, by our ability to price against inflation, which we said before, and a combination of those things. And together with, I suppose, you could say robust sales of big-ticket items like diagnostics and tool storage. So I think you could look at the Tools Group second quarter and say, wow, that is an extraordinary quarter. They are operating on all cylinders. They probably have gained some share, if you look at their growth in the situation. They've got good growth and they're performing well and the mix is very robust. I don't know if you can extrapolate from that number."

So when you're talking about a growth scenario that looks like we have managed over, at least through this quarter, maybe another quarter, the worst of that and we'll start building from a base. I've given up predicting Spain. Because I think, I would've said a year ago that Spain's got to get better. We believe we're not losing market share, but the Spanish market was down again and I think what you're seeing is, if you just pick up a newspaper and read about it, you can see the roots of that across Southern Europe. And so that's how I see C&I. Good strong double-digit growth happening just like we thought it would. Three concentrated areas of headwinds, 2 of which we think dissipate as we go through the year in the third and fourth quarter. Varying time constants. And Spain, I'm not so sure. We're confident it's going to come back but I can't predict the timing."

And when I talked to our franchisees, they were quite enthusiastic and quite full of themselves in terms of confidence. So if the numbers, if anecdotal evidence is anything, I feel, if anything, stronger than ever. And if the metrics are anything, I think 10% indicates that we're growing. And by the way, the comparison wasn't that easy. If you look at the Tools Group, they were pretty strong last year in the second quarter. So at 10% growth year-over-year is not small.

303646,137171262,144224,"Snap-on Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2011",2011-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Snap-on Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everybody. Well, the second quarter results were reasonably strong again, and I think it's safe to say that we're encouraged by the continued progress. Overall sales in the quarter were up 12.2% from last year with some help",2137,"Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everybody. Well, the second quarter results were reasonably strong again, and I think it's safe to say that we're encouraged by the continued progress. Overall sales in the quarter were up 12.2% from last year with some help from exchange rates. Organically, volume rose by over 7%. The overall operating margin was 15.4% and operating income was up more than 44% from 2010, and both of those comparisons exclude the positive effect of the arbitration settlement with CIT. 
The 40-plus percent rise in operating income is similar to what we posted in the past couple of quarters, so these results mark a continuation of an ongoing and strong trend. The profit increase included a $15.8 million rise in earnings from Financial Services, but a real highlight was the quarterly operating margin of 13.6% before Financial Services. That Opco [ph] OI margin represents the highest level Snap-on has achieved in well over 15 years. Now we believe the operating performance and the trend clearly demonstrates the strength of our Snap-on value creation processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement. It's a framework we apply everywhere at every level to improve our performance, and our commitment to those principles and processes are enabling our broad progress. 
Now with respect to the macro environment, the various markets in which we operate, the second quarter was fairly unchanged from what we spoke about 3 months ago. I characterize our performance brought -- our performance has widespread gains in most areas, more than overcoming those few continuing headwinds we mentioned in the past. I'll provide a bit of color on the quarter and cover the highlights for each of the operating groups. And then as usual, Aldo will offer a detailed financial review. 
From a geographic perspective, the same dynamics are present for our operations that have been in play for the past couple of quarters. In North America, no real change. Look, the overall 10% volume growth in the Tools Group reflects the same stable upward trend that we've become accustomed to in North America. Also, the big-ticket diagnostics and tool storage units that are sold in the van channel remain strong, and that's a continuing positive for us. 
Our Undercar Equipment, another big-ticket category was also up in North America, better than our overall sales increase. The same was true in our distribution and general industrial sales in the region. 
Moving to another area of strength, the emerging markets of Asia Pacific. Again this quarter, we saw strong double-digit gains. It's no secret that those markets are expanding, and we're taking advantage as we build presence and gain position. Throughout that jurisdiction, but especially in China, in India, in Indonesia, we're seeing growth, far above both GDP rates and the company's overall pace of growth. 
We continue to see progress in most of Europe in the established markets like the U.K., Sweden, Finland and we're growing in the East, in Eastern Europe, of course, in Russia. But also in other developing areas like Poland and in Turkey. And the gains we've seen are across business segments from big-ticket undercar equipment to industrial customers to SNA Europe's. 
But the overall growth in that region was somewhat muted by the ongoing economic weakness in Southern Europe. You might remember that for Snap-on, these are large markets by way of SNA Europe, and we're not seeing relief. Countries across the south like Spain and Portugal remain weak. But you know, that's no real surprise, given the almost daily news from that region. Actually, when it comes to Europe, given the turbulence, we feel okay about no major changes for us at Europe over the past few quarters. Speaking of headwinds, another that we mentioned last quarter is Japan. The situation there is fairly well known, it's unsettled as we thought it would be for a while. The good news is it's isolated and most people believe it's temporary. 
Now for the operating segment. For the operating segments and a view on the advancements we've made in those strategic areas, which we've identified as decisive for our future: expanding into critical industries, building in emerging markets, enhancing the franchise network and expanding in the repair garage. 
In Commercial-Industrial or the C&I group, sales were up 8.1% from 2010 levels. However, excluding the benefit from foreign exchange, volumes increased about 2%. The operating margin was 10.4%, up 50 basis points from last year. And as you expect from the geographic discussion I just provided, most areas here were up solidly, widespread double-digit rises. Keep in mind, however, that C&I is where we see most of the impact of those fairly specific headwinds of Southern Europe, the unsettled situation in Japan, and the lower military spending which we discussed last quarter. So the story in C&I is robust gains in most areas, partially offset by the concentration of our external headwinds in this one segment. 
C&I operations outside those concentrated headwinds grew organically as double digits, very much in line with the gains in the Tools Group and in the Repair Systems and Information Groups. From that perspective, we're encouraged by the progress along run rates from growth in C&I. And that progress can be seen in the volumes, the positive motion in Asia Pacific and in critical industries such as aerospace and natural resources. All these continued with their trend of strong double-digit growth. 
But more important than the sales in a particular quarter, we know that Snap-on is building expanded long-term presence in each of those strategic areas. Just last month, the corporation had a strong showing at the Paris Air Show. It is widely recognized as the most prestigious aircraft exposition in the world, and many of you know that our array of products for the aerospace sector is expanding. 
While in Paris, we highlighted the high-tech Automated Tool Control unit or ATC and our newly increased range of torque products aimed at aerospace. And the response was very enthusiastic. It's that kind of growing presence that's generating the big gains we're seeing in this critical industry of aerospace. And the gains are being driven by customers throughout the industries from airlines in support of their fleet, to aircraft manufacturing facilities and into the maintenance and repair of overhaul shops or MRO facilities. And as you would expect, the opportunities here are across the globe, and Snap-on is increasingly valued in this important sector. We feel encouraged by that.
I've spoken in the past about the partnerships with technical schools in creating certification programs. We believe it's a great way for technicians of the future using Snap-on products. It's a great way to get the technicians of the future to use Snap-on products, to get them to see the quality and the professionalism of the Snap-on brand and ultimately for them to become Snap-on customers for life. We continue to build those programs in the U.S. and internationally and across the wide range of disciplines from automotive repair, to critical power generation, to aerospace. 
And as part of that progress, an array of key technical schools across the U.S. have adopted Snap-on certification protocols, and that practice is expanding. Our sales in Education were up over 20% again in the quarter. But more importantly, we believe those gains are setting the stage for future growth across all the critical industries. 
I already mentioned the rapid growth we're seeing in Asia-Pacific, but I'll just provide one example of the products that are helping to drive that expansion. During the quarter, we released a new version of our diagnostics unit in China. The handheld includes a new touchscreen interactive display, as well as expanded vehicle and system coverage. As you can imagine in China, with relatively recent development of the new car market, the repair wave is just starting to form. Our handheld unit is getting great reviews and is positioning Snap-on to ride that wave as it breaks. So that gives you a little insight into C&I, continued advancements in critical industries in emerging markets, significant gains, with offsets from a few concentrated headwinds in that segment. 
Moving to the Tools Group, where we serve professional automotive technicians. Sales were up 13%, including 3 points related to currency, and the operating margin was 15.5%, up 300 basis points from last year. Sales of diagnostics products to the vans were up strongly. We're continuing to see the benefits of the successful launches of both our high-end VERDICT and our updated VERUS handheld unit. Those products are innovative, big-time productivity enhancers and they're driving a big-ticket strength across the Tools Group. We said we need to maintain and even enhance our van network. It's been a big focus for us, and it's showing in the results. 
Again this quarter, the franchisee health metrics are moving positively. Obviously, the sales are up, but our franchisees are in a better overall financial shape, the turnover is low, and we believe that the network is stronger than ever. We did get some validation of that progress in the quarter when Franchise Direct published its annual global franchisees report. The Snap-on franchisee proposition ranks sixth overall, the top-ranked tool company by a wide margin, in fact, the top-ranked industrial company of any type. 
This is a publication that's a leading source of information for the franchise industry in both North America and Europe, so it was a valuable endorsement for us. The rankings were based on several criteria, including stability, growth, best practices and support and training, and those are areas that all have directly benefited from our focused efforts to enhance the channel and from the application of Snap-on value creation processes. 
Now on to the Repair System & Information Group. This is where we serve vehicle repair shop owners and managers and where we have a great opportunity to expand the Snap-on brand throughout the garage. RS&I posted a sales increase of 13.9%, just under 10% excluding currency. And the operating margin, it was 20.9%, a 150 basis points up from 19.4% last year. Related to the growth in those shops, our Equipment division was up in both North America and in Europe. Over the past several years, we've had done a number of innovative products and equipment, and they're propelling us forward. The OEMs increasingly are directly signing on to these products, and that additional exposure is a big plus. Particularly strong in the quarter were big-ticket alignment products, up more than double the group's growth rate. This is a product where we have a lead in imaging technology, and we're taking advantage. 
Also related to our expansion in the garage, we're increasingly seeing -- serving medium and heavy truck market with information and diagnostics. We have launched the new Pocket iQ handheld diagnostic unit, specifically for the Truck segment. It's designed for anyone diagnosing and repairing trucks from dealers, to fleet maintenance shops even to owners. We're also working with truck engine OEMs, launching software for diagnostic testing for repair information and for reprogramming capabilities, to ease repair work across their entire line of OEM engines. 
And in the independent repair sector, Mitchell 1. Mitchell 1 has been making investments in truck repair and information for some time. Now we're well-positioned and we're gaining in the truck software space. 
We've spoken in the past about a relatively small direct exposure to automotive OEMs. But obviously, as the rooftops in the U.S. decrease, our Electronic Parts Catalog business to Snap-on Business Solutions has been impacted. But we're finding offsets both internationally and in adjacent markets, areas like motorcycles and agriculture, and we have made gains in those areas. Also related to this space, we continue to see increased activity in essential tool distributions. The OEMs are more freely commending, and that's helping drive some of the sales increases in RS&I. So that gives you a picture of what's going on in the operating units. 
As I said in the beginning of my remarks here, the Snap-on value creation processes are driving our progress, customer connection, building relationship with students, creating customers for life, innovation, new diagnostics units in the U.S. and the U.K. and in China for cars and for trucks. Undercar, new undercar equipment, building on technology leadership winning new customers and products expanded to serve critical industries, automated tool control and wider torque offerings. And of course, rapid continuous improvement or RCI, one of our biggest value creators. The operating income margin tells that story, 13.6% before Financial Services, up 140 basis points stronger than we've been in some time. 
We believe we've come out of the downturn as a stronger company than when we entered, and the Snap-on value creation processes made it possible. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo for our financial review. Aldo?"
303646,137171262,144224,"Snap-on Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2011",2011-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Snap-on Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Overall revenue growth increased profitability in Financial Services and what we believe are ongoing benefits from our Snap-on value creation processes generated a 44% improvement",1757,"Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Overall revenue growth increased profitability in Financial Services and what we believe are ongoing benefits from our Snap-on value creation processes generated a 44% improvement in year-over-year operating earnings. 
This operating earnings improvement excludes the $18 million arbitration settlement gain recorded during the quarter. That sales in the second quarter of $726.7 million increased $79.1 million by 12.2% year-over-year. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased 7.2%. We continue to realize year-over-year sales growth broadly across most of our business, including increased sales to franchisees by the Snap-on Tools Group, higher sales to repair shop owners and managers by the Repair Systems & Information Group our RS&I and increased sales to a wide range of customers in emerging markets and critical industries that are commercial and industrial or C&I Group. 
Consolidated gross profit of $342 million in the quarter increased $38.4% million from 2010 level. As a result of higher sales, $11.1 million of favorable foreign currency effects, savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives of $1.9 million of lower structuring costs. Consolidated gross margin of 47.1% in the quarter improved 20 basis points from Q2 of last year. Operating expenses in the quarter of $243.4 million increased $18.6 million from 2010 levels, largely due to $8.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects and higher volume related in other expenses, including a $4.2 million of anticipated higher pension expense. 
As a percentage of sales, operating expenses in the quarter were 33.5%, it improved 120 basis points from 34.7% last year, restructuring cost of $1.9 million in the quarter compared to $3.1 million last year. Operating earnings from Financial Services of $17.5 million before the arbitration settlement, improved to $15.8 million from second quarter 2010 levels. Sequentially and as expected, Financial Services operating earnings continues to improve as our on-book financial portfolio grows. 
Interest expense of $16.3 million in the quarter increased $3.1 million from 2010 levels, mainly due to higher average debt levels following last December's $250 million notes issuance. Next month, we intend to repay $200 million of 6.25% notes upon the maturity with available cash. 
Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 34% was higher than last year's 31.2% rate, primarily due to the mix of earnings including the impact of the arbitration settlement gain that is taxable in the United States. 
And finally, reported net earnings in the second quarter of 2011 were $78 million or $1.33 per diluted share. Absent of settlement gain, which contributed $0.19 per share, net earnings in the quarter were $66.9 million or $1.14 per diluted share. This represents an increase of 47.7% when compared with the $45.3 million or $0.78 per diluted share earned in the second quarter of last year. 
Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with a C&I Group on Slide 7, sales of $279.7 million for the second quarter improved 8.1% from 2010 levels. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased 1.9%. Sales to a wide range of customers in emerging markets in critical industries were up considerably in the quarter. However, the rate of year-over-year organic sales growth in the C&I group was again affected by lower sales to the Military, continued weakness across Southern Europe and some impact in Japan from last quarter's natural disasters. 
Gross profit of $102.4 million in the quarter increased $9.8 million or 10.6% from 2010 levels, primarily due to the higher sales of lower restructuring costs, $4.2 million of favorable currency effects and $2.8 million of savings from an ongoing restructuring of ongoing RCI initiatives, partially offset by inflationary in other cost increases. 
Gross margin of 36.6% in the quarter improved 80 basis points from 35.8% last year. Operating expenses of $73.2 million in the quarter increased $6.1 million from 2010 levels, primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts, higher volume-related expenses and higher restructuring costs. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses in the quarter were 26.2% as compared to 25.9% last year. Second quarter operating earnings of $29.2 million for the C&I segment increased $3.7 million or 14.5% from 2010 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating margin in the C&I segment of 10.4% improved 50 basis points from 9.9% last year. 
Turning now to Slide 8. Second quarter sales of the Snap-on Tools Group increased 13% year-over-year, largely due to continued higher sales in the U.S, On an organic basis, sales were up 10%. Gross profit in the Snap-on Tools Group of $132.4 million in the quarter increased $17 million from last year's levels, primarily due to the higher sales led by increased sales of hand tools and diagnostic products and favorable currency effects. These gross profit increases were partially offset by higher structuring costs for the previously communicated consolidation of our North American tools storage operations. As a percentage of sales, gross margin of 44.3% improved 60 basis points from 43.7% last year. 
Operating expenses of $86.2 million in the quarter increased $3.7 million from 2010 levels, primarily due to higher volume-related and other expenses and $1.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by $1.5 million of lower bad debt expense. 
As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 28.8% in the quarter improved 240 basis points from 31.2% last year. Operating earnings for Snap-on Tools Group of $46.2 million in the quarter increased $13.2 million or 40% from the $33 million earned last year. And as a percentage of sales, operating earnings of 15.5% increased 300 basis points from 12.5% last year. 
Turning now to the RS&I group shown on Slide 9. Second quarter sales of $234.5 million increased 13.9% year-over-year. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased 9.7% reflecting continued higher sales to repair shop owners and managers. Gross profit of $107.4 million in the quarter increased $11.7 million from prior-year levels, primarily due to higher sales and $3 million of favorable foreign currency effects. As a percentage of sales, gross margin of 45.8 declined 70 basis points from 2010 levels, reflecting the higher relative growth in sales of undercar equipment and essential tool and facilitation program. Operating expenses of $58.4 million in the quarter increased $2.7 million from 2010 levels, primarily due to higher volume-related expenses and $2.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects. 
As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 24.9% improved 220 basis points from 27.1% last year. Our operating expenses as a percentage of sales also benefits from the higher mix of undercar equipment and essential tool facilitation program sales, which tend to exhibit lower operating expense levels relative to the other businesses within RS&I. Operating earnings of $49 million for the RS&I group increased $9 million or 22.5% from 2010 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating margin of 20.9% improved 150 basis points from 2010. 
Now, turning to Slide 10. Financial Services operating earnings of $35.5 million in the quarter of 2011 includes the previously discussed $18 million arbitration settlement gain. Excluding the settlement gain, operating earnings of $17.5 million in the quarter compares favorably to both first quarter earnings of $12.5 million and to fourth quarter 2010 earnings of $9.4 million. The $15.8 million year-over-year increase in operating earnings from $1.7 million last year to $17.5 million in the second quarter of 2011, we believe is testament to the earnings potential of our growing on-book finance portfolio. Originations of $153.1 million in the quarter increased 12% compared to last year's levels, reflecting increased sales in Snap-on tools, higher approval rates, as well as increased participation in our credit programs. 
Moving to Slide 11. As of the second quarter end, our balance sheet includes $845 million of gross financing receivables including $697 million from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operation. In the United States, $576 million or 83% of the financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. Since the beginning of 2011, our global on-book financing portfolio has grown over $110 million. In the remainder of the year, we expect that our on-book finance portfolio will roughly increase by an additional $45 million. Regarding finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, this continue to be in line with our expectations. 
Now, turning to Slide 12. Net cash used by operating activities was $13.7 million in the quarter. This compares to net cash provided of $55.5 million in the second quarter of last year. This $69 million year-over-year net decrease primarily reflects the return of $89.8 million of cash previously withheld from CIT related to the arbitration settlement. This return of cash, combined with the funding of higher inventory levels and new loans originated by Snap-on Credit, were partially offset by higher net earnings. Similarly, our quarter-end cash position of $418 million decreased $154 million from year-end levels, primarily due to the funding of new loans originated by Snap-on Credit, the return of cash to CIT and increased levels of working investment in capital expenditures, partially offset by higher levels of net earnings in 2011. 
Free cash flow from Financial Services was, as expected, a negative $116 million, primarily due to the return of cash to CIT and the continued funding of new loan originations at Snap-on Credit. Free cash flow from the operating company was a positive $82 million. Capital expenditures totaled $14.7 million in the quarter. 
As seen on Slide 13, day sales outstanding for trade receivables of 59 days at quarter end improved from 61 days at both first quarter and 2010 year end. Inventories increased $63 million from year end, primarily to support increased customer demand and to mitigate supply-chain disruption from both the recent natural disasters in Japan and the consolidation of our North American tool storage operations. 
Currency translation also contributed $12.9 million of the inventory increase. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 4.3x compared to 4.4x at the end of Q1 and 4.7x at 2010 year end, reflective of the higher inventory. Our net debt-to-capital ratio 32.4% compares to the 30.1% at 2010 year end and 28.3% last year. The year-over-year increase is primarily reflective of last December's $250 million bond issuance. 
In addition to our $418 million of cash and cash flow from operations, we have more than $600 million in available credit facilities, and our current A2P2 short-term credit rating allows us to access the commercial paper markets, should we choose to do so. As of second quarter end, no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities. This includes my remarks on our second quarter performance, and I'll now turn the call back over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?"

Margins are up again, Opco [ph] by 140 basis point and the overall company by 320 basis points. 
And again this quarter, we're demonstrating progress along our strategic runways for coherent growth. The van network has been enhanced. Cash collections are up, turnovers down and Snap-on was named the top industrial franchise by Franchise Direct. We had expanded in the repair garage. Our liner sales continue their upward trend, and our big-ticket diagnostics are increasing their penetration. The Snap-on presence is expanding further in critical industries. Sales continue to grow significantly in sectors like aerospace and natural resources, and our presence in emerging markets keeps building. Our growth in China, India and Indonesia confirm the opportunities. So that's our quarter, more evidence that Snap-on has considerable strength, capabilities and position. It has much more runway for growth and improvement, and as it embarked firmly on the path that we believe will continue our progress for some time to come. 
I once again want to end my remarks -- I want to end today by speaking to the many franchisees and Snap-on associates that I know are on the call.

So we find that to be pretty good for us, and that's quite manageable. One of the problems with turnover is it could become very expensive. But at this level, we have the ability to manage it quite well. The way we see this is that we've invested all through the recession and try to help our franchisees in terms of continuous improvement, the productivity on their van, in terms of upgrading their system and in terms of giving them access to other opportunities like more efficient ways to ensure they're advanced, more efficient ways to communicate more, better ways to manage their vans from a fuel consumption point of view. And we see all that coming through in these numbers. Now in terms of the van side, I think the numbers are somewhere just south of 3,500. That's been growing gradually. I want to say on a year-over-year basis, single digits. So it's been moving upwards but not at a large pace, but it's been very stable."

The first thing is, if you're thinking about the short term and you want to extrapolate off of this, I think what have to think of for Snap-on, of course, for the Tools Group and for our business, in general, is the second quarter is a good strong quarter for us. The third quarter is always uncertain. We have in the Tools Group the van drivers will take time off. They have to go on vacation sometimes. They usually go on the third quarter, and we put the Snap-on Franchisee Conference in that period. So if you're looking at the short term, I don't think you can extrapolate from second quarter onto the third quarter. You have to get that effect in the Tools Group, and you have the effect in Europe of vacations which are always, in my experience, of indeterminate length depending on the year in Europe. So you have in the short term. In the longer term, we feel very positive about our position in the Tools Group. I don't know if you can extrapolate off the 15.5%. In the past, we have said that our target for operating margins for the entire corporation is around mid-teens, and we thought the Tools Group would approach that. In this second quarter, it got above that number. It started to go into the back end, the back half of that number. I don't know what you can make out of one quarter. But having said that, we feel very good about where the Tools business is today. That's not being driven by necessarily an extraordinarily rich mix of the business. It's simply being driven by RCI, by good strong sales, by our ability to price against inflation, which we said before, and a combination of those things. And together with, I suppose, you could say robust sales of big-ticket items like diagnostics and tool storage. So I think you could look at the Tools Group second quarter and say, ""Wow, that is an extraordinary quarter. They have been selling on -- they are operating on all cylinders. They probably have gained some share, if you look at their growth in this situation."" They've got good growth, and they're performing well and the mix is very robust. I don't know if you can extrapolate from that number."

But that will all work itself out, as we know the Japanese do, they're very ingenious and so-and-so. We think Japan comes back from its current malaise, I don't know it will go back to prerecession levels or not, but you'll certainly see recovery. So I think that fixes itself out toward the back of the year. If you're talking about the military, I don't know where the government goes, but the comparisons get easier year-over-year. So when you're talking about a growth scenario that looks like we have managed over, at least, through this quarter, maybe another quarter, the worst of that, and we'll start building from a base. I have given up predicting Spain. Because I think, I would have said a year ago that Spain's got to get better. We believe we're not losing market share, but the Spanish market was down again, and I think what you're seeing is, if you just pick up a newspaper and read about it, you can see the roots of that across Southern Europe. And so, that's how I see C&I. Good strong double-digit growth happening just like we thought it would. Three concentrated areas of headwinds, 2 of which we think dissipate as we go through the year in the third and fourth quarter, varying time constants. And Spain, I'm not so sure. We're confident it's going to come back, but I can't predict the timing."

And when I talked to our franchisees, they were quite enthusiastic and quite full of themselves in terms of confidence. So if the numbers, if the anecdotal evidence is anything, I feel we're, if anything, stronger than ever. And if the metrics are anything, I think 10% indicates that we're growing. And by the way, the comparison wasn't that easy. If you look at the Tools Group, they were pretty strong last year in the second quarter. So at 10% growth year-over-year, it's not small.

303646,137171262,144316,"Snap-on Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2011",2011-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Snap-on Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everybody. Well, the second quarter results were reasonably strong again, and I think it's safe to say that we're encouraged by the continued progress. Overall sales in the quarter were up 12.2% from last year with some help",2137,"Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everybody. Well, the second quarter results were reasonably strong again, and I think it's safe to say that we're encouraged by the continued progress. Overall sales in the quarter were up 12.2% from last year with some help from exchange rates. Organically, volume rose by over 7%. The overall operating margin was 15.4% and operating income was up more than 44% from 2010, and both of those comparisons exclude the positive effect of the arbitration settlement with CIT. 
The 40-plus percent rise in operating income is similar to what we posted in the past couple of quarters, so these results mark a continuation of an ongoing and strong trend. The profit increase included a $15.8 million rise in earnings from Financial Services, but a real highlight was the quarterly operating margin of 13.6% before Financial Services. That Opco [ph] OI margin represents the highest level Snap-on has achieved in well over 15 years. Now we believe the operating performance and the trend clearly demonstrates the strength of our Snap-on value creation processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement. It's a framework we apply everywhere at every level to improve our performance, and our commitment to those principles and processes are enabling our broad progress. 
Now with respect to the macro environment, the various markets in which we operate, the second quarter was fairly unchanged from what we spoke about 3 months ago. I characterize our performance brought -- our performance has widespread gains in most areas, more than overcoming those few continuing headwinds we mentioned in the past. I'll provide a bit of color on the quarter and cover the highlights for each of the operating groups. And then as usual, Aldo will offer a detailed financial review. 
From a geographic perspective, the same dynamics are present for our operations that have been in play for the past couple of quarters. In North America, no real change. Look, the overall 10% volume growth in the Tools Group reflects the same stable upward trend that we've become accustomed to in North America. Also, the big-ticket diagnostics and tool storage units that are sold in the van channel remain strong, and that's a continuing positive for us. 
Our Undercar Equipment, another big-ticket category was also up in North America, better than our overall sales increase. The same was true in our distribution and general industrial sales in the region. 
Moving to another area of strength, the emerging markets of Asia Pacific. Again this quarter, we saw strong double-digit gains. It's no secret that those markets are expanding, and we're taking advantage as we build presence and gain position. Throughout that jurisdiction, but especially in China, in India, in Indonesia, we're seeing growth, far above both GDP rates and the company's overall pace of growth. 
We continue to see progress in most of Europe in the established markets like the U.K., Sweden, Finland and we're growing in the East, in Eastern Europe, of course, in Russia, but also in other developing areas like Poland and in Turkey. And the gains we've seen are across business segments from big-ticket undercar equipment to industrial customers to SNA Europe's. 
But the overall growth in that region was somewhat muted by the ongoing economic weakness in Southern Europe. You might remember that for Snap-on, these are large markets by way of SNA Europe, and we're not seeing relief. Countries across the south like Spain and Portugal remain weak. But you know that's no real surprise, given the almost daily news from that region. Actually, when it comes to Europe, given the turbulence, we feel okay about no major changes for us at Europe over the past few quarters. Speaking of headwinds, another that we mentioned last quarter is Japan. The situation there is fairly well known, it's unsettled as we thought it would be for a while. The good news is it's isolated and most people believe it's temporary. 
Now for the operating segment. For the operating segments and a view on the advancements we've made in those strategic areas, which we've identified as decisive for our future: expanding into critical industries, building in emerging markets, enhancing the franchise network and expanding in the repair garage. 
In Commercial-Industrial or the C&I group, sales were up 8.1% from 2010 levels. However, excluding the benefit from foreign exchange, volumes increased about 2%. The operating margin was 10.4%, up 50 basis points from last year. And as you expect from the geographic discussion I just provided, most areas here were up solidly, widespread double-digit rises. Keep in mind, however, that C&I is where we see most of the impact of those fairly specific headwinds of Southern Europe, the unsettled situation in Japan, and the lower military spending which we discussed last quarter. So the story in C&I is robust gains in most areas, partially offset by the concentration of our external headwinds in this one segment. 
C&I operations outside those concentrated headwinds grew organically as double digits, very much in line with the gains in the Tools Group and in the Repair Systems and Information Groups. From that perspective, we're encouraged by the progress along run rates from growth in C&I. And that progress can be seen in the volumes, the positive motion in Asia Pacific and in critical industries such as aerospace and natural resources. All these continued with their trend of strong double-digit growth. 
But more important than the sales in a particular quarter, we know that Snap-on is building expanded long-term presence in each of those strategic areas. Just last month, the corporation had a strong showing at the Paris Air Show. It is widely recognized as the most prestigious aircraft exposition in the world, and many of you know that our array of products for the aerospace sector is expanding. 
While in Paris, we highlighted the high-tech Automated Tool Control unit or ATC and our newly increased range of torque products aimed at aerospace. And the response was very enthusiastic. It's that kind of growing presence that's generating the big gains we're seeing in this critical industry of aerospace. And the gains are being driven by customers throughout the industries from airlines in support of their fleet, to aircraft manufacturing facilities and into the maintenance and repair of overhaul shops or MRO facilities. And as you would expect, the opportunities here are across the globe, and Snap-on is increasingly valued in this important sector. We feel encouraged by that.
I've spoken in the past about the partnerships with technical schools in creating certification programs. We believe it's a great way for technicians of the future using Snap-on products. It's a great way to get the technicians of the future to use Snap-on products, to get them to see the quality and the professionalism of the Snap-on brand and ultimately for them to become Snap-on customers for life. We continue to build those programs in the U.S. and internationally and across the wide range of disciplines from automotive repair, to critical power generation, to aerospace. 
And as part of that progress, an array of key technical schools across the U.S. have adopted Snap-on certification protocols, and that practice is expanding. Our sales in Education were up over 20% again in the quarter. But more importantly, we believe those gains are setting the stage for future growth across all the critical industries. 
I already mentioned the rapid growth we're seeing in Asia-Pacific, but I'll just provide one example of the products that are helping to drive that expansion. During the quarter, we released a new version of our diagnostics unit in China. The handheld includes a new touch screen interactive display, as well as expanded vehicle and system coverage. As you can imagine in China, with relatively recent development of the new car market, the repair wave is just starting to form. Our handheld unit is getting great reviews and is positioning Snap-on to ride that wave as it breaks. So that gives you a little insight into C&I, continued advancements in critical industries in emerging markets, significant gains, with offsets from a few concentrated headwinds in that segment. 
Moving to the Tools Group, where we serve professional automotive technicians. Sales were up 13%, including 3 points related to currency, and the operating margin was 15.5%, up 300 basis points from last year. Sales of diagnostics products to the vans were up strongly. We're continuing to see the benefits of the successful launches of both our high-end VERDICT and our updated VERUS handheld unit. Those products are innovative, big-time productivity enhancers and they're driving a big-ticket strength across the Tools Group. We said we need to maintain and even enhance our van network. It's been a big focus for us, and it's showing in the results. 
Again this quarter, the franchisee health metrics are moving positively. Obviously, the sales are up, but our franchisees are in better overall financial shape, the turnover is low, and we believe that the network is stronger than ever. We did get some validation of that progress in the quarter when Franchise Direct published its annual global franchisees report. The Snap-on franchisee proposition ranked sixth overall, the top-ranked tool company by a wide margin, in fact, the top-ranked industrial company of any type. 
This is a publication that's a leading source of information for the franchise industry in both North America and Europe, so it was a valuable endorsement for us. The rankings were based on several criteria, including stability, growth, best practices and support and training, and those are areas that all have directly benefited from our focused efforts to enhance the channel and from the application of Snap-on value creation processes. 
Now on to the Repair System & Information Group. This is where we serve vehicle repair shop owners and managers and where we have a great opportunity to expand the Snap-on brand throughout the garage. RS&I posted a sales increase of 13.9%, just under 10% excluding currency. And the operating margin, it was 20.9%, a 150 basis points up from 19.4% last year. Related to the growth in those shops, our Equipment division was up in both North America and in Europe. Over the past several years, we've had done a number of innovative products and equipment, and they're propelling us forward. The OEMs increasingly are directly signing on to these products, and that additional exposure is a big plus. Particularly strong in the quarter were big-ticket alignment products, up more than double the group's growth rate. This is a product where we have a lead in imaging technology, and we're taking advantage. 
Also related to our expansion in the garage, we're increasingly seeing -- serving medium and heavy truck market with information and diagnostics. We have launched the new Pocket iQ handheld diagnostic unit, specifically for the Truck segment. It's designed for anyone diagnosing and repairing trucks from dealers, to fleet maintenance shops even to owners. We're also working with truck engine OEMs, launching software for diagnostic testing for repair information and for reprogramming capabilities, to ease repair work across their entire line of OEM engines. 
And in the independent repair sector, Mitchell 1. Mitchell 1 has been making investments in truck repair and information for some time. Now we're well-positioned and we're gaining in the truck software space. 
We've spoken in the past about a relatively small direct exposure to automotive OEMs. But obviously, as the rooftops in the U.S. decrease, our Electronic Parts Catalog business to Snap-on Business Solutions has been impacted. But we're finding offsets both internationally and in adjacent markets, areas like motorcycles and agriculture, and we have made gains in those areas. Also related to this space, we continue to see increased activity in essential tool distributions. The OEMs are more freely commending, and that's helping drive some of the sales increases in RS&I. So that gives you a picture of what's going on in the operating units. 
As I said in the beginning of my remarks here, the Snap-on value creation processes are driving our progress, customer connection, building relationship with students, creating customers for life, innovation, new diagnostics units in the U.S. and the U.K. and in China for cars and for trucks. Undercar, new undercar equipment, building on technology leadership winning new customers and products expanded to serve critical industries, automated tool control and wider torque offerings. And of course, rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, one of our biggest value creators. The operating income margin tells that story, 13.6% before Financial Services, up 140 basis points stronger than we've been in some time. 
We believe we've come out of the downturn as a stronger company than when we entered, and the Snap-on value creation processes made it possible. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo for our financial review. Aldo?"

Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Overall revenue growth increased profitability in Financial Services and what we believe are ongoing benefits from our Snap-on value creation processes generated a 44% improvement",1757,"Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Overall revenue growth increased profitability in Financial Services and what we believe are ongoing benefits from our Snap-on value creation processes generated a 44% improvement in year-over-year operating earnings. 
This operating earnings improvement excludes the $18 million arbitration settlement gain recorded during the quarter. That sales in the second quarter of $726.7 million increased $79.1 million by 12.2% year-over-year. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased 7.2%. We continue to realize year-over-year sales growth broadly across most of our businesses, including increased sales to franchisees by the Snap-on Tools Group, higher sales to repair shop owners and managers by the Repair Systems & Information Group our RS&I and increased sales to a wide range of customers in emerging markets and critical industries that are commercial and industrial or C&I Group. 
Consolidated gross profit of $342 million in the quarter increased $38.4% million from 2010 level. As a result of higher sales, $11.1 million of favorable foreign currency effects, savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives of $1.9 million of lower structuring costs. Consolidated gross margin of 47.1% in the quarter improved 20 basis points from Q2 of last year. Operating expenses in the quarter of $243.4 million increased $18.6 million from 2010 levels, largely due to $8.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects and higher volume related in other expenses, including a $4.2 million of anticipated higher pension expense. 
As a percentage of sales, operating expenses in the quarter were 33.5%, it improved 120 basis points from 34.7% last year, restructuring cost of $1.9 million in the quarter compared to $3.1 million last year. Operating earnings from Financial Services of $17.5 million before the arbitration settlement, improved to $15.8 million from second quarter 2010 levels. Sequentially and as expected, Financial Services operating earnings continues to improve as our on-book financial portfolio grows. 
Interest expense of $16.3 million in the quarter increased $3.1 million from 2010 levels, mainly due to higher average debt levels following last December's $250 million notes issuance. Next month, we intend to repay $200 million of 6.25% notes upon the maturity with available cash. 
Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 34% was higher than last year's 31.2% rate, primarily due to the mix of earnings including the impact of the arbitration settlement gain that is taxable in the United States. 
And finally, reported net earnings in the second quarter of 2011 were $78 million or $1.33 per diluted share. Absent of settlement gain, which contributed $0.19 per share, net earnings in the quarter were $66.9 million or $1.14 per diluted share. This represents an increase of 47.7% when compared with the $45.3 million or $0.78 per diluted share earned in the second quarter of last year. 
Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with a C&I Group on Slide 7, sales of $279.7 million for the second quarter improved 8.1% from 2010 levels. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased 1.9%. Sales to a wide range of customers in emerging markets in critical industries were up considerably in the quarter. However, the rate of year-over-year organic sales growth in the C&I group was again affected by lower sales to the Military, continued weakness across Southern Europe and some impact in Japan from last quarter's natural disasters. 
Gross profit of $102.4 million in the quarter increased $9.8 million or 10.6% from 2010 levels, primarily due to the higher sales of lower restructuring costs, $4.2 million of favorable currency effects and $2.8 million of savings from an ongoing restructuring of ongoing RCI initiatives, partially offset by inflationary in other cost increases. 
Gross margin of 36.6% in the quarter improved 80 basis points from 35.8% last year. Operating expenses of $73.2 million in the quarter increased $6.1 million from 2010 levels, primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts, higher volume-related expenses and higher restructuring costs. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses in the quarter were 26.2% as compared to 25.9% last year. Second quarter operating earnings of $29.2 million for the C&I segment increased $3.7 million or 14.5% from 2010 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating margin in the C&I segment of 10.4% improved 50 basis points from 9.9% last year. 
Turning now to Slide 8. Second quarter sales of the Snap-on Tools Group increased 13% year-over-year, largely due to continued higher sales in the U.S, On an organic basis, sales were up 10%. Gross profit in the Snap-on Tools Group of $132.4 million in the quarter increased $17 million from last year's levels, primarily due to the higher sales led by increased sales of hand tools and diagnostic products and favorable currency effects. These gross profit increases were partially offset by higher structuring costs for the previously communicated consolidation of our North American tools storage operations. As a percentage of sales, gross margin of 44.3% improved 60 basis points from 43.7% last year. 
Operating expenses of $86.2 million in the quarter increased $3.7 million from 2010 levels, primarily due to higher volume-related and other expenses and $1.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by $1.5 million of lower bad debt expense. 
As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 28.8% in the quarter improved 240 basis points from 31.2% last year. Operating earnings for Snap-on Tools Group of $46.2 million in the quarter increased $13.2 million or 40% from the $33 million earned last year. And as a percentage of sales, operating earnings of 15.5% increased 300 basis points from 12.5% last year. 
Turning now to the RS&I group shown on Slide 9. Second quarter sales of $234.5 million increased 13.9% year-over-year. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased 9.7% reflecting continued higher sales to repair shop owners and managers. Gross profit of $107.4 million in the quarter increased $11.7 million from prior-year levels, primarily due to higher sales and $3 million of favorable foreign currency effects. As a percentage of sales, gross margin of 45.8 declined 70 basis points from 2010 levels, reflecting the higher relative growth in sales of undercar equipment and essential tool and facilitation program. Operating expenses of $58.4 million in the quarter increased $2.7 million from 2010 levels, primarily due to higher volume-related expenses and $2.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects. 
As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 24.9% improved 220 basis points from 27.1% last year. Our operating expenses as a percentage of sales also benefits from the higher mix of undercar equipment and essential tool facilitation program sales, which tend to exhibit lower operating expense levels relative to the other businesses within RS&I. Operating earnings of $49 million for the RS&I group increased $9 million or 22.5% from 2010 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating margin of 20.9% improved 150 basis points from 2010.
Now, turning to Slide 10. Financial Services operating earnings of $35.5 million in the quarter of 2011 includes the previously discussed $18 million arbitration settlement gain. Excluding the settlement gain, operating earnings of $17.5 million in the quarter compares favorably to both first quarter earnings of $12.5 million and to fourth quarter 2010 earnings of $9.4 million. The $15.8 million year-over-year increase in operating earnings from $1.7 million last year to $17.5 million in the second quarter of 2011, we believe is testament to the earnings potential of our growing on-book finance portfolio. Originations of $153.1 million in the quarter increased 12% compared to last year's levels, reflecting increased sales in Snap-on tools, higher approval rates, as well as increased participation in our credit programs. 
Moving to Slide 11. As of the second quarter end, our balance sheet includes $845 million of gross financing receivables including $697 million from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operation. In the United States, $576 million or 83% of the financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. Since the beginning of 2011, our global on-book financing portfolio has grown over $110 million. In the remainder of the year, we expect that our on-book finance portfolio will roughly increase by an additional $45 million. Regarding finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations. 
Now, turning to Slide 12. Net cash used by operating activities was $13.7 million in the quarter. This compares to net cash provided of $55.5 million in the second quarter of last year. This $69 million year-over-year net decrease primarily reflects the return of $89.8 million of cash previously withheld from CIT related to the arbitration settlement. This return of cash, combined with the funding of higher inventory levels and new loans originated by Snap-on Credit, were partially offset by higher net earnings. Similarly, our quarter-end cash position of $418 million decreased $154 million from year-end levels, primarily due to the funding of new loans originated by Snap-on Credit, the return of cash to CIT and increased levels of working investment in capital expenditures, partially offset by higher levels of net earnings in 2011. 
Free cash flow from Financial Services was, as expected, a negative $116 million, primarily due to the return of cash to CIT and the continued funding of new loan originations at Snap-on Credit. Free cash flow from the operating company was a positive $82 million. Capital expenditures totaled $14.7 million in the quarter. 
As seen on Slide 13, day sales outstanding for trade receivables of 59 days at quarter end improved from 61 days at both first quarter and 2010 year end. Inventories increased $63 million from year end, primarily to support increased customer demand and to mitigate supply-chain disruption from both the recent natural disasters in Japan and the consolidation of our North American tool storage operations. 
Currency translation also contributed $12.9 million of the inventory increase. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 4.3x compared to 4.4x at the end of Q1 and 4.7x at 2010 year end, reflective of the higher inventory. Our net debt-to-capital ratio 32.4% compares to the 30.1% at 2010 year end and 28.3% last year. The year-over-year increase is primarily reflective of last December's $250 million bond issuance. 
In addition to our $418 million of cash and cash flow from operations, we have more than $600 million in available credit facilities, and our current A2P2 short-term credit rating allows us to access the commercial paper markets, should we choose to do so. As of second quarter end, no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities. This includes my remarks on our second quarter performance, and I'll now turn the call back over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?"

Opco [ph] by 140 basis point and the overall company by 320 basis points. 
And again this quarter, we're demonstrating progress along our strategic runways for coherent growth. The van network has been enhanced. Cash collections are up, turnovers down and Snap-on was named the top industrial franchise by Franchise Direct. We had expanded in the repair garage. Our liner sales continue their upward trend, and our big-ticket diagnostics are increasing their penetration. The Snap-on presence is expanding further in critical industries. Sales continue to grow significantly in sectors like aerospace and natural resources, and our presence in emerging markets keeps building. Our growth in China, India and Indonesia confirm the opportunities. So that's our quarter, more evidence that Snap-on has considerable strength, capabilities and position. It has much more runway for growth and improvement, and as it embarked firmly on the path that we believe will continue our progress for some time to come.

So we find that to be pretty good for us, and that's quite manageable. One of the problems with turnover is it could become very expensive. But at this level, we have the ability to manage it quite well. The way we see this is that we've invested all through the recession and try to help our franchisees in terms of continuous improvement, the productivity on their van, in terms of upgrading their system and in terms of giving them access to other opportunities like more efficient ways to ensure they're advanced, more efficient ways to communicate more, better ways to manage their vans from a fuel consumption point of view. And we see all that coming through in these numbers. Now in terms of the van side, I think the numbers are somewhere just south of 3,500. That's been growing gradually. I want to say on a year-over-year basis, single digits. So it's been moving upwards but not at a large pace, but it's been very stable."

The first thing is, if you're thinking about the short term and you want to extrapolate off of this, I think what have to think of for Snap-on, of course, for the Tools Group and for our business, in general, is the second quarter is a good strong quarter for us. The third quarter is always uncertain. We have in the Tools Group the van drivers will take time off. They have to go on vacation sometimes. They usually go on the third quarter, and we put the Snap-on Franchisee Conference in that period. So if you're looking at the short term, I don't think you can extrapolate from second quarter onto the third quarter. You have to get that effect in the Tools Group, and you have the effect in Europe of vacations which are always, in my experience, of indeterminate length depending on the year in Europe. So you have in the short term. In the longer term, we feel very positive about our position in the Tools Group. I don't know if you can extrapolate off the 15.5%. In the past, we have said that our target for operating margins for the entire corporation is around mid-teens, and we thought the Tools Group would approach that. In this second quarter, it got above that number. It started to go into the back end, the back half of that number. I don't know what you can make out of one quarter. But having said that, we feel very good about where the Tools business is today. That's not being driven by necessarily an extraordinarily rich mix of the business. It's simply being driven by RCI, by good strong sales, by our ability to price against inflation, which we said before, and a combination of those things. And together with, I suppose, you could say robust sales of big-ticket items like diagnostics and tool storage. So I think you could look at the Tools Group second quarter and say, ""Wow, that is an extraordinary quarter. They have been selling on -- they are operating on all cylinders. They probably have gained some share, if you look at their growth in this situation. They've got good growth, and they're performing well and the mix is very robust.” I don't know if you can extrapolate from that number."

But that will all work itself out, as we know the Japanese do, they're very ingenious and so on and so. We think Japan comes back from its current malaise, I don't know it will go back to prerecession levels or not, but you'll certainly see recovery. So I think that fixes itself out toward the back of the year. If you're talking about the military, I don't know where the government goes, but the comparisons get easier year-over-year. So when you're talking about a growth scenario that looks like we have managed over, at least, through this quarter, maybe another quarter, the worst of that, and we'll start building from a base. I have given up predicting Spain. Because I think, I would have said a year ago that Spain's got to get better. We believe we're not losing market share, but the Spanish market was down again, and I think what you're seeing is, if you just pick up a newspaper and read about it, you can see the roots of that across Southern Europe. And so, that's how I see C&I. Good strong double-digit growth happening just like we thought it would. Three concentrated areas of headwinds, 2 of which we think dissipate as we go through the year in the third and fourth quarter, varying time constants. And Spain, I'm not so sure. We're confident it's going to come back, but I can't predict the timing."

Well, I would characterize our third quarter as an extension of the broad progress that we're making for quite some time.

Well, I would characterize our third quarter as an extension of the broad progress that we're making for quite some time. Having said that, the continuing trend is especially encouraging in light of the generally negative macroeconomic news we seem to be hearing almost every day. Overall, our sales in the quarter were up 6.8%. Excluding currency, organic volumes increased 3.6%. Now last year's third quarter did create some tough year-over-year optics, because we were in the midst of a fairly robust recovery, and there really wasn't any of the normal 5% seasonal sequential decline we usually see in the third quarter. 
From that perspective, this year's sequential downtick of 3.5% was a bit better then usual. So this period's volume is a positive indicator. Operating income for the quarter rose by over 37%, and our operating margin of 15.8% was up from 12.5% last year. Now those numbers include $15.8 million in higher earnings from Financial Services, and that's the result of a continuing ramp up of our book portfolio. 
Looking at the results before Financial Services. The third quarter operating margin of 13.5% was up 140 basis points, in part aided by that favorable mark-to-market adjustments highlighted in our release. But even excluding those adjustments,
Opco operating income in the period represents a new record high for Snap-on third quarter. 
We believe the advancements we're making a great testimony to the effectiveness of Snap-on Value Creation Processes, the principles and process we apply everyday in moving the company forward, safety, quality, customer connection innovation, Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI. It's that framework that enables our progress and is driving our strong profitability. 
As usual, I'll now review some of the highlights for the quarter, provide my perspective on the market environment and offer a view on the strategic areas we've identified as being decisive for our future, extending to critical industries building an emerging markets enhancing the franchise network and expanding in the garage.
The overall environment. I'll just comment that based our various businesses, it can be characterized as generally unchanged from the past several quarters. I view that as a real positive, because if you pick up the paper or watch the news on any given day, you'll get the feeling that has been a decided turn for the worst. But we've just not seen it. That said, I do think the well-documented troubles in Europe are creating a bit more uncertainty, and therefore, less visibility. But we had a high level of European uncertainty as well as a headwind in Southern Europe for quite a while, and we've managed through it by taking advantage in other prices where opportunities are expanding like in emerging markets and in critical interest and in automotive repair. So there is some uncertainty as there has been for some time. But we're not seeing any overriding downturn. Probably the best summary measure I can give you is this. In the third quarter, our volumes, excluding the effective currency movements, were above the third quarter levels of both 2007 and 2008, the strongest periods before the recession took hold. That same comparison for the first 2 quarters of this year showed 2011 slightly below those earlier year levels. So recapture a pre-recession level, the measure of recovery moments, our third quarter was another favorable data point, and it occurred despite the bad news all over the press.
Moving to the highlights of the operating segments. The Commercial and Industrial Group sales increased 6.6%, that's 2.6% organic growth excluding currency. The operating margin was 10.6%, a 20 basis point improvement from the second quarter, but down from the 11.7% last year, reflecting the concentration of our major headwinds in this segment, the weakness in Southern Europe as well as contracted military spending. These challenges primarily impact the C&I Group where SNA Europe had a strong position in Spain and Portugal and where our Industrial division has felt the impact of the reduced military spending. 
In the balance of this C&I Group, outside of the specific areas, volumes were actually up a moral robustly, both 8% organically. Those gains reflect the progress being made in our primary areas of C&I strategic focus, building our presence in emerging markets and extending into critical industries. 
Speaking of emerging markets, the case to be excess of any related GDP growth rate, and the expansion isn't just limited to Asia-Pac or posting significant gains in the emerging European regions. Places like Russia and Turkey are growing rapidly. I guess when you say emerging markets, the focus is most of is in Asia, the discussion is Asia. And we did see exceptionally strong base across that region as well, in places like India, in Indonesia, and, of course, in China. We're investing continuously in the region and it's paying off with growing position. 
In that regard, our Asian products offering is expanding. Outliners, in particular, has been ramping up and rolling out over the past few quarters. And actually I would expect this is a product that will specifically designed for Asia, and coupled with our new Asian Diagnostic Products, which I discussed last quarter, we're not only driving growth in the region but we're building a strong presence as the repair wage is just rising in China. We said all along that will continue to invest in those areas that are strategically important. And we're doing just that in China. When the process of building a new engineering and R&D center in that country, it will be state-of-the-art, it will support a wide range of Asian ice products and will help continue our rapid growth all over the region. In addition to emerging markets, we're also building our position in critical industries. Our aviation space sales served to our Industrial division grew strongly in the quarter. I've spoken about our ever-expanding offering for those customers, while we're highlighting that broader array of products with what we call our advanced technology list. These are large trucks, loaded with aviation offering, just under a aviation offering, traveling sites to sites to assembly plants, to hangers and the maintenance and repair and overhaul locations. We find it to be a great way demonstrate the product right in the workplace and it's helped to drive our growth every month were getting orders from your customers were to control systems, toolkits, for flight lines, for assembly operations and for those MRO facilities. Importantly, as you would expect, our position is improving across the globe here. Aviation is an industry is a growing international. It's certainly critical and it's right in the Snap-on wheelhouse.
On to the Tools Group where sales were up 8.1%, including about 2 points from currency. The operating margin of 12.7% was an increase of 180 basis points from last year. The Tools Group is where we serve professional automotive technicians and they value Snap-on. That fact was recently highlighted, once again, by -- as we came up on top in Frost & Sullivan survey of technicians, brands of preferences in hand tools, diagnostics, tool storage, power tools and pneumatic air tools. We always distance ourselves from the competition by wide margins in the survey, but this year's results show Snap-on even further in lead with record levels of the professional technicians choosing Snap-on in several of those categories. For example, in hand tools, 75% of technicians surveyed preferred Snap-on. The next Slide, please, only 8%. Now with that sort of position, it's no wonder that our franchise network is strong. Volumes in the third become for our franchises were very robust. And our franchisee help metrics, which we closely monitor continued their favorable trend. 
The Snap-on franchise e-conference, which was held in August provided more evidence of progress in strengthening our franchise systems, another one of our primary strategic objectives, strengthening that system. This conference was quite a success, record participation in higher than ever product ordering activity. And aside from the metrics and the sales level, the enthusiasm, the enthusiasm on display was considerable and contagious. All of this is testimony that our network is well-positioned and moving in the right direction.
Now for the Repair System Information segment or the RS&I Group. Sales were up 7.3% or 4.7% without the favorable effect of currency. The gains were somewhat muted by the returns to a more typical seasonal decline in our undercar equipment business, which had been a particularly strong in the third quarter of 2010. The RS&I operating margin of 19.6% remained very strong, but was down from last year's level of, I think, 20.1%, mainly due to growth in our facilitation business that serves OEM dealerships. That lower margin activity was up strongly as OEMs continue to commit to additional essential tools in diagnostic programs throughout the U.S. and in Europe. One of the highlights of RS&I for the third quarter was the launch of our soulless Ultra, a new full function handheld diagnostic unit. We introduced it at the August franchisee conference, and it made a big splash. It offers a real advance, advancements, ease-of-use, functionality, starting with a faster boot-up and a battery that charge directed from the vehicle so never-ending worries about power availability. It also have a keyless adapter that makes connections to the vehicle much easier. And it has a high-resolution graphing on a touch screen that is 50% larger than the competition. This tool is always ready to be used with improve this intensity and productivity and is helping support the strong results in our RS&I. 
I mentioned earlier that the Equipment division returned to its normal seasonality in the third quarter, and that characterization is driven but the fact the Snap-on has a strong position in the European equipment market, where summers, it tend to be a bit slower. Our undercard equipment line up in fact is where we're seeing some strong international expansion. I already mentioned the liners in my discussion of Asian growth, but we're seeing the same kind of thing in Brazil and in the emerging markets of Eastern Europe. We're posting solid gains in those areas. Our equipment lineup is instrumental in advancing us along 2 of our strategic runways, expanding in the garage and building in emerging markets with reading technologies that does provide a real advantage. An example of one recently new product in this area just being launched in Europe is our new 2000 diagnostic wheel balancer. It's already getting considerable attention and winning innovation awards right out of the blocks. We've taken our patented imaging technology to analyzing the interaction between the wheel and the suspension system, so this new unit predicts and will head off any vibrations, all in just a few spins of the wheel, achieving a balance quicker than ever before. 
The RV 2000 also laser-maps the side wall and the wheel and the tire trick, providing a picture of the actual and predicted tire wear heading off any future problems. That's a feature that's going to be valued by shop owners everywhere on their league car owners. 
So that's some of the highlights in each of the operating units, and while I just mentioned some of the new products in the RS&I Group, let me expand that discussion a bit as it relates to the entire corporation and to the Snap-on Value Creation Processes. Two of the tenets embedded in this framework are innovation and customer connection. We have a great legacy in both those areas. And we believe a huge advantage in a number of customer interactions that our people whether they're franchisees or associates, have with professional users, those actually benefit from our productivity enhancing tools. That customer connection gives us great insight for developing new products. So not only do professionals prefer Snap-on, as evidenced by the survey data, but we're using that strong customer connection to make sure our product line just keeps getting better with new innovative offerings that customers greatly value. 
Just recently, we were honored to have won 2 motor magazines of Top 20 Tool awards. These awards recognize products that will help make the jobs of technicians and shop owners easier, enabling them to perform vehicle repair more accurately and more quickly. One of the winning products was the RSV 2000 that I already mentioned. The other was the VERDICT diagnostics and information systems, a modular handheld unit that includes a touch screen and wirelessly connects to the vehicle. It also includes Wi-Fi access and Windows multitasking so that technician can access the more information, including our Mitchell shot repair information system, and they can do it from anywhere in the garage. I've spoken about this product in the past, and I think at that time I told you was a great innovation. Well, this award confirms that fact. As further testimony to the effectiveness of customer connection in our innovation processes, Snap-on was also named winner of 4 innovation awards by Professional Tool Equipment News. Our products were voted the best in tool storage, the best in list, the best in shop equipment and the best in tool accessories. The importance of this recognition is that judges are professionals, people that make their living using these very products, independent shop owners and skilled technicians. In that regard, these awards speak strongly not only to Snap-on product innovations, but to our strong connection to our customers. It's a unique Snap-on advantage, and it's paying dividends. 
So that's our third quarter. Encouraging financial, clear evidence of strategic progress and a strong pipeline full of new and exciting products. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo for more detailed -- more detail on the financials. Aldo?"

Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales in the third quarter of $697.2 million increased $44.1 million or 6.8% year-over-year. Excluding favorable currency translation of $19.6 million, organic sales increased",1795,"Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales in the third quarter of $697.2 million increased $44.1 million or 6.8% year-over-year. Excluding favorable currency translation of $19.6 million, organic sales increased 3.6% as we realized year-over-year sales growth across the majority of our businesses. Continued sales increases in Snap-on Tools Group, higher essential tool and facilitated programs sales to OEM dealerships, expansion in emerging markets and growth to a wide range of customers in critical industries, more than offset anticipated lower sales for the military and across Southern Europe. As Nick also noted, the sales level refund return to more traditional seasonal pattern that we typically experience lower sequential sales of moving from the second quarter to the third quarter. This seasonal pattern was largely absent 2010 as the economy was rebounding from 2009 recession levels. Consolidated gross profit of $329.3 million in the quarter increased $28.1 million from 2010 levels, refighting contributions from higher sales, $9.5 million of favorable foreign currency effects, savings from our ongoing cost-reduction and rapid continuous improvements or RCI initiatives and $1 million of lower restructuring cost. Consolidated gross margin of 47.2% in the quarter improved 110 basis points from 46.1% last year. 
Operating expenses in the quarter of $235 million increased $4.6 million from 2010 levels. The year-over-year operating expense increase includes volume-related and other costs as well as $5.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, $3.1 million of expected higher pension expense, $2.6 million of increased performance-based compensation expense and $1.8 million of higher restructuring costs. As noted in our earnings release, mark-to-market adjustments on stock-based compensation, which are calculated on the quarter ending stock price, also benefited third quarter results. The change in Snap-on's period-end stock price resulted in a benefit of $7.8 million or $0.09 per diluted share in the quarter. And while we always have some impact from mark-to-market in our results, recent stock market declined resulted in the significant third quarter benefits. Similarly, should the price of Snap-on stock appreciate during a given quarter, we would incur mark-to-market expense. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses in the quarter of 33.7% improved 30 basis points from 34% last year. So from a restructuring cost of $2.9 million in the quarter compared to $2.1 million last year. 
Operating earnings from Financial Services of $20.8 million improved $15.8 million from third quarter 2010 levels. As expected, Financial Services' operating earnings continues to grow as our unbooked Finance portfolio grows. Consolidated operating earnings of $115.1 million or 15.8% of total revenues increased 330 basis points from 12.5% a year ago, with mark-to-market contributing 110 basis points. Interest expense of $15.1 million in the quarter increased $1.6 million from 2010 levels primarily due to higher average debt levels to fund the growth in our contract portfolio in Snap-on credit, partially offset by lower average interest rates. 
Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 31.7% was lower than last year's 34.4% rate, primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters. Finally, third quarter net earnings of earnings per share of $67.8 million or $1.16 per diluted share increased $21.3 million or 45.8% from last year's levels. Even without the $0.09 of benefit from mark-to-market, these net earnings and earnings per share represents an all-time third quarter record. Now let's turn to our segment results.
Starting with the Commercial and Industrial, C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $278.3 million for the third quarter improved a 6.6% from 2010 levels. Excluding currency translation, sales rose 2.6%. C&I benefited from double-digit gains in both Asia and Eastern Europe. These year-over-year sales to wide range of customers in emerging markets as well as critical industries were partially offset by expected lower sales to the military and ongoing weakness across Southern Europe. Gross profit of $102.8 million in the quarter increased $6.6 million or 6.9% from 2010 levels, primarily due to higher sales, $2.9 million and of favorable foreign currency effects and a $1.2 million of a lower restructuring costs. Gross margin of 36.9% in the quarter improved slightly from 36.8% last year. Operating expenses of $73.2 million in the quarter were up $7.6 million from 2010 levels, primarily due to the volume related and other expenses, $2.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects and a $1.8 million of higher restructuring costs, largely for the ongoing optimization of our cost structure in Europe. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 26.3% in the quarter compared to 25.1% last year. Third quarter operating earnings of $29.6 million for this C&I segment declined $1 million from 2010 levels, largely due to overall higher restructuring costs. As a percentage of sales, operating margin of 10.6% in the C&I segment compared with 11.7% last year.
Turning now to Slide 8. Third quarter sales of the Snap-on Tools Group improved $20.9 million or 8.1% year-over-year, largely due to continued higher sales in the U.S. And our organic basis, sales were up 6%. Gross profit in the Snap-on Tools Group of $125.2 million in the quarter increased $17.5 million from last year's levels, primarily due to higher sales across several product categories, favorable manufacturing utilization and $4.8 million of favorable currency effects. As a percentage of sales, gross margin of 44.8% in the Snap-on Tools Group, improved 320 basis points from 41.6% last year. Operating expenses of $89.6 million in the quarter increased $10.1 million from 2010 levels, primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses including higher cost as a result of increased participation at the Annual Snap-on Franchisee Conference and a $1.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 32.1% in the quarter compared with 30.7% last year. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $35.6 million in the quarter increased $7.4 million or 26.2% from the $28.2 million earned last year. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings of 12.7% in the quarter increased 180 basis points from 10.9% last year.
Turning to the Repair Systems and Information or RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Third quarter sales of the $222.6 million increased 7.3% year-over-year. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased 4.7%, primarily due to higher sales in our Equipment Solutions business, which facilitates essential tool programs for OEMs. Gross profit of $101.3 million in the quarter increased $4 million from prior year levels, primarily due to higher sales and $1.8 million of favorable foreign currency effects. Gross margin of 45.5% in the quarter declined 140 basis points from 2010 levels, largely reflecting the growth in essential tools facilities and probe of sales to OEM dealerships which yields a relatively lower gross margins. Operating expenses of $57.6 million in the quarter increased $2 million from 2010 levels, primarily due to $1.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects and higher volume-related expenses, partially offset by savings from ongoing RCI initiatives. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 25.9%, improved 90 basis points from 26.8% last year. Operating earnings of $43.7 million for the RS&I Group increase of $2 million or 4.8% from 2010 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating margin of 19.6% compared to 20.1% last year.
Now turning to Slide 10. Third quarter operating earnings from Financial Services was $20.8 million on revenue of $32.7 million. This compares with operating earnings of $5 million or $17.2 million in revenue last year. We believe the $15.8 million year-over-year increase in operating earnings, demonstrates the earnings potential of our growing and booked Finance portfolio. Originations of $153 million in the quarter rose 7.2% compared to last year's levels, reflecting both higher sales in our Snap-on tools segment and increased participation in our credit programs. 
Moving to Slide 11. As of third quarter end, our balance sheet includes $896 million of gross financing receivables, including $751 million from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operations. In the U.S., $609 million or 81% of the financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. Since the beginning of 2011, our unbooked financing portfolio has grown over $160 million. For the remainder of the year, we expect that our unbooked finance portfolio will roughly increase an additional $20 million and $25 million. The pace of the portfolios on the balance sheet development continues as expected and naturally decelerates as the transition progresses. For 2012, we would expect any further expansion of the Snap-on credit portfolio to largely reflect the activity in the Snap-on Tools Group. Regarding finance portfolio of losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations.
Now turning to Slide 12. Net cash provided by operating activities was $42 million in the quarter. This compares to net cash provided of $10.2 million last year. Our quarter end cash position of $186 million decreased $386 million from year-end levels, primarily due to the August repayment of $200 million of long-term notes, continued funding for new loans originated by Snap-on Credit and the previously disclosed second quarter repayment of amounts previously withheld since the GIP. 
As expected, free cash flow from Financial Services in the quarter was a negative $42 million, reflecting the continued funding of new loan originations at Snap-on Credit. Free cash flow from the operating company was a positive $35 million. Capital expenditures totaled $13.3 million in the quarter. 
As seen on Slide 13, days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 58 days at quarter end improved from 61 days at 2010 year end. Inventories increased $70 million from year-end levels, primarily to support higher demand and seasonal inventory builds, mitigate potential supply chain disruptions and to improve customer service levels. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 4.1x compared to 4.7x at 2010 year-end, reflective of the higher inventory. 
Our net debt to capital ratio of 33.8% compares to 30.1% in 2010 year-end and 29.2% last year. The year-over-year increase results primarily from last December's $250 million of bond issuance, net of this quarter's $200 million debt repayment in the second quarter repayment to CID. In addition to our $186 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, including $200 million under our recently amended loan and servicing agreement. In addition, our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets should we choose to do so. As of third quarter end, no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities. 
During the quarter, Fitch initiated credit ratings on Snap-on of A minus and F2, which is in addition to our existing ratings of A minus and A2 from S&P and PAA 1 and P2 for Moody's. This concludes my remarks in our third quarter performance, and I'll now turn the call back over to Nick for his closing thoughts."

Well, that's our quarter. Sales positive from a sequential perspective. And for the vantage point of capturing pre-recession levels, the volumes represent another step forward, better than either our 2007 or 2008 third quarter activity. From a profit view, the adjustments that helped, but even excluding those effects, both opco operating income and our EPS in the period versus record high profits for Snap-on third quarter. 
Regarding environment. It was a third quarter, and as I have said in the past, there is considerable variation on third quarters due to vacations. On balance however, looking at our overall results, it appears that just the same headwinds are in place, but the positive trends are continuing, despite the bad news we get everyday in the press. While our results don't indicate deterioration, the difficult macros, difficult macroeconomic bulletin do create some limits to our forward visibility, I think it's fair to say. But having said that, I'm confident that the advantage and strengths we bring to any environment, the Snap-on Value Creation Process generates improvement in good times and in challenging times. Our runways for growth enhancing the network, expanding in the repair garage, extending the critical industry and building in emerging markets, they remain attracted and they generated returns on our investments and on our energy for multiple quarters now. And we're fully confident will provide the same strong opportunities as we go forward to the days and the quarters and the years ahead. Before I finish though, I want to once again speak directly to our associates and franchisees around the world. I know many of you are listening or will replay this call later.

Now I want to emphasize that I've said 4% to 6% kind of an annual over time basis, I'm just saying you can do every single quarter, but I think if you look at those numbers, capturing more technicians through the efficiency in advance, extending out in the critical industries, which are places we haven't gone before, which is kind of like share capture, building in emerging markets, where the wave is still rising and getting into the garage a little bit more by offering more products. I think those places right above the specific GDP numbers. Now if everything crashes, and we have a really terrible situation like people are talking about the banks will hold up and everybody's worried about putting money in their mattresses or something, then that's a different situation. If you just talk about slow growth, we feel okay."

Well, I would characterize our third quarter as an extension of the broad progress that we're making for quite some time.

Well, I would characterize our third quarter as an extension of the broad progress that we're making for quite some time. I would say that the continuing trend is especially encouraging in light of the generally negative macroeconomic news we seem to be hearing almost every day. Overall, our sales in the quarter were up 6.8%. Excluding currency, organic volumes increased 3.6%. Now last year's third quarter did create some tough year-over-year optics, because we were in the midst of a fairly robust recovery, and there really wasn't any of the normal 5% seasonal sequential decline we usually see in the third quarter. 
From that perspective, this year's sequential downtick of 3.5% was a bit better then usual. So this period's volume is a positive indicator. Operating income for the quarter rose by over 37%, and our operating margin of 15.8% was up from 12.5% last year. Now those numbers include $15.8 million in higher earnings from Financial Services, and that's the result of the continuing ramp up of our on-book portfolio. 
Looking at the results before Financial Services. The third quarter operating margin of 13.5% was up 140 basis points, in part aided by that favorable mark-to-market adjustments highlighted in our release. But even excluding those adjustments,
Opco operating income in the period represents a new record high for Snap-on third quarter. 
We believe the advancements we're making a great testimony to the effectiveness of the Snap-on Value Creation Processes, the principles and processes we apply everyday in moving the company forward: safety, quality, customer connection, innovation, Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI. It's that framework that enables our progress and it's driving our strong profitability. 
As usual, I'll now review some of the highlights for the quarter, provide my perspective on the market environment and offer a view on the strategic areas we've identified as being decisive for our future, extending to critical industries, building in emerging markets, enhancing the franchise network and expanding in the garage.
Regarding overall environment, I'll just comment that based on our various businesses, it can be characterized as generally unchanged from the past several quarters. I view that as a real positive, because if you pick up the paper or watch the news on any given day, you'll get the feeling that there's been a decided turn for the worst, but we've just not seen it. That said, I do think the well-documented troubles in Europe are creating a bit more uncertainty, and therefore, less visibility. But we had a high level of European uncertainty as well as a headwind in Southern Europe for quite a while, and we've managed through it by taking advantage in other places where opportunities are expanding like in emerging markets and in critical industries and in automotive repair. So there is some uncertainty as there has been for some time. But we're not seeing any overriding downturn. 
Probably the best summary measure I can give you is this. In the third quarter, our volumes, excluding the effect of currency movements, were above the third quarter levels of both 2007 and 2008, the strongest periods before the recession took hold. That same comparison for the first 2 quarters of this year showed 2011 slightly below those earlier year levels. So recapture of pre-recession level is your measure of recovery momentum, our third quarter was another favorable data point, and it occurred despite the bad news all over the press.
Moving to the highlights of the operating segments. The Commercial & Industrial Group sales increased 6.6%, that's 2.6% organic growth excluding currency. The operating margin was 10.6%, a 20 basis point improvement from the second quarter, but down from the 11.7% last year, reflecting the concentration of our major headwinds in this segment, the weakness in Southern Europe as well as contracted military spending. These challenges primarily impact the C&I Group where SNA Europe has a strong position in Spain and Portugal and where our Industrial division has felt the impact of the reduced military spending. 
In the balance of the C&I Group, outside of those specific areas, volumes were actually up much more robustly, about 8% organically. Those gains reflect the progress being made in our primary areas of C&I strategic focus, building our presence in emerging markets and extending into critical industries. 
Speaking of emerging markets, the gains continue to be far in excess of any related GDP growth rate, and the expansion isn't just limited to Asia or posting significant gains in the emerging European regions. Places like Russia and Turkey are growing rapidly. I guess, when you say emerging markets, the focus is most of on Asia, the discussion is Asia. And we did see exceptionally strong gains across that region as well, in places like India, in Indonesia, and, of course, in China. We're investing continuously in the region and it's paying off with growing position. 
In that regard, our Asian product offering is expanding. Our Undercar Equipment lineup, aligners in particular has been ramping up and rolling out over the past few quarters. And actually, I would expect this is a product that is specifically designed for Asia, and coupled with our new Asian Diagnostic Products, which I discussed last quarter, we're not only driving growth in the region but we're building a strong presence as the repair wave is just rising in China. We said all along that we'll continue to invest in those areas that are strategically important. And we're doing just that in China. We're in the process of building a new engineering and R&D center in that country. It will be state-of-the-art, it will support a wide range of Asian ice product, it will help continue our rapid growth all over the region. In addition to emerging markets, we're also building our position in critical industries. Our Aviation & Aerospace sales served to our Industrial division grew strongly in the quarter. I've spoken about our ever-expanding offering for those customers, while we're highlighting that broadened array of products with what we call our Advanced Technologies Labs. These are large trucks, loaded with aviation offering, trav -- with our aviation offering, traveling site to site to assembly plants, to hangars and to maintenance and repair and overhaul locations. We find it to be a great way to demonstrate the product right in the workplace and it's helping drive our growth. Every month, we're getting orders from new customers for tool control systems, toolkits, for flight lines, for assembly operations and for those MRO facilities. Importantly, as you would expect, our position is improving across the globe here. Aviation is an industry that is growing internationally. It's certainly critical and it's right in the Snap-on wheelhouse. 
On to the Tools Group, where sales were up 8.1%, including about 2 points from currency. The operating margin of 12.7% was an increase of 180 basis points from last year. The Tools Group is where we serve professional automotive technicians and they value Snap-on. The fact was recently highlighted, once again, by -- as we came out on top in Frost & Sullivan survey of technicians, brand preferences in hand tools, diagnostics tools storage, power tools and pneumatic air tools. We always distance ourselves from the competition by wide margins in the survey, but this year's results show Snap-on even further in the lead with record levels of professional technicians choosing Snap-on in several of those categories. For example, in hand tools, 75% of technicians surveyed preferred Snap-on. 
The next highest brand registered only 8%. Now with that sort of position, it's no wonder that our franchise network is strong. Volumes in the third for our franchisees were very robust. And the franchisee help metrics, which we closely monitor continue their favorable trend. 
The Snap-on Franchisee Conference, which was held in August provided more evidence of progress in strengthening our franchise system. Another one of our primary strategic objective is strengthening that system. This conference was quite a success, record participation in higher-than-ever product ordering activity. And aside from the metrics and the sales levels, the enthusiasm, the enthusiasm on display was considerable and contagious. All of this is testimony that our network is well-positioned and moving in the right direction.
Now for the Repair System Information segment or the RS&I Group. Sales were up 7.3% or 4.7% without the favorable effect of currency. The gains were somewhat muted by the return to a more typical seasonal decline in our Undercar Equipment business, which had been a particularly strong in the third quarter of 2010. The RS&I operating margin of 19.6% remained very strong, but was down from last year's level of, I think, 20.1%, mainly due to growth in our Facilitation business that serves OEM dealerships. That lower margin activity was up strongly as OEMs continue to commit to additional essential tools in diagnostic programs throughout the U.S. and in Europe. One of the highlights of RS&I for the third quarter was the launch of our SOLUS Ultra, a new full-function hand held diagnostic unit. We introduced it at the August Franchisee Conference and it made a big splash. It will offer some real advancements, ease-of-use, functionality, starting with the faster boot-up and a battery that charge directly from the vehicle so never any worries about power availability. It also have a keyless adapter that makes connections to the vehicle much easier. And it has high-resolution graphing on a touch screen that is 50% larger than the competition. This tool is always ready to be used with improved simplicity and productivity and is helping support the strong results in RS&I. 
I mentioned earlier that the Equipment division returned to its normal seasonality in the third quarter, and that counterization is driven by the fact that Snap-on has a strong position in the European equipment market, where summers tend to be a bit slower. Our Undercar Equipment lineup in fact is where we're seeing some strong international expansion. I already mentioned the liners in my discussion of Asian growth, but we're seeing the same kind of thing in Brazil and in the emerging markets of Eastern Europe. We're posting solid gains in those areas. Our equipment lineup is instrumental in advancing us along 2 of our strategic runways, expanding in the garage and building in emerging markets with leading technologies that does provide a real advantage. An example of one recent new product in this area, just being launched in Europe, is our new RFV 2000 diagnostic wheel balancer. So already getting considerable attention and winning innovation awards right out of the blocks. We've taken our patented imaging technology to analyze the interaction between the wheel and the suspension system, so this new unit predicts and will head off any vibrations, all in just a few spins of the wheel, achieving a balance quicker than ever before. 
The RFV 2000 also laser maps the side wall and the wheel and the tire tread providing a picture of the actual and predicted tire wear, heading off any future problems. That's a feature that's going to be valued by shop owners everywhere when their dealing with car owners. 
So that's some of the highlights in each of the operating units, and while I just mentioned some of the new products in the RS&I Group, let me expand that discussion a bit as it relates to the entire corporation and to the Snap-on Value Creation Processes. Two of the tenets embedded in this framework are innovation and customer connection. We have a great legacy in both those areas. And we believe a huge advantage in a number of customer interactions that our people, whether they're franchisees or associates, have with professional users, those who actually benefit from our productivity enhancing tools. That customer connection gives us great insight for developing new products. So not only do professionals prefer Snap-on as evidenced by the survey data, but we're using that strong customer connection to make sure our product line just keeps getting better with new innovative offering that customers greatly value. 
Just recently, we were honored to have won 2 MOTOR Magazine Top 20 Tool Award. These awards recognize products that will help make the jobs of technicians and shop owners easier, enabling them to perform vehicle repair more accurately and more quickly. One of the winning products was the RFV 2000 that I already mentioned. The other was the VERDICT diagnostics and information systems, a modular hand held unit that includes a touch screen and wirelessly connects to the vehicle. It also includes Wi-Fi access and Windows multitasking so that technicians can access more information, including our Mitchell 1 shop key repair information system, and they can do it from anywhere in the garage. I've spoken about this product in the past, I think at that time, I told you was a great innovation. Well, this award confirms that fact. As further testimony to the effectiveness of customer connection and our innovation processes, Snap-on was also named winner of 4 innovation awards by Professional Tool & Equipment News. Our products were voted the best in tool storage, the best in list, the best in shop equipment and the best in tool accessories. The importance of this recognition is that judges are professionals, people that make their living using these very products, independent shop owners and skilled technicians. In that regard, these awards speak strongly not only to Snap-on product innovations, but to our strong connection to our customers. It's a unique Snap-on advantage, and it's paying dividends. 
So that's our third quarter. Encouraging financials, clear evidence of strategic progress and a strong pipeline full of new and exciting products. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo for more detailed -- more detail on the financials. Aldo?"

Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales in the third quarter of $697.2 million increased $44.1 million or 6.8% year-over-year. Excluding favorable currency translation of $19.6 million, organic sales increased",1789,"Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales in the third quarter of $697.2 million increased $44.1 million or 6.8% year-over-year. Excluding favorable currency translation of $19.6 million, organic sales increased 3.6% as we realized year-over-year sales growth across the majority of our businesses. Continued sales increases in the Snap-on Tools Group, higher essential tool and facilitation program sales to OEM dealerships, expansion in emerging markets and growth to a wide range of customers in critical industries, more than offset anticipated lower sales for the military and across Southern Europe. As Nick also noted, the sales level refund return to a more traditional seasonal pattern where we typically experience lower sequential sales moving from the second quarter to the third quarter. This seasonal pattern was largely absent in 2010 as the economy was rebounding from 2009 recession levels. Consolidated gross profit of $329.3 million in the quarter increased $28.1 million from 2010 levels, reflecting contributions from higher sales, $9.5 million of favorable foreign currency effects, savings from our ongoing cost-reduction and rapid continuous improvements or RCI initiatives and $1 million of lower restructuring cost. Consolidated gross margin of 47.2% in the quarter improved 110 basis points from 46.1% last year. 
Operating expenses in the quarter of $235 million increased $12.6 million from 2010 levels. The year-over-year operating expense increase includes volume-related and other costs as well as $5.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, $3.1 million of expected higher pension expense, $2.6 million of increased performance-based compensation expense and $1.8 million of higher restructuring cost. As noted in our earnings release, mark-to-market adjustments on stock-based compensation, which are calculated on the quarter ending stock price, also benefited a third quarter results. The change in Snap-on's period-end stock price resulted in a benefit of $7.8 million or $0.09 per diluted share in the quarter. And while we always have some impact from mark-to-market in our results, recent stock market declined resulted in the significant third quarter declines benefits. Similarly, should the price of Snap-on stock appreciate during a given quarter, we would incur mark-to-market expense. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses in the quarter of 33.7% improved 30 basis points from 34% last year. From a restructuring cost of $2.9 million in the quarter compared to $2.1 million last year. 
Operating earnings from Financial Services of $20.8 million improved $15.8 million from third quarter 2010 levels. As expected, Financial Services' operating earnings continues to grow as our unbooked Finance portfolio grows. Consolidated operating earnings of $115.1 million or 15.8% of total revenues increased 330 basis points from 12.5% a year ago, with mark-to-market contributing 110 basis points. Interest expense of $15.1 million in the quarter increased $1.6 million from 2010 levels primarily due to higher average debt levels to fund the growth in our contract portfolio of Snap-on credit, partially offset by lower average interest rates. 
Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 31.7% was lower than last year's 34.4% rate, primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters. Finally, third quarter net earnings of earnings per share of $67.8 million or $1.16 per diluted share increased $21.3 million or 45.8% from last year's levels. Even without the $0.09 of benefit from mark-to-market, these net earnings and earnings per share represent an all-time third quarter record. Now let's turn to our segment results.
Starting with the Commercial & Industrial, or C&I Group, on Slide 7. Sales of $278.3 million for the third quarter improved 6.6% from 2010 levels. Excluding currency translation, sales rose 2.6%. C&I benefited from double-digit gains in both Asia and Eastern Europe. These higher year-over-year sales to a wide range of customers in emerging markets as well as critical industries were partially offset by expected lower sales to the military and ongoing weakness across Southern Europe. Gross profit of $102.8 million in the quarter increased $6.6 million or 6.9% from 2010 levels, primarily due to higher sales, $2.9 million and of favorable foreign currency effects and $1.2 million of a lower restructuring costs. Gross margin of 36.9% in the quarter improved slightly from 36.8% last year. Operating expenses of $73.2 million in the quarter were up $7.6 million from 2010 levels, primarily due to the volume related and other expenses, $2.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects and $1.8 million of higher restructuring costs, largely for the ongoing optimization of our cost structure in Europe. 
As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 26.3% in the quarter compared to 25.1% last year. Third quarter operating earnings of $29.6 million for this C&I segment declined $1 million from 2010 levels, largely due to overall higher restructuring costs. As a percentage of sales, operating margin of 10.6% in the C&I segment compared with 11.7% last year.
Turning now to Slide 8. Third quarter sales of the Snap-on Tools Group improved $20.9 million or 8.1% year-over-year, largely due to continued higher sales in the U.S. And our organic basis, sales were up 6%. Gross profit in the Snap-on Tools Group of $125.2 million in the quarter increased $17.5 million from last year's levels, primarily due to higher sales across several product categories, favorable manufacturing utilization and $4.8 million of favorable currency effects. As a percentage of sales, gross margin of 44.8% in the Snap-on Tools Group improved 320 basis points from 41.6% last year. Operating expenses of $89.6 million in the quarter increased $10.1 million from 2010 levels, primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses including higher cost as a result of increased participation at the Annual Snap-on Franchisee Conference and a $1.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 32.1% in the quarter compared with 30.7% last year. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $35.6 million in the quarter increased $7.4 million or 26.2% from the $28.2 million earned last year. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings of 12.7% in the quarter increased 180 basis points from 10.9% last year.
Turning to Repair Systems & Information or RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Third quarter sales of $222.6 million increased 7.3% year-over-year. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased 4.7%, primarily due to higher sales in our Equipment Solutions business, which facilitates essential tool programs for OEMs. Gross profit of $101.3 million in the quarter increased $4 million from prior year levels, primarily due to higher sales and $1.8 million of favorable foreign currency effects. Gross margin of 45.5% in the quarter declined 140 basis points from 2010 levels, largely reflecting the growth in essential tools facilities and probe of sales to OEM dealerships which yield a relatively lower gross margins. Operating expenses of $57.6 million in the quarter increased $2 million from 2010 levels, primarily due to $1.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects and higher volume-related expenses, partially offset by savings from ongoing RCI initiatives. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 25.9%, improved 90 basis points from 26.8% last year. Operating earnings of $43.7 million for the RS&I Group increased of $2 million or 4.8% from 2010 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating margin of 19.6% compared to 20.1% last year.
Now turning to Slide 10. Third quarter operating earnings from Financial Services was $20.8 million on revenue of $32.7 million. This compares with operating earnings of $5 million or $17.2 million of last year. We believe the $15.8 million year-over-year increase in operating earnings, demonstrates the earnings potential of our growing in booked Finance portfolio. Originations of $153 million in the quarter rose 7.2% compared to last year's levels, reflecting both higher sales in our Snap-on tools segment and increased participation in our credit programs. 
Moving to Slide 11. As of third quarter end, our balance sheet includes $896 million of gross financing receivables, including $751 million from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operations. In the U.S., $609 million or 81% of the financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. Since the beginning of 2011, our unbooked financing portfolio has grown over $160 million. For the remainder of the year, we expect that our unbooked finance portfolio will roughly increase an additional $20 million to $25 million. The pace of the portfolios on balance sheet development continues as expected and naturally decelerates as the transition progresses. For 2012, we would expect any further expansion of the Snap-on credit portfolio to largely reflect the activity in the Snap-on Tools Group. Regarding finance portfolio of losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations.
Now turning to Slide 12. Net cash provided by operating activities was $42 million in the quarter. This compares to net cash provided of $10.2 million last year. Our quarter end cash position of $186 million decreased $386 million from year-end levels, primarily due to the August repayment of $200 million of long-term notes, continued funding for new loans originated by Snap-on Credit and the previously disclosed second quarter repayment of amounts previously withheld from GIP. 
As expected, free cash flow from Financial Services in the quarter was a negative $42 million, reflecting the continued funding of new loan originations at Snap-on Credit. Free cash flow from the operating company was a positive $35 million. Capital expenditures totaled $13.3 million in the quarter. 
As seen on Slide 13, days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 58 days at quarter end improved from 61 days at 2010 year end. Inventories increased $70 million from year-end levels, primarily to support higher demand and seasonal inventory builds, mitigate potential supply chain disruption and to improve customer service levels. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 4.1x compared to 4.7x at 2010 year-end, reflective of the higher inventory. 
Our net debt to capital ratio of 33.8% compares to 30.1% at 2010 year-end and 29.2% last year. The year-over-year increase results primarily from last December's $250 million bond issuance, net of this quarter's $200 million debt repayment in the second quarter repayment to CITD. In addition to our $186 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, including $200 million under our recently amended loan and servicing agreement. In addition, our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets should we choose to do so. As of third quarter end, no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities. 
During the quarter, Fitch initiated credit ratings on Snap-on of A- and F2, which is in addition to our existing ratings of A- and A2 from S&P and Baa1 and P2 for Moody's. This concludes my remarks in our third quarter performance, and I'll now turn the call back over to Nick for his closing thoughts."

Well, that's our quarter. Sales positive from a sequential perspective. And for the vantage point of capturing pre-recession levels, the volumes represent another step forward, better than either our 2007 or our 2008 third quarter activity. From a profit view, there were adjustments that helped, but even excluding those effects, both OpCo operating income and our EPS in the period represent record high profits for Snap-on third quarter. 
Regarding the environment. It was a third quarter, and as I have said in the past, there is considerable variation on third quarters due to vacations. On balance, however, looking at our overall results, it appears that just the same headwinds are in place, but the positive trends are continuing despite the bad news we get everyday in the press. While our results don't indicate deterioration, the difficult macros, the difficult macroeconomic bulletin do create some limits to our forward visibility, I think that's fair to say. But having said that, I'm confident that the advantages and strengths we bring to any environment, the Snap-on Value Creation Process generates improvement in good times and in challenging times. Our runways for growth enhancing the network, expanding in the repair garage, extending the critical industry and building in emerging markets, they remain attractive and they generated returns on our investments and on our energy for multiple quarters now. And we're fully confident they'll provide the same strong opportunities as we go forward to the days and the quarters and the years ahead. Before I finish though, I want to once again speak directly to our associates and franchisees around the world. I know many of you are listening or will replay this call later. The Snap-on third quarter was another encouraging period. And we all know that our financial and strategic progress would not be possible without your effort.

And then dividends, where we feel pretty strongly that our dividends for perpetuity, because we've never -- we pay the dividend every year since 1939 and never reduce it. So we look at moving our dividend up, but it's always in the context that we're never going to move, it's permanent for us.

So I think we feel pretty good about that. Now I want to emphasize that I've said 4% to 6% kind of an annual over time basis. I'm not saying you can do it every single quarter, but I think if you look at those numbers, capturing more technicians through the efficiency of the vans, extending out in the critical industries which are places we haven't gone before, which is kind of like share capture, building in emerging markets, where the wave is still rising and getting into the garage a little bit more by offering more products.

And then because no one would know, but if steel goes up by 10%, we can price for that. Now on top of that, we have a very -- and part of our Snap-on Value Creation Process is we have something called RCI, Rapid Continuous Improvement and we're out everyday in every site with dedicated people. We have a dedicated guy in every site, pushing cost reduction and productivity. So not only do we have a pricing, but we have this productivity flow through our plans."

303646,141348521,175045,"Snap-on Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2011",2011-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Snap-on Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everyone. Well, I would characterize our third quarter as an extension of the broad progress we’ve been making for quite some time. And I would say that the continuing trend is especially encouraging in light of the general",2304,"Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everyone. Well, I would characterize our third quarter as an extension of the broad progress we’ve been making for quite some time. And I would say that the continuing trend is especially encouraging in light of the generally negative macroeconomic news we seem to be hearing almost every day. Overall, our sales in the quarter were up 6.8%. Excluding currency, organic volumes increased 3.6%. Now last year's third quarter did create some tough year-over-year optics, because we were in the midst of a fairly robust recovery, and there really wasn't any of the normal 5% seasonal sequential decline we usually see in the third quarter. 
From that perspective, this year's sequential downtick of 3.5% was a bit better then usual. So this period's volume is a positive indicator. Operating income for the quarter rose by over 37%, and our operating margin of 15.8% was up from 12.5% last year. Now those numbers include $15.8 million in higher earnings from Financial Services, and that's the result of the continuing ramp up of our on-book portfolio. 
Looking at the results before Financial Services. The third quarter operating margin of 13.5% was up 140 basis points, in part aided by that favorable mark-to-market adjustments highlighted in our release. But even excluding those adjustments, Opco operating income in the period represents a new record high for a Snap-on third quarter. 
We believe the advancements we're making are a great testimony to the effectiveness of the Snap-on Value Creation Processes, the principles and processes we apply every day in moving the company forward: safety, quality, customer connection, innovation, Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI. It's that framework that enables our progress and it's driving our strong profitability. 
As usual, I'll now review some of the highlights for the quarter, provide my perspective on the market environment and offer a view on the strategic areas we've identified as being decisive for our future, extending to critical industries, building in emerging markets, enhancing the franchise network and expanding in the garage.
Regarding the overall environment, I'll just comment that based on our various businesses, it can be characterized as generally unchanged from the past several quarters. I view that as a real positive, because if you pick up the paper or watch the news on any given day, you'll get the feeling that there's been a decided turn for the worst, but we're just not seen it. That said, I do think the well-documented troubles in Europe are creating a bit more uncertainty, and therefore, less visibility. But we’ve had a high level of European uncertainty as well as a headwind in Southern Europe for quite a while, and we've managed through it by taking advantage in other places where opportunities are expanding like in emerging markets and in critical industries and in automotive repair. So there is some uncertainty as there has been for some time. But we're not seeing any overriding downturn. 
Probably the best summary measure I can give you is this. In the third quarter, our volumes, excluding the effect of currency movements, were above the third quarter levels of both 2007 and 2008, the strongest period before the recession took hold. That same comparison for the first 2 quarters of this year showed 2011 slightly below those earlier year levels. So if recapture of pre-recession level is your measure of recovery momentum, our third quarter was another favorable data point, and it occurred despite the bad news all over the press.
Moving to the highlights of the operating segments. The Commercial & Industrial Group sales increased 6.6%, that's 2.6% organic growth excluding currency. The operating margin was 10.6%, a 20 basis point improvement from the second quarter, but down from the 11.7% last year, reflecting the concentration of our major headwinds in this segment, the weakness in Southern Europe as well as contracted military spending. These challenges primarily impact the C&I Group where SNA Europe has a strong position in Spain and Portugal and where our Industrial division has felt the impact of the reduced military spending. 
In the balance of the C&I Group, outside of those specific areas, volumes were actually up much more robustly, about 8% organically. Those gains reflect the progress being made in our primary areas of C&I strategic focus, building our presence in emerging markets and extending into critical industries. 
Speaking of emerging markets, the gains continue to be far in excess of any related GDP growth rate, and the expansion isn't just limited to Asia. We’re posting significant gains in the emerging European regions. Places like Russia and Turkey are growing rapidly. So I guess, when you say emerging markets, the focus is most of on Asia; the discussion is Asia. And we did see exceptionally strong gains across that region as well, in places like India, in Indonesia, and, of course, in China. We're investing continuously in the region and it's paying off with growing position. 
In that regard, our Asian product offering is expanding. Our Undercar Equipment lineup, aligners in particular has been ramping up and rolling out over the past few quarters. And as you would expect this is a product that is specifically designed for Asia, and coupled with our new Asian Diagnostic Products, which I discussed last quarter, we're not only driving growth in the region but we're building a strong presence as the repair wave is just rising in China. We said all along that we'll continue to invest in those areas that are strategically important. And we're doing just that in China. We're in the process of building a new engineering and R&D center in that country. It will be state-of-the-art. It will support a wide range of Asianized product and it’ll help continue our rapid growth all over the region. In addition to emerging markets, we're also building our position in critical industries. Our Aviation & Aerospace sales, served through our Industrial division, grew strongly in the quarter. I've spoken about our ever-expanding offering for those customers, while we're highlighting that broadened array of products with what we call our Advanced Technology Labs. These are large trucks, loaded with aviation offering, trav -- with our aviation offering, traveling site to site to assembly plants, to hangars and to maintenance and repair and overhaul locations. We find it to be a great way to demonstrate the product right in the workplace and it's helping drive our growth. Every month, we're getting orders from new customers for tool control systems and toolkits, for flight lines, for assembly operations and for those MRO facilities. Importantly, as you would expect, our position is improving across the globe here. Aviation is an industry that is growing internationally. It's certainly critical and it's right in the Snap-on wheelhouse. 
On to the Tools Group where sales were up 8.1%, including about 2 points from currency. The operating margin of 12.7% was an increase of 180 basis points from last year. The Tools Group is where we serve professional automotive technicians and they value Snap-on. That fact was recently highlighted, once again, by -- as we came out on top in Frost & Sullivan’s survey of technicians’ brand preferences in hand tools, diagnostics, tools storage, power tools and pneumatic air tools. We always distance ourselves from the competition by wide margins in this survey, but this year's results showed Snap-on even further in the lead with record levels of professional technicians choosing Snap-on in several of those categories. For example, in hand tools, 75% of technicians surveyed preferred Snap-on. 
The next highest brand registered only 8%. Now with that sort of position, it's no wonder that our franchise network is strong. Volumes in the third quarter for our franchisees were very robust. And the franchisee-held metrics, which we closely monitored, continued their favorable trend. 
The Snap-on Franchisee Conference, which was held in August, provided more evidence of progress in strengthening our franchise system, another one of our primary strategic objectives, strengthening that system. This conference was quite a success, record participation and higher than ever product ordering activity. And aside from the metrics and the sales levels, the enthusiasm, the enthusiasm on display was considerable and contagious. All of this is testimony that our network is well positioned and moving in the right direction.
Now for the Repair System Information segment or the RS&I Group. Sales were up 7.3% or 4.7% without the favorable effect of currency. The gains were somewhat muted by the return to a more typical seasonal decline in our Undercar Equipment business, which had been particularly strong in the third quarter of 2010. The RS&I operating margin of 19.6% remained very strong, but was down from last year's level of, I think, 20.1%, mainly due to growth in our Facilitation business that serves OEM dealerships. That lower margin activity was up strongly as OEMs continue to commit to additional essential tools in diagnostic programs throughout the U.S. and in Europe. One of the highlights in RS&I for the third quarter was the launch of our SOLUS Ultra, a new full-function handheld diagnostic unit. We introduced it at the August Franchisee Conference and it made a big splash. It offers some real advancements, ease-of-use, functionality, starting with the faster boot-up and a battery that charged directly from the vehicle so never any worries about power availability. It also had a keyless adapter that makes connections to the vehicle much easier. And it has high-resolution graphing on a touch screen that is 50% larger than the competition. This tool is always ready to be used with improved simplicity and productivity and it’s helping support the strong results in RS&I. 
I mentioned earlier that the Equipment division returned to its normal seasonality in the third quarter, and that counterization is driven by the fact that Snap-on has a strong position in the European equipment market where summers, they tend to be a bit slower. Our Undercar Equipment lineup in fact is where we're seeing some strong international expansion. I already mentioned the liners in my discussion of Asian growth, but we're seeing the same kind of thing in Brazil and in the emerging markets of Eastern Europe. We're posting solid gains in those areas. Our equipment lineup is instrumental in advancing us along 2 of our strategic runways, expanding in the garage and building in emerging markets with leading technologies that does provide a real advantage. An example of one recent new product in this area, just being launched in Europe, is our new RFV 2000 diagnostic wheel balancer. It’s already getting considerable attention and winning innovation awards right out of the blocks. We've taken our patented imaging technology to analyze the interaction between the wheel and the suspension system so this new unit predicts and will head off any vibrations, all in just a few spins of the wheel, achieving a balance quicker than ever before. 
The RFV 2000 also laser maps the side wall and the wheel and the tire tread providing a picture of the actual and predicted tire wear, heading off any future problems. That's a feature that's going to be valued by shop owners everywhere when they’re dealing with car owners. 
So that's some of the highlights in each of the operating units, and while I just mentioned some of the new products in the RS&I Group, let me expand that discussion a bit as it relates to the entire corporation and to the Snap-on value creation processes. Two of the tenets embedded in this framework are innovation and customer connection. We have a great legacy in both those areas. And we believe a huge advantage in the number of customer interactions that our people, whether they're franchisees or associates, have with professional users, those who actually benefit from our productivity enhancing tools, that customer connection gives us great insight for developing new products. So not only do professionals prefer Snap-on as evidenced by the survey data, but we're using that strong customer connection to make sure our product line just keeps getting better with new innovative offerings that customers greatly value. 
Just recently, we were honored to have won 2 MOTOR Magazine Top 20 Tool Award. These awards recognize products that will help make the jobs of technicians and shop owners easier, enabling them to perform vehicle repair more accurately and more quickly. One of the winning products was the RFV 2000 that I already mentioned. The other was the VERDICT diagnostic and information systems, a modular handheld unit that includes a touch screen and wirelessly connects to the vehicle. It also includes Wi-Fi access and Windows multitasking so that technicians can access more information, including our Mitchell 1 shop key repair information system, and they can do it from anywhere in the garage. I've spoken about this product in the past and I think at that time, I told you it was great innovation. Well, this award confirms that fact. As further testimony to the effectiveness of customer connection and our innovation processes, Snap-on was also named winner of 4 innovation awards by Professional Tool & Equipment News. Our products were voted the best in tool storage, the best in lifts, the best in shop equipment and the best in tool accessories. The importance of this recognition is that the judges are professionals, people that make their living using these very products, independent shop owners and skilled technicians. In that regard, these awards speak strongly not only to Snap-on product innovations, but to our strong connection to our customers. It's a unique Snap-on advantage, and it's paying dividends. 
So that's our third quarter: Encouraging financials, clear evidence of strategic progress and a strong pipeline full of new and exciting products. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo for a more detailed -- more detail on the financials. Aldo?"

Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales in the third quarter of $697.2 million increased $44.1 million or 6.8% year-over-year. Excluding favorable currency translation of $19.6 million, organic sales increased",1785,"Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales in the third quarter of $697.2 million increased $44.1 million or 6.8% year-over-year. Excluding favorable currency translation of $19.6 million, organic sales increased 3.6% as we realized year-over-year sales growth across the majority of our businesses. Continued sales increases in the Snap-on Tools Group, higher essential tool and facilitation program sales to OEM dealerships, expansion in emerging markets and growth to a wide range of customers in critical industries, more than offset anticipated lower sales for the military and across Southern Europe. As Nick also noted, these sales levels reflect a return to a more traditional seasonal pattern where we typically experience lower sequential sales moving from the second quarter to the third quarter. This seasonal pattern was largely absent in 2010 as the economy was rebounding from 2009 recession levels. Consolidated gross profit of $329.3 million in the quarter increased $28.1 million from 2010 levels, reflecting contributions from higher sales, $9.5 million of favorable foreign currency effects, savings from our ongoing cost-reduction and rapid continuous improvement or RCI initiatives and $1 million of lower restructuring cost. Consolidated gross margin of 47.2% in the quarter improved 110 basis points from 46.1% last year. 
Operating expenses in the quarter of $235 million increased $12.6 million from 2010 levels. The year-over-year operating expense increase includes volume-related and other costs as well as $5.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, $3.1 million of expected higher pension expense, $2.6 million of increased performance-based compensation expense and $1.8 million of higher restructuring cost. As noted in our earnings release, mark-to-market adjustments on stock-based compensation, which are calculated on the quarter ending stock price, also benefited third quarter results. The change in Snap-on's period-end stock price resulted in a benefit of $7.8 million or $0.09 per diluted share in the quarter. And while we always have some impact from mark-to-market in our results, recent stock market declines resulted in the significant third quarter benefit. Similarly, should the price of Snap-on stock appreciate during a given quarter, we would incur mark-to-market expense. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses in the quarter of 33.7% improved 30 basis points from 34% last year from a restructuring cost of $2.9 million in the quarter compared to $2.1 million last year. 
Operating earnings from Financial Services of $20.8 million improved $15.8 million from third quarter 2010 levels. As expected, Financial Services operating earnings continues to grow as our on-book Finance portfolio grows. Consolidated operating earnings of $115.1 million or 15.8% of total revenues increased 330 basis points from 12.5% a year ago, with the mark-to-market contributing 110 basis points. Interest expense of $15.1 million in the quarter increased $1.6 million from 2010 levels primarily due to higher average debt levels to fund the growth in our contract portfolio of Snap-on credit, partially offset by lower average interest rates. 
Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 31.7% was lower than last year's 34.4% rate, primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters. Finally, third quarter net earnings of earnings per share of $67.8 million or $1.16 per diluted share increased $21.3 million or 45.8% from last year's levels. Even without the $0.09 of benefit from mark-to-market, these net earnings and earnings per share represent an all-time third quarter record. Now let's turn to our segment results.
Starting with the Commercial & Industrial, or C&I Group, on Slide 7. Sales of $278.3 million for the third quarter improved 6.6% from 2010 levels. Excluding currency translation, sales rose 2.6%. C&I benefited from double-digit gains in both Asia and Eastern Europe. These higher year-over-year sales to a wide range of customers in emerging markets as well as critical industries were partially offset by expected lower sales to the military and ongoing weakness across Southern Europe. Gross profit of $102.8 million in the quarter increased $6.6 million or 6.9% from 2010 levels, primarily due to higher sales, $2.9 million of favorable foreign currency effects and $1.2 million of a lower restructuring cost. Gross margin of 36.9% in the quarter improved slightly from 36.8% last year. Operating expenses of $73.2 million in the quarter were up $7.6 million from 2010 levels, primarily due to the volume related and other expenses, $2.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects and $1.8 million of higher restructuring costs, largely for the ongoing optimization of our cost structure in Europe. 
As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 26.3% in the quarter compared to 25.1% last year. Third quarter operating earnings of $29.6 million for this C&I segment declined $1 million from 2010 levels, largely due to overall higher restructuring costs. As a percentage of sales, operating margin of 10.6% in the C&I segment compared with 11.7% last year.
Turning now to Slide 8. Third quarter sales of the Snap-on Tools Group improved $20.9 million or 8.1% year-over-year, largely due to continued higher sales in the U.S. And on an organic basis, sales were up 6%. Gross profit in the Snap-on Tools Group of $125.2 million in the quarter increased $17.5 million from last year's levels, primarily due to higher sales across several product categories, favorable manufacturing utilization and $4.8 million of favorable currency effects. As a percentage of sales, gross margin of 44.8% in the Snap-on Tools Group improved 320 basis points from 41.6% last year. Operating expenses of $89.6 million in the quarter increased $10.1 million from 2010 levels, primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses including higher cost as a result of increased participation at the Annual Snap-on Franchisee Conference and $1.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 32.1% in the quarter compared with 30.7% last year. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $35.6 million in the quarter increased $7.4 million or 26.2% from the $28.2 million earned last year. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings of 12.7% in the quarter increased 180 basis points from 10.9% last year.
Turning to the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I Group as shown on Slide 9. Third quarter sales of $222.6 million increased 7.3% year-over-year. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased 4.7%, primarily due to higher sales in our Equipment Solutions business, which facilitates essential tool programs for OEMs. Gross profit of $101.3 million in the quarter increased $4 million from prior year levels, primarily due to higher sales and $1.8 million of favorable foreign currency effects. Gross margin of 45.5% in the quarter declined 140 basis points from 2010 levels, largely reflecting the growth in essential tool facilities and program sales to OEM dealerships which yield relatively lower gross margins. Operating expenses of $57.6 million in the quarter increased $2 million from 2010 levels, primarily due to $1.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects and higher volume-related expenses, partially offset by savings from ongoing RCI initiatives. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 25.9% improved 90 basis points from 26.8% last year. Operating earnings of $43.7 million for the RS&I Group increased $2 million or 4.8% from 2010 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating margin of 19.6% compared to 20.1% last year.
Now turning to Slide 10. Third quarter operating earnings from Financial Services was $20.8 million on revenue of $32.7 million. This compares with operating earnings of $5 million or $17.2 million of revenue last year. We believe the $15.8 million year-over-year increase in operating earnings demonstrates the earnings potential of our growing on-book Finance portfolio. Originations of $153 million in the quarter rose 7.2% compared to last year's levels, reflecting both higher sales in our Snap-on tools segment and increased participation in our credit programs. 
Moving to Slide 11. As of third quarter end, our balance sheet includes $896 million of gross financing receivables, including $751 million from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operation. In the U.S., $609 million or 81% of the financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. Since the beginning of 2011, our on-book financing portfolio has grown over $160 million. For the remainder of the year, we expect that our on-book finance portfolio will roughly increase by an additional $20 million to $25 million. The pace of the portfolios on balance sheet development continues as expected and naturally decelerates as the transition progresses. For 2012, we would expect any further expansion of the Snap-on credit portfolio to largely reflect activity in the Snap-on Tools Group. Regarding finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations.
Now turning to Slide 12. Net cash provided by operating activities was $42 million in the quarter. This compares to net cash provided of $10.2 million last year. Our quarter-end cash position of $186 million decreased $386 million from year-end levels, primarily due to the August repayment of $200 million of long-term notes, continued funding for new loans originated by Snap-on Credit and the previously disclosed second quarter repayment of amounts previously withheld from CIT. 
As expected, free cash flow from Financial Services in the quarter was a negative $42 million, reflecting the continued funding of new loan originations at Snap-on Credit. Free cash flow from the operating company was a positive $35 million. Capital expenditures totaled $13.3 million in the quarter. 
As seen on Slide 13, days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 58 days at quarter end improved from 61 days at 2010 year end. Inventories increased $70 million from year-end levels, primarily to support higher demand and seasonal inventory builds, mitigate potential supply chain disruption and to improve customer service levels. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 4.1x compared to 4.7x at 2010 year-end, reflective of the higher inventory. 
Our net debt to capital ratio of 33.8% compares to 30.1% to 2010 year-end and 29.2% last year. The year-over-year increase results primarily from last December's $250 million bond issuance, net of this quarter's $200 million debt repayment and the second quarter repayment to CIT. In addition to our $186 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, including $200 million under our recently amended loan and servicing agreement. In addition, our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets should we choose to do so. As of third quarter end, no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities. 
During the quarter, Fitch initiated credit ratings on Snap-on of A- and F2, which is in addition to our existing ratings of A- and A2 from S&P and Baa1 and P2 for Moody's. This concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance, and I'll now turn the call back over to Nick for his closing thoughts."

Well, that's our quarter. Sales positive from a sequential perspective. And from the vantage point of capturing pre-recession levels, the volumes represent another step forward, better than either our 2007 or our 2008 third quarter activity. From a profit view, there were adjustments that helped, but even excluding those effects, both OpCo operating income and our EPS in the period represent record high profits for a Snap-on third quarter. 
Regarding the environment. It was a third quarter, and as I have said in the past, there is considerable variation on third quarters due to vacations. On balance, however, looking at our overall results, it appears that just the same headwinds are in place, but the positive trends are continuing despite the bad news we get every day in the press. While our results don't indicate deterioration, the difficult macros -- the difficult macroeconomic bulletins do create some limits to our forward visibility; I think that's fair to say. But having said that, I'm confident that the advantages and strengths we bring to any environment, the Snap-on value creation process generates improvement in good times and in challenging times. Our runways for growth enhancing the network, expanding in the repair garage, extending the critical industry and building in emerging markets, they remain attractive and they’ve generated returns on our investments and on our energy for multiple quarters now. And we're fully confident they'll provide the same strong opportunities as we go forward to the days and the quarters and the years ahead. Before I finish though, I want to once again speak directly to our associates and franchisees around the world. I know many of you are listening or will replay this call later. The Snap-on third quarter was another encouraging period. And we all know that our financial and strategic progress would not be possible without your effort.

I'm not saying you can do it every single quarter, but I think if you look at those numbers, capturing more technicians through the efficiency of the vans, extending out into critical industries which are places we haven't gone before, which is kind of like share capture, building in emerging markets, where the wave is still rising and getting into the garage a little bit more by offering more products.

And there's questions about what's going to happen in Europe. And we already talked about the idea that it limits our visibility, but if you're talking about the people at the ground, our people, seem to be confident that a solution is going to be worked out.

So if somebody decided -- we put titanium, say, in our steel; if somebody decided to increase of the price of titanium by 20x, probably we might not be able to price for that.

303646,141348521,175518,"Snap-on Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2011",2011-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Snap-on Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everyone. Well, I would characterize our third quarter as an extension of the broad progress we’ve been making for quite some time. And I would say that the continuing trend is especially encouraging in light of the general",2304,"Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everyone. Well, I would characterize our third quarter as an extension of the broad progress we’ve been making for quite some time. And I would say that the continuing trend is especially encouraging in light of the generally negative macroeconomic news we seem to be hearing almost every day. Overall, our sales in the quarter were up 6.8%. Excluding currency, organic volumes increased 3.6%. Now last year's third quarter did create some tough year-over-year optics, because we were in the midst of a fairly robust recovery, and there really wasn't any of the normal 5% seasonal sequential decline we usually see in the third quarter. 
From that perspective, this year's sequential downtick of 3.5% was a bit better then usual. So this period's volume is a positive indicator. Operating income for the quarter rose by over 37%, and our operating margin of 15.8% was up from 12.5% last year. Now those numbers include $15.8 million in higher earnings from Financial Services, and that's the result of the continuing ramp up of our on-book portfolio. 
Looking at the results before Financial Services. The third quarter operating margin of 13.5% was up 140 basis points, in part aided by that favorable mark-to-market adjustments highlighted in our release. But even excluding those adjustments, Opco operating income in the period represents a new record high for a Snap-on third quarter. 
We believe the advancements we're making are a great testimony to the effectiveness of the Snap-on Value Creation Processes, the principles and processes we apply every day in moving the company forward: safety, quality, customer connection, innovation, Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI. It's that framework that enables our progress and it's driving our strong profitability. 
As usual, I'll now review some of the highlights for the quarter, provide my perspective on the market environment and offer a view on the strategic areas we've identified as being decisive for our future, extending to critical industries, building in emerging markets, enhancing the franchise network and expanding in the garage.
Regarding the overall environment, I'll just comment that based on our various businesses, it can be characterized as generally unchanged from the past several quarters. I view that as a real positive, because if you pick up the paper or watch the news on any given day, you'll get the feeling that there's been a decided turn for the worst, but we're just not seen it. That said, I do think the well-documented troubles in Europe are creating a bit more uncertainty, and therefore, less visibility. But we’ve had a high level of European uncertainty as well as a headwind in Southern Europe for quite a while, and we've managed through it by taking advantage in other places where opportunities are expanding like in emerging markets and in critical industries and in automotive repair. So there is some uncertainty as there has been for some time. But we're not seeing any overriding downturn. 
Probably the best summary measure I can give you is this. In the third quarter, our volumes, excluding the effect of currency movements, were above the third quarter levels of both 2007 and 2008, the strongest period before the recession took hold. That same comparison for the first 2 quarters of this year showed 2011 slightly below those earlier year levels. So if recapture of pre-recession level is your measure of recovery momentum, our third quarter was another favorable data point, and it occurred despite the bad news all over the press.
Moving to the highlights of the operating segments. The Commercial & Industrial Group sales increased 6.6%, that's 2.6% organic growth excluding currency. The operating margin was 10.6%, a 20 basis point improvement from the second quarter, but down from the 11.7% last year, reflecting the concentration of our major headwinds in this segment, the weakness in Southern Europe as well as contracted military spending. These challenges primarily impact the C&I Group where SNA Europe has a strong position in Spain and Portugal and where our Industrial division has felt the impact of the reduced military spending. 
In the balance of the C&I Group, outside of those specific areas, volumes were actually up much more robustly, about 8% organically. Those gains reflect the progress being made in our primary areas of C&I strategic focus, building our presence in emerging markets and extending into critical industries. 
Speaking of emerging markets, the gains continue to be far in excess of any related GDP growth rate, and the expansion isn't just limited to Asia. We’re posting significant gains in the emerging European regions. Places like Russia and Turkey are growing rapidly. So I guess, when you say emerging markets, the focus is most of on Asia; the discussion is Asia. And we did see exceptionally strong gains across that region as well, in places like India, in Indonesia, and, of course, in China. We're investing continuously in the region and it's paying off with growing position. 
In that regard, our Asian product offering is expanding. Our Undercar Equipment lineup, aligners in particular has been ramping up and rolling out over the past few quarters. And as you would expect this is a product that is specifically designed for Asia, and coupled with our new Asian Diagnostic Products, which I discussed last quarter, we're not only driving growth in the region but we're building a strong presence as the repair wave is just rising in China. We said all along that we'll continue to invest in those areas that are strategically important. And we're doing just that in China. We're in the process of building a new engineering and R&D center in that country. It will be state-of-the-art. It will support a wide range of Asianized product and it’ll help continue our rapid growth all over the region. In addition to emerging markets, we're also building our position in critical industries. Our Aviation & Aerospace sales, served through our Industrial division, grew strongly in the quarter. I've spoken about our ever-expanding offering for those customers, while we're highlighting that broadened array of products with what we call our Advanced Technology Labs. These are large trucks, loaded with aviation offering, trav -- with our aviation offering, traveling site to site to assembly plants, to hangars and to maintenance and repair and overhaul locations. We find it to be a great way to demonstrate the product right in the workplace and it's helping drive our growth. Every month, we're getting orders from new customers for tool control systems and toolkits, for flight lines, for assembly operations and for those MRO facilities. Importantly, as you would expect, our position is improving across the globe here. Aviation is an industry that is growing internationally. It's certainly critical and it's right in the Snap-on wheelhouse. 
On to the Tools Group where sales were up 8.1%, including about 2 points from currency. The operating margin of 12.7% was an increase of 180 basis points from last year. The Tools Group is where we serve professional automotive technicians and they value Snap-on. That fact was recently highlighted, once again, by -- as we came out on top in Frost & Sullivan’s survey of technicians’ brand preferences in hand tools, diagnostics, tools storage, power tools and pneumatic air tools. We always distance ourselves from the competition by wide margins in this survey, but this year's results showed Snap-on even further in the lead with record levels of professional technicians choosing Snap-on in several of those categories. For example, in hand tools, 75% of technicians surveyed preferred Snap-on. 
The next highest brand registered only 8%. Now with that sort of position, it's no wonder that our franchise network is strong. Volumes in the third quarter for our franchisees were very robust. And the franchisee-held metrics, which we closely monitored, continued their favorable trend. 
The Snap-on Franchisee Conference, which was held in August, provided more evidence of progress in strengthening our franchise system, another one of our primary strategic objectives, strengthening that system. This conference was quite a success, record participation and higher than ever product ordering activity. And aside from the metrics and the sales levels, the enthusiasm, the enthusiasm on display was considerable and contagious. All of this is testimony that our network is well positioned and moving in the right direction.
Now for the Repair System Information segment or the RS&I Group. Sales were up 7.3% or 4.7% without the favorable effect of currency. The gains were somewhat muted by the return to a more typical seasonal decline in our Undercar Equipment business, which had been particularly strong in the third quarter of 2010. The RS&I operating margin of 19.6% remained very strong, but was down from last year's level of, I think, 20.1%, mainly due to growth in our Facilitation business that serves OEM dealerships. That lower margin activity was up strongly as OEMs continue to commit to additional essential tools in diagnostic programs throughout the U.S. and in Europe. One of the highlights in RS&I for the third quarter was the launch of our SOLUS Ultra, a new full-function handheld diagnostic unit. We introduced it at the August Franchisee Conference and it made a big splash. It offers some real advancements, ease-of-use, functionality, starting with the faster boot-up and a battery that charged directly from the vehicle so never any worries about power availability. It also had a keyless adapter that makes connections to the vehicle much easier. And it has high-resolution graphing on a touch screen that is 50% larger than the competition. This tool is always ready to be used with improved simplicity and productivity and it’s helping support the strong results in RS&I. 
I mentioned earlier that the Equipment division returned to its normal seasonality in the third quarter, and that counterization is driven by the fact that Snap-on has a strong position in the European equipment market where summers, they tend to be a bit slower. Our Undercar Equipment lineup in fact is where we're seeing some strong international expansion. I already mentioned the liners in my discussion of Asian growth, but we're seeing the same kind of thing in Brazil and in the emerging markets of Eastern Europe. We're posting solid gains in those areas. Our equipment lineup is instrumental in advancing us along 2 of our strategic runways, expanding in the garage and building in emerging markets with leading technologies that does provide a real advantage. An example of one recent new product in this area, just being launched in Europe, is our new RFV 2000 diagnostic wheel balancer. It’s already getting considerable attention and winning innovation awards right out of the blocks. We've taken our patented imaging technology to analyze the interaction between the wheel and the suspension system so this new unit predicts and will head off any vibrations, all in just a few spins of the wheel, achieving a balance quicker than ever before. 
The RFV 2000 also laser maps the side wall and the wheel and the tire tread providing a picture of the actual and predicted tire wear, heading off any future problems. That's a feature that's going to be valued by shop owners everywhere when they’re dealing with car owners. 
So that's some of the highlights in each of the operating units, and while I just mentioned some of the new products in the RS&I Group, let me expand that discussion a bit as it relates to the entire corporation and to the Snap-on value creation processes. Two of the tenets embedded in this framework are innovation and customer connection. We have a great legacy in both those areas. And we believe a huge advantage in the number of customer interactions that our people, whether they're franchisees or associates, have with professional users, those who actually benefit from our productivity enhancing tools, that customer connection gives us great insight for developing new products. So not only do professionals prefer Snap-on as evidenced by the survey data, but we're using that strong customer connection to make sure our product line just keeps getting better with new innovative offerings that customers greatly value. 
Just recently, we were honored to have won 2 MOTOR Magazine Top 20 Tool Award. These awards recognize products that will help make the jobs of technicians and shop owners easier, enabling them to perform vehicle repair more accurately and more quickly. One of the winning products was the RFV 2000 that I already mentioned. The other was the VERDICT diagnostic and information systems, a modular handheld unit that includes a touch screen and wirelessly connects to the vehicle. It also includes Wi-Fi access and Windows multitasking so that technicians can access more information, including our Mitchell 1 shop key repair information system, and they can do it from anywhere in the garage. I've spoken about this product in the past and I think at that time, I told you it was great innovation. Well, this award confirms that fact. As further testimony to the effectiveness of customer connection and our innovation processes, Snap-on was also named winner of 4 innovation awards by Professional Tool & Equipment News. Our products were voted the best in tool storage, the best in lifts, the best in shop equipment and the best in tool accessories. The importance of this recognition is that the judges are professionals, people that make their living using these very products, independent shop owners and skilled technicians. In that regard, these awards speak strongly not only to Snap-on product innovations, but to our strong connection to our customers. It's a unique Snap-on advantage, and it's paying dividends. 
So that's our third quarter: Encouraging financials, clear evidence of strategic progress and a strong pipeline full of new and exciting products. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo for a more detailed -- more detail on the financials. Aldo?"

Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales in the third quarter of $697.2 million increased $44.1 million or 6.8% year-over-year. Excluding favorable currency translation of $19.6 million, organic sales increased",1785,"Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales in the third quarter of $697.2 million increased $44.1 million or 6.8% year-over-year. Excluding favorable currency translation of $19.6 million, organic sales increased 3.6% as we realized year-over-year sales growth across the majority of our businesses. Continued sales increases in the Snap-on Tools Group, higher essential tool and facilitation program sales to OEM dealerships, expansion in emerging markets and growth to a wide range of customers in critical industries, more than offset anticipated lower sales for the military and across Southern Europe. As Nick also noted, these sales levels reflect a return to a more traditional seasonal pattern where we typically experience lower sequential sales moving from the second quarter to the third quarter. This seasonal pattern was largely absent in 2010 as the economy was rebounding from 2009 recession levels. Consolidated gross profit of $329.3 million in the quarter increased $28.1 million from 2010 levels, reflecting contributions from higher sales, $9.5 million of favorable foreign currency effects, savings from our ongoing cost-reduction and rapid continuous improvement or RCI initiatives and $1 million of lower restructuring cost. Consolidated gross margin of 47.2% in the quarter improved 110 basis points from 46.1% last year. 
Operating expenses in the quarter of $235 million increased $12.6 million from 2010 levels. The year-over-year operating expense increase includes volume-related and other costs as well as $5.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, $3.1 million of expected higher pension expense, $2.6 million of increased performance-based compensation expense and $1.8 million of higher restructuring cost. As noted in our earnings release, mark-to-market adjustments on stock-based compensation, which are calculated on the quarter ending stock price, also benefited third quarter results. The change in Snap-on's period-end stock price resulted in a benefit of $7.8 million or $0.09 per diluted share in the quarter. And while we always have some impact from mark-to-market in our results, recent stock market declines resulted in the significant third quarter benefit. Similarly, should the price of Snap-on stock appreciate during a given quarter, we would incur mark-to-market expense. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses in the quarter of 33.7% improved 30 basis points from 34% last year from a restructuring cost of $2.9 million in the quarter compared to $2.1 million last year. 
Operating earnings from Financial Services of $20.8 million improved $15.8 million from third quarter 2010 levels. As expected, Financial Services operating earnings continues to grow as our on-book Finance portfolio grows. Consolidated operating earnings of $115.1 million or 15.8% of total revenues increased 330 basis points from 12.5% a year ago, with the mark-to-market contributing 110 basis points. Interest expense of $15.1 million in the quarter increased $1.6 million from 2010 levels primarily due to higher average debt levels to fund the growth in our contract portfolio of Snap-on credit, partially offset by lower average interest rates. 
Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 31.7% was lower than last year's 34.4% rate, primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters. Finally, third quarter net earnings of earnings per share of $67.8 million or $1.16 per diluted share increased $21.3 million or 45.8% from last year's levels. Even without the $0.09 of benefit from mark-to-market, these net earnings and earnings per share represent an all-time third quarter record. Now let's turn to our segment results.
Starting with the Commercial & Industrial, or C&I Group, on Slide 7. Sales of $278.3 million for the third quarter improved 6.6% from 2010 levels. Excluding currency translation, sales rose 2.6%. C&I benefited from double-digit gains in both Asia and Eastern Europe. These higher year-over-year sales to a wide range of customers in emerging markets as well as critical industries were partially offset by expected lower sales to the military and ongoing weakness across Southern Europe. Gross profit of $102.8 million in the quarter increased $6.6 million or 6.9% from 2010 levels, primarily due to higher sales, $2.9 million of favorable foreign currency effects and $1.2 million of a lower restructuring cost. Gross margin of 36.9% in the quarter improved slightly from 36.8% last year. Operating expenses of $73.2 million in the quarter were up $7.6 million from 2010 levels, primarily due to the volume related and other expenses, $2.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects and $1.8 million of higher restructuring costs, largely for the ongoing optimization of our cost structure in Europe. 
As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 26.3% in the quarter compared to 25.1% last year. Third quarter operating earnings of $29.6 million for this C&I segment declined $1 million from 2010 levels, largely due to overall higher restructuring costs. As a percentage of sales, operating margin of 10.6% in the C&I segment compared with 11.7% last year.
Turning now to Slide 8. Third quarter sales of the Snap-on Tools Group improved $20.9 million or 8.1% year-over-year, largely due to continued higher sales in the U.S. And on an organic basis, sales were up 6%. Gross profit in the Snap-on Tools Group of $125.2 million in the quarter increased $17.5 million from last year's levels, primarily due to higher sales across several product categories, favorable manufacturing utilization and $4.8 million of favorable currency effects. As a percentage of sales, gross margin of 44.8% in the Snap-on Tools Group improved 320 basis points from 41.6% last year. Operating expenses of $89.6 million in the quarter increased $10.1 million from 2010 levels, primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses including higher cost as a result of increased participation at the Annual Snap-on Franchisee Conference and $1.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 32.1% in the quarter compared with 30.7% last year. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $35.6 million in the quarter increased $7.4 million or 26.2% from the $28.2 million earned last year. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings of 12.7% in the quarter increased 180 basis points from 10.9% last year.
Turning to the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I Group as shown on Slide 9. Third quarter sales of $222.6 million increased 7.3% year-over-year. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased 4.7%, primarily due to higher sales in our Equipment Solutions business, which facilitates essential tool programs for OEMs. Gross profit of $101.3 million in the quarter increased $4 million from prior year levels, primarily due to higher sales and $1.8 million of favorable foreign currency effects. Gross margin of 45.5% in the quarter declined 140 basis points from 2010 levels, largely reflecting the growth in essential tool facilities and program sales to OEM dealerships which yield relatively lower gross margins. Operating expenses of $57.6 million in the quarter increased $2 million from 2010 levels, primarily due to $1.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects and higher volume-related expenses, partially offset by savings from ongoing RCI initiatives. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 25.9% improved 90 basis points from 26.8% last year. Operating earnings of $43.7 million for the RS&I Group increased $2 million or 4.8% from 2010 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating margin of 19.6% compared to 20.1% last year.
Now turning to Slide 10. Third quarter operating earnings from Financial Services was $20.8 million on revenue of $32.7 million. This compares with operating earnings of $5 million or $17.2 million of revenue last year. We believe the $15.8 million year-over-year increase in operating earnings demonstrates the earnings potential of our growing on-book Finance portfolio. Originations of $153 million in the quarter rose 7.2% compared to last year's levels, reflecting both higher sales in our Snap-on tools segment and increased participation in our credit programs. 
Moving to Slide 11. As of third quarter end, our balance sheet includes $896 million of gross financing receivables, including $751 million from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operation. In the U.S., $609 million or 81% of the financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. Since the beginning of 2011, our on-book financing portfolio has grown over $160 million. For the remainder of the year, we expect that our on-book finance portfolio will roughly increase by an additional $20 million to $25 million. The pace of the portfolios on balance sheet development continues as expected and naturally decelerates as the transition progresses. For 2012, we would expect any further expansion of the Snap-on credit portfolio to largely reflect activity in the Snap-on Tools Group. Regarding finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations.
Now turning to Slide 12. Net cash provided by operating activities was $42 million in the quarter. This compares to net cash provided of $10.2 million last year. Our quarter-end cash position of $186 million decreased $386 million from year-end levels, primarily due to the August repayment of $200 million of long-term notes, continued funding for new loans originated by Snap-on Credit and the previously disclosed second quarter repayment of amounts previously withheld from CIT. 
As expected, free cash flow from Financial Services in the quarter was a negative $42 million, reflecting the continued funding of new loan originations at Snap-on Credit. Free cash flow from the operating company was a positive $35 million. Capital expenditures totaled $13.3 million in the quarter. 
As seen on Slide 13, days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 58 days at quarter end improved from 61 days at 2010 year end. Inventories increased $70 million from year-end levels, primarily to support higher demand and seasonal inventory builds, mitigate potential supply chain disruption and to improve customer service levels. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 4.1x compared to 4.7x at 2010 year-end, reflective of the higher inventory. 
Our net debt to capital ratio of 33.8% compares to 30.1% to 2010 year-end and 29.2% last year. The year-over-year increase results primarily from last December's $250 million bond issuance, net of this quarter's $200 million debt repayment and the second quarter repayment to CIT. In addition to our $186 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, including $200 million under our recently amended loan and servicing agreement. In addition, our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets should we choose to do so. As of third quarter end, no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities. 
During the quarter, Fitch initiated credit ratings on Snap-on of A- and F2, which is in addition to our existing ratings of A- and A2 from S&P and Baa1 and P2 for Moody's. This concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance, and I'll now turn the call back over to Nick for his closing thoughts."

Well, that's our quarter. Sales positive from a sequential perspective. And from the vantage point of capturing pre-recession levels, the volumes represent another step forward, better than either our 2007 or our 2008 third quarter activity. From a profit view, there were adjustments that helped, but even excluding those effects, both OpCo operating income and our EPS in the period represent record high profits for a Snap-on third quarter. 
Regarding the environment. It was a third quarter, and as I have said in the past, there is considerable variation on third quarters due to vacations. On balance, however, looking at our overall results, it appears that just the same headwinds are in place, but the positive trends are continuing despite the bad news we get every day in the press. While our results don't indicate deterioration, the difficult macros -- the difficult macroeconomic bulletins do create some limits to our forward visibility; I think that's fair to say. But having said that, I'm confident that the advantages and strengths we bring to any environment, the Snap-on value creation process generates improvement in good times and in challenging times. Our runways for growth enhancing the network, expanding in the repair garage, extending the critical industry and building in emerging markets, they remain attractive and they’ve generated returns on our investments and on our energy for multiple quarters now. And we're fully confident they'll provide the same strong opportunities as we go forward to the days and the quarters and the years ahead. Before I finish though, I want to once again speak directly to our associates and franchisees around the world. I know many of you are listening or will replay this call later. The Snap-on third quarter was another encouraging period. And we all know that our financial and strategic progress would not be possible without your effort. So for your extraordinary contributions, for the wins you have achieved, and for your commitment to your team, you have my congratulations and you have my thanks.

I'm not saying you can do it every single quarter, but I think if you look at those numbers, capturing more technicians through the efficiency of the vans, extending out into critical industries which are places we haven't gone before, which is kind of like share capture, building in emerging markets, where the wave is still rising and getting into the garage a little bit more by offering more products.

I mean, I'll try to give you the people's interpretation of it, and then -- the whole idea is, it emanates from 2 big pieces. One is the fact that for outside the United States, we grant stock appreciation rights, not options. And we have deferred compensation in the United States where you have a stock certificate, not a real share, and so that gets mark-to-market based on a stock price. And so what happens is that if the stock stays at where it is today, which is up from the quarter close, we would see some kind of negative in the fourth quarter. And so any time the stock -- it's a quarter-to-quarter thing so if the stock moves up during the quarter, we will see a negative impact for this. If the stock moves down, we see a positive."
