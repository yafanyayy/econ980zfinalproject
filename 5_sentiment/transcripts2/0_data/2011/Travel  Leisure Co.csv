We ended the year a high note with fourth quarter adjusted EPS coming in $0.02 ahead of the top end of our guidance range. For the year, excluding the benefit of deferred revenues we had in the 2009, revenues increased 8% and adjusted EBITDA increased 17%, demonstrating continued strong execution across our businesses.
2010 was a great year for Wyndham Worldwide. We generated $603 million in free cash flow just above the top end of our range. We used that cash to both grow our businesses and return capital to shareholders. A year ago, we tripled our dividend and today, we announced another 25% increase reflecting the real growth of our businesses. Our confidence in the future in our continued commitment to return cash to shareholders.
In 2010, we utilized $237 million to repurchase approximately 9.3 million shares of our common stocks. We used another $212 million to repurchase approximately 50% of our convertible notes and related warrants, reducing current and potential future share deletion. And we invested $232 million in our businesses before acquisitions service business that will drive higher EBITDA and cash flow for years to come.
So for those keeping score, we returned 42% of our available cash flow to shareholders with dividend and share purchases, 30% to acquire complementary businesses to fuel future growth and 28% of retired convertible debt.
On the operating front, each of our three business units exceeded its 2010 plan and made significant progress towards its strategic goals. At Wyndham Vacation Ownership, we drove the DPG [ph] to new levels and launched our asset affiliation models signing three deals and generating sales ahead of our expectations.
In our exchange and rental business, we enhanced our leadership positions in service rentals with three terrific acquisitions. RCI signed 74 new long-term affiliations and renewed its affiliation with Disney Vacation Club and multi-year agreements. Also in exchange, we achieved 29% online WebShare. More than doubling our online shares since we began our initiative to enhance our RCI.com in 2008. To capture similar success on our Lodging business, we launched the Apollo initiative, which will improve our value proposition to franchisees and consumers and enable us to capture incremental RevPAR and room growth. 
I'll bring you up-to-date of the most recent achievements in a moment but first, let me spend a minute on what we're seeing across our businesses around the world. In general, we continue to see signs of gradual economic recovery. In Lodging, the outlook in the hotel owner community is significantly improved and we expect asset trading to increase in 2011 as the credit markets continue to improve. The RevPAR rebound that we experienced in the U.S. in 2010 continues to gain momentum. Our European rentals business was also off to a great start in 2011. We believe the significant decline in unemployment in Germany and pent-up demand from December's increment weather are two factors abroad in demand as evidenced by year-over-year increase of 11% in rental volume excluding the acquisition that we made in January of 2011.
RCI recently held its annual affiliate event in New York. The event brought together more than 55 timeshare developers and industry leaders to celebrate a year of collaboration and success and to learn more about how RCI can continue to help their businesses.
While credit markets for timeshare developers are still the recovery process, sentiments among the developers who attended the event was markably positive. Of course, no words have helped the timeshare industry more evident than the Wyndham Vacation Ownership, where we ended the year with adjusted EBITDA of 32% above 2009, excluding the impact of deferred revenues.
So give that back of improving economic conditions, we are focused on ensuring we capture more than our fair share of the recovery and that the continue to fuel our growth for many years to come. Today, I want to discuss four themes that will help us ensure we achieve these goals. First, our emphasis on innovation. Second, rebound single portfolio towards fee for service businesses. Third, expanding brand presence, and finally, our customer service and associates engagements.
First, let's discuss innovation, a central theme here at Wyndham worldwide. We are deploying technology in new and creative ways to provide more innovative interfaces and service delivery for business partners and consumers. As you know, RCI is the leading the way on this front and in November we implemented our most significant technology upgrade ever. This enhancements give members the ability to combine deposits to trade up and to receive change back from an exchange when the trading power of their timeshare is greater than the trading power of the timeshare they're trading into.
These are transformational changes in the vacation exchange industry. We went live with these improvements in November, on schedule and without a hitch.
Member and affiliate response has been positive. Members love the ability to deposit and receive change back and they view these options as fair and member-friendly. Through January, over 75% of exchange transactions resulted in members receiving change back that they can use for future exchanges and approximately 10% of exchange transactions resulted from combined deposits, meaning members were able to exchange into a better unit by combining the timeshare that they owed.
At the Hotel group is also leveraging into the data technology to enhance their customer experience. As part of our Apollo initiative, during the fourth quarter, we launched enhanced old cell, which enabled cross selling functionality across all brands across all Wyndham Hotel Group web site. We're also operating all of our brand websites. We recently completed test designs for Baymont  and in the process of soliciting content from over 6,000 franchisee sites. We expect to launch these sites with mobile website functionality in the summer of 2011 and will follow shortly thereafter with the remainder of our brand.
Our focus on innovation extends beyond technology to product development as evidenced by the significant process we've made with our asset affiliation model at Wyndham Vacation Ownership. We also introduced product innovations in our RCI business with our premium membership product, RCI platinum, which offers many benefits including opportunities for last-minute upgrades and priorities viewing of specialty inventory.
Next, let me share the progress we made on rebounds in our portfolio to emphasize fee for service business. Last month, we announced our third WAAM deal at Smugler's Notch  [ph] near Vermont. Smugler's Notch is consistently recognized as a top-rated destination for family-friendly vacations. This affiliation aligns with our business model providing vacation experiences for families, facilitates our expansion in New England and provides our owners with another world-class vacation property. And today, we are announcing our fourth WAAM deal at grant in Florida which adds yet another world-class luxury resort on Florida's Gold Coast through our Vacation Ownership. The four deals we've announced in the last 12 months including our option to take additional units within this resorts would provide enough inventory to achieve our current Wyndham target of 15% to 20% of gross vacation ownership over the next five years.
As importantly, in addition to executing our fee for service model, these are brand enhancing product additions, adding valuable infrastructure in important geographic locations to our portfolio.
As I mentioned earlier, we also successfully completed four acquisitions of fee for service businesses in 2010. Hoseasons added meaningful inventory to our highly successful U.K. vacational business. The Trip brand was a tuck-in opportunity for the Wyndham Hotel Group that significantly enhanced our international presence. The third, ResortQuest, is serving as our platform to enter the U.S. full-service business, which is estimated to be a $10 billion industry. And in late November, we had a James Villa Holiday, a leading and highly recognized brand in the U.K. to Mediterranean Holiday market for consumers and property. James Villa Holidays is second only to Hoseasons' consumer awareness in the U.K. self-catering categories. With the addition of approximately 2,300 properties and an excellent reputation, the acquisition gives us geographic and product expansion, growth opportunities in Europe. It provides scale in Spain and Portugal and gives us good representation in Greece. We're happy to welcome James Villa Holidays to the Wyndham Worldwide family. This brings me to our third focus area, expanding brand presence.
A key goal of ours has been to continue to grow the Wyndham Hotels and Resorts brands. Wyndham brand openings were up over 60% in 2010. In the fourth quarter, we opened over 2,000 rooms, reflecting property addition in Orlando, Chicago, Baltimore and Hawaii, as well as international openings, including Mexico, Panama City, Panama and Surfer's Paradise down in Australia.
Wyndham Hotel Group has always been focused on growing its system and increasing overall revenues through branded affiliations. This arrangement allows us to increase our overall presence with little or no capital investments. Last quarter, I told you about our alliance with Planet Hollywood. And just last month, we entered into an exclusive agreement with hotels and resorts to franchise and manage its Dream and Night boutique hotel brands globally. We will position the Dream brand as a full-service lifestyle brand for Gateway cities and resort destinations and the Night brand as a portable full-service or limited service hotel in primary and secondary markets.
Adding these complementarity brands to Wyndham Hotel Group's portfolio supports our objective of meeting guest needs with a Hotel product for any kind of travel. Of course, innovation and the best product in the world are meaningless without the face of loyal customer and a team of engaged employees. So let me conclude by spending a few moments on our culture. Our Count On Me! service culture and associate engagements are central to everything we do. Wyndham Worldwide culture, family-friendly benefits and programs earned us a spot on the highly regarded Working Mothers Magazine 100 Best Companies List. Several of our offices including Mexico City, Indianapolis, Orlando, Las Vegas and the New Jersey office here received prestigious 2010 Best Places to Work Awards. In recent, or Landal GreenParks was named the most customer friendly company in the Netherlands based on ratings by the Dutch Public. Landal was invited to ring the opening bell on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, an incredible and well-deserved honor and a great example of the power of our Associates Living Wyndham Worldwide's Count on Me values every day.
Before turning the call over to Tom, I'd like to note that excluding the tax benefit we enjoyed in 2010, which were a positive for us in 2010, our guidance this year reflects approximately 15% EPS growth, which is at the top end of our guidance range. This EPS growth does not assume the application of any free cash flow in 2011 to reduce our shares outstanding. We expect continued improvement in the fundamentals of each of our businesses. We have great confidence in Wyndham Worldwide near and long-term prospects. And now I'll turn it over to Tom to review the financials. Tom?"
31063165,118481439,100747,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2011",2011-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Travel + Leisure Co.","Executives","Thank you, Steve. The fourth quarter was another strong quarter with earnings coming in at $0.02 above the top end of our guidance range.

The fourth quarter was another strong quarter with earnings coming in at $0.02 above the top end of our guidance range. In constant dollars and excluding the benefit of deferred revenues in the 2009, adjusted EBITDA increased 11%, reflecting double-digit RevPAR growth and strengthen our Vacation Ownership business. In addition, our earnings per share benefited from a lower effective tax rate and lower interest expense, partially due to a reduction of value-added tax accrual. Our adjusted results exclude a $9 million pretax charge predominantly related to the elimination of RCI activity in our call center in St. John, Canada.
This structural cost reduction is the result of ongoing success in moving more transactions to the web for our RCI exchange business.
We expect another charge of approximately $2 million in the second quarter of 2011 related to RCI exiting this center. And we anticipate approximately $9 million in annual cost savings as a result of the restructuring beginning in 2012.
Also excluded from adjusted EBITDA is the $3 million pretax loss associated with the repurchase of an additional 10% of convertible notes and related warrants in the fourth quarter of 2010. Now, as you know, the convertible bond structure, which includes warrants, generates dilution for share pricing above $20. Today, we have repurchased approximately 50% of the notes and this morning, we announced the tender offer for the remaining notes. Following the tender offer, retirement of the warrants could reduce what we believe will be significant future dilution. At year end, share dilution associated with the warrant was approximately 3 million shares.
Free cash flow increased over 11% to $603 million for the full year compared with $541 million for 2009. And just as a reminder, we define free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less CapEx, equity investments and development advances, and excluding the cash payment related to contingent IRS tax liabilities.
We believe that cash is a great enabler of our long-term business goals and that our sustainable annual free cash flow was $600 million to $700 million will accelerate our EPS growth and enhance shareholder value by supporting further investment in the business, paying dividends and improve share repurchase.
As Steve said, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders, consistent with the dividend housing we established last year, which was  to grow our dividends at least in line with earnings. The Board of Directors has authorized in increase in the quarterly dividends to $0.15 per share, approximately a 28% payout at the midpoint of our 2011 net income guidance range.
Now this growth approximates what we believe was our true underlying growth in 2010, adjusting towards deferred revenues 2009 and the extraordinary tax benefit we achieved last year. Now, we also continue to repurchase shares. From the reinstatement of our program from February to yesterday, we have bought 9.7 million shares with an average price of $25.71 a share. We have $246 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. Now moving to operating performance for the quarter. Let's begin the segment review with a Wyndham Hotel Group.
Revenues were up 9%, EBITDA increased 25% and margins improved over 300 basis points. This reflected higher RevPAR and corresponding royalty fees, lower bad debt expense and the absence of a $60 million asset impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2009.
As Steve mentioned earlier, RevPAR recovery has been strong across the globe. Systemwide RevPAR increased over 10% in the fourth quarter. In the U.S., RevPAR improved 8% versus a year ago with the vast majority coming from occupancy gain. In constant currency, RevPAR in China and the U.K. grew 18% and 13%, respectively. These free countries represents 84% of our total business. Excluding the Trip acquisition, we opened over 54,000 rooms in 2010 and terminated approximately 52,000.
Apart from the 3,145 rooms related to the expiration of a low-margin contract for unbranded, affiliated room, which we chose not to reveal in the first quarter 2010, we estimate that approximately half of the terminated rooms were due to financial difficulties for our franchisees. We expect these types of terminations to moderate over time as the economy continues to recover.
In general, retaining our strong franchisees remains a key priority for our Lodging business. In the fourth quarter, we opened nearly 19,000 rooms. The franchise sales team did a great job of replenishing the pipeline, which approximated 103,000 rooms at year end. For the year, contract signings were up 9% compared with last year and we executed 363 conversion deals compared with 308 in the 2009, an 18% increase. On the new construction front, the international pipeline increased. However, the tight credit market continued to suppress the domestic pipeline for new construction.
Wyndham Exchange & Rentals had a strong year delivering their financial results as expected while completing three separate acquisitions. Revenue in constant currency was up 12% in the fourth quarter, reflecting the acquisitions of Hoseasons, ResortQuest and James Villa Holidays, which contributed $21 million in incremental revenue, as well as higher rental revenues in our Novacel and Landal GreenParks businesses. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 13% in the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting the seasonal effect on profits from the three acquisitions, which incurred costs that exceeded revenues by $6 million. Now excluding the impact of these acquisitions, adjusted EBITDA for WER was flat. Windham Exchange and Rentals performance drives were consistent with our expectations. The average number of exchange members and exchange revenue per member were relatively flat.
Vacation rental transactions were up and average net price per vacation rental was down, primarily reflecting the effects of the acquisitions. Steve mentioned our progress in migrating transactions to the web at RCI. Since the launch of this initiative in 2008, we have captured approximately 130 basis points of margin improvement in the Wyndham Exchange & Rentals business segment. We expect another approximately 120 basis points over the next four years as we continue our technology and program enhancement initiatives. Remember, however, that the impact of this improvement may be obscured a bit in the overall segment performance due to make shift taking place with our lower margin rentals businesses growing more rapidly than the RCI exchange business.
Now moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. This business once again delivered outstanding results. Revenues and EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2010 increased 8% and 19%, respectively, excluding the fourth quarter 2009 benefits associated with the deferred revenue roll-in.
These increases reflect strong execution in the business with volume per guests and towards in line with expectations and tours considerably better than the fourth quarter of 2009. Fourth quarter 2010 results also reflected a lower provision for low levels and higher EBITDA from consumer finance operations. We made good progress in building our pool of lifetime buyers of Vacation Ownership, with over 22,000 new owners being added in 2010. Within the WVO, our recurring fee-for-service property management business, increased revenue 6% in the quarter, primarily reflecting an increase in the number of managed units.
Consumer finance revenues were down approximately 2%, due to a decline in our contract receivable portfolio, while interest expense declined 32%, reflecting lower interest rates on our securitized debt. Delinquency and default rates in the portfolio continue to improve. Write-offs during the fourth quarter declined to 2.5%, 1% of the overall portfolio from 3% in the fourth quarter of 2009.
The provision for loan losses was $82 million or 22.8% of gross VOI sales net of WAAM sales, down from 26.4% in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Now posted on our investor website is the comprehensive presentation that highlights the terrific attributes of our Vacation Ownership business. The significant improvements we've made to this business over the past few years and the strength of our asset-light go forward business model. In the coming months, you'll be happy to hear that WVO management team will be meeting with the financial community, so you can hear from them firsthand why we continue to be so excited about this business.
Moving corporate expenses briefly. Excluding legacy related items, corporate expenses were up, primarily reflecting foreign exchange, increased data security and IT expenses and tax charges. Now information security enhancements will continue to be an important spending priority for us in 2011 as we face, like many other companies, an increasingly aggressive threat from hackers.
Our fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 27%, reflecting the tax credits we discussed last quarter.
Now let's turn to 2011 guidance. We will post a full guidance including cash flow detail to our Investor Relations website following the call. To give you the  highlights, revenue guidance remains between $4 billion and $4.2 billion, up 5% to 9% from 2010 and EBITDA guidance is $925 million to $955 million, up 8% 11% from 2010. Also, we expect annual free cash flow of $600 million to $700 million in 2011 and beyond. As we've discussed in prior quarters, we estimate that the effect of that cash properly deployed, could meaningfully increase our baseline EBITDA and earnings growth on a per share basis.
Now let's look at each business unit starting with our hotel group. We expect RevPAR growth to be up 5% to 7% and 1% to 3% increase in system size. We expect revenues to be between $675 million to $725 million and EBITDA in the range of $200 million and $250 million.
Moving to Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. Drivers are expected to be up slightly for our exchange business and significantly higher for our rentals business. Specifically, in exchange, we expect the average number of members to be flat and exchange revenue per member to be up 1% to 3%, reflecting higher transaction pricing and other member related revenue.
In rentals, we expect transactions to be up 18% to 20%, and average net price per vacation rentals to increased 18% to 20%, reflecting our recent acquisitions. Now, based on these drivers, we expect Wyndham Exchange and Rentals revenue of $1.375 billion and $1.475 billion and EBITDA of $325 million to $345 million.
At Wyndham Vacation Ownership, remember that we are concentrating on cash flow generation and a return profile of this business. So based on those objectives, we expect growth VOI sales to be up slightly from 2010 to $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, which includes, by the way,  approximately $150 million in gross WAAM sales. We expected 2% to 5% increase in Tours as we target more new owners and a 2% to 5% increase in volume per guest. We expect total segment revenues of between $1.9 million and $2.1 billion and EBITDA of $470 million to $500 million in 2011.
Now based on the improvements we've made to credit standards and the improve performance of the portfolio, we are projecting that the provision for loan losses will continue to decline modestly in 2011 to approximately 22% of gross VOI sales, excluding WAAM sales. We expect corporate expenses for the year of approximately $75 million to $85 million, primarily reflecting continued investment in information, security and IT in general.
We expect depreciation and amortization to be between $180 million and $190 million, somewhat higher than 2010, reflecting the recent acquisitions and our technology upgrades at Wyndham Exchange and Rentals.
We expect interest expense of approximately $135 million to $145 million reflecting our current debt levels. Now remember our intention is to maintain a stable leverage ratio, which means we will likely add debt as we increase EBITDA.
In addition, we expect some charges for the early extinguishment of debt related to the convert tender that I mentioned earlier. These charges are excluded from our guidance and will be excluded from our adjusted results. We expect our effective tax rate for the year to be 39% compared with 34% compared in 2010. Now remember, the 2010 tax rate was lower due to the benefits from the utilization of multiple years of foreign tax credits.
We expect to spend $200 million to $225 million in CapEx and hotel development advancement. This is in the recent years reflecting approximately $50 million to complete the Bonnet Creek Hotel near Walt Disney World. However, we expect spending for timeshare inventory to be between $80 million and $90 million, a significant reduction from the $130 million we spent in 2010. We expect earnings per share for the year of $2.05 to $2.15 with a diluted share count of approximately 181 million shares, which assumes no share buybacks. These translates to approximately 15% EPS growth at the top end of our guidance range, excluding the tax benefit.
Finally, for the first quarter, we expect earnings per share of between $0.37 to $0.41 per share. With that, I'll turn the call back to Steve."

Obviously we exceeded the top end of our 500 to 600 range this year that we have originally put in place and we always love to be at the top end of all of our ranges and exceed them if possible. Getting to the $600 million to $700 million, it requires good working capital management and that's something that the company is very focused on. As you know, we put in place a program for focusing everyone on cash flow this past year and it seems to be a focal point. And I think the other kind of the basic or fundamental thing is just pushing EBITDA growth and getting the fundamental to grow. If we can grow EBITDA, that's going to fall down to our cash flow."

At WBR, we have two sort of macro factors at work here.We have the positive incremental movement and margin improvement in our exchange business because of this movement to the web and our announcement today of restructuring in our call center in Canada will yield a structural improvement, further structural improvement in margins and our exchange business. The issue is, there are two factors that are offsetting that somewhat. Factor number one is that the rental business just has lower margins than the exchange business and the rentals business will grow faster especially with the aid of acquisition than the exchange business. But there's a second factor related to rental and it's a seasonal factor and that is that when you look at the business on a quarterly basis, which we try not to do, but we know that we need to speak to it, we had seasonal effects. The fact is that in Europe, in our U.S. vacation rental business, we just don't have as much revenue in the winter than we do in the summer and the spring. So we have an added compounding effects. It's a seasonal factor that works against us.
So that's when you're looking at a quarterly basis, but sort of at a macro level, we have these two competing trends of margin improvement and exchange, but faster growth in our lower margins rentals business."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We ended the year a high note with fourth quarter adjusted EPS coming in $0.02 ahead of the top end of our guidance range.

We ended the year a high note with fourth quarter adjusted EPS coming in $0.02 ahead of the top end of our guidance range. For the year, excluding the benefit of deferred revenues we had in the 2009, revenues increased 8% and adjusted EBITDA increased 17%, demonstrating continued strong execution across our businesses.
2010 was a great year for Wyndham Worldwide. We generated $603 million in free cash flow just above the top end of our range. We used that cash to both grow our businesses and return capital to shareholders. 
A year ago, we tripled our dividend, and today, we announced another 25% increase, reflecting the real growth of our businesses, our confidence in the future and our continued commitment to return cash to shareholders.
In 2010, we utilized $237 million to repurchase approximately 9.3 million shares of our common stock. We used another $212 million to repurchase approximately 50% of our convertible notes and related warrants, reducing current and potential future share dilution. And we invested $232 million in our businesses before acquisitions for Fee-for-Service businesses that will drive higher EBITDA and cash flow for years to come.
So for those keeping score, we returned 42% of our available cash flow to shareholders through dividend and share purchases, 30% to acquire complementary businesses to fuel future growth and 28% to retired convertible debt.
On the operating front, each of our three business units exceeded its 2010 plan and made significant progress towards its strategic goals. At Wyndham Vacation Ownership, we drove VPG to new levels and launched our Asset Affiliation Model, signing three deals and generating sales ahead of our expectations.
In our Exchange and Rental business, we enhanced our leadership position in service rentals with three terrific acquisitions. RCI signed 74 new long-term affiliations and renewed its affiliation with Disney Vacation Club in a multi-year agreement. Also in exchange, we achieved 29% online Web share, more than doubling our online shares since we began our initiative to enhance RCI.com in 2008. To capture similar success in our Lodging business, we launched the Apollo initiative, which will improve our value proposition to franchisees and consumers and enable us to capture incremental RevPAR and room growth. 
I'll bring you up-to-date of the most recent achievements in a moment, but first, let me spend a minute on what we're seeing across our businesses and around the world. In general, we continue to see signs of gradual economic recovery. In Lodging, the outlook in the hotel owner community has significantly improved, and we expect asset trading to increase in 2011 as the credit markets continue to improve. The RevPAR rebound that we experienced in the U.S. in 2010 continues to gain momentum globally. 
Our European Rentals business was also off to a great start in 2011. We believe the significant decline in unemployment in Germany and pent-up demand from December's inclement weather are two contributing factors supporting broad demand, as evidenced by a year-over-year increase of 11% in rental volume, excluding the acquisitions that we made in January of 2011.
RCI recently held its annual affiliate event in New York. The event brought together more than 55 Timeshare developers and industry leaders to celebrate a year of collaboration and success and to learn more about how RCI can continue to help their businesses.
While credit markets for Timeshare developers are still in the recovery process, sentiment among the developers who attended the event was markedly positive. Of course, nowhere is the health of the Timeshare industry more evident than at Wyndham Vacation Ownership, where we ended the year with adjusted EBITDA of 32% above 2009, excluding the impact of deferred revenue. So gainst that backdrop, of improving economic conditions, we're focused on ensuring we capture more than our fair share of the recovery and that we continue to fuel our growth for many years to come. 
Today, I want to discuss four themes that will help ensure we achieve these goals: First, our emphasis on innovation; second, rebound single portfolio towards Fee-for-Service businesses; third, expanding brand presence; and finally, our customer service and associates engagement culture.
First, let's discuss innovation, a central theme here at Wyndham Worldwide. We're deploying technology in new and creative ways to provide more innovative interfaces and service delivery for business partners and consumers. As you know, RCI is still leading the way on this front and in November, we implemented our most significant technology upgrade ever. This enhancements give members the ability to combine deposits to trade up and to receive change back from an exchange when the trading power of their Timeshare is greater than the trading power of the Timeshare they're trading into.
These are transformational changes in the vacation exchange industry. We went live with these improvements in November, on schedule and without a hitch.
Member and affiliate response has been positive. Members love the ability to combine deposits and receive change back and they view these options as fair and member-friendly. Through January, over 75% of exchange transactions resulted in members receiving change back that they can use for future exchanges and approximately 10% of exchange transactions resulted from combined deposits, meaning members were able to exchange into a better unit by combining the Timeshare that they owned.
At the Hotel Group is also leveraging innovative technology to enhance the customer experience. As part of our Apollo initiative, during the fourth quarter, we launched enhanced outsell, which enabled cross selling functionality for all brands across all Wyndham Hotel Group websites. We are also upgrading all of our brand websites. We recently completed test designs for Baymont, Super 8, Days Inn and the Ramada and are in the process of soliciting content from over 6,000 franchisee sites. We expect to launch these sites with mobile website functionality in the summer of 2011 and will follow shortly, thereafter, with the remainder of our brands. 
Our focus on innovation extends beyond technology to product development as evidenced by the significant process we've made with our Asset Affiliation Model at Wyndham Vacation Ownership. We also introduced product innovations in our RCI business with our premium membership product, RCI Points Platinum, which offers many benefits including opportunities for last-minute upgrades and priority viewing of specialty inventory.
Next, let me share the progress we've made on rebounds in our portfolio to emphasize Fee-for-Service businesses. Last month, we announced our third WAAM deal at Smuggler's Notch near Stowe, Vermont. Smuggler's Notch is consistently recognized as a top-rated destination for family-friendly vacations. This affiliation aligns with our business model providing vacation experiences for families, facilitates our expansion in New England and provides our owners with another world-class vacation property. And today, we're announcing our fourth WAAM deal at Emerald Grande in Destin, Florida, which adds yet another world-class luxury resort on Florida's Gulf Coast through our Vacation Ownership. The four deals we've announced in the last 12 months including our option to take additional units within these resorts would provide enough inventory to meet our current WAAM target of 15% to 20% of gross vacation ownership sales over the next five years. As importantly, in addition to executing on our Fee-for-Service model, these are brand-enhancing product additions, adding valuable infrastructure in important geographic locations to our portfolio.
As I mentioned earlier, we also successfully completed four acquisitions of Fee-for-Service businesses in 2010. Hoseasons added meaningful inventory to our highly successful U.K. Vacational business. The Tryp brand was a tuck-in opportunity for the Wyndham Hotel Group that significantly enhanced our international presence. The third, ResortQuest, is serving us our platform to enter the U.S. full-service vacation rentals business, which is estimated to be a $10 billion-industry. 
And in late November, we added James Villa Holidays, a leading and highly recognized brand in the U.K. to Mediterranean villa holiday market for consumers and property owners. James Villa Holidays is second only to Hoseasons in consumer awareness in the U.K. self-catering category. With the addition of approximately 2,300 properties and an excellent reputation, the acquisition gives us geographic and product expansion, growth opportunities in Europe. It provides scale in Spain and Portugal and gives us good representation in Greece. We're happy to welcome James Villa Holidays to the Wyndham Worldwide family. This brings me to our third focus area: expanding brand presence.
A key goal of ours has been to continue to grow the Wyndham Hotels and Resort brand. Wyndham brand openings were up over 60% in 2010. In the fourth quarter, we opened over 2,000 rooms, reflecting property additions in Orlando, Chicago, Baltimore and Hawaii, as well as international openings, including Los Cabos, Mexico; Panama City, Panama and Surfer's Paradise down in Australia.
Wyndham Hotel Group has always been focused on growing its system and increasing overall revenues through brand affiliations. These arrangements allow us to increase our overall presence with little or no capital investments. Last quarter, I told you about our alliance with Planet Hollywood. And just last month, we entered into an exclusive agreement with Chatwal Hotels & Resorts to franchise and manage its Dream and Night boutique hotel brands globally. We will position the Dream brand as a full-service lifestyle brand for gateway cities and resort destinations and the Night brand as an affordable chic full-service or limited-service hotel in primary and secondary markets. Adding these complementary brands to Wyndham Hotel Group's portfolio supports our objective of meeting guest needs with our hotel product for every kind of traveler. 
Of course, innovation and the best products in the world are meaningless without a base of loyal customers and a team of engaged employees. So let me conclude by spending a few moments on our culture. Our Count On Me! service culture and associate engagement are central to everything we do. Wyndham Worldwide culture's, family-friendly benefits and programs earned us a spot on the highly regarded Working Mother's magazine 100 Best Companies list. Several of our offices including Mexico City, Indianapolis, Orlando, Las Vegas and the New Jersey office here received prestigious 2010 Best Places to Work Awards. In recent, Landal GreenParks was named the most customer-friendly company in the Netherlands based on ratings by the Dutch public. Landal was invited to ring the opening bell on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, an incredible and well-deserved honor and a great example of the power of our associates living Wyndham Worldwide's Count on Me! values every day.
Before turning the call over to Tom, I'd like to note that excluding the tax benefit we enjoyed in 2010, which were a positive for us in 2010, our guidance this year reflects approximately a 15% EPS growth, which is at the top end of our guidance range. This EPS growth does not assume the application of any free cash flow in 2011 to reduce our shares outstanding. We expect continued improvement in the fundamentals of each of our businesses. And we have great confidence in Wyndham Worldwide's near and long-term prospects. 
And now I'll turn it over to Tom to review the financials. Tom?"
31063165,118481439,100922,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2011",2011-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Travel + Leisure Co.","Executives","Thank you, Steve. The fourth quarter was another strong quarter with earnings coming in $0.02 above the top end of our guidance range. In constant dollars and excluding the benefit of deferred revenues in the 2009, adjusted EBITDA increased 11%, reflectin",2124,"Thank you, Steve. The fourth quarter was another strong quarter with earnings coming in $0.02 above the top end of our guidance range. In constant dollars and excluding the benefit of deferred revenues in the 2009, adjusted EBITDA increased 11%, reflecting double-digit RevPAR growth and strengthen our Vacation Ownership business. In addition, our earnings per share benefited from a lower effective tax rate and lower interest expense, partially due to a reduction of value-added tax accruals. 
Our adjusted results exclude a $9 million pretax charge predominantly related to the elimination of RCI activity in our call center in St. John, Canada. This structural cost reduction is the result of ongoing success in moving more transactions to the Web for our RCI Exchange business.
We expect another charge of approximately $2 million in the second quarter of 2011 related to RCI exiting this center. And we anticipate approximately $9 million in annual cost savings as a result of the restructuring beginning in 2012. Also excluded from adjusted EBITDA is the $3 million pretax loss associated with the repurchase of an additional 10% of our convertible notes and related warrants in the fourth quarter of 2010. 
Now, as you know, the convertible bond structure, which includes warrants, generates dilution for share prices above $20. Today, we have repurchased approximately 50% of the notes and this morning, we announced the tender offer for the remaining notes. Following the tender offer, retirement of the warrants could reduce what we believe will be significant future dilution. At year end, share dilution associated with the warrants was approximately 3 million shares.
Free cash flow increased over 11% to $603 million for the full year compared with $541 million for 2009. And just as a reminder, we define free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less CapEx, equity investments and development advances, and excluding the cash payment related to contingent IRS tax liabilities.
We believe that cash is the great enabler of our long-term business goals and that our sustainable annual free cash flow was $600 million to $700 million will accelerate our EPS growth and enhance shareholder value by supporting further investment in the business, paying dividends and through share repurchase.
As Steve said, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders. Consistent with the dividend policy we established last year, which was to grow our dividend at least in line with earnings. The Board of Directors has authorized an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.15 per share, approximately a 28% payout at the midpoint of our 2011 net income guidance range.
Now, this growth approximates what we believe was our true growth in 2010, adjusting for deferred revenues in 2009 and the extraordinary tax benefits we achieved last year. 
Now, we also continue to repurchase shares. From the reinstatement of our program last February through yesterday, we have bought 9.7 million shares at an average price of $25.71 a share. We have $246 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. 
Now moving to operating performance for the quarter. Let's begin the segment review with the Wyndham Hotel Group. Revenues were up 9%, EBITDA increased 25% and margins improved over 300 basis points. This reflected higher RevPAR and corresponding royalty fees, lower bad debt expense and the absence of a $6 million asset impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2009.
As Steve mentioned earlier, RevPAR recovery has been strong across the globe. Systemwide RevPAR increased over 10% in the fourth quarter. In the U.S., RevPAR improved 8% versus a year ago with the vast majority coming from occupancy gain. In constant currency, RevPAR in China and the U.K. grew 18% and 13%, respectively. These three countries represent 84% of our total system. 
Excluding the Tryp acquisition, we opened over 54,000 rooms in 2010 and terminated approximately 52,000. Now apart from the 3,145 rooms related to the expiration of a low-margin contract for unbranded, affiliated room, which we chose not to review in the first quarter of 2010, we estimate that approximately half of the terminated rooms were due to financial difficulties for our franchisees. We expect these types of terminations to moderate over time as the economy continues to recover. In general, retaining our strong franchisees remains a key priority for our Lodging business. 
In the fourth quarter, we opened nearly 19,000 rooms. The franchise sales team did a great job of replenishing the pipeline, which approximated 103,000 rooms at year end. For the year, contract signings were up 9% compared with last year and we executed 363 conversion deals compared with 308 in the 2009, an 18% increase. On the new construction front, the international pipeline increased. However, the tight credit markets continued to suppress the domestic pipeline for new construction.
Wyndham Exchange & Rentals had a strong year in delivering their financial results, as expected, while completing three separate acquisitions. Revenue in constant currency was up 12% in the fourth quarter, reflecting the acquisitions of Hoseasons, ResortQuest and James Villa Holidays, which contributed $21 million in incremental revenues, as well as higher rental revenues in our Novasol and Landal GreenParks businesses. 
Adjusted EBITDA decreased 13% in the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting the seasonal effects on profits from the three acquisitions, which incurred costs that exceeded revenues by $6 million. Now excluding the impacts from these acquisitions, adjusted EBITDA for WER was flat. Windham Exchange and Rentals performance drivers were consistent with our expectations. The average number of exchange members and exchange revenue per member were relatively flat. Vacation rental transactions were up and average net price per vacation rental was down, primarily reflecting the effects of the acquisitions. 
Steve mentioned our progress in migrating transactions to the web at RCI. Since the launch of this initiative in 2008, we have captured approximately 130 basis points of margin improvement in the Wyndham Exchange & Rentals business segments. We expect another approximately 120 basis points over the next four years as we continue our technology and program enhancement initiatives. Remember, however, that the impact of this improvement may be obscured a bit in the overall segment performance due to make shift taking place with our lower margin Rentals businesses, growing more rapidly than the RCI Exchange business.
Now moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. This business once again delivered outstanding results. Revenues and EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2010 increased 8% and 19%, respectively, excluding the fourth quarter 2009 benefits associated with the deferred revenue roll-in.
These increases reflect strong execution in the business with volume per guests and tours in line with expectations, and tours considerably better than the fourth quarter of 2009. Fourth quarter 2010 results also reflected a lower provision for loan losses and higher EBITDA from consumer finance operations. We made good progress in building our pool of lifetime buyers of Vacation Ownership, with over 22,000 new owners being added in 2010. Within the WVO, our recurring Fee-for-Service Property Management business, increased revenue 6% in the quarter, primarily reflecting an increase in the number of managed units.
Consumer finance revenues were down approximately 2%, due to a decline in our contract receivable portfolio, while interest expense declined 32%, reflecting lower interest rates on our securitized debt. Delinquency and default rates in the portfolio continue to improve. Write-offs during the fourth quarter declined to 2.51% of the overall portfolio from 3% in the fourth quarter of 2009. The provision for loan losses was $82 million or 22.8% of gross VOI sales net of WAAM sales, down from 26.4% in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Now posted on our investor website is the comprehensive presentation that highlights the terrific attributes of our Vacation Ownership business, the significant improvements we've made to this business over the past few years and the strength of our asset-like, go-forward business model. In the coming months, you'll be happy to hear that WVO management team will be meeting with the financial community, so you can hear from them firsthand, while we continue be so excited about this business.
Moving to corporate expenses briefly. Excluding legacy-related items, corporate expenses were up, primarily reflecting foreign exchange, increased data security and IT expenses and tax consulting charges. Now information security enhancements will continue to be an important spending priority for us in 2011 as we face, like many other companies, an increasingly aggressive threat from hackers.
Our fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 27%, reflecting the tax credits we discussed last quarter.
Now let's turn to 2011 guidance. We'll post the full guidance including cash flow detail to our Investor Relations website following the call. To give you the  highlights, revenue guidance remains between $4 billion and $4.2 billion, up 5% to 9% from 2010 and EBITDA guidance is $925 million to $955 million, up 8% to 11% from 2010. Also, we expect annual free cash flow of $600 million to $700 million in 2011 and beyond. As we've discussed in prior quarters, we estimate that the effect of that cash properly deployed, could meaningfully increase our baseline EBITDA and earnings growth on a per share basis.
Now let's look at each business unit starting with our Hotel group. We expect RevPAR growth to be up 5% to 7% and a 1% to 3% increase in system size. We expect revenues to be between $675 million to $725 million and EBITDA in the range of $200 million and $250 million.
Moving to Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. Drivers are expected to be up slightly for our Exchange business and significantly higher for our Rentals business. Specifically, in exchange, we expect the average number of members to be flat and exchange revenue per member to be up 1% to 3%, reflecting higher transaction pricing and other member-related revenue.
In rentals, we expect transactions to be up 18% to 20%, and average net price per vacation rental to increased 18% to 20%, reflecting our recent acquisitions. Now, based on these drivers, we expect Wyndham Exchange and Rentals revenue of $1.375 billion and $1.475 billion and EBITDA of $325 million to $345 million.
At Wyndham Vacation Ownership, remember that we are concentrating on cash flow generation and a return profile of this business. So based on those objectives, we expect growth VOI sales to be up slightly from 2010 to $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, which includes, by the way,  approximately $150 million in gross WAAM sales. We expected 2% to 5% increase in Tours as we target more new owners and a 2% to 5% increase in volume per guest. We expect total segment revenues of between $1.9 million and $2.1 billion and EBITDA of $470 million to $500 million in 2011.
Now based on the improvements we've made to credit standards and the improved performance of the portfolio, we are projecting that the provision for loan losses will continue to decline modestly in 2011 to approximately 22% of gross VOI sales, excluding WAAM sales. We expect corporate expenses for the year of approximately $75 million to $85 million, primarily reflecting continued investment in information, security and IT, in general.
We expect depreciation and amortization to be between $180 million and $190 million, somewhat higher than 2010, reflecting the recent acquisitions and our technology upgrades at Wyndham Exchange and Rentals.
We expect interest expense of approximately $135 million to $145 million reflecting our current debt levels. Now remember our intention is to maintain a stable leverage ratio, which means we will likely add debt as we increase EBITDA.
In addition, we expect some charges for the early extinguishment of debt related to the convert tender that I mentioned earlier. These charges are excluded from our guidance and will be excluded from our adjusted results. 
We expect our effective tax rate for the year to be 39% compared with 34% compared in 2010. Now remember, the 2010 tax rate was lower due to the benefits from the utilization of multiple years of foreign tax credits.
We expect to spend $200 million to $225 million in CapEx and hotel development advancement. This is in higher than the recent years, reflecting approximately $50 million to complete the Bonnet Creek hotel near Walt Disney World. However, we expect spending for Timeshare inventory to be between $80 million and $90 million, a significant reduction from the $130 million we spent in 2010. 
We expect earnings per share for the year of $2.05 to $2.15 with a diluted share count of approximately 181 million shares, which assumes no share buybacks. These translates to approximately 15% EPS growth at the top end of our guidance range, excluding the tax benefit in 2010. Finally, for the first quarter, we expect earnings per share of between $0.37 and $0.41 per share. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve."

So at WHG, the margin story in the fourth quarter or the Hotel Group was really very positive.
At WER, we have two, sort of, macro factors at work here. We have the positive incremental movement and margin improvement in our Exchange business because of this movement to the Web and our announcement today of restructuring in our call center in Canada will yield a structural improvement, further structural improvement in margins and our Exchange business. The issue is, there are two factors that are offsetting that somewhat. Factor number one is that the Rental business just has lower margins than the Exchange business and the Rentals business will grow faster especially with the aid of acquisition than the Exchange business. But there's a second factor related to Rental and it's a seasonal factor and that is that when you look at the business on a quarterly basis, which we try not to do, but we know that we need to speak to it, we had seasonal effects. The fact is that in Europe, in our U.S. Vacation Rental business, we just don't have as much revenue in the winter than we do in the summer and the spring. So we have an added compounding effect. It's a seasonal factor that works against us. So that's when you're looking at it on a quarterly basis, but sort of at a macro level, we have these two competing trends of margin improvement and exchange, but faster growth in our lower margin Rentals business."

So it's definitely in a better place than it was and it's been a difficult market in Germany for quite some time. So that's an improvement. And I think also if you just, Chris, go back up and look at what happened in 2009, frankly, in this business, when people were worried about the world falling apart, and this business performed exceedingly well. And that's the result of the fact that we've got terrific brands, but also terrific products in locations of very high demand.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We ended the year a high note with fourth quarter adjusted EPS coming in $0.02 ahead of the top end of our guidance range.

We ended the year a high note with fourth quarter adjusted EPS coming in $0.02 ahead of the top end of our guidance range. For the year, excluding the benefit of deferred revenues we had in the 2009, revenues increased 8% and adjusted EBITDA increased 17%, demonstrating continued strong execution across our businesses.
2010 was a great year at Wyndham Worldwide. We generated $603 million in free cash flow just above the top end of our range. We used that cash to both grow our businesses and return capital to shareholders. 
A year ago, we tripled our dividend, and today, we announced another 25% increase, reflecting the real growth of our businesses, our confidence in the future and our continued commitment to return cash to shareholders.
In 2010, we utilized $237 million to repurchase approximately 9.3 million shares of our common stock. We used another $212 million to repurchase approximately 50% of our convertible notes and related warrants, reducing current and potential future share dilution. And we invested $232 million in our businesses before acquisitions for Fee-for-Service businesses that will drive higher EBITDA and cash flow for years to come.
So for those keeping score, we returned 42% of our available cash flow to shareholders through dividend and share repurchases, 30% to acquire complementary businesses to fuel future growth and 28% to retired convertible debt.
On the operating front, each of our three business units exceeded its 2010 plan and made significant progress towards its strategic goals. At Wyndham Vacation Ownership, we drove VPG to new levels and launched our Asset Affiliation Model, signing three deals and generating sales ahead of our expectations.
In our Exchange and Rental business, we enhanced our leadership position in service rentals with three terrific acquisitions. RCI signed 74 new long-term affiliations and renewed its affiliation with the Disney Vacation Club in a multi-year agreement. Also in exchange, we achieved 29% online Web share, more than doubling our online shares since we began our initiative to enhance RCI.com in 2008. To capture similar success in our Lodging business, we launched the Apollo initiative, which will improve our value proposition to franchisees and consumers and enable us to capture incremental RevPAR and room growth. 
I'll bring you up-to-date on the most recent achievements in a moment, but first, let me spend a minute on what we're seeing across our businesses and around the world. In general, we continue to see signs of gradual economic recovery. In Lodging, the outlook in the hotel owner community has significantly improved, and we expect asset trading to increase in 2011 as the credit markets continue to improve. The RevPAR rebound that we experienced in the U.S. in 2010 continues to gain momentum globally. 
Our European Rentals business was also off to a great start in 2011. We believe the significant decline in unemployment in Germany and pent-up demand from December's inclement weather are two contributing factors supporting broad demand, as evidenced by a year-over-year increase of 11% in rental volume, excluding the acquisitions that we made in January of 2011.
RCI recently held its annual affiliate event in New York. The event brought together more than 55 Timeshare developers and industry leaders to celebrate a year of collaboration and success and to learn more about how RCI can continue to help their businesses.
While credit markets for Timeshare developers are still in the recovery process, sentiment among the developers who attended the event was markedly positive. Of course, nowhere is the health of the Timeshare industry more evident than at Wyndham Vacation Ownership, where we ended the year with adjusted EBITDA of 32% above 2009, excluding the impact of deferred revenue. So against that backdrop of improving economic conditions, we're focused on ensuring we capture more than our fair share of the recovery and that we continue to fuel our growth for many years to come. 
Today, I want to discuss four themes that will help ensure we achieve these goals: First, our emphasis on innovation; second, rebound single portfolio towards Fee-for-Service businesses; third, expanding brand presence; and finally, our customer service and associates engagement culture.
First, let's discuss innovation, a central theme here at Wyndham Worldwide. We're deploying technology in new and creative ways to provide more innovative interfaces and service delivery for business partners and consumers. As you know, RCI has been leading the way on this front and in November, we implemented our most significant technology upgrade ever. These enhancements give members the ability to combine deposits to trade up and to receive change back from an exchange when the trading power of their Timeshare is greater than the trading power of the Timeshare they're trading into.
These are transformational changes in the vacation exchange industry. We went live with these improvements in November, on schedule and without a hitch.
Member and affiliate response has been positive. Members love the ability to combine deposits and receive change back and they view these options as fair and member-friendly. Through January, over 75% of exchange transactions resulted in members receiving change back that they can use for future exchanges and approximately 10% of exchange transactions resulted from combined deposits, meaning members were able to exchange into a better unit by combining the Timeshare that they owned.
The Hotel Group is also leveraging innovative technology to enhance the customer experience. As part of our Apollo initiative, during the fourth quarter, we launched enhanced outsell, which enabled cross selling functionality for all brands across all Wyndham Hotel Group websites. We are also upgrading all of our brand websites. We recently completed test designs for Baymont, Super 8, Days Inn and the Ramada and are in the process of soliciting content from over 6,000 franchisee sites. We expect to launch these sites with mobile website functionality in the summer of 2011 and will follow shortly, thereafter, with the remainder of our brands. 
Our focus on innovation extends beyond technology to product development as evidenced by the significant process we've made with our Asset Affiliation Model at Wyndham Vacation Ownership. We also introduced product innovations in our RCI business with our premium membership product, RCI Points Platinum, which offers many benefits including opportunities for last-minute upgrades and priority viewing of specialty inventory.
Next, let me share the progress we've made on rebounds in our portfolio to emphasize Fee-for-Service businesses. Last month, we announced our third WAAM deal at Smuggler's Notch near Stowe, Vermont. Smuggler's Notch is consistently recognized as a top-rated destination for family-friendly vacations. This affiliation aligns with our business model providing vacation experiences for families, facilitates our expansion in New England and provides our owners with another world-class vacation property. And today, we're announcing our fourth WAAM deal at Emerald Grande in Destin, Florida, which adds yet another world-class luxury resort on Florida's Gulf Coast through our Vacation Ownership. The four deals we've announced in the last 12 months including our option to take additional units within these resorts would provide enough inventory to meet our current WAAM target of 15% to 20% of gross vacation ownership sales over the next five years. As importantly, in addition to executing our Fee-for-Service model, these are brand-enhancing product additions, adding valuable infrastructure in important geographic locations to our portfolio.
As I mentioned earlier, we also successfully completed four acquisitions of Fee-for-Service businesses in 2010. Hoseasons added meaningful inventory to our highly successful U.K. Vacational business. The Tryp brand was a tuck-in opportunity for the Wyndham Hotel Group that significantly enhanced our international presence. The third, ResortQuest, is serving us our platform to enter the U.S. full-service vacation rentals business, which is estimated to be a $10 billion-industry. 
And in late November, we added James Villa Holidays, a leading and highly recognized brand in the U.K. to Mediterranean villa holiday market for consumers and property owners. James Villa Holidays is second only to Hoseasons in customer and consumer awareness in the U.K. self-catering category. With the addition of approximately 2,300 properties and an excellent reputation, the acquisition gives us geographic and product expansion, growth opportunities in Europe. It provides scale in Spain and Portugal and gives us good representation in Greece. We're happy to welcome James Villa Holidays to the Wyndham Worldwide family. This brings me to our third focus area: expanding brand presence.
A key goal of ours has been to continue to grow the Wyndham Hotels and Resort brand. Wyndham brand openings were up over 60% in 2010. In the fourth quarter, we opened over 2,000 rooms, reflecting property additions in Orlando, Chicago, Baltimore and Hawaii, as well as international openings, including Los Cabos, Mexico; Panama City, Panama and Surfer's Paradise down in Australia.
Wyndham Hotel Group has always been focused on growing its system and increasing overall revenues through brand affiliations. These arrangements allow us to increase our overall presence with little or no capital investments. Last quarter, I told you about our alliance with Planet Hollywood. And just last month, we entered into an exclusive agreement with Chatwal Hotels & Resorts to franchise and manage its Dream and Night boutique hotel brands globally. We will position the Dream brand as a full-service lifestyle brand for gateway cities and resort destinations and the Night brand as an affordable chic full-service or limited-service hotel in primary and secondary markets. Adding these complementary brands to Wyndham Hotel Group's portfolio supports our objective of meeting guest needs with our hotel product for every kind of traveler. 
Of course, innovation and the best products in the world are meaningless without a base of loyal customers and a team of engaged employees. So let me conclude by spending a few moments on our culture. Our Count On Me! service culture and associate engagement are central to everything we do. Wyndham Worldwide’s culture, family-friendly benefits and programs earned us a spot on the highly regarded Working Mother's magazine 100 Best Companies list. Several of our offices including Mexico City, Indianapolis, Orlando, Las Vegas and the New Jersey office here received prestigious 2010 Best Places to Work Awards. In recent, Landal GreenParks was named the most customer-friendly company in the Netherlands based on ratings by the Dutch public. Landal was invited to ring the opening bell on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, an incredible and well-deserved honor and a great example of the power of our associates living Wyndham Worldwide's Count on Me! values every day.
Before turning the call over to Tom, I'd like to note that excluding the tax benefit we enjoyed in 2010, which were a positive for us in 2010, our guidance this year reflects approximately a 15% EPS growth, which is at the top end of our guidance range. This EPS growth does not assume the application of any free cash flow in 2011 to reduce our shares outstanding. We expect continued improvement in the fundamentals of each of our businesses. And we have great confidence in Wyndham Worldwide's near and long-term prospects. 
And now I'll turn it over to Tom to review the financials. Tom?"
31063165,118481439,101077,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2011",2011-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Travel + Leisure Co.","Executives","Thank you, Steve. The fourth quarter was another strong quarter with earnings coming in $0.02 above the top end of our guidance range. In constant dollars and excluding the benefit of deferred revenues in the 2009, adjusted EBITDA increased 11%, reflectin",2124,"Thank you, Steve. The fourth quarter was another strong quarter with earnings coming in $0.02 above the top end of our guidance range. In constant dollars and excluding the benefit of deferred revenues in the 2009, adjusted EBITDA increased 11%, reflecting double-digit RevPAR growth and strengthen our Vacation Ownership business. In addition, our earnings per share benefited from a lower effective tax rate and lower interest expense, partially due to a reduction of value-added tax accruals. 
Our adjusted results exclude a $9 million pretax charge predominantly related to the elimination of RCI activity in our call center in St. John, Canada. This structural cost reduction is the result of ongoing success in moving more transactions to the Web for our RCI Exchange business.
We expect another charge of approximately $2 million in the second quarter of 2011 related to RCI exiting this center. And we anticipate approximately $9 million in annual cost savings as a result of the restructuring beginning in 2012. Also excluded from adjusted EBITDA is the $3 million pretax loss associated with the repurchase of an additional 10% of our convertible notes and related warrants in the fourth quarter of 2010. 
Now, as you know, the convertible bond structure, which includes warrants, generates dilution for share prices above $20. Today, we have repurchased approximately 50% of the notes and this morning, we announced the tender offer for the remaining notes. Following the tender offer, retirement of the warrants could reduce what we believe will be significant future dilution. At year end, share dilution associated with the warrants was approximately 3 million shares.
Free cash flow increased over 11% to $603 million for the full year compared with $541 million for 2009. And just as a reminder, we define free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less CapEx, equity investments and development advances, and excluding the cash payment related to contingent IRS tax liabilities.
We believe that cash is the great enabler of our long-term business goals and that our sustainable annual free cash flow was $600 million to $700 million will accelerate our EPS growth and enhance shareholder value by supporting further investment in the business, paying dividends and through share repurchase.
As Steve said, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders. Consistent with the dividend policy we established last year, which was to grow our dividend at least in line with earnings. The Board of Directors has authorized an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.15 per share, approximately a 28% payout at the midpoint of our 2011 net income guidance range.
Now, this growth approximates what we believe was our true underlying growth in 2010, adjusting for deferred revenues in 2009 and the extraordinary tax benefits we achieved last year. 
Now, we also continue to repurchase shares. From the reinstatement of our program last February through yesterday, we have bought 9.7 million shares at an average price of $25.71 a share. We have $246 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. 
Now moving to operating performance for the quarter. Let's begin the segment review with the Wyndham Hotel Group. Revenues were up 9%, EBITDA increased 25% and margins improved over 300 basis points. This reflected higher RevPAR and corresponding royalty fees, lower bad debt expense and the absence of a $6 million asset impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2009.
As Steve mentioned earlier, RevPAR recovery has been strong across the globe. Systemwide RevPAR increased over 10% in the fourth quarter. In the U.S., RevPAR improved 8% versus a year ago with the vast majority coming from occupancy gain. In constant currency, RevPAR in China and the U.K. grew 18% and 13%, respectively. These three countries represent 84% of our total system. 
Excluding the Tryp acquisition, we opened over 54,000 rooms in 2010 and terminated approximately 52,000. Now apart from the 3,145 rooms related to the expiration of a low-margin contract for unbranded, affiliated room, which we chose not to review in the first quarter of 2010, we estimate that approximately half of the terminated rooms were due to financial difficulties for our franchisees. We expect these types of terminations to moderate over time as the economy continues to recover. In general, retaining our strong franchisees remains a key priority for our Lodging business. 
In the fourth quarter, we opened nearly 19,000 rooms. The franchise sales team did a great job of replenishing the pipeline, which approximated 103,000 rooms at year end. For the year, contract signings were up 9% compared with last year and we executed 363 conversion deals compared with 308 in the 2009, an 18% increase. On the new construction front, the international pipeline increased. However, the tight credit markets continued to suppress the domestic pipeline for new construction.
Wyndham Exchange & Rentals had a strong year in delivering their financial results, as expected, while completing three separate acquisitions. Revenue in constant currency was up 12% in the fourth quarter, reflecting the acquisitions of Hoseasons, ResortQuest and James Villa Holidays, which contributed $21 million in incremental revenues, as well as higher rental revenues in our Novasol and Landal GreenParks businesses. 
Adjusted EBITDA decreased 13% in the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting the seasonal effects on profits from the three acquisitions, which incurred costs that exceeded revenues by $6 million. Now excluding the impacts from these acquisitions, adjusted EBITDA for WER was flat. Windham Exchange and Rentals performance drivers were consistent with our expectations. The average number of exchange members and exchange revenue per member were relatively flat. Vacation rental transactions were up and average net price per vacation rental was down, primarily reflecting the effects of the acquisitions. 
Steve mentioned our progress in migrating transactions to the web at RCI. Since the launch of this initiative in 2008, we have captured approximately 130 basis points of margin improvement in the Wyndham Exchange & Rentals business segments. We expect another approximately 120 basis points over the next four years as we continue our technology and program enhancement initiatives. Remember, however, that the impact of this improvement may be obscured a bit in the overall segment performance due to a make shift taking place with our lower margin Rentals businesses, growing more rapidly than the RCI Exchange business.
Now moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. This business once again delivered outstanding results. Revenues and EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2010 increased 8% and 19%, respectively, excluding the fourth quarter 2009 benefits associated with deferred revenue roll-in.
These increases reflect strong execution in the business with volume per guests and tours in line with expectations, and tours considerably better than the fourth quarter of 2009. Fourth quarter 2010 results also reflected a lower provision for loan losses and higher EBITDA from consumer finance operations. We made good progress in building our pool of lifetime buyers of Vacation Ownership, with over 22,000 new owners being added in 2010. Within WVO, our recurring Fee-for-Service Property Management business, increased revenue 6% in the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting an increase in the number of managed units.
Consumer finance revenues were down approximately 2%, due to a decline in our contract receivable portfolio, while interest expense declined 32%, reflecting lower interest rates on our securitized debt. Delinquency and default rates in the portfolio continue to improve. Write-offs during the fourth quarter declined to 2.51% of the overall portfolio from 3% in the fourth quarter of 2009. The provision for loan losses was $82 million or 22.8% of gross VOI sales net of WAAM sales, down from 26.4% in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Now posted on our investor website is the comprehensive presentation that highlights the terrific attributes of our Vacation Ownership business, the significant improvements we've made to this business over the past few years and the strength of our asset-like, go-forward business model. In the coming months, you'll be happy to hear that WVO management team will be meeting with the financial community, so you can hear from them firsthand, why we continue be so excited about this business.
Moving to corporate expenses briefly. Excluding legacy-related items, corporate expenses were up, primarily reflecting foreign exchange, increased data security and IT expenses and tax consulting charges. Now information security enhancements will continue to be an important spending priority for us in 2011 as we face, like many other companies, an increasingly aggressive threat from hackers.
Our fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 27%, reflecting the tax credits we discussed last quarter.
Now let's turn to 2011 guidance. We'll post the full guidance including cash flow details to our Investor Relations website following the call. To give you the  highlights, revenue guidance remains between $4 billion and $4.2 billion, up 5% to 9% from 2010 and EBITDA guidance is $925 million to $955 million, up 8% to 11% from 2010. Also, we expect annual free cash flow of $600 million to $700 million in 2011 and beyond. As we've discussed in prior quarters, we estimate that the effect of that cash properly deployed, could meaningfully increase our baseline EBITDA and earnings growth on a per share basis.
Now let's look at each business unit starting with our Hotel group. We expect RevPAR growth to be up 5% to 7% and a 1% to 3% increase in system size. We expect revenues to be between $675 million to $725 million and EBITDA in the range of $200 million and $250 million.
Moving to Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. Drivers are expected to be up slightly for our Exchange business and significantly higher for our Rentals business. Specifically, in exchange, we expect the average number of members to be flat and exchange revenue per member to be up 1% to 3%, reflecting higher transaction pricing and other member-related revenue.
In rentals, we expect transactions to be up 18% to 20%, and average net price per vacation rental to increased 18% to 20%, reflecting our recent acquisitions. Now, based on these drivers, we expect Wyndham Exchange and Rentals revenue of $1.375 billion and $1.475 billion and EBITDA of $325 million to $345 million.
At Wyndham Vacation Ownership, remember that we are concentrating on cash flow generation and a return profile of this business. So based on those objectives, we expect growth VOI sales to be up slightly from 2010 to $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, which includes, by the way,  approximately $150 million in gross WAAM sales. We expected 2% to 5% increase in Tours as we target more new owners and a 2% to 5% increase in volume per guest. We expect total segment revenues of between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion and EBITDA of $470 million to $500 million in 2011.
Now based on the improvements we've made to credit standards and the improved performance of the portfolio, we are projecting that the provision for loan losses will continue to decline modestly in 2011 to approximately 22% of gross VOI sales, excluding WAAM sales. We expect corporate expenses for the year of approximately $75 million to $85 million, primarily reflecting continued investment in information, security and IT, in general.
We expect depreciation and amortization to be between $180 million and $190 million, somewhat higher than 2010, reflecting the recent acquisitions and our technology upgrades at Wyndham Exchange and Rentals.
We expect interest expense of approximately $135 million to $145 million reflecting our current debt levels. Now remember our intention is to maintain a stable leverage ratio, which means we will likely add debt as we increase EBITDA.
In addition, we expect some charges for the early extinguishment of debt related to the convert tender that I mentioned earlier. These charges are excluded from our guidance and will be excluded from our adjusted results. 
We expect our effective tax rate for the year to be 39% compared with 34% in 2010. Now remember, the 2010 tax rate was lower due to the benefits from the utilization of multiple years of foreign tax credits.
We expect to spend $200 million to $225 million in CapEx and hotel development advancements. This is in higher than the recent years, reflecting approximately $50 million to complete the Bonnet Creek hotel near Walt Disney World. However, we expect spending for Timeshare inventory to be between $80 million and $90 million, a significant reduction from the $130 million we spent in 2010. 
We expect earnings per share for the year of $2.05 to $2.15 with a diluted share count of approximately 181 million shares, which assumes no share buybacks. This translates to approximately 15% EPS growth at the top end of our guidance range, excluding the tax benefit in 2010. Finally, for the first quarter, we expect earnings per share of between $0.37 and $0.41 per share. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve."

So at WHG, the margin story in the fourth quarter or the Hotel Group was really very positive.
At WER, we have two, sort of, macro factors at work here. We have the positive incremental movement and margin improvement in our Exchange business because of this movement to the Web and our announcement today of restructuring in our call center in Canada will yield a structural improvement, further structural improvement in margins and our Exchange business. The issue is, there are two factors that are offsetting that somewhat. Factor number one is that the Rental business just has lower margins than the Exchange business and the Rentals business will grow faster especially with the aid of acquisition than the Exchange business. But there's a second factor related to Rental and it's a seasonal factor and that is that when you look at the business on a quarterly basis, which we try not to do, but we know that we need to speak to it, we had seasonal effects. The fact is that in Europe, in our U.S. Vacation Rental business, we just don't have as much revenue in the winter then we do in the summer and the spring. So we have an added compounding effect. It's a seasonal factor that works against us. So that's when you're looking at it on a quarterly basis, but sort of at a macro level, we have these two competing trends of margin improvement and exchange, but faster growth in our lower margin Rentals business."

So it's definitely in a better place than it was and it's been a difficult market in Germany for quite some time. So that's an improvement. And I think also if you just, Chris, go back up and look at what happened in 2009, frankly, in this business, when people were worried about the world falling apart, and this business performed exceedingly well. And that's the result of the fact that we've got terrific brands, but also terrific products in locations of very high demand. So even when demand may sag in general, the product that we have is still very highly sought after. So it performed well during a really tough downturn and we continue to see it do well now."

First quarter revenues increased 7% and adjusted EBITDA increased 13%. Adjusted EPS for the quarter grew 29% and came in $0.03 above the top end of our guidance range. These results reflect continued economic improvement in the U.S. and strong operational performance in each of our businesses. They also reflect the growing benefit from our commitment to ongoing share repurchases. Performance was strong across the company with each of our businesses delivering solid growth and adjusted EBITDA. In the Lodging business, RevPAR was at a strong 7% with gains in both occupancy and rates. Wyndham Exchange and Rentals delivered another great quarter. In Vacation Ownership, we saw good growth in property management revenues and continuing improvement in delinquency and default rates in the loan portfolio. Free cash flow was robust in the quarter at over $1 per share. We completed our most successful timeshare securitization deal and also repurchased most of our outstanding convert and warrants, reducing our full-year diluted share count by 2 million shares. And finally, our board authorized a $500 million increase to our share repurchase program. Overall, great results across the board. 
The World Travel and Tourism Council forecast that over the next 10 years, the global travel and tourism economy will grow by 4.3% per year. This implies the travel and tourism share of the global economy will rise to just over 10%. We believe that that growth will be broad-based standing many regions and product offering. We are strongly positioned to benefit from that growth. Our product portfolio is geographically and demographically diverse. The breadth of our offerings protected our results in the downturn and is now supporting our growth in the recovery. And it will continue to fuel our expansion for years to come. 
Let me spend a moment on some recent announcement in our state that have generated a lot of questions from investors. The first is the announced spinoff of Marriott's Timeshare Business. Over the next several months, we will all hear more about the way this transaction will be structured, and we look forward to the opportunity for investors to give forth more familiar with the Timeshare Business. While recent private transaction has been priced around 10x EBITDA, existing multiples described in timeshare businesses of public companies are still far below the valuations that existed prior to the economic downturn. 
Another recent development was the final on March 11 by Home Way Inc. for the $230 million initial public offering. Home Way is an online vacation rental company with 2010 revenues of $168 million. The vacation and rentals market is a large and highly fragmented market with significant growth opportunities globally. There are 2 operating models in this market today. First is the rent by owner or listings model. In this model, the vacation homeowner lists his or her property on her website for a listing fee. The listings company refers the potential renter back to the homeowner to inquire about availability, make the reservation and process payment. The second model is the professionally managed model. This is primarily how our European rentals and resort businesses operate. Of course, we also list properties on the Internet and over 60% of our bookings are transacted online. We provide real-time, bookable inventory that we hand-select and annually inspect. Homeowners provide homes to us primarily on an exclusive and commissionable basis. Unlike the listings model, the consumer rarely deals with the homeowner. We process all payments and handle customer service for their stay. When in vacations model leverages our years of expertise in sales, marketing and vacation rental operations. From check-in to check out, consumers can book with trust and confidence because Wyndham is standing behind them every step of the way. Our acquisition ResortQuest combined with our leadership position in Europe makes us the world's largest company in the professionally managed segment of this growing market. Revenues from our Vacation Rentals businesses in 2010 were approximately $500 million. We have approximately 93,000 properties in 32 countries representing over 51,000 homeowners. We are highly trusted by over 1 million families who vacation with us each year. It is an excellent base for continued growth. The worldwide rentals market is estimated at $85 billion, and we think there's plenty of room for both models to grow. Our belief in the potential of this business is evidenced by our 3 acquisitions in this space last year. We look forward to showing both consumers and investors what we can do in this business. So while these recent events are external to Wyndham Worldwide, we think they underscore the strength and advantages of our businesses and business model. 
Let me now spend a few moments to give you an update on progress in our business units in the first quarter. The hotel group continues to focus on international expansion. Over the past 2 years, we have accelerated our international development efforts to leverage existing relationships and develop multi-unit deals. We are achieving great success. For example, in the first quarter, we executed 2 deals Doha, a 246-room Wyndham Grand and a 300-room Planet Hollywood with the owner of 111 room Ramada Encore that recently opened. All 3 properties are five-star products in great locations. In March, we signed an agreement to develop at least 10 Super 8 hotels in Poland with the same owner over the next 5 years. And last week, we announced the master development agreement for more than 75 new construction Microtel hotels in Canada over the next 25 years. A principal of our partner there in Canada was part of a team that signed the Master Development Agreement for the Super 8 brand in Canada back in 1992. They have since grown that brand's portfolio to include approximately 130 Super 8 hotels throughout every province in Canada. We look forward to the team's continued success. Of course, a critical component of our strategy is developing the Wyndham brand. Through organic growth, acquisition and brand strategy, we have grown to over 60,000 rooms carrying the Wyndham flag, double the number that we acquired the brand in October of 2005, when we had a timeshare units by the Wyndham flag the total increases doubled over 80,000 rooms. We have underway a series of technology and business enhancements and improving the value proposition to our hotel owners. Recall this initiatives Apollo. In our most recent project, we began an effort with our franchisees to improve the content and navigation of our websites. We look forward to launching a beta test that next month on one of our brands and will continue with additional releases throughout the year. 
Now moving to Exchange and Rentals. Four weeks ago I attended the Arctic Conference, which is the timeshare industry's annual trade convention. We had tremendous attendance by RCA's largest affiliates at the conference, and I was encouraged by the number of new, non-US developers that attended this year. We had meetings with developers from India, Brazil, Asia and the Caribbean. Interest in timeshare is growing as is interest in RCI. We are very pleased to announce during the show our new and exclusive multiyear affiliations with Vacation Club, one of Asia's premier developers of luxury timeshare products; Palace Resorts New Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in the Dominican Republic and Fairmont Hotels and Resorts Luxurious Fairmont Heritage Plates recently signed an agreement with the Registry Collection. The Registry Collections is RCI factional timeshare program, which boasts over 180 luxury properties around the world. The highlight of the artist show for me was RCI's selection as the recipient of the Innovator of the Year award, for developing technologies through RCI.com that provides substantially greater transparency in the timeshare exchange business. We built upon that success earlier this month with our recent release of RCI.com. The upgrade included the Phase I launch of RCI Platinum 4 weeks members, RCI TV enhancements and new tools to enable interaction with Facebook. 
Now let's touch on Vacation Ownership. While the traditional timeshare model continues to perform very well, we are also excited by the progress we are making in our Asset Affiliation Model or WAAM. March 10 marked the anniversary of our first WAAM sales. We went from $0 to almost $70 million in gross sales in 12 months. It's a homerun for us and for developers. WVO has begun a multiyear initiative called Project Voyager, which is designed to improve our inventory and reservation systems. The goal is to get our owners on more vacations each and every year. Our owner satisfaction, which is extremely high, is tied to the frequency with which the user vacation ownership and with higher satisfaction comes multiple benefits such as higher upgrade sales, improved lead generation, increased on-time payments and, most importantly, a better experience for our owners. Through a series of technology enhancements anticipated to be complete in early 2013, we will maximize vacation planning during the booking process, enhance reservation capability and improve our website experience with greater self-service options. We will keep you apprised of additional developments of this project, which we believe will have long-term beneficial impact on our business. 
Before I turn the call over to Tom, let me repeat that we are confident in the strength of our business models and our ability to execute our operating and financial growth plans to deliver shareholder value. How confident are we? We spent approximately $255 million on share repurchases so far this year, which is more than we spent on repurchases all of last year. And the board has recently increased our current program by $500 million, the largest increase in authorization since we listed on the New York Stock Exchange 5 years ago. And now I'll turn it over to Tom to review the financials."
31063165,129551372,117998,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2011",2011-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Travel + Leisure Co.","Executives","Thank you, Steve. As Steve said, the first quarter was strong with adjusted earnings per share coming in 29% ahead of 2010 and $0.03 above the top end of our guidance range., due to continued business momentum, sound expense management and continued share",1723,"Thank you, Steve. As Steve said, the first quarter was strong with adjusted earnings per share coming in 29% ahead of 2010 and $0.03 above the top end of our guidance range., due to continued business momentum, sound expense management and continued share repurchases. Adjusted EBITDA increased 13% reflecting improve RevPAR performance, favorable loan loss trends in our Vacation Ownership business and growth in our European Rentals business. Our adjusted net income excludes the following after tax items: An $8 million benefit related to legacy items, a non-cash impairment charge of $8 million to reduce the value of an international joint venture in the Hotel business; an interest cost of $7 million related to the repurchase of the convertible notes. Free cash flow increased to $185 million for the quarter compared to $166 million in 2010. On a per-share basis, free cash flow was $1.03 for the quarter compared with $0.89 in 2010. That reflects a 16% increase in free cash flow per share. 
Going forward, when I talked about free cash flow, I will express it in a per-share term to better reflect the impact of our share repurchase program. So to re-state, we believe that cash is the great enabler of our long-term business goals and that our sustainable and growing annual free cash flow of $3.50 to $4.05 per diluted share based on our diluted share count guidance of 173 million shares will accelerate our growth and enhance shareholder value by supporting further investment in the business, dividends and share repurchases. 
Now lets start to review with the capital markets where we had a very busy and productive quarter with 3 well-executed transactions. First, we issued $250 million of senior unsecured notes at a coupon rate of 5.6%. We used the proceeds to repurchase a significant portion of the remaining balance of our convertible debt and the associated warrants. The rationale was to reduce our fully diluted share count by 3 million shares on an annualized basis and reduce potential dilution as well. Our overall debt balance at quarter end was essentially unchanged from year end 2010 and well within our targeted investment grade range. 
Turning to the ABS markets, last month we announced a $400 million time-share securitization with an unprecedented advance rate of 98% and a weighted average cost of 3.7%. The transaction was oversubscribed, enabling us to increase the size of the offering. Overall, the deal produced $100 million more in cash than we had been projecting. Securitize borrowings are shown under financing activities on the cash flow statement, so this had no impact on free cash flow, but it is a significant contributor to overall cash availability. This was great work by our treasury and WVO finance and consumer finance teams who couldn't have done it if not for the outstanding sales effort of our sales and marketing team at WVO. 
Now moving to operating performance for the quarter. Let me begin by saying that the integration of our 2010 acquisitions, all seasons, the Tryp brand, Resort Quest and James Villa Holidays is going extremely well. We expect each to meet or exceed the earnings targets that were set up in acquisition. Combined, these companies will contribute over $30 million to our 2011 EBITDA. As importantly, they would each contribute meaningful growth for years to come. We are pleased with the significant progress we are making on this front. 
So let's begin the segment review with both Wyndham Hotel Group. Revenues were up 3% due to improved RevPAR in the 2010 Tryp acquisition. Adjusted EBITDA was up 21%, again reflecting RevPAR improvement and lower costs. Adjusted margins improved fully 390 basis points. RevPAR was up 7.4% reflecting occupancy gains of 5.8% and rate improvement of 1.4%. We saw occupancy gains across all regions in all chain scales segments. We're beginning to achieve rate gains in the Domestic Upscale and midscale segments without compromising occupancy. This bodes well for the continued recovery in the Economy segment, which is 2/3 of our system. We ended the quarter with approximately 609,600 hotel rooms worldwide. Development efforts in the quarter were robust. We terminated 12,488 rooms in the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. Consistent with our recent experience, approximately 65% of the terminated rooms were related to financial difficulties for our franchisees. So while the tide has turned and we are in the upswing of what we believe will be a multiyear lodging industry recovery, we have yet to see a significant improvement in franchisee financial health. However, as I said in the last call, we do expect these types of terminations to moderate over time as the economy continues to recover. We also eliminated 2,766 rooms related to the impairment of an international joint venture, which I mentioned earlier. Now our partner in the joint venture has an indirect relationship with the Libyan Government Investment Fund and given uncertainties related to Libyan-related entities, we recorded a write-down of the investment and eliminated the rooms for more aggregate room total, even though the contract is ongoing. The joint venture produced minimal EBITDA last year. We opened over 12,000 rooms, our highest level of activity in any first quarter ever and the pipeline held steady. The development team delivered 160 this quarter, up 58% compared with a year ago. Now a little over a third of these new deals were are internationally based, mostly in China, India and the politically stable Middle Eastern markets. Wyndham Exchange and Rentals had a good quarter with the Exchange business performing in line with expectations and Rentals slightly better than expected, despite some softening in the U.K. market. Segment revenues increased to $356 million reflecting $31 million in incremental revenues from our recent rentals acquisitions and a $2 million benefit from currency in the Exchange business. Excluding the acquisition-related incremental revenues and the impact of foreign currency, revenues increased 8%, driven by favorable pricing and volumes at Novasol. Exchange revenues increased 3% in the quarter compared with the same period in 2010. Average members and exchange members revenues per member both reflected modest increases in the first quarter of 2011 compared with the same period last year. The acquisition of  Hoseasons Group  Resort Quest and James Villa Holidays contributed $25 million of incremental rental revenue during the quarter. Excluding the acquisition, rental revenues increased 19%, reflecting a 10% increase in average net price per vacation rental and an 8% increase in transaction volume. Overall, adjusted EBITDA for WER increased 11% in the quarter compared with the same period in 2010, primarily reflecting a higher revenue contribution from Novasol, which primarily services customers in Germany and Denmark and sound expense management. The segment margin, excluding the acquisitions, was 28.9%, reflecting some margin improvement in both the Exchange and Rentals business. However, as expected, the makeshift created by the acquisitions in the Rentals business resulted in an adjusted margin decline of close to 200 basis points. 
Now moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. This business once again delivered solid results. Revenues increased 1.4% towards the plan and volume was slightly below plan as we continue to focus on new-owner generation. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter 2011 was $96 million, compared with $82 million in the first quarter of 2010. Now this increase reflects the absence of litigation reserve we took in the first quarter of 2010, lower loan loss provision and strong property management results. 
Now the Property Management business, which produced $50 million of EBITDA in 2010, continue to produce a recurring fee-for-service revenue stream with revenues growing 10%. Consumer finance revenues were down approximately 3% due to a decrease in our contract receivables portfolio while interest expense decreased 12%, reflecting lower interest rates on our secure ties debt, partly offset by a higher average securitized debt balance. Now remember that higher advance rates improved cash flow but decreased EBITDA as the interest on securitized debt is reported above the EBITDA line. Delinquency int default rates in the portfolio continue to improve. Writeups during the first quarter were $85 million, down from $96 million a year ago. The provision for loan losses was $79 million, compared with $86 million in the first quarter of 2010. On a quarterly calls, we have been expressing writeoffs relative to the overall portfolio and the provision relative to growth vacation ownership interest sales. Some of you have told that this is not how you think about these figures, so to simplify things going forward, we'll give you the absolute numbers so you can calculate the ratios that are most meaningful to you. 
Moving to Corporate, excluding legacy-related items, expenses increased $6 million, primarily reflecting increased information security and IT expenses. As I said on the last call, information security is an important spending priority. Like many companies, we have faced and will continue to face an increasingly aggressive threats from cyber criminals. We are investing in our systems infrastructure and hiring additional information security staff to address this threat. We will keep you updated on the progress in this important area. 
Now, let me spend a few moments on guidance. For the second quarter, we expect earnings per share of $0.53 to $0.56. As you saw from the press release, we are raising our full year EPS guidance from $2.05 to $2.15 to $2.15 to $2.25, $0.10 increase on both the lower and upper end of the range. The new EPS guidance is based on an expected diluted share count of 173 million shares, down from our original guidance of 181 million shares. This new guidance reflects the benefits of our share repurchase program to date and our repurchase of significant portion of the convertible notes. This guidance excludes any future share repurchases from our half a billion dollar share repurchase program authorization increase. We expect to be at the high-end of our full-year EBITDA guidance of 9 25 to 9 55 but ar enot raising our guidance range at this time. While we are seeing good momentum in each of our businesses, there remains economic uncertainty in Europe, especially in the U.K. where austerity measures have dampened consumer confidence. In addition, as discussed, we expect higher corporate costs related to information security and other IT spending, which could somewhat offset our operating momentum. So with all of that, I'll turn the call back to Steve."

You know that the nature of that business is that there are really 2 distinct sales. channels, I mean there are many channels, but in general  you either sell to a new person or you upgrade an existing owner. And we are making a concerted effort, a strategically important effort, to make sure that we continue to grow that new ownership base, because the economics of the new owner acquisition ar e sort of marginal breakeven on the initial sales, but really the nature of the business is to upgrade that first-time buyer to be a lifetime buyer of timeshare. And now on the upgrade, our margins are more like 40% to 50%. So we want to make sure that we never lose sight of the fact that the upgrade profitability will be ensured only if we continue to bring in a steady flow of new owners and this year we're targeting around 25,000 to 35,000 owners which are important for our future growth. So BPG declines because our 12 full makeshift has been more favorably to the new owner, who is more expensive owner to secure than an upgrade. And so I think the VPG on an upgrade is over 3,000. The VPG on new owners are around are 1,500. So we are new owner acquisition through VPG is bound to come down but within upgrade and within no owner, within those distinct categories. Upgrade was about the same VPG we had last year, so no deterioration in the upgrade component. And on new owners, new owner VPG actually improved somewhat, but it's that mixed shift. The third question you had was..."

The fact is that we went back and did a very analysis over a comparative analysis for the last 1990 with the information we have available and there really is no correlation between our hotel activity occupancy and rate and fuel prices. There are other factors that have more correlation, for example, consumer confidence, I think was one that had more maybe GDP growth, had more correlation, but there is really not much correlation. When we look at this in the last down -- last increase in fuel prices and what happened with our hotels, what we found is that people may change their travel patterns. If you're up in the Northeast, you might decide going to Washington for vacation instead of down to Orlando, so you cut your trip shorter. But you're still staying in our product and in fact, as people become more value conscious, that kind of plays right into our hands because we have a value leisure play."

Having 50,000 new customers means our marketing costs would be higher because we're generating a new tour and a new tour cost more than an upgrade to generate. In addition, our close rate will go down a little bit because we close higher on upgrade sales than we do on new sales. So VPG will be impacted if we went up to 50,000 new customers. We think we're at the right balance now. We think by adding 25,000, we're freshening our pool of new and existing owners that we will have adequate upgrade opportunities running out into the foreseeable future. So we're comfortable at that level. But we could change it. We had a higher dose sales generation, customer generation back when we were at $2 billion sales base, for example. On the second question about the WAAM and is there a lot of competition. There are other people who are looking at the WAAM type model, there's other was executing on it. The good thing is just like going fishing in the spring when the brooks are fully stock. There's a lot of fish out there, so it's kind of easy to pull them in. Because there's a lot of product out there. So I don't think that that's an issue for us at all frankly. And the third one on acquisitions, and seeing less acquisitions. I wouldn't say there we're seeing less. I would probably say that 2010 was probably a little bit unusual that we get 4 deals done. The fact was there was a lot of uncertainty during 2008, 2009 timeframe, as we all know. We didn't stop working on things. We didn't stop our team from looking at opportunities. And that may have created a little bit of backlog that all got completed in 2010. But we continue to look at opportunities. We continue to be active in this arena. And again, you can't model when they're going to come out. We can't model the opportunity of when the deals are available and will happen. So I wouldn't say that we're not seeing anything or the market is dry. We're using this opportunity, the lack of deal the deal closings to buy back more stock."

The first question, I don't know if I would say that there is more professionally managed in Europe than in U.S. There definitely is more organized and consolidated professionally managed presence in Europe. In the U.S., a lot of the professionally managed are done by small owners in the markets that have managed a couple of moments and they don't buy into any large network. In the Europe and the U.K., it is a much more organized and consolidated effort businesses that we have over there has been around for decades. They basically a lot of small people into their network, and their network provides them marketing opportunities far superior to what a local, small owner could do. I don't know if I look at the landscape that I would say there's a lot more in one market than the other. There probably is because it's more organized in Europe, a larger presence of professionally managed to Europe but there are also exist professionally managed in the U.S. It's just not under a number of an umbrella brand or brands that really present themselves other than ResortQuest. As for the second half of the question, which is related to, are we listings company or we are professionally managed. We are professionally managed. The reason I mentioned that we still do a good of our product our transactions on the Internet is I don't want people to think that we are using the Internet as a source for distribution and marketing. We absolutely do. But we don't just take a listing fee from somebody and put their product up on the market, on the Internet and then let the consumer contact the person who put it up on our listing service. We manage the product that we show on our system, which allows us to have this really good inventory, bookable inventory model, where you can go on light and immediately book what you want versus going to the process of contacting the owner of the home. Again, I think there's plenty of room for both models in the market, there's a very large fragmented market and so are excited about the growth of this market overall that are produced and our participation in it."

On the second question, about U.K., we just have one thing. The U.K. travelers, the second largest market for us to market to in Europe, the German traveler is the largest, the U.K. traveler is the second largest traveler for European traveler. I agree with your comment about with the austerity measures, will that modify maybe  and make the U.K. traveler within the U.K. better. But it can also decrease the a number of U.K. to Europe kind of traveler. So we plan on both of them. So we are pretty well protected but the fact is the U.K. traveler may end up staying more within the U.K. versus going to Continental Europe. And that's the reason we might see some shift there in which case we may have more product to market to the Dutch and German travelers. And it looks like we're out of time and so we appreciate everybody being on the call and look forward to talking to you at the end next quarter. Enjoy your spring."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We are starting the year on a high note. First quarter revenues increased 7% and adjusted EBITDA increased 13%. Adjusted EPS for the quarter grew 29% and came in $0.03 above the top end",1665,"Thank you, Margo. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We are starting the year on a high note. First quarter revenues increased 7% and adjusted EBITDA increased 13%. Adjusted EPS for the quarter grew 29% and came in $0.03 above the top end of our guidance range. 
These results reflect continued economic improvement in the U.S. and strong operational performance in each of our businesses. They also reflect the growing benefit from our commitment to ongoing share repurchases. Performance was strong across the company with each of our businesses delivering solid growth in adjusted EBITDA. 
In the Lodging business, RevPAR [revenue per available room] was up a strong 7%, with gains in both occupancy and rates. Wyndham Exchange and Rentals delivered another great quarter. In Vacation Ownership, we saw a good growth in property management revenues and continuing improvement in delinquency and default rates in the Loan portfolio. 
Free cash flow was robust in the quarter at over $1 per share. We completed our most successful timeshare securitization deal and also repurchased most of our outstanding convert and warrants, reducing our full-year diluted share count by 2 million shares. 
And finally, our board authorized a $500 million increase to our share repurchase program. Overall, great results across the board. 
The World Travel and Tourism Council forecast that over the next 10 years, the global travel and tourism economy will grow by 4.3% per year. This implies the travel and tourism share of the global economy will rise to just over 10%. We believe that, that growth will be broad-based, spanning many regions and product offerings. We are strongly positioned to benefit from that growth. 
Our product portfolio is geographically and demographically diverse. The breadth of our offerings protected our results in the downturn and is now supporting our growth in the recovery. And it will continue to fuel our expansion for years to come. 
Let me spend a moment on some recent announcement in our space that have generated a lot of questions from investors. The first is the announced spinoff of Marriott's Timeshare business. Over the next several months, we will all hear more about the way this transaction will be structured, and we look forward to the opportunity for investors to get more familiar with the Timeshare business. 
While recent private transaction has been priced around 10x EBITDA, existing multiples ascribed to timeshare businesses of public companies are still far below the valuations that existed prior to the economic downturn. 
Another recent development was the filing on March 11 by HomeAway, Inc. for the $230 million initial public offering. HomeAway is an online vacation rental company with 2010 revenues of $168 million. The vacation rentals market is a large and highly fragmented market with significant growth opportunities globally. 
There are 2 operating models in this market today. First is the rent by owner or listings model. In this model, the vacation homeowner lists his or her property on a website for a listing fee. The listings company refers the potential renter back to the homeowner to inquire about availability, make the reservation and process payment. 
The second model is the professionally managed model. This is primarily how our European rentals and ResortQuest businesses operate. Of course, we also list properties on the Internet and over 60% of our bookings are transacted online. We provide real-time, bookable inventory that we hand-select and annually inspect. 
Homeowners provide homes to us primarily on an exclusive and commissionable basis. Unlike the listings model, the consumer rarely deals with the homeowner. We process all payments and handle customer service for their stay. When in vacations model leverages our years of expertise in sales, marketing and vacation rental operations. From check-in to check out, consumers can book with trust and confidence because Wyndham is standing behind them every step of the way. 
Our acquisition of ResortQuest, combined with our leadership position in Europe, makes us the world's largest company in the professionally managed segment of this growing market. Revenues from our Vacation Rental businesses in 2010 were approximately $500 million. We have approximately 93,000 properties in 32 countries, representing over 51,000 homeowners. We are highly trusted by over 1 million families who vacation with us each year. It's an excellent base for continued growth. 
The worldwide rentals market is estimated at $85 billion, and we think there's plenty of room for both models to grow. Our belief in the potential of this business is evidenced by our 3 acquisitions in this space last year. We look forward to showing both consumers and investors what we can do in this business. So while these recent events are external to Wyndham Worldwide, we think they underscore the strength and advantages of our businesses and business model. 
Let me now spend a few moments to give you an update on progress in our business units in the first quarter. The Hotel group continues to focus on international expansion. Over the past 2 years, we have accelerated our international development efforts to leverage existing relationships and develop multi-unit deals. We are achieving great success. 
For example, in the first quarter, we executed 2 deals in Doha, a 246-room Wyndham Grand and a 300-room Planet Hollywood, with the owner of 111 room Ramada Encore that recently opened. All 3 properties are 5-star products in great locations. 
In March, we signed an agreement to develop at least 10 Super 8 hotels in Poland, with the same owner over the next 5 years. And last week, we announced the master development agreement for more than 75 new construction Microtel hotels in Canada over the next 25 years. 
A principal of our partner there in Canada was part of a team that signed the master development agreement for the Super 8 brand in Canada back in 1992. They have since grown that brand's portfolio to include approximately 130 Super 8 hotels throughout every province in Canada. We look forward to the team's continued success. 
Of course, a critical component of our strategy is developing the Wyndham brand. Through organic growth, acquisition and brand strategy, we have grown to over 60,000 rooms carrying the Wyndham flag, double the number than we acquired the brand in October of 2005. When we add in the timeshare units flying the Wyndham flag, the total increases double over 80,000 rooms. 
We have underway a series of technology and business enhancement aimed at improving the value proposition to our hotel owners. We call these initiatives ""Apollo."" In our most recent project, we began an effort with our franchisees to improve the content and navigation of our websites. We look forward to launching a beta test next month on one of our brands, and will continue with additional releases throughout the year. 
Now moving to Exchange and Rentals. Four weeks ago, I attended the ARDA [American Resort Development Association] Conference, which is the timeshare industry's annual trade convention. We had tremendous attendance by RCI's largest affiliates at the conference, and I was encouraged by the number of new, non-US developers that attended this year. 
We had meetings with developers from India, Brazil, Asia and the Caribbean. Interest in timeshare is growing as is interest in RCI. We are very pleased to announce during the show our new and exclusive multiyear affiliations with the Anantara Vacation Club, one of Asia's developers of luxury timeshare products; Palace Resorts' new Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in the Dominican Republic; and Fairmont Hotels & Resorts' luxurious Fairmont Heritage Place, recently signed an agreement with The Registry Collection. 
The Registry Collection is RCI's fractional timeshare exchange program, which boasts over 180 luxury properties around the world. The highlight of the ARDA show for me was RCI's selection as the recipient of the Innovator of the Year award, for developing technologies through RCI.com that provides substantially greater transparency in the timeshare exchange business. 
We built upon that success earlier this month with our recent release of RCI.com. The upgrade included the Phase 1 launch of RCI Platinum for Weeks [RCI Weeks] members, RCI TV enhancements and new tools to enable interaction with Facebook. 
Now let's touch on Vacation Ownership. While the traditional timeshare model continues to perform very well, we are also excited by the progress we are making in our Asset Affiliation Model or WAAM [Wyndham Asset Affiliation Model]. March 10 marked the anniversary of our first WAAM sale. We went in from $0 to almost $70 million in gross sales in 12 months. It's a homerun for us and for developers. 
WVO [Wyndham Vacation Ownership] has begun a multiyear initiative called Project Voyager, which is designed to improve our inventory and reservation systems. The goal is to get our owners on more booked vacations each and every year. Our owner satisfaction, which is extremely high, is tied to the frequency with which the user vacation ownership. And with higher satisfaction comes multiple benefits, such as higher upgrade sales, improved lead generation, increased on-time payments and most importantly, a better experience for our owners. 
Through a series of technology enhancements anticipated to be complete in early 2013, we will maximize vacation planning during the booking process, enhance reservations capability and improve our website experience with greater self-service options. We will keep you apprised of additional developments with this project, which we believe will have long-term beneficial impact on our business. 
Before I turn the call over to Tom, let me repeat that we are confident in the strength of our business models and our ability to execute our operating and financial growth plans to deliver shareholder value. How confident are we? We spent approximately $255 million on share repurchases so far this year, which is more than we spent on repurchases all of last year. And the board has recently increased our current program by $500 million, the largest increase in authorization since we listed on the New York Stock Exchange 5 years ago. 
And now I'll turn it over to Tom to review the financials. Tom?"
31063165,129551372,118193,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2011",2011-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Travel + Leisure Co.","Executives","Thank you, Steve. As Steve said, the first quarter was strong with adjusted earnings per share coming in 29% ahead of 2010 and $0.03 above the top end of our guidance range, due to continued business momentum, sound expense management and continued share",1729,"Thank you, Steve. As Steve said, the first quarter was strong with adjusted earnings per share coming in 29% ahead of 2010 and $0.03 above the top end of our guidance range, due to continued business momentum, sound expense management and continued share repurchases. 
Adjusted EBITDA increased 13% reflecting improve RevPAR performance, favorable loan loss trends in our Vacation Ownership business and growth in our European Rentals business. Our adjusted net income excludes the following after tax items: an $8 million benefit related to legacy items, a non-cash impairment charge of $8 million to reduce the value of an international joint venture in the Hotel business, an interest cost of $7 million related to the repurchase of the convertible notes. 
Free cash flow increased to $185 million for the quarter compared with $166 million in 2010. On a per share basis, free cash flow was $1.03 for the quarter compared with $0.89 in 2010. That reflects a 16% increase in free cash flow per share. 
Going forward, when I talk about free cash flow, I will express it in a ""per share"" term to better reflect the impact of our share repurchase program. 
So to restate, we believe that cash is the great enabler of our long-term business goals and that our sustainable and growing annual free cash flow of $3.50 to $4.05 per diluted share, based on our diluted share count guidance of 173 million shares, will accelerate our growth and enhance shareholder value by supporting further investment in the business, dividends and share repurchases. 
Now let's start to review with the capital markets, where we had a very busy and productive quarter with 3 well-executed transactions. First, we issued $250 million of senior unsecured notes at a coupon rate of 5.6%. We used the proceeds to repurchase a significant portion of the remaining balance of our convertible debt and the associated warrants. 
The rationale was to reduce our fully diluted share count by 3 million shares on an annualized basis and reduce potential dilution as well. Our overall debt balance at quarter end was essentially unchanged from year end 2010 and well within our targeted investment grade range. 
Turning to the ABS markets, last month we announced a $400 million timeshare securitization with an unprecedented advance rate of 98% and a weighted average cost of 3.7%. The transaction was oversubscribed, enabling us to increase the size of the offering. Overall, the deal produced $100 million more in cash than we had been projecting. 
Securitized borrowings are shown under financing activities on the cash flow statement, so this had no impact on free cash flow, but it is a significant contributor to overall cash availability. This was great work by our treasury and WVO finance and consumer finance teams, who couldn't have done it if not for the outstanding sales effort of our sales and marketing team at WVO. 
Now moving to operating performance for the quarter. Let me begin by saying that the integration of our 2010 acquisitions, Hoseasons [Hoseasons Group], the Tryp brand, ResortQuest and James Villa Holidays is going extremely well. We expect each to meet or exceed the earnings targets that were set up at acquisition. Combined, these companies will contribute over $30 million to our 2011 EBITDA. As importantly, they will each contribute meaningful growth for years to come. We are pleased with the significant progress we are making on this front. 
So let's begin the segment review with both Wyndham Hotel Group. Revenues were up 3% due to improved RevPAR in the 2010 Tryp acquisition. Adjusted EBITDA was up 21%, again reflecting RevPAR improvement and lower costs. Adjusted margins improved fully 390 basis points. RevPAR was up 7.4% reflecting occupancy gains of 5.8% and rate improvement of 1.4%. We saw occupancy gains across all regions in all chain scale segments. 
We're beginning to achieve rate gains in the domestic upscale and midscale segments without compromising occupancy. This bodes well for the continued recovery in the economy segment, which is 2/3 of our system. 
We ended the quarter with approximately 609,600 hotel rooms worldwide. Development efforts in the quarter were robust. We terminated 12,488 rooms in the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. Consistent with our recent experience, approximately 65% of the terminated rooms were related to financial difficulties for our franchisees. So while the tide has turned and we are in the upswing of what we believe will be a multiyear lodging industry recovery, we have yet to see a significant improvement in franchisee financial health. 
However, as I said in the last call, we do expect these types of terminations to moderate over time as the economy continues to recover. We also eliminated 2,766 rooms related to the impairment of an international joint venture, which I mentioned earlier. 
Now our partner in the joint venture has an indirect relationship with the Libyan government investment fund. And given uncertainties related to Libyan-related entities, we recorded a write-down of the investment and eliminated the rooms for more aggregate room total, even though the contract is ongoing. The joint venture produced minimal EBITDA last year. 
We opened over 12,000 rooms, our highest level of activity in any first quarter ever and the pipeline held steady. The development team delivered 160 of this quarter, up 58% compared with a year ago. Now a little over 1/3 of these new deals were internationally based, mostly in China, India and the politically-stable Middle Eastern markets. 
Wyndham Exchange and Rentals had a good quarter, with the Exchange business performing in line with expectations and Rentals slightly better than expected, despite some softening in the U.K. market. Segment revenues increased to $356 million, reflecting $31 million in incremental revenues from our recent rentals acquisitions and a $2 million benefit from currency in the Exchange business. 
Excluding the acquisition-related incremental revenues and the impact of foreign currency, revenues increased 8%, driven by favorable pricing and volumes at Novasol. Exchange revenues increased 3% in the quarter compared with the same period in 2010. Average members and exchange members revenues per member both reflected modest increases in the first quarter of 2011 compared with the same period last year. 
The acquisition of  Hoseasons, ResortQuest and James Villa Holidays contributed $25 million of incremental rental revenue during the quarter. Excluding the acquisition, rental revenues increased 19%, reflecting a 10% increase in average net price per vacation rental and an 8% increase in transaction volume. 
Overall, adjusted EBITDA for WER [Wyndham Exchange and Rentals] increased 11% in the quarter compared with the same period in 2010, primarily reflecting a higher revenue contribution from Novasol, which primarily services customers in Germany and Denmark and sound expense management. 
The segment margin, excluding the acquisitions, was 28.9%, reflecting some margin improvement in both the Exchange and Rentals business. However, as expected, the mixed shift created by the acquisitions in the Rentals business resulted in an adjusted margin decline of close to 200 basis points. 
Now moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. This business once again delivered solid results. Revenues increased 1.4%, tours tracked to plan and volume for guests was slightly below plan as we continue to focus on new owner generation. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter 2011 was $96 million, compared with $82 million in the first quarter of 2010. Now this increase reflects the absence of a litigation reserve we took in the first quarter of 2010, lower loan loss provision and strong property management results. 
Now the Property Management business, which produced $50 million of EBITDA in 2010, continue to produce a recurring fee-for-service revenue stream with revenues growing 10%. Consumer finance revenues were down approximately 3% due to a decrease in our contract receivables portfolio, while interest expense decreased 4%, reflecting lower interest rates on our securitized debt, partly offset by a higher average securitized debt balance. 
Now remember that higher advance rates improve cash flow but decrease EBITDA, as the interest on securitized debt is reported above the EBITDA line. 
Delinquency and default rates in the portfolio continue to improve. Write-offs during the first quarter were $85 million, down from $96 million a year ago. The provision for loan losses was $79 million, compared with $86 million in the first quarter of 2010. 
On our quarterly calls, we have been expressing write-offs relative to the overall portfolio and the provision relative to gross vacation ownership interest sales. Some of you have told us that this is not how you think about these figures, so to simplify things going forward, we'll give you the absolute numbers so you can calculate the ratios that are most meaningful to you. 
Moving to corporate, excluding legacy-related items, expenses increased $6 million, primarily reflecting increased information security and IT expenses. As I said on the last call, information security is an important spending priority. Like many companies, we have faced and will continue to face an increasingly aggressive threat from cyber criminals. 
We are investing in our systems infrastructure and hiring additional information security staff to address this threat. We will keep you updated on our progress in this important area. 
Now, let me spend a few moments on guidance. For the second quarter, we expect earnings per share of $0.53 to $0.56. As you saw from the press release, we are raising our full year EPS guidance from $2.05 to $2.15, to $2.15 to $2.25, $0.10 increase on both the lower and upper end of the range. The new EPS guidance is based on an expected diluted share count of 173 million shares, down from our original guidance of 181 million shares. 
This new guidance reflects the benefits of our share repurchase program to date and our repurchase of a significant portion of the convertible notes. This guidance excludes any future share repurchases from our $0.5 billion share repurchase authorization increase. We expect to be at the high-end of our full-year EBITDA guidance of $925 million to $955 million, but are not raising our guidance range at this time. 
While we are seeing good momentum in each of our businesses, there remains economic uncertainty in Europe, especially in the U.K. where austerity measures have dampened consumer confidence. In addition, as discussed, we expect higher corporate costs related to information security and other IT spending, which could somewhat offset our operating momentum. 
So with all of that, I'll turn the call back to Steve."

Could you just talk about the operating leverage in the Lodging segment, just broadly, and the sustainability of it? Because it's very impressive that you can show essentially 3% or so top line growth and 21% EBITDA growth. And so to how we should think about that over the next couple of years. And then on the Vacation Ownership side, you did note that you were seeing lower volume per guest. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about that and how the profitability for that lays out over the next couple of years? And then the final thing, just on the financing sales under WAAM, are you moving forward with that? Are you being more aggressive on providing financing to those customers as another way to enhance that business?"

So the operating leverage we think absolutely is sustainable as RevPAR recovers and we manage cost. So the formula in the first quarter was a simple one, RevPAR growth of 7% help drive operating leverage and then we had some cost -- we had tighter cost management. And there were 1 or 2 costs that we incurred, sort of extraordinary costs in 2010 first quarter, that we didn't experience. But in general, there was also cost leverage as well. So we believe that's sustainable. We expect that there's going to be a multiyear, and I think you do as well. Lodging recovery will get our fair share of that. And we'll continue to see operating leverage take place in that business unit, so definitely sustainable. The second question you had that I can recall was WVO and VPG, our volume per guest. And so you know that the nature of that business, Steve, is that there are really 2 distinct sales channels. I mean there are many channels, but in general, you either sell to a new person or you upgrade an existing owner. And we are making a concerted effort, a strategically important effort, to make sure that we continue to grow that new ownership base, because as you know the economics of the new owner acquisition are sort of marginal breakeven at the initial sale. But really, the nature of the business is to upgrade that first-time buyer to be a lifetime buyer of timeshare. And now on the upgrade, our margins are more like 40% to 50%. So we want to make sure that we never lose sight of the fact that the upgrade profitability will be ensured, only if we continue to bring in a steady flow of new owners. And this year, we're targeting around 25,000 to 35,000 owners, which are important for our future growth. And so VPG declines because our tour flow mix shift has been more favorably to the new owner, who is a more expensive owner to secure than an upgrade. And so I think the VPG on an upgrade is over $3,000. The VPG on new owners, around 1,500. And so when you're doing more new owner acquisition, your VPG is bound to come down. But within upgrade and within new owner, within those distinct categories, upgrade was about the same VPG we had last year, so no deterioration in the upgrade component. And on new owners, new owner VPG actually improved somewhat, but it's that mixed shift. The third question you had was..."

But you're absolutely right. If I were looking at a deal right now, we'd probably be providing the financing, not letting somebody else do it. And Steve, just going back to the VPG question for a minute that Tom answered. One way to look at it numerically, because we all love numbers, is if you look at our Table 3, it shows our tour volume and our VPG broken down by quarter. And what you'll see is that the VPG was down a little bit 2010 to 2011, and the tour flow was up, about 11%. If you go back to 2009, you'll see a similar tour flow level and now our VPG is above what it was back then. Just go to Tom's point, that our underlying upgrade sales VPG is up, it's just more of a mix issue. You can kind of see it there in the numbers."

There are other factors that have more correlation, for example, consumer confidence, I think was one that had more maybe GDP growth, had more correlation but there's really not much correlation. When we look at this in the last downturn, the last increase in fuel prices and what happened with our hotels, what we found is that people may change their travel patterns. If you're up in the Northeast, you might decide that you're going to Washington for vacation instead of down to Orlando, so you cut your trip shorter, but you're still staying in our product.

On the first question about VPG and what the impact is and what we think about having 50,000 new customers versus 25,000 new customers, you're correct in the fact that if we wanted to have 50,000, we could probably have 50,000. Having 50,000 new customers means our marketing costs would be higher because we're generating a new tour, and a new tour cost more than an upgrade to generate. In addition, our close rate would go down a little bit because we close higher on upgrade sales than we do on new sales. So VPG will be impacted if we went up to 50,000 new customers. We think we're at the right balance now. We think by adding 25,000, we're freshening our pool of new potential of existing owners that we will have adequate upgrade opportunities running out into the foreseeable future. So we're comfortable at that level. But we could change it. We have a higher new sales generation, the customer generation back when we were at $2 billion sales base, for example. On the second question about the WAAM and is there a lot of competition. There are other people who are looking at the WAAM-type model, there's other who are executing on it. The good thing is, it's like going fishing in the spring when the brooks are fully stocked. There's a lot of fish out there, so it's kind of easy to pull them in, because there's a lot of product out there. So I don't think that that's an issue for us at all, frankly. And the third one on acquisitions, and seeing less acquisitions. I wouldn't say there we're seeing less. I would probably say that 2010 was probably a little bit unusual that we get 4 deals done. The fact was there was a lot of uncertainty during the 2008, 2009 time frame, as we all know. We didn't stop working on things. We didn't stop our team from looking at opportunities. And that may have created a little bit of backlog that all got completed in 2010. But we continue to look at opportunities. We continue to be active in this arena. And again, you can't model when they're going to come out. We can't model the opportunity of when the deals are available and will happen. So I wouldn't say that we're not seeing anything or that the market is dry. It's just, we're using this opportunity, the lack of deal the deal closings to buy back more stock. Thanks."

The first question, I don't know that I would say that there's more professionally managed in Europe than the U.S. There definitely is a more organized and consolidated professionally managed presence in Europe. In the U.S., a lot of the professionally managed are done by real small real owners at the market that happened to manage a couple of moments and they don't tie in any large network. In the Europe and the U.K., it is a much more organized and consolidated effort, so the businesses that we have over there has been around for decades. They basically rolled in a lot of the small people into their network, and their network provides them marketing opportunities far superior to what a local, small real owner could do. So I don't know if I looked at the landscape that I would say that there's a lot more in one market or the other. There probably is because it's more organized in Europe, a larger presence of professionally managed to Europe, but there are also exist professionally managed in the U.S. It's just not under an umbrella brand or brands that really present itself other than ResortQuest. As for the second half of the question, which related to, are we a listings company or are we a professionally managed? We are professionally managed. The reason I mentioned that we still do a good of our product, our transactions on the Internet, is I don't want people to think that we are using the Internet as a source for distribution and marketing. We absolutely do, but we don't just take a listing fee from somebody and put their product up on the market, on the Internet and then let the consumer contact the person who put it up on our listing service. We manage the product that we show on our system, which allows us to have this really good inventory, bookable inventory model, where you can go online and immediately book what you want versus going through the process of contacting the owner of the home. Again, we think there's plenty of room for both models in the market. There's a very large fragmented market and so we're excited about the growth of this market overall, and our participation in it."

I agree with your comment about with the austerity measures, will that modify maybe a make the U.K. traveler within the U.K. better. But it can also decrease the a number of U.K. to Europe kind of Europe traveler. So we plan on both of them. So we're pretty well protected, but the fact is, the U.K. traveler may end up staying more within the U.K. versus going to Continental Europe.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We are starting the year on a high note. First quarter revenues increased 7% and adjusted EBITDA increased 13%. Adjusted EPS for the quarter grew 29% and came in $0.03 above the top end",1666,"Thank you, Margo. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We are starting the year on a high note. First quarter revenues increased 7% and adjusted EBITDA increased 13%. Adjusted EPS for the quarter grew 29% and came in $0.03 above the top end of our guidance range. 
These results reflect continued economic improvement in the U.S. and strong operational performance in each of our businesses. They also reflect the growing benefit from our commitment to ongoing share repurchases. Performance was strong across the company with each of our businesses delivering solid growth in adjusted EBITDA. 
In the Lodging business, RevPAR [revenue per available room] was up a strong 7%, with gains in both occupancy and rates. Wyndham Exchange and Rentals delivered another great quarter. In Vacation Ownership, we saw a good growth in property management revenues and continuing improvement in delinquency and default rates in the Loan portfolio. 
Free cash flow was robust in the quarter at over $1 per share. We completed our most successful timeshare securitization deal and also repurchased most of our outstanding convert and warrants, reducing our full-year diluted share count by 2 million shares. 
And finally, our board authorized a $500 million increase to our share repurchase program. Overall, great results across the board. 
The World Travel and Tourism Council forecast that over the next 10 years, the global travel and tourism economy will grow by 4.3% per year. This implies that travel and tourism’s share of the global economy will rise to just over 10%. We believe that, that growth will be broad-based, spanning many regions and product offerings. We are strongly positioned to benefit from that growth. 
Our product portfolio is geographically and demographically diverse. The breadth of our offerings protected our results in the downturn and is now supporting our growth in the recovery. And it will continue to fuel our expansion for years to come. 
Let me spend a moment on some recent announcement in our space that have generated a lot of questions from investors. The first is the announced spinoff of Marriott's Timeshare business. Over the next several months, we will all hear more about the way this transaction will be structured, and we look forward to the opportunity for investors to get more familiar with the Timeshare business. 
While recent private transaction has been priced around 10x EBITDA, existing multiples ascribed to timeshare businesses of public companies are still far below the valuations that existed prior to the economic downturn. 
Another recent development was the filing on March 11 by HomeAway, Inc. for the $230 million initial public offering. HomeAway is an online vacation rental company with 2010 revenues of $168 million. The vacation rentals market is a large and highly fragmented market with significant growth opportunities globally.
There are 2 operating models in this market today. First is the rent by owner or listings model. In this model, the vacation homeowner lists his or her property on a website for a listing fee. The listings company refers the potential renter back to the homeowner to inquire about availability, make the reservation and process payment. 
The second model is the professionally managed model. This is primarily how our European rentals and ResortQuest businesses operate. Of course, we also list properties on the Internet and over 60% of our bookings are transacted online. We provide real-time, bookable inventory that we hand-select and annually inspect. 
Homeowners provide homes to us primarily on an exclusive and commissionable basis. Unlike the listings model, the consumer rarely deals with the homeowner. We process all payments and handle customer service for their stay. When in vacations model leverages our years of expertise in sales, marketing and vacation rental operations. From check-in to check out, consumers can book with trust and confidence because Wyndham is standing behind them every step of the way. 
Our acquisition of ResortQuest, combined with our leadership position in Europe, makes us the world's largest company in the professionally managed segment of this growing market. Revenues from our Vacation Rental businesses in 2010 were approximately $500 million. We have approximately 93,000 properties in 32 countries, representing over 51,000 homeowners. We are highly trusted by over 1 million families who vacation with us each year. It's an excellent base for continued growth. 
The worldwide rentals market is estimated at $85 billion, and we think there's plenty of room for both models to grow. Our belief in the potential of this business is evidenced by our 3 acquisitions in this space last year. We look forward to showing both consumers and investors what we can do in this business. So while these recent events are external to Wyndham Worldwide, we think they underscore the strength and advantages of our businesses and business model. 
Let me now spend a few moments to give you an update on progress in our business units in the first quarter. The Hotel group continues to focus on international expansion. Over the past 2 years, we have accelerated our international development efforts to leverage existing relationships and develop multi-unit deals. We are achieving great success. 
For example, in the first quarter, we executed 2 deals in Doha, a 246-room Wyndham Grand and a 300-room Planet Hollywood, with the owner of 111 room Ramada Encore that recently opened. All 3 properties are 5-star products in great locations. 
In March, we signed an agreement to develop at least 10 Super 8 hotels in Poland, with the same owner over the next 5 years. And last week, we announced the master development agreement for more than 75 new construction Microtel hotels in Canada over the next 25 years. 
A principal of our partner there in Canada was part of a team that signed a master development agreement for the Super 8 brand in Canada back in 1992. They have since grown that brand's portfolio to include approximately 130 Super 8 hotels throughout every province in Canada. We look forward to the team's continued success. 
Of course, a critical component of our strategy is developing the Wyndham brand. Through organic growth, acquisition and brand strategy, we have grown to over 60,000 rooms carrying the Wyndham flag, double the number that we acquired the brand in October of 2005. When you add in the timeshare units flying the Wyndham flag, the total increases to over 80,000 rooms. 
We have underway a series of technology and business enhancements aimed at improving the value proposition to our hotel owners. We call these initiatives ""Apollo."" In our most recent project, we began an effort with our franchisees to improve the content and navigation of our websites. We look forward to launching a beta test next month on one of our brands, and will continue with additional releases throughout the year. 
Now moving to Exchange and Rentals. Four weeks ago, I attended the ARDA [American Resort Development Association] Conference, which is the timeshare industry's annual trade convention. We had tremendous attendance by RCI's largest affiliates at the conference, and I was encouraged by the number of new, non-US developers that attended this year. 
We had meetings with developers from India, Brazil, Asia and the Caribbean. Interest in timeshare is growing as is interest in RCI. We are very pleased to announce during the show our new and exclusive multiyear affiliations with the Anantara Vacation Club, one of Asia's premiere developers of luxury timeshare products; Palace Resorts' new Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in the Dominican Republic; and Fairmont Hotels & Resorts' luxurious Fairmont Heritage Place, recently signed an agreement with The Registry Collection. 
The Registry Collection is RCI's fractional timeshare exchange program, which boasts over 180 luxury properties around the world. The highlight of the ARDA show for me was RCI's selection as the recipient of the Innovator of the Year award, for developing technologies through RCI.com that provides substantially greater transparency in the timeshare exchange business. 
We built upon that success earlier this month with our recent release of RCI.com. The upgrade included the Phase 1 launch of RCI Platinum for Weeks [RCI Weeks] members, RCI TV enhancements and new tools to enable interaction with Facebook.
Now let's touch on Vacation Ownership. While the traditional timeshare model continues to perform very well, we are also excited by the progress we are making in our Asset Affiliation Model or WAAM [Wyndham Asset Affiliation Model]. March 10 marked the anniversary of our first WAAM sale. We went in from $0 to almost $70 million in gross sales in 12 months. It's a homerun for us and for developers. 
WVO [Wyndham Vacation Ownership] has begun a multiyear initiative called Project Voyager, which is designed to improve our inventory and reservation systems. The goal is to get our owners on more booked vacations each and every year. Our owner satisfaction, which is extremely high, is tied to the frequency with which the user vacation ownership. And with higher satisfaction comes multiple benefits, such as higher upgrade sales, improved lead generation, increased on-time payments and most importantly, a better experience for our owners. 
Through a series of technology enhancements anticipated to be complete in early 2013, we will maximize vacation planning during the booking process, enhance reservations capability and improve our website experience with greater self-service options. We will keep you apprised of additional developments with this project, which we believe will have long-term beneficial impact on our business. 
Before I turn the call over to Tom, let me repeat that we are confident in the strength of our business models and our ability to execute our operating and financial growth plans to deliver shareholder value. How confident are we? We spent approximately $255 million on share repurchases so far this year, which is more than we spent on repurchases all of last year. And the board has recently increased our current program by $500 million, the largest increase in authorization since we listed on the New York Stock Exchange 5 years ago. 
And now I'll turn it over to Tom to review the financials. Tom?"
31063165,129551372,118289,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2011",2011-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Travel + Leisure Co.","Executives","Thank you, Steve. As Steve said, the first quarter was strong with adjusted earnings per share coming in 29% ahead of 2010 and $0.03 above the top end of our guidance range, due to continued business momentum, sound expense management and continued share",1730,"Thank you, Steve. As Steve said, the first quarter was strong with adjusted earnings per share coming in 29% ahead of 2010 and $0.03 above the top end of our guidance range, due to continued business momentum, sound expense management and continued share repurchases. 
Adjusted EBITDA increased 13% reflecting improve RevPAR performance, favorable loan loss trends in our Vacation Ownership business and growth in our European Rentals business. Our adjusted net income excludes the following after tax items: an $8 million benefit related to legacy items, a non-cash impairment charge of $8 million to reduce the value of an international joint venture in the Hotel business, an interest cost of $7 million related to the repurchase of the convertible notes. 
Free cash flow increased to $185 million for the quarter compared with $166 million in 2010. On a per share basis, free cash flow was $1.03 for the quarter compared with $0.89 in 2010. That reflects a 16% increase in free cash flow per share. 
Going forward, when I talk about free cash flow, I will express it in a ""per share"" term to better reflect the impact of our share repurchase program. 
So to restate, we believe that cash is the great enabler of our long-term business goals and that our sustainable and growing annual free cash flow of $3.50 to $4.05 per diluted share, based on our diluted share count guidance of 173 million shares, will accelerate our growth and enhance shareholder value by supporting further investment in the business, dividends and share repurchases. 
Now let's start a review with the capital markets, where we had a very busy and productive quarter with 3 well-executed transactions. First, we issued $250 million of senior unsecured notes at a coupon rate of 5.6%. We used the proceeds to repurchase a significant portion of the remaining balance of our convertible debt and the associated warrants. 
The rationale was to reduce our fully diluted share count by 3 million shares on an annualized basis and reduce potential dilution as well. Our overall debt balance at quarter end was essentially unchanged from year end 2010 and well within our targeted investment grade range. 
Turning to the ABS markets, last month we announced a $400 million timeshare securitization with an unprecedented advance rate of 98% and a weighted average cost of 3.7%. The transaction was oversubscribed, enabling us to increase the size of the offering. Overall, the deal produced $100 million more in cash than we had been projecting. 
Securitized borrowings are shown under financing activities on the cash flow statement, so this had no impact on free cash flow, but it is a significant contributor to overall cash availability. This was great work by our treasury and WVO finance and consumer finance teams, who couldn't have done it if not for the outstanding sales effort of our sales and marketing team at WVO. 
Now moving to operating performance for the quarter. Let me begin by saying that the integration of our 2010 acquisitions, Hoseasons [Hoseasons Group], the Tryp brand, ResortQuest and James Villa Holidays is going extremely well. We expect each to meet or exceed the earnings targets that were set up at acquisition. Combined, these companies will contribute over $30 million to our 2011 EBITDA. As importantly, they will each contribute meaningful growth for years to come. We are pleased with the significant progress we are making on this front. 
So let's begin the segment review with both Wyndham Hotel Group. Revenues were up 3% due to improved RevPAR in the 2010 Tryp acquisition. Adjusted EBITDA was up 21%, again reflecting RevPAR improvement and lower costs. Adjusted margins improved fully 390 basis points. RevPAR was up 7.4% reflecting occupancy gains of 5.8% and rate improvement of 1.4%. We saw occupancy gains across all regions in all chain scale segments. 
We're beginning to achieve rate gains in the domestic upscale and midscale segments without compromising occupancy. This bodes well for the continued recovery in the economy segment, which is 2/3 of our system. 
We ended the quarter with approximately 609,600 hotel rooms worldwide. Development efforts in the quarter were robust. We terminated 12,488 rooms in the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. Consistent with our recent experience, approximately 65% of the terminated rooms were related to financial difficulties for our franchisees. So while the tide has turned and we are in the upswing of what we believe will be a multiyear lodging industry recovery, we have yet to see a significant improvement in franchisee financial health. 
However, as I said on the last call, we do expect these types of terminations to moderate over time as the economy continues to recover. We also eliminated 2,766 rooms related to the impairment of an international joint venture, which I mentioned earlier. 
Now our partner in the joint venture has an indirect relationship with a Libyan government investment fund. And given uncertainties related to Libyan-related entities, we recorded a write-down of the investment and eliminated the rooms for more aggregate room total, even though the contract is ongoing. The joint venture produced minimal EBITDA last year. 
We opened over 12,000 rooms, our highest level of activity in any first quarter ever and the pipeline held steady. The development team delivered 160 of this quarter, up 58% compared with a year ago. Now a little over 1/3 of these new deals were internationally based, mostly in China, India and the politically-stable Middle Eastern markets. 
Wyndham Exchange and Rentals had a good quarter, with the Exchange business performing in line with expectations and Rentals slightly better than expected, despite some softening in the U.K. market. Segment revenues increased to $356 million, reflecting $31 million in incremental revenues from our recent rentals acquisitions and a $2 million benefit from currency in the Exchange business. 
Excluding the acquisition-related incremental revenues and the impact of foreign currency, revenues increased 8%, driven by favorable pricing and volumes at Novasol. Exchange revenues increased 3% in the quarter compared with the same period in 2010. Average members and exchange members revenues per member both reflected modest increases in the first quarter of 2011 compared with the same period last year. 
The acquisition of Hoseasons, ResortQuest and James Villa Holidays contributed $25 million of incremental rental revenue during the quarter. Excluding the acquisitions, rental revenues increased 19%, reflecting a 10% increase in average net price per vacation rental and an 8% increase in transaction volume. 
Overall, adjusted EBITDA for WER [Wyndham Exchange and Rentals] increased 11% in the quarter compared with the same period in 2010, primarily reflecting a higher revenue contribution from Novasol, which primarily services customers in Germany and Denmark and sound expense management. 
The segment margin, excluding the acquisitions, was 28.9%, reflecting some margin improvement in both the Exchange and Rentals business. However, as expected, the mixed shift created by the acquisitions in the Rentals business resulted in an adjusted margin decline of close to 200 basis points. 
Now moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. This business once again delivered solid results. Revenues increased 1.4%, tours tracked to plan and volume per guests was slightly below plan as we continue to focus on new owner generation. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter 2011 was $96 million, compared with $82 million in the first quarter of 2010. Now this increase reflects the absence of a litigation reserve we took in the first quarter of 2010, lower loan loss provision and strong property management results. 
Now the Property Management business, which produced $50 million of EBITDA in 2010, continued to produce a recurring fee-for-service revenue stream with revenues growing 10%. Consumer finance revenues were down approximately 3% due to a decrease in our contract receivables portfolio, while interest expense decreased 4%, reflecting lower interest rates on our securitized debt, partly offset by a higher average securitized debt balance. 
Now remember that higher advance rates improved cash flow but decreased EBITDA, as the interest expense on securitized debt is reported above the EBITDA line. 
Delinquency and default rates in the portfolio continue to improve. Write-offs during the first quarter were $85 million, down from $96 million a year ago. The provision for loan losses was $79 million, compared with $86 million in the first quarter of 2010. 
On our quarterly calls, we have been expressing write-offs relative to the overall portfolio and the provision relative to gross vacation ownership interest sales. Some of you have told us that this is not how you think about these figures, so to simplify things going forward, we'll give you the absolute numbers so you can calculate the ratios that are most meaningful to you. 
Moving to corporate, excluding legacy-related items, expenses increased $6 million, primarily reflecting increased information security and IT expenses. As I said on the last call, information security is an important spending priority. Like many companies, we have faced and will continue to face an increasingly aggressive threat from cyber criminals. 
We are investing in our systems infrastructure and hiring additional information security staff to address this threat. We will keep you updated on our progress in this important area. 
Now, let me spend a few moments on guidance. For the second quarter, we expect earnings per share of $0.53 to $0.56. As you saw from the press release, we are raising our full year EPS guidance from $2.05 to $2.15, to $2.15 to $2.25, $0.10 increase on both the lower and upper end of the range. The new EPS guidance is based on an expected diluted share count of 173 million shares, down from our original guidance of 181 million shares. 
This new guidance reflects the benefits of our share repurchase program to date and our repurchase of a significant portion of the convertible notes. This guidance excludes any future share repurchases from our $0.5 billion share repurchase authorization increase. We expect to be at the high-end of our full-year EBITDA guidance of $925 million to $955 million, but are not raising our guidance range at this time. 
While we are seeing good momentum in each of our businesses, there remains economic uncertainty in Europe, especially in the U.K. where austerity measures have dampened consumer confidence. In addition, as discussed, we expect higher corporate costs related to information security and other IT spending, which could somewhat offset our operating momentum. 
So with all of that, I'll turn the call back to Steve."

It really depends on the best deals out there. I think our shareholders are paying us to be thoughtful and to be as -- take advantage as much as possible of opportunities that exist, but to deliver the best value for all of our shareholders. So where, we could move that up or down, depending on what we see. There's plenty of product out there, but we also want to work off our balance sheet.

To answer the first part of your question, have we done everything that we wanted to do? Absolutely not. There's a lot of technology improvement that we think we can bring to bear a lot of marketing, improvement that we can probably bring to bear because of our size and breadth. In fact, our leadership team from the Exchange and Rental group is down and desked-in right now with the Fort Walton Beach with the ResortQuest team going through some of those initiatives. So we still have a lot to do there. An integration, generally in my experience, takes maybe 18 to 24 months to really get to where you want it to be just because there's so much to do. And ResortQuest has so many great opportunities for us. We're thrilled with the deal and were thrilled with our opportunities, but I would say that we are not done at all with what we think we can do to bring value to that business and improve it."

So the operating leverage we think absolutely is sustainable as RevPAR recovers and we manage cost. So the formula in the first quarter was a simple one, RevPAR growth of 7% help drive operating leverage and then we had some cost -- we had tighter cost management. And there were 1 or 2 costs that we incurred, sort of extraordinary costs in 2010 first quarter, that we didn't experience. But in general, there was also cost leverage as well. So we believe that's sustainable. We expect that there's going to be a multiyear, and I think you do as well. Lodging recovery will get our fair share of that. And we'll continue to see operating leverage take place in that business unit, so definitely sustainable. The second question you had that I can recall was WVO and VPG, our volume per guest. And so you know that the nature of that business, Steve, is that there are really 2 distinct sales channels. I mean there are many sales channels, but in general, you either sell to a new person or you upgrade an existing owner. And we are making a concerted effort, a strategically important effort, to make sure that we continue to grow that new ownership base, because as you know the economics of the new owner acquisition are sort of marginal breakeven at the initial sale. But really, the nature of the business is to upgrade that first-time buyer to be a lifetime buyer of timeshare. And now on the upgrade, our margins are more like 40% to 50%. So we want to make sure that we never lose sight of the fact that the upgrade profitability will be ensured, only if we continue to bring in a steady flow of new owners. And this year, we're targeting around 25,000 to 30,000 new owners, which are important for our future growth. And so VPG declines because our tour flow mix shift has been more favorably to the new owner, who is a more expensive owner to secure than an upgrade. And so I think the VPG on an upgrade is over $3,000. The VPG on new owners is around $1,500. And so when you're doing more new owner acquisition, your VPG is bound to come down. But within upgrade and within new owner, within those distinct categories, upgrade was about the same VPG we had last year, so no deterioration in the upgrade component. And on new owners, new owner VPG actually improved somewhat, but it's that mixed shift. The third question you had was..."

On the first question about VPG and what the impact is and would we think about having 50,000 new customers versus 25,000 new customers, you're correct in the fact that if we wanted to have 50,000, we could probably have 50,000. Having 50,000 new customers means our marketing costs would be higher because we're generating a new tour, and a new tour cost more than an upgrade to generate. In addition, our close rate would go down a little bit because we close higher on upgrade sales than we do on new sales. So VPG would be impacted if we went up to 50,000 new customers. We think we're at the right balance now. We think by adding 25,000, we're freshening our pool of new potential of existing owners that we will have adequate upgrade opportunities running out into the foreseeable future. So we're comfortable at that level. But we could change it around. And we have a higher new sales generation, the customer generation back when we were at $2 billion sales base, for example. On the second question about the WAAM and is there a lot of competition. There are other people who are looking at the WAAM-type model, there's other who are executing on it. The good thing is, it's like going fishing in the spring when the brooks are fully stocked. There's a lot of fish out there, so it's kind of easy to pull them in, because there's a lot of product out there. So I don't think that that's an issue for us at all, frankly. And the third one on acquisitions, and seeing less acquisitions. I wouldn't say that we're seeing less. I would probably say that 2010 was probably a little bit unusual that we get 4 deals done. The fact was there was a lot of uncertainty during the 2008, 2009 time frame, as we all know. We didn't stop working on things. We didn't stop our team from looking at opportunities. And that may have created a little bit of backlog that all got completed in 2010. But we continue to look at opportunities. We continue to be active in this arena. And again, you can't model when they're going to come out. We can't model the opportunity of when the deals are available and will happen. So I wouldn't say that we're not seeing anything or that the market is dry. It's just, we're using this opportunity, a lack of deal, deal closings to buy back more stock. Thanks."

The first question, I don't know that I would say that there's more professionally managed in Europe than the U.S. There definitely is a more organized and consolidated professionally managed presence in Europe. In the U.S., a lot of the professionally managed are done by small realtors in a market that happen to manage a couple of homes and they don't tie into any large network. In the Europe and the U.K., it is a much more organized and consolidated effort, so the businesses that we have over there has been around for decades. They basically rolled in a lot of the small people into their network, and their network provides them marketing opportunities far superior to what a local, small realtor could do. So I don't know if I looked at the landscape that I would say that there's a lot more in one market or the other. There probably is because it’s been so well organized in Europe, a larger presence of professionally managed in Europe, but there also exists professionally managed in the U.S. It's just not under an umbrella brand or brands that really presents itself other than ResortQuest. As for the second half of the question, which related to, are we a listings company or are we a professionally managed? We are professionally managed. The reason I mentioned that we still do a good bit of our product, our transactions on the Internet, is I don't want people to think that we aren’t using the Internet as a source for distribution and marketing. We absolutely do, but we don't just take a listing fee from somebody and put their product up on the market, on the Internet and then let the consumer contact the person who put it up on our listing service. We manage the product that we show on our system, which allows us to have this really good inventory, bookable inventory model, where you can go online and immediately book what you want versus going through the process of contacting the owner of the home. Again, we think there's plenty of room for both models in the market. There's a very large fragmented market and so we're excited about the growth of this market overall, and our participation in it."

The U.K. travelers, the second largest market for us to market to in Europe, the German traveler is the largest, the U.K. traveler is the second largest traveler for European travel. I agree with your comment about with the austerity measures, will that modify maybe and make the U.K. travel within the U.K. better. But it can also decrease the number of U.K. to Europe, to kind of an only Europe travelers. So we plan on both of them. So we're pretty well protected, but the fact is, the U.K. traveler may end up staying more within the U.K. versus going to Continental Europe.

31063165,129551372,118857,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2011",2011-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Travel + Leisure Co.","Executives","Thank you, Margo. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We are starting the year on a high note. First quarter revenues increased 7% and adjusted EBITDA increased 13%. Adjusted EPS for the quarter grew 29% and came in $0.03 above the top end",1666,"Thank you, Margo. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We are starting the year on a high note. First quarter revenues increased 7% and adjusted EBITDA increased 13%. Adjusted EPS for the quarter grew 29% and came in $0.03 above the top end of our guidance range. 
These results reflect continued economic improvement in the U.S. and strong operational performance in each of our businesses. They also reflect the growing benefit from our commitment to ongoing share repurchases. Performance was strong across the company with each of our businesses delivering solid growth in adjusted EBITDA. 
In the Lodging business, RevPAR [revenue per available room] was up a strong 7%, with gains in both occupancy and rates. Wyndham Exchange and Rentals delivered another great quarter. In Vacation Ownership, we saw a good growth in property management revenues and continuing improvement in delinquency and default rates in the Loan portfolio. 
Free cash flow was robust in the quarter at over $1 per share. We completed our most successful timeshare securitization deal and also repurchased most of our outstanding convert and warrants, reducing our full-year diluted share count by 2 million shares. 
And finally, our board authorized a $500 million increase to our share repurchase program. Overall, great results across the board. 
The World Travel and Tourism Council forecast that over the next 10 years, the global travel and tourism economy will grow by 4.3% per year. This implies that travel and tourism’s share of the global economy will rise to just over 10%. We believe that, that growth will be broad-based, spanning many regions and product offerings. We are strongly positioned to benefit from that growth. 
Our product portfolio is geographically and demographically diverse. The breadth of our offerings protected our results in the downturn and is now supporting our growth in the recovery. And it will continue to fuel our expansion for years to come. 
Let me spend a moment on some recent announcement in our space that have generated a lot of questions from investors. The first is the announced spinoff of Marriott's Timeshare business. Over the next several months, we will all hear more about the way this transaction will be structured, and we look forward to the opportunity for investors to get more familiar with the Timeshare business. 
While recent private transaction has been priced around 10x EBITDA, existing multiples ascribed to timeshare businesses of public companies are still far below the valuations that existed prior to the economic downturn. 
Another recent development was the filing on March 11 by HomeAway, Inc. for the $230 million initial public offering. HomeAway is an online vacation rental company with 2010 revenues of $168 million. The vacation rentals market is a large and highly fragmented market with significant growth opportunities globally.
There are 2 operating models in this market today. First is the rent by owner or listings model. In this model, the vacation homeowner lists his or her property on a website for a listing fee. The listings company refers the potential renter back to the homeowner to inquire about availability, make the reservation and process payment. 
The second model is the professionally managed model. This is primarily how our European rentals and ResortQuest businesses operate. Of course, we also list properties on the Internet and over 60% of our bookings are transacted online. We provide real-time, bookable inventory that we hand-select and annually inspect. 
Homeowners provide homes to us primarily on an exclusive and commissionable basis. Unlike the listings model, the consumer rarely deals with the homeowner. We process all payments and handle customer service for their stay. When in vacations model leverages our years of expertise in sales, marketing and vacation rental operations. From check-in to check out, consumers can book with trust and confidence because Wyndham is standing behind them every step of the way. 
Our acquisition of ResortQuest, combined with our leadership position in Europe, makes us the world's largest company in the professionally managed segment of this growing market. Revenues from our Vacation Rental businesses in 2010 were approximately $500 million. We have approximately 93,000 properties in 32 countries, representing over 51,000 homeowners. We are highly trusted by over 1 million families who vacation with us each year. It's an excellent base for continued growth. 
The worldwide rentals market is estimated at $85 billion, and we think there's plenty of room for both models to grow. Our belief in the potential of this business is evidenced by our 3 acquisitions in this space last year. We look forward to showing both consumers and investors what we can do in this business. So while these recent events are external to Wyndham Worldwide, we think they underscore the strength and advantages of our businesses and business model. 
Let me now spend a few moments to give you an update on progress in our business units in the first quarter. The Hotel group continues to focus on international expansion. Over the past 2 years, we have accelerated our international development efforts to leverage existing relationships and develop multi-unit deals. We are achieving great success. 
For example, in the first quarter, we executed 2 deals in Doha, a 246-room Wyndham Grand and a 300-room Planet Hollywood, with the owner of 111 room Ramada Encore that recently opened. All 3 properties are 5-star products in great locations. 
In March, we signed an agreement to develop at least 10 Super 8 hotels in Poland, with the same owner over the next 5 years. And last week, we announced the master development agreement for more than 75 new construction Microtel hotels in Canada over the next 25 years. 
A principal of our partner there in Canada was part of a team that signed a master development agreement for the Super 8 brand in Canada back in 1992. They have since grown that brand's portfolio to include approximately 130 Super 8 hotels throughout every province in Canada. We look forward to the team's continued success. 
Of course, a critical component of our strategy is developing the Wyndham brand. Through organic growth, acquisition and brand strategy, we have grown to over 60,000 rooms carrying the Wyndham flag, double the number that we acquired the brand in October of 2005. When you add in the timeshare units flying the Wyndham flag, the total increases to over 80,000 rooms. 
We have underway a series of technology and business enhancements aimed at improving the value proposition to our hotel owners. We call these initiatives ""Apollo."" In our most recent project, we began an effort with our franchisees to improve the content and navigation of our websites. We look forward to launching a beta test next month on one of our brands, and will continue with additional releases throughout the year. 
Now moving to Exchange and Rentals. Four weeks ago, I attended the ARDA [American Resort Development Association] Conference, which is the timeshare industry's annual trade convention. We had tremendous attendance by RCI's largest affiliates at the conference, and I was encouraged by the number of new, non-US developers that attended this year. 
We had meetings with developers from India, Brazil, Asia and the Caribbean. Interest in timeshare is growing as is interest in RCI. We are very pleased to announce during the show our new and exclusive multiyear affiliations with the Anantara Vacation Club, one of Asia's premiere developers of luxury timeshare products; Palace Resorts' new Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in the Dominican Republic; and Fairmont Hotels & Resorts' luxurious Fairmont Heritage Place, recently signed an agreement with The Registry Collection. 
The Registry Collection is RCI's fractional timeshare exchange program, which boasts over 180 luxury properties around the world. The highlight of the ARDA show for me was RCI's selection as the recipient of the Innovator of the Year award, for developing technologies through RCI.com that provides substantially greater transparency in the timeshare exchange business. 
We built upon that success earlier this month with our recent release of RCI.com. The upgrade included the Phase 1 launch of RCI Platinum for Weeks [RCI Weeks] members, RCI TV enhancements and new tools to enable interaction with Facebook.
Now let's touch on Vacation Ownership. While the traditional timeshare model continues to perform very well, we are also excited by the progress we are making in our Asset Affiliation Model or WAAM [Wyndham Asset Affiliation Model]. March 10 marked the anniversary of our first WAAM sale. We went in from $0 to almost $70 million in gross sales in 12 months. It's a homerun for us and for developers. 
WVO [Wyndham Vacation Ownership] has begun a multiyear initiative called Project Voyager, which is designed to improve our inventory and reservation systems. The goal is to get our owners on more booked vacations each and every year. Our owner satisfaction, which is extremely high, is tied to the frequency with which the user vacation ownership. And with higher satisfaction comes multiple benefits, such as higher upgrade sales, improved lead generation, increased on-time payments and most importantly, a better experience for our owners. 
Through a series of technology enhancements anticipated to be complete in early 2013, we will maximize vacation planning during the booking process, enhance reservations capability and improve our website experience with greater self-service options. We will keep you apprised of additional developments with this project, which we believe will have long-term beneficial impact on our business. 
Before I turn the call over to Tom, let me repeat that we are confident in the strength of our business models and our ability to execute our operating and financial growth plans to deliver shareholder value. How confident are we? We spent approximately $255 million on share repurchases so far this year, which is more than we spent on repurchases all of last year. And the board has recently increased our current program by $500 million, the largest increase in authorization since we listed on the New York Stock Exchange 5 years ago. 
And now I'll turn it over to Tom to review the financials. Tom?"
31063165,129551372,118857,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2011",2011-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Travel + Leisure Co.","Executives","Thank you, Steve. As Steve said, the first quarter was strong with adjusted earnings per share coming in 29% ahead of 2010 and $0.03 above the top end of our guidance range, due to continued business momentum, sound expense management and continued share",1730,"Thank you, Steve. As Steve said, the first quarter was strong with adjusted earnings per share coming in 29% ahead of 2010 and $0.03 above the top end of our guidance range, due to continued business momentum, sound expense management and continued share repurchases. 
Adjusted EBITDA increased 13% reflecting improve RevPAR performance, favorable loan loss trends in our Vacation Ownership business and growth in our European Rentals business. Our adjusted net income excludes the following after tax items: an $8 million benefit related to legacy items, a non-cash impairment charge of $8 million to reduce the value of an international joint venture in the Hotel business, an interest cost of $7 million related to the repurchase of the convertible notes. 
Free cash flow increased to $185 million for the quarter compared with $166 million in 2010. On a per share basis, free cash flow was $1.03 for the quarter compared with $0.89 in 2010. That reflects a 16% increase in free cash flow per share. 
Going forward, when I talk about free cash flow, I will express it in a ""per share"" term to better reflect the impact of our share repurchase program. 
So to restate, we believe that cash is the great enabler of our long-term business goals and that our sustainable and growing annual free cash flow of $3.50 to $4.05 per diluted share, based on our diluted share count guidance of 173 million shares, will accelerate our growth and enhance shareholder value by supporting further investment in the business, dividends and share repurchases. 
Now let's start a review with the capital markets, where we had a very busy and productive quarter with 3 well-executed transactions. First, we issued $250 million of senior unsecured notes at a coupon rate of 5.6%. We used the proceeds to repurchase a significant portion of the remaining balance of our convertible debt and the associated warrants. 
The rationale was to reduce our fully diluted share count by 3 million shares on an annualized basis and reduce potential dilution as well. Our overall debt balance at quarter end was essentially unchanged from year end 2010 and well within our targeted investment grade range. 
Turning to the ABS markets, last month we announced a $400 million timeshare securitization with an unprecedented advance rate of 98% and a weighted average cost of 3.7%. The transaction was oversubscribed, enabling us to increase the size of the offering. Overall, the deal produced $100 million more in cash than we had been projecting. 
Securitized borrowings are shown under financing activities on the cash flow statement, so this had no impact on free cash flow, but it is a significant contributor to overall cash availability. This was great work by our treasury and WVO finance and consumer finance teams, who couldn't have done it if not for the outstanding sales effort of our sales and marketing team at WVO. 
Now moving to operating performance for the quarter. Let me begin by saying that the integration of our 2010 acquisitions, Hoseasons [Hoseasons Group], the Tryp brand, ResortQuest and James Villa Holidays is going extremely well. We expect each to meet or exceed the earnings targets that were set up at acquisition. Combined, these companies will contribute over $30 million to our 2011 EBITDA. As importantly, they will each contribute meaningful growth for years to come. We are pleased with the significant progress we are making on this front. 
So let's begin the segment review with both Wyndham Hotel Group. Revenues were up 3% due to improved RevPAR in the 2010 Tryp acquisition. Adjusted EBITDA was up 21%, again reflecting RevPAR improvement and lower costs. Adjusted margins improved fully 390 basis points. RevPAR was up 7.4% reflecting occupancy gains of 5.8% and rate improvement of 1.4%. We saw occupancy gains across all regions in all chain scale segments. 
We're beginning to achieve rate gains in the domestic upscale and midscale segments without compromising occupancy. This bodes well for the continued recovery in the economy segment, which is 2/3 of our system. 
We ended the quarter with approximately 609,600 hotel rooms worldwide. Development efforts in the quarter were robust. We terminated 12,488 rooms in the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. Consistent with our recent experience, approximately 65% of the terminated rooms were related to financial difficulties for our franchisees. So while the tide has turned and we are in the upswing of what we believe will be a multiyear lodging industry recovery, we have yet to see a significant improvement in franchisee financial health. 
However, as I said on the last call, we do expect these types of terminations to moderate over time as the economy continues to recover. We also eliminated 2,766 rooms related to the impairment of an international joint venture, which I mentioned earlier. 
Now our partner in the joint venture has an indirect relationship with a Libyan government investment fund. And given uncertainties related to Libyan-related entities, we recorded a write-down of the investment and eliminated the rooms for more aggregate room total, even though the contract is ongoing. The joint venture produced minimal EBITDA last year. 
We opened over 12,000 rooms, our highest level of activity in any first quarter ever and the pipeline held steady. The development team delivered 160 of this quarter, up 58% compared with a year ago. Now a little over 1/3 of these new deals were internationally based, mostly in China, India and the politically-stable Middle Eastern markets. 
Wyndham Exchange and Rentals had a good quarter, with the Exchange business performing in line with expectations and Rentals slightly better than expected, despite some softening in the U.K. market. Segment revenues increased to $356 million, reflecting $31 million in incremental revenues from our recent rentals acquisitions and a $2 million benefit from currency in the Exchange business. 
Excluding the acquisition-related incremental revenues and the impact of foreign currency, revenues increased 8%, driven by favorable pricing and volumes at Novasol. Exchange revenues increased 3% in the quarter compared with the same period in 2010. Average members and exchange members revenues per member both reflected modest increases in the first quarter of 2011 compared with the same period last year. 
The acquisition of Hoseasons, ResortQuest and James Villa Holidays contributed $25 million of incremental rental revenue during the quarter. Excluding the acquisitions, rental revenues increased 19%, reflecting a 10% increase in average net price per vacation rental and an 8% increase in transaction volume. 
Overall, adjusted EBITDA for WER [Wyndham Exchange and Rentals] increased 11% in the quarter compared with the same period in 2010, primarily reflecting a higher revenue contribution from Novasol, which primarily services customers in Germany and Denmark and sound expense management. 
The segment margin, excluding the acquisitions, was 28.9%, reflecting some margin improvement in both the Exchange and Rentals business. However, as expected, the mixed shift created by the acquisitions in the Rentals business resulted in an adjusted margin decline of close to 200 basis points. 
Now moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. This business once again delivered solid results. Revenues increased 1.4%, tours tracked to plan and volume per guests was slightly below plan as we continue to focus on new owner generation. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter 2011 was $96 million, compared with $82 million in the first quarter of 2010. Now this increase reflects the absence of a litigation reserve we took in the first quarter of 2010, lower loan loss provision and strong property management results. 
Now the Property Management business, which produced $50 million of EBITDA in 2010, continued to produce a recurring fee-for-service revenue stream with revenues growing 10%. Consumer finance revenues were down approximately 3% due to a decrease in our contract receivables portfolio, while interest expense decreased 4%, reflecting lower interest rates on our securitized debt, partly offset by a higher average securitized debt balance. 
Now remember that higher advance rates improved cash flow but decreased EBITDA, as the interest expense on securitized debt is reported above the EBITDA line. 
Delinquency and default rates in the portfolio continue to improve. Write-offs during the first quarter were $85 million, down from $96 million a year ago. The provision for loan losses was $79 million, compared with $86 million in the first quarter of 2010. 
On our quarterly calls, we have been expressing write-offs relative to the overall portfolio and the provision relative to gross vacation ownership interest sales. Some of you have told us that this is not how you think about these figures, so to simplify things going forward, we'll give you the absolute numbers so you can calculate the ratios that are most meaningful to you. 
Moving to corporate, excluding legacy-related items, expenses increased $6 million, primarily reflecting increased information security and IT expenses. As I said on the last call, information security is an important spending priority. Like many companies, we have faced and will continue to face an increasingly aggressive threat from cyber criminals. 
We are investing in our systems infrastructure and hiring additional information security staff to address this threat. We will keep you updated on our progress in this important area. 
Now, let me spend a few moments on guidance. For the second quarter, we expect earnings per share of $0.53 to $0.56. As you saw from the press release, we are raising our full year EPS guidance from $2.05 to $2.15, to $2.15 to $2.25, $0.10 increase on both the lower and upper end of the range. The new EPS guidance is based on an expected diluted share count of 173 million shares, down from our original guidance of 181 million shares. 
This new guidance reflects the benefits of our share repurchase program to date and our repurchase of a significant portion of the convertible notes. This guidance excludes any future share repurchases from our $0.5 billion share repurchase authorization increase. We expect to be at the high-end of our full-year EBITDA guidance of $925 million to $955 million, but are not raising our guidance range at this time. 
While we are seeing good momentum in each of our businesses, there remains economic uncertainty in Europe, especially in the U.K. where austerity measures have dampened consumer confidence. In addition, as discussed, we expect higher corporate costs related to information security and other IT spending, which could somewhat offset our operating momentum. 
So with all of that, I'll turn the call back to Steve."

Our repurchase program is really built on the fact that we have priorities for capital allocation. The first priority is if we have transactions that could grow, attractively grow our operating business, we would like to do those. Absent those opportunities, we obviously believe our stock is undervalued, and we're actively in the market buying it. Last year we had a lot of acquisition activity, kind of more than we've had for a couple of years and kind of unusually high for us. This year, we haven't seen any acquisition activity and we've become very aggressive at buying back our stock. As we said before, we don't need to build stock up on our balance sheet. We have a $960 million revolver. We’re happy with our leverage. And in fact, as we grow our EBITDA, we could probably grow our leverage a little bit.

So the operating leverage we think absolutely is sustainable as RevPAR recovers and we manage cost. So the formula in the first quarter was a simple one, RevPAR growth of 7% help drive operating leverage and then we had some cost -- we had tighter cost management. And there were 1 or 2 costs that we incurred, sort of extraordinary costs in 2010 first quarter, that we didn't experience. But in general, there was also cost leverage as well. So we believe that's sustainable. We expect that there's going to be a multiyear, and I think you do as well. Lodging recovery will get our fair share of that. And we'll continue to see operating leverage take place in that business unit, so definitely sustainable. The second question you had that I can recall was WVO and VPG, our volume per guest. And so you know that the nature of that business, Steve, is that there are really 2 distinct sales channels. I mean there are many sales channels, but in general, you either sell to a new person or you upgrade an existing owner. And we are making a concerted effort, a strategically important effort, to make sure that we continue to grow that new ownership base, because as you know the economics of the new owner acquisition are sort of marginal breakeven at the initial sale. But really, the nature of the business is to upgrade that first-time buyer to be a lifetime buyer of timeshare. And now on the upgrade, our margins are more like 40% to 50%. So we want to make sure that we never lose sight of the fact that the upgrade profitability will be ensured, only if we continue to bring in a steady flow of new owners. And this year, we're targeting around 25,000 to 30,000 new owners, which are important for our future growth. And so VPG declines because our tour flow mix shift has been more favorably to the new owner, who is a more expensive owner to secure than an upgrade. And so I think the VPG on an upgrade is over $3,000. The VPG on new owners is around $1,500. And so when you're doing more new owner acquisition, your VPG is bound to come down. But within upgrade and within new owner, within those distinct categories, upgrade was about the same VPG we had last year, so no deterioration in the upgrade component. And on new owners, new owner VPG actually improved somewhat, but it's that mixed shift. The third question you had was..."

And Steve, just going back to the VPG question for a minute that Tom answered. One way to look at it numerically, because we all love numbers, is if you look at our Table 3, it shows our tour volume and our VPG broken down by quarter. And what you'll see is that the VPG was down a little bit 2010 to 2011, and the tour flow was up, about 11%. If you go back to 2009, you'll see a similar tour flow level and now our VPG is above what it was back then. Just, so to Tom's point, that our underlying upgrade sales VPG is up, it's just more of a mix issue. You can kind of see it there in the numbers."

On the first question about VPG and what the impact is and would we think about having 50,000 new customers versus 25,000 new customers, you're correct in the fact that if we wanted to have 50,000, we could probably have 50,000. Having 50,000 new customers means our marketing costs would be higher because we're generating a new tour, and a new tour cost more than an upgrade to generate. In addition, our close rate would go down a little bit because we close higher on upgrade sales than we do on new sales. So VPG would be impacted if we went up to 50,000 new customers. We think we're at the right balance now. We think by adding 25,000, we're freshening our pool of new potential of existing owners that we will have adequate upgrade opportunities running out into the foreseeable future. So we're comfortable at that level. But we could change it around. And we have a higher new sales generation, the customer generation back when we were at $2 billion sales base, for example. On the second question about the WAAM and is there a lot of competition. There are other people who are looking at the WAAM-type model, there's other who are executing on it. The good thing is, it's like going fishing in the spring when the brooks are fully stocked. There's a lot of fish out there, so it's kind of easy to pull them in, because there's a lot of product out there. So I don't think that that's an issue for us at all, frankly. And the third one on acquisitions, and seeing less acquisitions. I wouldn't say that we're seeing less. I would probably say that 2010 was probably a little bit unusual that we get 4 deals done. The fact was there was a lot of uncertainty during the 2008, 2009 time frame, as we all know. We didn't stop working on things. We didn't stop our team from looking at opportunities. And that may have created a little bit of backlog that all got completed in 2010. But we continue to look at opportunities. We continue to be active in this arena. And again, you can't model when they're going to come out. We can't model the opportunity of when the deals are available and will happen. So I wouldn't say that we're not seeing anything or that the market is dry. It's just, we're using this opportunity, a lack of deal, deal closings to buy back more stock. Thanks."

The first question, I don't know that I would say that there's more professionally managed in Europe than the U.S. There definitely is a more organized and consolidated professionally managed presence in Europe. In the U.S., a lot of the professionally managed are done by small realtors in a market that happen to manage a couple of homes and they don't tie into any large network. In the Europe and the U.K., it is a much more organized and consolidated effort, so the businesses that we have over there has been around for decades. They basically rolled in a lot of the small people into their network, and their network provides them marketing opportunities far superior to what a local, small realtor could do. So I don't know if I looked at the landscape that I would say that there's a lot more in one market or the other. There probably is because it’s been so well organized in Europe, a larger presence of professionally managed in Europe, but there also exists professionally managed in the U.S. It's just not under an umbrella brand or brands that really presents itself other than ResortQuest. As for the second half of the question, which related to, are we a listings company or are we a professionally managed? We are professionally managed. The reason I mentioned that we still do a good bit of our product, our transactions on the Internet, is I don't want people to think that we aren’t using the Internet as a source for distribution and marketing. We absolutely do, but we don't just take a listing fee from somebody and put their product up on the market, on the Internet and then let the consumer contact the person who put it up on our listing service. We manage the product that we show on our system, which allows us to have this really good inventory, bookable inventory model, where you can go online and immediately book what you want versus going through the process of contacting the owner of the home. Again, we think there's plenty of room for both models in the market. There's a very large fragmented market and so we're excited about the growth of this market overall, and our participation in it."

We just see some early signs that make us cautious about projecting that we will be the recession solution for the U.K. consumer. But, Steve?"

We're saying we're cautious on the U.K. part of the business. So you seem to indicate that maybe it was an overall company indication, but as Tom said in his comments regarding the top end. On the second question, about U.K., let me just add one thing. The U.K. travelers, the second largest market for us to market to in Europe, the German traveler is the largest, the U.K. traveler is the second largest traveler for European travel. I agree with your comment about with the austerity measures, will that modify maybe and make the U.K. travel within the U.K. better. But it can also decrease the number of U.K. to Europe, to kind of an only Europe travelers. So we plan on both of them. So we're pretty well protected, but the fact is, the U.K. traveler may end up staying more within the U.K. versus going to Continental Europe. And that's the reason that we might see some shift there in which case we may have more product to market to the Dutch and German travelers."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We are starting the year on a high note. First quarter revenues increased 7% and adjusted EBITDA increased 13%. Adjusted EPS for the quarter grew 29% and came in $0.03 above the top end",1666,"Thank you, Margo. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We are starting the year on a high note. First quarter revenues increased 7% and adjusted EBITDA increased 13%. Adjusted EPS for the quarter grew 29% and came in $0.03 above the top end of our guidance range. 
These results reflect continued economic improvement in the U.S. and strong operational performance in each of our businesses. They also reflect the growing benefit from our commitment to ongoing share repurchases. Performance was strong across the company with each of our businesses delivering solid growth in adjusted EBITDA. 
In the Lodging business, RevPAR [revenue per available room] was up a strong 7%, with gains in both occupancy and rates. Wyndham Exchange and Rentals delivered another great quarter. In Vacation Ownership, we saw a good growth in property management revenues and continuing improvement in delinquency and default rates in the Loan portfolio. 
Free cash flow was robust in the quarter at over $1 per share. We completed our most successful timeshare securitization deal and also repurchased most of our outstanding convert and warrants, reducing our full-year diluted share count by 2 million shares. 
And finally, our board authorized a $500 million increase to our share repurchase program. Overall, great results across the board. 
The World Travel and Tourism Council forecast that over the next 10 years, the global travel and tourism economy will grow by 4.3% per year. This implies that travel and tourism’s share of the global economy will rise to just over 10%. We believe that, that growth will be broad-based, spanning many regions and product offerings. We are strongly positioned to benefit from that growth. 
Our product portfolio is geographically and demographically diverse. The breadth of our offerings protected our results in the downturn and is now supporting our growth in the recovery. And it will continue to fuel our expansion for years to come. 
Let me spend a moment on some recent announcement in our space that have generated a lot of questions from investors. The first is the announced spinoff of Marriott's Timeshare business. Over the next several months, we will all hear more about the way this transaction will be structured, and we look forward to the opportunity for investors to get more familiar with the Timeshare business. 
While recent private transaction has been priced around 10x EBITDA, existing multiples ascribed to timeshare businesses of public companies are still far below the valuations that existed prior to the economic downturn. 
Another recent development was the filing on March 11 by HomeAway, Inc. for the $230 million initial public offering. HomeAway is an online vacation rental company with 2010 revenues of $168 million. The vacation rentals market is a large and highly fragmented market with significant growth opportunities globally.
There are 2 operating models in this market today. First is the rent by owner or listings model. In this model, the vacation homeowner lists his or her property on a website for a listing fee. The listings company refers the potential renter back to the homeowner to inquire about availability, make the reservation and process payment. 
The second model is the professionally managed model. This is primarily how our European rentals and ResortQuest businesses operate. Of course, we also list properties on the Internet and over 60% of our bookings are transacted online. We provide real-time, bookable inventory that we hand-select and annually inspect. 
Homeowners provide homes to us primarily on an exclusive and commissionable basis. Unlike the listings model, the consumer rarely deals with the homeowner. We process all payments and handle customer service for their stay. When in vacations model leverages our years of expertise in sales, marketing and vacation rental operations. From check-in to check out, consumers can book with trust and confidence because Wyndham is standing behind them every step of the way. 
Our acquisition of ResortQuest, combined with our leadership position in Europe, makes us the world's largest company in the professionally managed segment of this growing market. Revenues from our Vacation Rental businesses in 2010 were approximately $500 million. We have approximately 93,000 properties in 32 countries, representing over 51,000 homeowners. We are highly trusted by over 1 million families who vacation with us each year. It's an excellent base for continued growth. 
The worldwide rentals market is estimated at $85 billion, and we think there's plenty of room for both models to grow. Our belief in the potential of this business is evidenced by our 3 acquisitions in this space last year. We look forward to showing both consumers and investors what we can do in this business. So while these recent events are external to Wyndham Worldwide, we think they underscore the strength and advantages of our businesses and business model. 
Let me now spend a few moments to give you an update on progress in our business units in the first quarter. The Hotel group continues to focus on international expansion. Over the past 2 years, we have accelerated our international development efforts to leverage existing relationships and develop multi-unit deals. We are achieving great success. 
For example, in the first quarter, we executed 2 deals in Doha, a 246-room Wyndham Grand and a 300-room Planet Hollywood, with the owner of 111 room Ramada Encore that recently opened. All 3 properties are 5-star products in great locations. 
In March, we signed an agreement to develop at least 10 Super 8 hotels in Poland, with the same owner over the next 5 years. And last week, we announced the master development agreement for more than 75 new construction Microtel hotels in Canada over the next 25 years. 
A principal of our partner there in Canada was part of a team that signed a master development agreement for the Super 8 brand in Canada back in 1992. They have since grown that brand's portfolio to include approximately 130 Super 8 hotels throughout every province in Canada. We look forward to the team's continued success. 
Of course, a critical component of our strategy is developing the Wyndham brand. Through organic growth, acquisition and brand strategy, we have grown to over 60,000 rooms carrying the Wyndham flag, double the number that we acquired the brand in October of 2005. When you add in the timeshare units flying the Wyndham flag, the total increases to over 80,000 rooms. 
We have underway a series of technology and business enhancements aimed at improving the value proposition to our hotel owners. We call these initiatives ""Apollo."" In our most recent project, we began an effort with our franchisees to improve the content and navigation of our websites. We look forward to launching a beta test next month on one of our brands, and will continue with additional releases throughout the year. 
Now moving to Exchange and Rentals. Four weeks ago, I attended the ARDA [American Resort Development Association] Conference, which is the timeshare industry's annual trade convention. We had tremendous attendance by RCI's largest affiliates at the conference, and I was encouraged by the number of new, non-US developers that attended this year. 
We had meetings with developers from India, Brazil, Asia and the Caribbean. Interest in timeshare is growing as is interest in RCI. We are very pleased to announce during the show our new and exclusive multiyear affiliations with the Anantara Vacation Club, one of Asia's premiere developers of luxury timeshare products; Palace Resorts' new Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in the Dominican Republic; and Fairmont Hotels & Resorts' luxurious Fairmont Heritage Place, recently signed an agreement with The Registry Collection. 
The Registry Collection is RCI's fractional timeshare exchange program, which boasts over 180 luxury properties around the world. The highlight of the ARDA show for me was RCI's selection as the recipient of the Innovator of the Year award, for developing technologies through RCI.com that provides substantially greater transparency in the timeshare exchange business. 
We built upon that success earlier this month with our recent release of RCI.com. The upgrade included the Phase 1 launch of RCI Platinum for Weeks [RCI Weeks] members, RCI TV enhancements and new tools to enable interaction with Facebook.
Now let's touch on Vacation Ownership. While the traditional timeshare model continues to perform very well, we are also excited by the progress we are making in our Asset Affiliation Model or WAAM [Wyndham Asset Affiliation Model]. March 10 marked the anniversary of our first WAAM sale. We went in from $0 to almost $70 million in gross sales in 12 months. It's a homerun for us and for developers. 
WVO [Wyndham Vacation Ownership] has begun a multiyear initiative called Project Voyager, which is designed to improve our inventory and reservation systems. The goal is to get our owners on more booked vacations each and every year. Our owner satisfaction, which is extremely high, is tied to the frequency with which the user vacation ownership. And with higher satisfaction comes multiple benefits, such as higher upgrade sales, improved lead generation, increased on-time payments and most importantly, a better experience for our owners. 
Through a series of technology enhancements anticipated to be complete in early 2013, we will maximize vacation planning during the booking process, enhance reservations capability and improve our website experience with greater self-service options. We will keep you apprised of additional developments with this project, which we believe will have long-term beneficial impact on our business. 
Before I turn the call over to Tom, let me repeat that we are confident in the strength of our business models and our ability to execute our operating and financial growth plans to deliver shareholder value. How confident are we? We spent approximately $255 million on share repurchases so far this year, which is more than we spent on repurchases all of last year. And the board has recently increased our current program by $500 million, the largest increase in authorization since we listed on the New York Stock Exchange 5 years ago. 
And now I'll turn it over to Tom to review the financials. Tom?"
31063165,129551372,118858,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2011",2011-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Travel + Leisure Co.","Executives","Thank you, Steve. As Steve said, the first quarter was strong with adjusted earnings per share coming in 29% ahead of 2010 and $0.03 above the top end of our guidance range, due to continued business momentum, sound expense management and continued share",1730,"Thank you, Steve. As Steve said, the first quarter was strong with adjusted earnings per share coming in 29% ahead of 2010 and $0.03 above the top end of our guidance range, due to continued business momentum, sound expense management and continued share repurchases. 
Adjusted EBITDA increased 13% reflecting improve RevPAR performance, favorable loan loss trends in our Vacation Ownership business and growth in our European Rentals business. Our adjusted net income excludes the following after tax items: an $8 million benefit related to legacy items, a non-cash impairment charge of $8 million to reduce the value of an international joint venture in the Hotel business, an interest cost of $7 million related to the repurchase of the convertible notes. 
Free cash flow increased to $185 million for the quarter compared with $166 million in 2010. On a per share basis, free cash flow was $1.03 for the quarter compared with $0.89 in 2010. That reflects a 16% increase in free cash flow per share. 
Going forward, when I talk about free cash flow, I will express it in a ""per share"" term to better reflect the impact of our share repurchase program. 
So to restate, we believe that cash is the great enabler of our long-term business goals and that our sustainable and growing annual free cash flow of $3.50 to $4.05 per diluted share, based on our diluted share count guidance of 173 million shares, will accelerate our growth and enhance shareholder value by supporting further investment in the business, dividends and share repurchases. 
Now let's start a review with the capital markets, where we had a very busy and productive quarter with 3 well-executed transactions. First, we issued $250 million of senior unsecured notes at a coupon rate of 5.6%. We used the proceeds to repurchase a significant portion of the remaining balance of our convertible debt and the associated warrants. 
The rationale was to reduce our fully diluted share count by 3 million shares on an annualized basis and reduce potential dilution as well. Our overall debt balance at quarter end was essentially unchanged from year end 2010 and well within our targeted investment grade range. 
Turning to the ABS markets, last month we announced a $400 million timeshare securitization with an unprecedented advance rate of 98% and a weighted average cost of 3.7%. The transaction was oversubscribed, enabling us to increase the size of the offering. Overall, the deal produced $100 million more in cash than we had been projecting. 
Securitized borrowings are shown under financing activities on the cash flow statement, so this had no impact on free cash flow, but it is a significant contributor to overall cash availability. This was great work by our treasury and WVO finance and consumer finance teams, who couldn't have done it if not for the outstanding sales effort of our sales and marketing team at WVO. 
Now moving to operating performance for the quarter. Let me begin by saying that the integration of our 2010 acquisitions, Hoseasons [Hoseasons Group], the Tryp brand, ResortQuest and James Villa Holidays is going extremely well. We expect each to meet or exceed the earnings targets that were set up at acquisition. Combined, these companies will contribute over $30 million to our 2011 EBITDA. As importantly, they will each contribute meaningful growth for years to come. We are pleased with the significant progress we are making on this front. 
So let's begin the segment review with both Wyndham Hotel Group. Revenues were up 3% due to improved RevPAR in the 2010 Tryp acquisition. Adjusted EBITDA was up 21%, again reflecting RevPAR improvement and lower costs. Adjusted margins improved fully 390 basis points. RevPAR was up 7.4% reflecting occupancy gains of 5.8% and rate improvement of 1.4%. We saw occupancy gains across all regions in all chain scale segments. 
We're beginning to achieve rate gains in the domestic upscale and midscale segments without compromising occupancy. This bodes well for the continued recovery in the economy segment, which is 2/3 of our system. 
We ended the quarter with approximately 609,600 hotel rooms worldwide. Development efforts in the quarter were robust. We terminated 12,488 rooms in the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. Consistent with our recent experience, approximately 65% of the terminated rooms were related to financial difficulties for our franchisees. So while the tide has turned and we are in the upswing of what we believe will be a multiyear lodging industry recovery, we have yet to see a significant improvement in franchisee financial health. 
However, as I said on the last call, we do expect these types of terminations to moderate over time as the economy continues to recover. We also eliminated 2,766 rooms related to the impairment of an international joint venture, which I mentioned earlier. 
Now our partner in the joint venture has an indirect relationship with a Libyan government investment fund. And given uncertainties related to Libyan-related entities, we recorded a write-down of the investment and eliminated the rooms for more aggregate room total, even though the contract is ongoing. The joint venture produced minimal EBITDA last year. 
We opened over 12,000 rooms, our highest level of activity in any first quarter ever and the pipeline held steady. The development team delivered 160 of this quarter, up 58% compared with a year ago. Now a little over 1/3 of these new deals were internationally based, mostly in China, India and the politically-stable Middle Eastern markets. 
Wyndham Exchange and Rentals had a good quarter, with the Exchange business performing in line with expectations and Rentals slightly better than expected, despite some softening in the U.K. market. Segment revenues increased to $356 million, reflecting $31 million in incremental revenues from our recent rentals acquisitions and a $2 million benefit from currency in the Exchange business. 
Excluding the acquisition-related incremental revenues and the impact of foreign currency, revenues increased 8%, driven by favorable pricing and volumes at Novasol. Exchange revenues increased 3% in the quarter compared with the same period in 2010. Average members and exchange members revenues per member both reflected modest increases in the first quarter of 2011 compared with the same period last year. 
The acquisition of Hoseasons, ResortQuest and James Villa Holidays contributed $25 million of incremental rental revenue during the quarter. Excluding the acquisitions, rental revenues increased 19%, reflecting a 10% increase in average net price per vacation rental and an 8% increase in transaction volume. 
Overall, adjusted EBITDA for WER [Wyndham Exchange and Rentals] increased 11% in the quarter compared with the same period in 2010, primarily reflecting a higher revenue contribution from Novasol, which primarily services customers in Germany and Denmark and sound expense management. 
The segment margin, excluding the acquisitions, was 28.9%, reflecting some margin improvement in both the Exchange and Rentals business. However, as expected, the mixed shift created by the acquisitions in the Rentals business resulted in an adjusted margin decline of close to 200 basis points. 
Now moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. This business once again delivered solid results. Revenues increased 1.4%, tours tracked to plan and volume per guests was slightly below plan as we continue to focus on new owner generation. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter 2011 was $96 million, compared with $82 million in the first quarter of 2010. Now this increase reflects the absence of a litigation reserve we took in the first quarter of 2010, lower loan loss provision and strong property management results. 
Now the Property Management business, which produced $50 million of EBITDA in 2010, continued to produce a recurring fee-for-service revenue stream with revenues growing 10%. Consumer finance revenues were down approximately 3% due to a decrease in our contract receivables portfolio, while interest expense decreased 4%, reflecting lower interest rates on our securitized debt, partly offset by a higher average securitized debt balance. 
Now remember that higher advance rates improved cash flow but decreased EBITDA, as the interest expense on securitized debt is reported above the EBITDA line. 
Delinquency and default rates in the portfolio continue to improve. Write-offs during the first quarter were $85 million, down from $96 million a year ago. The provision for loan losses was $79 million, compared with $86 million in the first quarter of 2010. 
On our quarterly calls, we have been expressing write-offs relative to the overall portfolio and the provision relative to gross vacation ownership interest sales. Some of you have told us that this is not how you think about these figures, so to simplify things going forward, we'll give you the absolute numbers so you can calculate the ratios that are most meaningful to you. 
Moving to corporate, excluding legacy-related items, expenses increased $6 million, primarily reflecting increased information security and IT expenses. As I said on the last call, information security is an important spending priority. Like many companies, we have faced and will continue to face an increasingly aggressive threat from cyber criminals. 
We are investing in our systems infrastructure and hiring additional information security staff to address this threat. We will keep you updated on our progress in this important area. 
Now, let me spend a few moments on guidance. For the second quarter, we expect earnings per share of $0.53 to $0.56. As you saw from the press release, we are raising our full year EPS guidance from $2.05 to $2.15, to $2.15 to $2.25, $0.10 increase on both the lower and upper end of the range. The new EPS guidance is based on an expected diluted share count of 173 million shares, down from our original guidance of 181 million shares. 
This new guidance reflects the benefits of our share repurchase program to date and our repurchase of a significant portion of the convertible notes. This guidance excludes any future share repurchases from our $0.5 billion share repurchase authorization increase. We expect to be at the high-end of our full-year EBITDA guidance of $925 million to $955 million, but are not raising our guidance range at this time. 
While we are seeing good momentum in each of our businesses, there remains economic uncertainty in Europe, especially in the U.K. where austerity measures have dampened consumer confidence. In addition, as discussed, we expect higher corporate costs related to information security and other IT spending, which could somewhat offset our operating momentum. 
So with all of that, I'll turn the call back to Steve."

Absent those opportunities, we obviously believe our stock is undervalued, and we're actively in the market buying it. Last year we had a lot of acquisition activity, kind of more than we've had for a couple of years and kind of unusually high for us. This year, we haven't seen any acquisition activity and we've become very aggressive at buying back our stock. As we said before, we don't need to build stock up on our balance sheet. We have a $960 million revolver. We’re happy with our leverage. And in fact, as we grow our EBITDA, we could probably grow our leverage a little bit.

So the operating leverage we think absolutely is sustainable as RevPAR recovers and we manage cost. So the formula in the first quarter was a simple one, RevPAR growth of 7% help drive operating leverage and then we had some cost -- we had tighter cost management. And there were 1 or 2 costs that we incurred, sort of extraordinary costs in 2010 first quarter, that we didn't experience. But in general, there was also cost leverage as well. So we believe that's sustainable. We expect that there's going to be a multiyear, and I think you do as well. Lodging recovery will get our fair share of that. And we'll continue to see operating leverage take place in that business unit, so definitely sustainable. The second question you had that I can recall was WVO and VPG, our volume per guest. And so you know that the nature of that business, Steve, is that there are really 2 distinct sales channels. I mean there are many sales channels, but in general, you either sell to a new person or you upgrade an existing owner. And we are making a concerted effort, a strategically important effort, to make sure that we continue to grow that new ownership base, because as you know the economics of the new owner acquisition are sort of marginal breakeven at the initial sale. But really, the nature of the business is to upgrade that first-time buyer to be a lifetime buyer of timeshare. And now on the upgrade, our margins are more like 40% to 50%. So we want to make sure that we never lose sight of the fact that the upgrade profitability will be ensured, only if we continue to bring in a steady flow of new owners. And this year, we're targeting around 25,000 to 30,000 new owners, which are important for our future growth. And so VPG declines because our tour flow mix shift has been more favorably to the new owner, who is a more expensive owner to secure than an upgrade. And so I think the VPG on an upgrade is over $3,000. The VPG on new owners is around $1,500. And so when you're doing more new owner acquisition, your VPG is bound to come down. But within upgrade and within new owner, within those distinct categories, upgrade was about the same VPG we had last year, so no deterioration in the upgrade component. And on new owners, new owner VPG actually improved somewhat, but it's that mixed shift. The third question you had was..."

But you're absolutely right. If I were looking at a deal right now, we'd probably be providing the financing, not letting somebody else do it. And Steve, just going back to the VPG question for a minute that Tom answered. One way to look at it numerically, because we all love numbers, is if you look at our Table 3, it shows our tour volume and our VPG broken down by quarter. And what you'll see is that the VPG was down a little bit 2010 to 2011, and the tour flow was up, about 11%. If you go back to 2009, you'll see a similar tour flow level and now our VPG is above what it was back then. Just, so to Tom's point, that our underlying upgrade sales VPG is up, it's just more of a mix issue. You can kind of see it there in the numbers."

When we look at this in the last downturn, the last increase in fuel prices and what happened with our hotels, what we found is that people may change their travel patterns.

On the first question about VPG and what the impact is and would we think about having 50,000 new customers versus 25,000 new customers, you're correct in the fact that if we wanted to have 50,000, we could probably have 50,000. Having 50,000 new customers means our marketing costs would be higher because we're generating a new tour, and a new tour cost more than an upgrade to generate. In addition, our close rate would go down a little bit because we close higher on upgrade sales than we do on new sales. So VPG would be impacted if we went up to 50,000 new customers. We think we're at the right balance now. We think by adding 25,000, we're freshening our pool of new potential of existing owners that we will have adequate upgrade opportunities running out into the foreseeable future. So we're comfortable at that level. But we could change it around. And we have a higher new sales generation, the customer generation back when we were at $2 billion sales base, for example. On the second question about the WAAM and is there a lot of competition. There are other people who are looking at the WAAM-type model, there's other who are executing on it. The good thing is, it's like going fishing in the spring when the brooks are fully stocked. There's a lot of fish out there, so it's kind of easy to pull them in, because there's a lot of product out there. So I don't think that that's an issue for us at all, frankly. And the third one on acquisitions, and seeing less acquisitions. I wouldn't say that we're seeing less. I would probably say that 2010 was probably a little bit unusual that we get 4 deals done. The fact was there was a lot of uncertainty during the 2008, 2009 time frame, as we all know. We didn't stop working on things. We didn't stop our team from looking at opportunities. And that may have created a little bit of backlog that all got completed in 2010. But we continue to look at opportunities. We continue to be active in this arena. And again, you can't model when they're going to come out. We can't model the opportunity of when the deals are available and will happen. So I wouldn't say that we're not seeing anything or that the market is dry. It's just, we're using this opportunity, a lack of deal, deal closings to buy back more stock. Thanks."

The first question, I don't know that I would say that there's more professionally managed in Europe than the U.S. There definitely is a more organized and consolidated professionally managed presence in Europe. In the U.S., a lot",382,"Okay. Chris, it's Steve. The first question, I don't know that I would say that there's more professionally managed in Europe than the U.S. There definitely is a more organized and consolidated professionally managed presence in Europe. In the U.S., a lot of the professionally managed are done by small realtors in a market that happen to manage a couple of homes and they don't tie into any large network. In the Europe and the U.K., it is a much more organized and consolidated effort, so the businesses that we have over there has been around for decades. They basically rolled in a lot of the small people into their network, and their network provides them marketing opportunities far superior to what a local, small realtor could do. So I don't know if I looked at the landscape that I would say that there's a lot more in one market or the other. There probably is because it’s been so well organized in Europe, a larger presence of professionally managed in Europe, but there also exists professionally managed in the U.S. It's just not under an umbrella brand or brands that really presents itself other than ResortQuest. As for the second half of the question, which related to, are we a listings company or are we a professionally managed? We are professionally managed. The reason I mentioned that we still do a good bit of our product, our transactions on the Internet, is I don't want people to think that we aren’t using the Internet as a source for distribution and marketing. We absolutely do, but we don't just take a listing fee from somebody and put their product up on the market, on the Internet and then let the consumer contact the person who put it up on our listing service. We manage the product that we show on our system, which allows us to have this really good inventory, bookable inventory model, where you can go online and immediately book what you want versus going through the process of contacting the owner of the home. Again, we think there's plenty of room for both models in the market. There's a very large fragmented market and so we're excited about the growth of this market overall, and our participation in it."

And so we remain cautious. In 2009, we did see the phenomenon you described, which was -- it seems like a recession friendly holiday solution for the holiday traveler in the U.K. And it may turn out to be that again this year.

We're saying we're cautious on the U.K. part of the business. So you seem to indicate that maybe it was an overall company indication, but as Tom said in his comments regarding the top end. On the second question, about U.K., let me just add one thing. The U.K. travelers, the second largest market for us to market to in Europe, the German traveler is the largest, the U.K. traveler is the second largest traveler for European travel. I agree with your comment about with the austerity measures, will that modify maybe and make the U.K. travel within the U.K. better. But it can also decrease the number of U.K. to Europe, to kind of an only Europe travelers. So we plan on both of them. So we're pretty well protected, but the fact is, the U.K. traveler may end up staying more within the U.K. versus going to Continental Europe. And that's the reason that we might see some shift there in which case we may have more product to market to the Dutch and German travelers."

Second quarter revenues increased 13% and adjusted EBITDA was up 17%. Adjusted EPS for the quarter grew 25% and came in $0.08 above the top end of our guidance range. Each of our businesses delivered growth in adjusted EBITDA and performed ahead of plans with particular strength this quarter in Lodging and Vacation Ownership. This strong performance and further visibility into second half of the year is allowing us to raise our guidance for 2011. Tom will go through the details in a few minutes. In addition, free cash flow is robust in the first half of the year coming in at $3.42 per share. We continue to implement our capital deployment strategy in a disciplined fashion to drive value for our shareholders. In the second quarter, we invested $200 million in share repurchases and July to date, we invested another $50 million. So far this year, we spent nearly $425 million on share repurchases. Our weighted average diluted share count is down by $17 million from a year ago. This contributed $0.06 of earnings in the second quarter compared with last year. Our results this quarter combined with our confidence in the short-term and long-term growth and cash flow potential of our businesses, convince us that share repurchase is a very solid investment. Having said that, our first priority is to continue the investment in our business to drive earnings growth and increase cash flow in the years to come. Our baseline sustainable free cash flow guidance of $600 million to $700 million a year assumes continuing investment in existing growth projects such us Apollo and our hotel business, RCI.com and our Vacation Exchange business and Voyager and our Vacation Ownership business.
We also continue to selectively evaluate potential acquisitions, which we will only pursue if they are strategically compelling and earnings accretive. Now moving to our business unit review. The Wyndham Hotel Group had a great quarter, exceeding our expectations with a 10% increase in RevPAR. Most significantly, we're seeing great improvement across all chain skill segments in the U.S. The lodging recovery is continuing and I believe we are exceptionally well positioned to capture more than our fair share of that recovery. The development environment is improving but financing still remains tight. Developers are looking to diversify the composition and geographic reach of their portfolios to include economy and midscale properties outside major city centers, which is where the majority of our brands are positioned. And, of course, the conversion market is always important in a tight credit environment. Both of these dynamics work to our benefit. We have a well seasoned development team able to capture opportunities both newbuild and conversion. We are the world's largest hotel franchise based in number of hotels, with over 72 properties, which translates almost 613,000 rooms in our system. We offer individual franchisees as well as multiproperty developers, a strong network of market-leading brands. Our brands cover every segment and we have a broad geographic reach. As we have discussed before, we are strengthening the successional base through a series of technology and business enhancements we call Apollo, and that further improving the value proposition to our hotel owner's. We recently began our franchisees to improve the content and navigation of our website. We launched our first beta test with the brand in June. Our early results are encouraging. Response times improved threefold and conversions were up 30%. In another Hotel group highlight, JD powers and Associates recently released the results of its annual guest satisfaction survey. For the 10th consecutive year, Microtel led the economy budget segment. In fact, Wyndham Hotel Group's economy budget brands took the first 3 positions in the segment.
No moving to Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. From a rental industry perspective we were pleased with the enthusiasm of investors over the recent HomeAway IPO. As a reminder, there are 2 operating models in the Vacation Rentals market. First, there's a rent by owner or listings model used by HomeAway and others. In this model, the vacation home owner lists his or her property on the website for a listing fee. The listing company refers the potential renter back to the homeowner to inquire about availability, make the reservation and then process the payment. The second model is the professionally managed model. This is primarily how our business operates at Wyndham Vacation Rentals. Approximately 60% of our bookings are transacted online. We, rather than the homeowner, control the inventory. We have uploaded in our system on a live and realtime basis. We hand select and expect the inventory, homeowners provide homes to us primarily on an exclusive basis. We process the payments and handle the customer service. And unlike the listings model, the consumer rarely deals with the homeowner. We are the world's largest company in this professionally managed segment of this growing market. We expect 2011 revenues from our Vacation Rental business to be over $700 million and transactions to exceed 1.3 million. We have approximately 93,000 properties in 32 countries, representing over 51,000 homeowners. We have tremendous scale, which we continue to expand. Integration of our most recent acquisitions Holidays and Resort Quest is progressing very well with both businesses ahead of our earnings expectations. We're making great progress on integrating our systems and leveraging best practices in inventory distribution strategies across all of our businesses. We are also the market leader in the exchange industry. While tempered growth in the timeshare industry has produced some headwinds for our exchange business, we have been able to drive growth and innovation resulting in a stable high free cash flow business. Through the end of 2010, our migration to online transactions has improved our exchange margin by over 130 basis points. The enhanced online experience also increases the overall value proposition for members through greater flexibility, functionality and better online content. Online transactions in the second quarter of 2011 were 38% of total transactions compared with 27% in the second quarter of 2010.
Now let's discuss the segment that's been receiving a lot of investor attention, Vacation Ownership. We had great response through initiative Tom started a year ago in repackaging this story. We recently had the management team out in the road and the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. We're happy for the investor acknowledgment because we knew this Timeshare business is a great business and we also know that we are the best Timeshare business in the world. Wyndham Vacation Ownership is highly evolved and highly adaptable business model resulting from years of innovation and operational excellence. With approximately 815,000 owners, 21,000 units and 160 resorts, we have the scale to fully leverage market opportunities such as a WAAM, our asset like model. Our owners have been investing in our points based products from more than 20 years. They know it, they love it and they buy more. Our points product offer owners a diverse range of vacation experiences, including clubbing and access and presidential reserve in both resorts and urban locations. We have a seasoned team of sales professionals and we have an execution based culture led by an exceptional management team. They have met or exceeded our expectations quarter-after-quarter even during the economic downturn. The fruit is really in the numbers. Over the past 5 years, which everyone would agree was pretty tumultuous, volume per guest is up approximately 50%. Adjusted EBITDA is up approximately 45%, and EBITDA margin has increased by over 750 basis points.
Let me transition now to a broader Wyndham Worldwide story. We recently completed our annual strategic reviews. Our 5 main strategic initiatives remain the same with the top 3 being the growth cash flow, rebound our portfolio to reemphasize our fee-for-service businesses an increase of market share. Since we established the strategic initiatives in 2009, we have remained on course and delivered against each of them, and we continue to define and pursue the opportunities for growth that are consistent with these initiatives. For example, the distressed real estate market has created a great opportunity for Wyndham Vacation Ownership to acquire high-quality inventory and very attractive pricing and driving improved margins. In addition to our asset opportunities, we're shifting a portion of our existing development budget to the purchase of inventory in a distressed real estate market. These initiatives support our strategy of optimizing the capital deployed to the Vacation Ownership business while extending the tail of the inventory already on our balance sheet. In addition, we are exploring a new concept, 12.0, which is a hybrid asset like solution. Under the WAAM 2.0 concept, we will sell third-party inventory per commission but we'll finance receivables. This will enable us to take advantage of the great spreads and high advance rates that we as a company are best able to realize. Within Wyndham Exchange and Rentals, we continue to innovate RCI to drive margin as well as member and developer satisfaction. The Vacation Rental team is laser focused on building helping the U.S. rental platform. We'll do this by applying our best in class strategies to grow organically and small tuck in acquisitions. In Wyndham Hotel group in addition to important initiatives to drive our core U.S. businesses at Apollo, we are pursuing an aggressive growth strategy around the world. For example, we are the largest U.S. hotel company in China with over 50,000 rooms. We expect to double that number in the next 5 years, and our long-term vision is to have a footprint in China that rivals our presence in the U.S. And in key states, we are planning to -- cities rather, we are planning to invest approximately $200 million in mezzanine and other financing over the next several years to support the growth of the Wyndham Hotel and Resorts brand. This entire strategic framework is consistent with our target of generating baseline free cash flow of at least $600 million to $700 million a year. This is approximately $3.50 to $4.10 per share based on our diluted share count guidance for 2011. I'm very optimistic about the future at Wyndham Worldwide and look forward to updating you as we execute these strategies 
Before I turn the call over to Tom, I want to note a significant milestone. Next week, we will celebrate the 5 year anniversary of our listings in the New York Stock Exchange. At that time, nobody anticipated that a few years later, we would all experience the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. What we did know was that we had great businesses, great people and great potential. We are proud of what we have accomplished during this period. Between dividends and share repurchase, we have returned nearly $1.7 billion to our shareholders over the past 5 years. The cumulative impact of our share repurchase activity over this period has been a 17% reduction in our share count. This combined with our growth has driven significant increases in key metrics on a per-share basis
Just to put a few numbers around it, revenues are up 38%. Adjusted EBITDA is up 87%. Impressive results. With all 3 of these businesses in great shape and the economy continuing to recover, we are more optimistic about what we can do over the next 5 years. Tom?"

great enabler of our long-term business goes. For 2011, we expect free cash flow of $3.50 to $4.10 per diluted share, based on our diluted share count guidance of $171 million. We expect to continue to grow in this important measure in the future. accelerated our growth and enhancing shareholder value by supporting further investment in the businesses, share repurchases and dividends.
Let me begin our quarterly operating review with the Wyndham Hotel Group, which had a great quarter. Revenues were up 7% and adjusted EBITDA was up 32%, driven by RevPAR improvements and lower bad debt expense. Adjusted margins improved 660 basis points. Systemwide RevPAR was up 9.7%. Now excluding the TRYP acquisition and in constant currency, RevPAR was up 5.8%. As in the first quarter, we saw occupancy gains across all regions and domestic chain sales segments. Encouragingly, we saw late gains across all chain sales segment domestically and across our regions except for Asia-Pacific. We believe the recovery is in full progress in our Lodging segments, including the economy and midscale segments. We ended the quarter with approximately 612,900 total rooms worldwide and development efforts in the quarter were robust. We opened over 16,000 rooms while terminating approximately 12,800 rooms in the quarter, in line with our expectations. The development team executed over 150 deals this quarter, up 6% compared with the year ago. The total pipeline consisted nearly 111,000 rooms, up 3% from the year ago. 64% of the pipeline is international, up from 49% a year ago. The new construction pipeline is up 10%, all international. Now all of these are good indication that we are successfully executing our international growth strategy. Wyndham Exchange and Rentals had another good quarter despite the difficult market conditions, with Exchange and Rentals results slightly better-than-expected. Segment revenue increased to $361 million, reflecting $53 million in incremental revenues from ResortQuest and James Villa Holidays and a $19 million benefit from favorable currency translation. Now excluding the acquisition-related incremental revenues and the impact of foreign currency, revenues increased 30%, reflecting higher rental revenues in our and Landal GreenParks businesses. Growth in exchange and the year-over-year change in the classification of revenue items expenses. Excluding currency impacts, exchange revenue in the second quarter increased about 2% compared with the same period in 2010. Consistent with our expectations, the average number of members of remained flat. Excluding currency, exchange revenue per member increased 1%, reflecting an increase in other transaction revenue, resulting from some of our recent innovations at RCI.com. Now remembering the November 2010 RCI.com release, we enhanced our week's exchange program by providing more transparency to our members and changed back on an exchange of lesser value. Change back deposit credits can be combined along with timeshare deposits, trade up into a higher value timeshare. In addition to the benefit of creating additional transactions, there is a fee for that service, which is already providing some revenue gains. Vacation Rentals revenue increased 57% to $180 million in the second quarter of a 2011 compared with the same period of 2010. Now our most recent additions, U.S. based ResortQuest and U.K. based James Villa Holiday contributed $46 million of incremental rental revenue during the quarter and foreign exchange had a $50 million favorable impact on Vacation Rental revenue. In constant currency excluding the acquisitions, rental revenues increased 30%. The average net price per Vacation Rental increased 5%, primarily driven by higher yield at our and Landal GreenParks. Transaction volumes declined slightly due to difficult market conditions in the market. Wyndham Exchange and Rentals adjusted EBITDA increased 5% in the quarter compared with same period in 2010, primarily reflecting the benefits of the ResortQuest and James Villa Holidays. Excluding the acquisitions, EBITDA was flat. Now we're pleased with that, during this difficult economic times in Europe. Our European Rentals business remained stable while others in the market had revenue and profit declines.
Now moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership this business once again delivered strong results. Compared to the prior year, revenues increased 7% tours were up 9% and VPG increased 3%. Year-to-date, we have added over 12,000 new owners into our systems and we are ahead of new owner goal of 25,000 for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2011 increased 25% to $130 million compared with $104 million in the second quarter of 2010. The increase reflects great sales results, lower loan loss provisions and a growing contribution from our property management business. Property management fees were 8% in the second quarter of 2011 compared with the comparable period in 2010. As you know, this business, which produced $50 million of EBITDA in 2010, provides a recurring fee-for-service revenue stream and steady and reliable growth. As anticipated, consumer finance revenues were down 3% due to a decrease in our contract receivables portfolio however, interest expense decreased 21% reflecting lower rates in our securitizations, which were partly offset by higher advance rates on our recent securitizations. Remember that higher advance rates improved cash flow but decreased EBITDA as we reported interest expense on securitized debt above the EBITDA line. Portfolio performance continues to improve somewhat. Write-offs during the second quarter were $75 million, down from $90 million to a year ago. The provision for loan losses was $80 million compared with $87 million in the second quarter of 2010. So we continue to see improvement in this important measures but at a moderate pace.
Now moving on to corporate. Excluding legacy related items, expenses increased $9 million, primarily reflecting increased information security and IT expenses. We are investing in our systems infrastructure and hiring additional information security staff to address the serious and increasing threat of data breaches, targeting the hospitality  industry. We will continue to keep you updated on this important progress.
Now let me review our activities in the capital markets where we had another busy and productive quarter. Last week, we announced the closing of a new $1 billion revolving credit facility to replace our $980 million facility, which was scheduled to mature in October of 2013. The maturity date of the new facility is July 15, 2016. There is no change to the overall corporate debt balance as a result of this transaction. Now the financing extends the credit facility to a 5 year term and has a more favorable pricing terms, which further strengthens our liquidity profile and decrease our ongoing interest expense. All of our historic relationship participated in the financing and several new participants were added, demonstrating the banking community's confidence in Wyndham Worldwide. Last month, we announced the renewal of our securitized timeshare receivables conduit facility. Our prior conduits were 1 year terms and this is a 2year  facility. This further strengthens our liquidity and balance sheet position and highlights the broad support enjoyed by our timeshare, ABS program. The new facility maintains capacity of $600 million.
Now I'd like to spend a few moments on guidance and we're going to post this to our website and mail it to you following the call. For the third quarter, we expect earnings per share of $0.86 to $0.89, assuming a share count of 168 million shares. As you saw from the press release, we are increasing our full year revenue guidance to $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion and our adjusted EBITDA guidance to $960 million to $975 million. We are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance from $2.15 to $2.25 to $2.32 to $2.40. The new EPS guidance is based on an expected diluted share count of 171 million shares, down from our original guidance of 181 million shares and our most recent guidance of 173 million shares. This new guidance reflects the benefits of our share repurchase program through the second quarter. The guidance excludes any further share repurchases. We have approximately $345 million remaining in our current repurchase authorization. We are narrowing the range on our D&A guidance by $5 million on the high-end. The new range is $180 million to $185 million. Interest expense guidance has been reduced to $130 million to $135 million reflecting lower borrower cost and higher capitalized interest. We expect our tax rate for the year-to-date to be a little lower than expected of about 38% and we think most of that reduction will come in the fourth quarter. Please note that the implied fourth quarter earnings per share guidance is $0.30 to $0.48 per share. Remember when considering year-over-year fourth quarter conversions that we benefited from an unusually low tax rate of 27% in 2010 and that the historic seasonality of our WER business has changed due to the acquisitions we did in 2010. Now drilling down to the business unit level. At the Hotel group, we are increasing our revenue guidance of $710 million $730 million in adjusted EBITDA guidance to $208 million to $215 million. Our RevPAR guidance increases 100 basis points to 6% to 8% year-over-year growth and room guidance remains unchanged at 1% to 3% year-over-year growth. We expect hotel margins to moderate for the remainder of the year reflecting planned increases in advertising spend compared to last year and timing differences, which I touched on earlier. Based on the new guidance, the implied full year margin improvement in the Hotel group is about 150 basis points to 175 basis points for the year. Exchange and Rentals revenue increased to $1.46 million to $1.5 million, and we're bringing up adjusted EBITDA to $343 million to $353 million. Exchange drivers remain unchanged. Average net price per vacation rentals increases to 25% to 27% year-over-year growth and rental transaction guidance decreases slightly to 16% to 18% year-over-year growth. The decline in transaction guidance is attributable to soft demand in our U.K. cottage business while the uplift of prices due to improved yield and the impact of currency in the first half of the year. Note that guidance assumes currency rates as of June 30. We are also raising Vacation Ownership revenues to $2 billion to $2.1 billion. We're bringing the EBITDA range of $495 million to $510 million, reflecting a narrowing of the VPG guidance 2% to 4% and an increase in tour flow of 5% to 8% from last year. We now expect corporate expenses to be $90 million $95 million, primarily reflecting increased information security costs as well as higher employee and bonus cost. We expect CapEx to be $225 million to $240 million, reflecting higher information technology and security cost but we also expect Vacation Ownership business spending to be within our original budget of $80 million to $90 million. And finally, we are confident in our free cash flow guidance of $600 million to $700 million or approximately $3.50 to $4.10 per share in 2011. And all of this points to another great year of financial and operational performance for the company. So with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve."

Number 1, typically we spend more CapEx in the second half of the year less than the first half of the year. So that's an important contributor. And as you know, we raised our CapEx guidance a bit. The second part is the seasonality of the rentals business. As you know, the way our rentals business in Europe works is we get cash early, we hold on to the cash and then we pay the homeowner the second half of the year. So the benefit that we get in the first half of the year, receiving cash early is the offset is in the second half of the year. And then finally, as we pointed out, there's about $50 million of our free cash flow number that's associated with the settlement that we had with the U.K. government on a outstanding value added tax issue and on a cash flow basis that was a $50 million benefit for the quarter. So those are the 3 factors why we think that $600 million to $700 million is still the right number and still a very strong number on a per-share basis."

Second quarter revenues increased 13%, and adjusted EBITDA was up 17%. Adjusted EPS for the quarter grew 25% and came in $0.08 above the top end of our guidance range. Each of our businesses delivered growth in adjusted EBITDA and performed ahead of plan with particular strength this quarter in lodging and vacation ownership. This strong performance and further visibility into the second half of the year is allowing us to raise our guidance for 2011. Tom will go through the details in a few minutes. In addition, free cash flow is robust in the first half of the year coming in at $3.42 per share. We continue to implement our capital deployment strategy in a disciplined fashion to drive value for our shareholders. In the second quarter, we invested $200 million in share repurchases and July to date, we invested another $50 million. So far this year, we have spent nearly $425 million on share repurchases. Our weighted average diluted share count is down by $17 million from a year ago. This contributed $0.06 of earnings in the second quarter compared with last year. Our results this quarter, combined with our confidence in the short-term and long-term growth and cash flow potential of our businesses, convince us that share repurchase is a very solid investment. Having said that, our first priority is the continued investment in our business to drive earnings growth and increase cash flow in the years to come. Our baseline sustainable free cash flow guidance of $600 million to $700 million a year assumes continuing investment in existing growth projects such as Apollo and our hotel business, RCI.com and our vacation exchange business and voyager and our vacation ownership business.
We also continue to selectively evaluate potential acquisitions, which we will only pursue if they are strategically compelling and earnings accretive. Now moving to our business unit review. The Wyndham Hotel Group had a great quarter, exceeding our expectations with almost a 10% increase in RevPAR. Most significantly, we are seeing rate improvement across all chain scale segments in the U.S. The lodging recovery is continuing, and I believe we are exceptionally well positioned to capture more than our fair share of that recovery. The development environment is improving, but financing still remains tight. Developers are looking to diversify the composition and geographic reach of their portfolios to include economy and midscale properties outside major city centers, which is where the majority of our brands are positioned. And of course, the conversion market is always important in a tight credit environment. Both of these dynamics work to our benefit. We have a well seasoned development team able to capture opportunities both new build and conversion. We are the world's largest hotel franchisor based on a number of hotels with over 7,200 properties, which translates to almost 613,000 rooms in our system. We offer individual franchisees as well as multiproperty developers a strong network of market-leading brands. Our brands cover every segment, and we have a broad geographic reach. As we have discussed before, we are strengthening this exceptional base through a series of technology and business enhancements we call Apollo aimed at further improving the value proposition to our hotel owners. We recently began an effort with our franchisees to improve the content and navigation of our websites. We launched our first beta test with the Baymont brand in June. Our early results are encouraging. Response times improved threefold, and conversions were up 30%. In another hotel group highlight, J.D. Power and Associates recently released the results of its annual guest satisfaction survey. For the 10th consecutive year, Microtel leads the economy/budget segment. In fact, Wyndham Hotel Group's economy/budget brands took the first 3 positions in the segment.
Now moving to Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. From a rental industry perspective, we were pleased with the enthusiasm of investors over the recent HomeAway IPO. As a reminder, there are 2 operating models in the vacation rentals market. First, there's a rent-by-owner or listings model used by HomeAway and others. In this model, the vacation homeowner lists his or her property on a website for a listing fee. The listing company refers the potential renter back to the homeowner to inquire about availability, make the reservation and then process the payment. The second model is the professionally managed model. This is primarily how our business operates at Wyndham Vacation Rentals. Approximately 60% of our bookings are transacted online. We, rather than the homeowner, control the inventory. We have uploaded in our system on a live and realtime basis. We hand-select and inspect the inventory. Homeowners provide homes to us primarily on an exclusive basis. We process the payments and handle the customer service. And unlike the listings model, the consumer rarely deals with the homeowner. We are the world's largest company in this professionally managed segment of this growing market. We expect 2011 revenues from our vacation rental business to be over $700 million and transactions to exceed 1.3 million. We have approximately 93,000 properties in 32 countries, representing over 51,000 homeowners. We have tremendous scale, which we continue to expand. Integration of our most recent acquisitions, James Villa Holidays and ResortQuest, is progressing very well with both businesses ahead of our earnings expectations. We are making great progress on integrating our systems and leveraging best practices in the inventory distribution strategies across all of our businesses. We are also the market leader in the exchange industry. While tempered growth in the timeshare industry has produced some headwinds for our exchange business, we have been able to drive growth through innovation resulting in a stable high free cash flow business. Through the end of 2010, our migration to online transactions has improved our exchange margin by over 130 basis points. The enhanced online experience also increases the overall value proposition to our members through greater flexibility, functionality and better online content. Online transactions in the second quarter of 2011 were 38% of total transactions, compared with 27% in the second quarter of 2010.
Now let's discuss the segment that's been receiving a lot of investor attention, vacation ownership. We had great response through an initiative Tom started about a year ago in repackaging the story. We recently had the management team out on the road, and the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. We're happy for the investor acknowledgment because we knew this timeshare business is a great business, and we also know that we have the best timeshare business in the world. Wyndham Vacation Ownership is a highly evolved and highly adaptable business model, resulting from years of innovation and operational excellence. With approximately 815,000 owners, 21,000 units and 160 resorts, we have the scale to fully leverage market opportunities such as WAAM, our asset-light model. Our owners have been investing in our points-based products for more than 20 years. They know it, they love it, and they buy more. Our points products offer owners a diverse range of vacation experiences, including CLUB WYNDHAM Access and Presidential Reserve in both resorts and urban locations. We have a seasoned team of sales professionals, and we have an execution-based culture led by an exceptional management team. They have met or exceeded our expectations quarter-after-quarter even during the economic downturn. The fruit is really in the numbers. Over the past 5 years, which everyone would agree, was pretty tumultuous, volume per guest is up approximately 50%. Adjusted EBITDA is up approximately 45%, and the EBITDA margin has increased by over 750 basis points.
Let me transition now to a broader Wyndham Worldwide story. We recently completed our annual strategic reviews. Our 5 main strategic initiatives remain the same with the top 3 being the growth cash flow rebounds our portfolio to emphasize our fee-for-service businesses an increased market share. Since we established these strategic initiatives in 2009, we have remained on course and have delivered against each of them. And we continue to find and pursue new opportunities for growth that are consistent with these initiatives. For example, the distressed real estate market has created a great opportunity for Wyndham Vacation Ownership to acquire high-quality inventory at very attractive prices and drive improved margins. In addition to our asset-light opportunities, we're shifting a portion of our existing development budget to the purchase of inventory in a distressed real estate market. This initiative supports our strategy of optimizing the capital deployed to the vacation ownership business, while extending the tail of the inventory already on our balance sheet. In addition, we are exploring a new concept, WAAM 2.0, which is a hybrid asset-light solution. Under the WAAM 2.0 concept, we will sell third-party inventory for a commission, but we'll finance the receivables. This will enable us to take advantage of the great spreads and high advance rates that we as a company are best able to realize. Within Wyndham Exchange and Rentals, we continue to innovate RCI to drive margin as well as member and developer satisfaction. The Vacation Rental team is laser focused on building out the U.S. rental platform. We'll do this by applying our best-in-class strategies to grow organically and with small tuck-in acquisitions. In Wyndham Hotel Group, in addition to important initiatives to drive our core U.S. business such as Apollo, we are pursuing an aggressive growth strategy around the world. For example, we are the largest U.S. hotel company in China with over 50,000 rooms. We expect to double that number in the next 5 years, and our long-term vision is to have a footprint in China that rivals our presence in the U.S. And in key U.S. states, we are planning to -- cities rather -- we are planning to invest approximately $200 million in mezzanine and other financing over the next several years to support the growth of the Wyndham Hotel and Resorts brand. This entire strategic framework is consistent with our target of generating baseline free cash flow of at least $600 million to $700 million a year. This is approximately $3.50 to $4.10 per share based on our diluted share count guidance for 2011. I'm very optimistic about the future at Wyndham Worldwide and look forward to updating you as we execute these strategies. 
Before I turn the call over to Tom, I want to note a significant milestone. Next week, we will celebrate the 5-year anniversary of our listing on the New York Stock Exchange. At that time, nobody anticipated that a few years later, we all would experience the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. What we did know was that we had great businesses, great people and great potential. We are proud of what we have accomplished during this period. Between dividends and share repurchase, we have returned nearly $1.7 billion to our shareholders over the past 5 years. The cumulative impact of our share repurchase activity over this period has been a 17% reduction in our share count. This, combined with our growth, has driven significant increases in key metrics on a per share basis
Just to put a few numbers around it, revenues are up 38%. Adjusted EBITDA is up 87%, impressive results. With all 3 of these businesses in great shape and the economy continuing to recover, we're even more optimistic about what we can do over the next 5 years. Tom?"

Our second quarter results reflect continued momentum and execution across our businesses and our ongoing commitment to return cash to shareholders.

Our second quarter results reflect continued momentum and execution across our businesses and our ongoing commitment to return cash to shareholders. Adjusted EBITDA increased 17%, and adjusted earnings per share increased 25% compared with the second quarter of 2010. These results reflect improved RevPAR performance and lower bad debt expense at the Wyndham Hotel Group, growth in our Wyndham Vacation Exchange and Rentals business, higher sales and a reduction in the loan loss provision at Wyndham Vacation Ownership, and the meaningful impact of our ongoing share repurchase program. We came in $0.08 above the top end of our guidance range. Each business performed better than our expectations. In addition, there was some benefit about $0.03, primarily in lodging, from the timing of expenses in the quarter which we'll give back in the second half of the year. Share repurchase, which is excluded from our guidance, also contributed to the b. Free cash flow increased to $595 million or $3.42 per share for the first 6 months in 2011. 
[Technical Difficulty] 
great enabler of our long-term business goals. For 2011, we expect free cash flow of $3.50 to $4.10 per diluted share based on our diluted share count guidance of $171 million. We expect to continue to grow this important measure in the future, accelerate on our growth and enhancing shareholder value by supporting further investment in the businesses, share repurchases and dividends.
Let me begin our quarterly operating review with the Wyndham Hotel Group, which had a great quarter. Revenues were up 7%, and adjusted EBITDA was up 32%, driven by RevPAR improvements and lower bad debt expense. Adjusted margins improved 660 basis points. Systemwide RevPAR was up 9.7%. Now excluding the Tryp acquisition and in constant currency, RevPAR was up 5.8%. As in the first quarter, we saw occupancy gains across all regions and domestic chain scale segments. Encouragingly, we saw rate gains across all chain scale segments domestically and across all regions except for Asia-Pacific. We believe the recovery is in full progress in all lodging segments, including the economy and midscale segments. We ended the quarter with approximately 612,900 hotel rooms worldwide, and development efforts in the quarter were robust. We opened over 16,000 rooms, while terminating approximately 12,800 rooms in the quarter in line with our expectations. The development team executed over 150 deals this quarter, up 6% compared with a year ago. The total pipeline consisted nearly 111,000 rooms, up 3% from a year ago. 64% of the pipeline is international, up from 49% a year ago. The new construction pipeline is up 10%, all international. Now all of this is a good indication that we are successfully executing our international growth strategy. Wyndham Exchange and Rentals had another good quarter inspite of difficult market conditions with exchange and rentals results slightly better than expected. Segment revenue increased to $361 million, reflecting $53 million in incremental revenues from ResortQuest and James Villa Holidays, and a $19 million benefit from favorable currency translations. Now excluding the acquisition-related incremental revenues and the impact of foreign currency, revenues increased 3%, reflecting higher rental revenues in our Novasol and Landal GreenParks businesses, growth in exchange and the year-over-year change in the classification of some contra revenue items to expenses. Excluding currency impacts, exchange revenue in the second quarter increased about 2% compared with the same period in 2010. Consistent with our expectations, the average number of members remained flat. Excluding currency, exchange revenue per member increased 1%, reflecting an increase in other transaction revenue, resulting from some of our recent innovations at RCI.com. Now remember in the November 2010 RCI.com release, we enhanced our Weeks exchange program by providing more transparency to our members and change back on an exchange of lesser value. Change back deposit credits can be combined, along with timeshare deposits, to trade up into a higher value timeshare. In addition to the benefit of creating additional transactions, there is a fee for that service which is already providing some revenue gain. Vacation rentals revenue increased 57% to $180 million in the second quarter of 2011 compared with the same period of 2010. Now our most recent additions, U.S. based ResortQuest and U.K. based James Villa Holidays contributed $46 million of incremental rental revenue during the quarter, and foreign exchange movement had a $15 million favorable impact on vacation rental revenue. In constant currency and excluding the acquisitions, rental revenues increased 3%. The average net price per vacation rental increased 5%, primarily driven by a higher yield at our Novasol and Landal GreenParks businesses. Transaction volumes declined slightly due to difficult market conditions in the U.K. Wyndham Exchange and Rentals' adjusted EBITDA increased 5% in the quarter compared with the same period in 2010, primarily reflecting the benefits of the ResortQuest and James Villa Holidays acquisitions. Excluding the acquisitions, EBITDA was flat. Now we're pleased with that during these difficult economic times in Europe. Our European rentals business remained stable, while others in the market had revenue and profit declines.
Now moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership, this business once again delivered strong results. Compared to the prior year, revenues increased 7%. Tours were up by 9%, and VPG increased 3%. Year-to-date, we have added over 12,000 new owners into our system, and we are ahead of our new owner goal of 25,000 for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter 2011 increased 25% to $130 million, compared with $104 million in the second quarter of 2010. The increase reflects great sales results, lower loan loss provisions and a growing contribution from our property management business. Property management fees grew 8% in the second quarter of 2011, compared with the comparable period in 2010. As you know, this business, which produced $50 million of EBITDA in 2010, provides a recurring fee-for-service revenue stream and steady, reliable growth. As anticipated, consumer finance revenues were down 3% due to a decrease in our contract receivables portfolio. However, interest expense decreased 21%, reflecting lower rates in our securitizations, which were partly offset by higher advance rates on our recent securitizations. Remember that higher advance rates improved cash flow but decreased EBITDA as we report the interest expense on securitized debt above the EBITDA line. Portfolio performance continues to improve somewhat. Write-offs during the second quarter were $75 million, down from $90 million a year ago. The provision for loan losses was $80 million, compared with $87 million in the second quarter of 2010. So we continue to see improvement in this important measures but at a moderate pace.
Now moving on to corporate. Excluding legacy related items, expenses increased $9 million, primarily reflecting increased information security and IT expenses. We are investing in our systems infrastructure and hiring additional information security staff to address the serious and increasing threat of data breaches, targeting the hospitality  industry. We will continue to keep you updated on this important progress.
Now let me review our activities in the capital markets where we had another busy and productive quarter. Last week, we announced the closing of a new $1 billion revolving credit facility to replace our $980 million facility, which was scheduled to mature in October of 2013. The maturity date of the new facility is July 15, 2016. There is no change to the overall corporate debt balance as a result of this transaction. Now the financing extends the credit facility to a 5-year term and has more favorable pricing terms, which further strengthens our liquidity profile and decreases our ongoing interest expense. All of our historical relationship banks participated in the financing, and several new participants were added, demonstrating the banking community's confidence in Wyndham Worldwide. Last month, we announced the renewal of our securitized timeshare receivables conduit facility. Our prior conduits were 1-year terms, and this is a 2-year  facility. This further strengthens our liquidity and balance sheet position and highlights the broad support enjoyed by our timeshare ABS program. The new facility maintains capacity of $600 million.
Now I'd like to spend a few moments on guidance, and we're going to post this to our website and email it to you following the call. For the third quarter, we expect earnings per share of $0.86 to $0.89, assuming a share count of 168 million shares. As you saw from the press release, we are increasing our full year revenue guidance to $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion, and our adjusted EBITDA guidance to $960 million to $975 million. We are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance from $2.15 to $2.25 to $2.32 to $2.40. The new EPS guidance is based on an expected diluted share count of 171 million shares, down from our original guidance of 181 million shares and our most recent guidance of 173 million shares. This new guidance reflects the benefits of our share repurchase program through the second quarter. The guidance excludes any further share repurchases. We have approximately $345 million remaining on our current repurchase authorization. We are narrowing the range on our D&A guidance by $5 million on the high end. The new range is $180 million to $185 million. Interest expense guidance has been reduced to $130 million to $135 million, reflecting lower borrowing cost and higher capitalized interest. We expect our tax rate for the year to be a little lower than expected at about 38%, and we think most of that reduction will come in the fourth quarter. Please note that the implied fourth quarter earnings per share guidance is $0.38 to $0.43 per share. Remember when considering year-over-year fourth quarter comparison that we benefited from an unusually low tax rate of 27% in 2010, and that the historic seasonality of our WER business has changed due to the acquisitions we did in 2010. Now drilling down to the business unit level. At the hotel group, we are increasing our revenue guidance to $710 million to $730 million, and adjusted EBITDA guidance to $208 million to $215 million. Our RevPAR guidance increases 100 basis points to 6% to 8% year-over-year growth, and room guidance remains unchanged at 1% to 3% year-over-year growth. We expect hotel margins to moderate for the remainder of the year, reflecting planned increases in advertising spend compared to last year and timing differences, which I touched on earlier. Based on the new guidance, the implied full year margin improvement in the hotel group is about 150 to 175 basis points for the year. Exchange and rentals revenue increased to $1.46 billion to $1.5 billion, and we're bringing up adjusted EBITDA to $343 million to $353 million. Exchange drivers remain unchanged. Average net price per vacation rental increases to 25% to 27% year-over-year growth. And rental transaction guidance decreases slightly to 16% to 18% year-over-year growth. The decline in transaction guidance is attributable to soft demand at our U.K. cottage business while the uplift in prices due to improved yield and the impact of currency in the first half of the year. Note that guidance assumes currency rates as of June 30. We're also raising vacation ownership revenues to $2 billion to $2.1 billion. We're bringing the EBITDA range up to $495 million to $510 million, reflecting a narrowing of the VPG guidance to 2% to 4%, and an increase in tour flow of 5% to 8% from last year. We now expect corporate expenses to be $90 million to $95 million, primarily reflecting increased information security costs as well as higher employee and bonus cost. We expect CapEx to be $225 million to $240 million, reflecting higher information technology and security cost. But we also expect vacation ownership inventory spending to be within our original budget of $80 million to $90 million. And finally, we are confident in our free cash flow guidance of $600 million to $700 million or approximately $3.50 to $4.10 per share in 2011. And all of this points to another great year of financial and operational performance for the company. So with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve."

The second part is the seasonality of the rentals business.

So the benefit that we get in the first half of the year of receiving cash early is the offset is in the second half of the year. And then finally, as we pointed out, there's about $50 million in our free cash flow number that's associated with the settlement that we had with the U.K. government on an outstanding value-added tax issue and on a cash flow basis that was a $50 million benefit for the quarter. So those are the 3 factors why we think that $600 million to $700 million is still the right number and still a very strong number on a per share basis."

The industry is growing. It's just not growing in the pace it was several years ago. So a lot of the big players like ourselves and Marriott, Walt Disney are all continuing to sell products and therefore, there is growth in the industry. It's just not as fast as the growth historically was, and it really unfortunately is a story of the haves and have-nots. The larger companies have access to capital. The smaller companies do not yet have access to a readily available capital. We see new players coming into market all the time. We've seen new players, single players move their financing sources coming in. Hopefully, that will continue to fuel some of the smaller players who have had a difficult time accessing capital. There are some terrific operators out there who just can't access to capital they need in order to sell timeshare and finance the receivables that, that sales generate. So it's still -- we still see improvement, but it's going to take some time as we previously said for that to return. As to the distressed inventory question, it's really, Mike, it's a combination of both. It's other developers who are looking to sell off portions of their development because they are unable to access that financing that I was speaking of. But it's also projects that were developed as full ownership condos that are being converted into timeshare. And again, as long as it's in the right place, the product quality is right, and we can give an experience to our consumers that is consistent with what the Wyndham Vacation Ownership wants to provide then it makes sense for us.

Second quarter revenues increased 13%, and adjusted EBITDA was up 17%. Adjusted EPS for the quarter grew 25% and came in $0.08 above the top end of our guidance range. Each of our businesses delivered growth in adjusted EBITDA and performed ahead of plan with particular strength this quarter in lodging and vacation ownership. This strong performance and further visibility into the second half of the year is allowing us to raise our guidance for 2011. Tom will go through the details in a few minutes. In addition, free cash flow is robust in the first half of the year coming in at $3.42 per share. We continue to implement our capital deployment strategy in a disciplined fashion to drive value for our shareholders. In the second quarter, we invested $200 million in share repurchases and July to date, we invested another $50 million. So far this year, we have spent nearly $425 million on share repurchases. Our weighted average diluted share count is down by $17 million from a year ago. This contributed $0.06 of earnings in the second quarter compared with last year. Our results this quarter, combined with our confidence in the short-term and long-term growth and cash flow potential of our businesses, convince us that share repurchase is a very solid investment. Having said that, our first priority is the continued investment in our business to drive earnings growth and increase cash flow in the years to come. Our baseline sustainable free cash flow guidance of $600 million to $700 million a year assumes continuing investment in existing growth projects such as Apollo and our hotel business, RCI.com and our vacation exchange business and voyager and our vacation ownership business.
We also continue to selectively evaluate potential acquisitions, which we will only pursue if they are strategically compelling and earnings accretive. Now moving to our business unit review. The Wyndham Hotel Group had a great quarter, exceeding our expectations with almost a 10% increase in RevPAR. Most significantly, we are seeing rate improvement across all chain scale segments in the U.S. The lodging recovery is continuing, and I believe we are exceptionally well positioned to capture more than our fair share of that recovery. The development environment is improving, but financing still remains tight. Developers are looking to diversify the composition and geographic reach of their portfolios to include economy and mid-scale properties outside major city centers, which is where the majority of our brands are positioned. And of course, the conversion market is always important in a tight credit environment. Both of these dynamics work to our benefit. We have a well seasoned development team able to capture opportunities both new build and conversion. We are the world's largest hotel franchisor based on a number of hotels with over 7,200 properties, which translates to almost 613,000 rooms in our system. We offer individual franchisees as well as multi-property developers a strong network of market-leading brands. Our brands cover every segment, and we have a broad geographic reach. As we have discussed before, we are strengthening this exceptional base through a series of technology and business enhancements we call Apollo aimed at further improving the value proposition to our hotel owners. We recently began an effort with our franchisees to improve the content and navigation of our websites. We launched our first beta test with the Baymont brand in June. Our early results are encouraging. Response times improved threefold, and conversions were up 30%. In another hotel group highlight, J.D. Power and Associates recently released the results of its annual guest satisfaction survey. For the 10th consecutive year, Microtel leads the economy/budget segment. In fact, Wyndham Hotel Group's economy/budget brands took the first 3 positions in the segment.
Now moving to Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. From a rental industry perspective, we were pleased with the enthusiasm of investors over the recent HomeAway IPO. As a reminder, there are 2 operating models in the vacation rentals market. First, there's a rent-by-owner or listings model used by HomeAway and others. In this model, the vacation homeowner lists his or her property on a website for a listing fee. The listing company refers the potential renter back to the homeowner to inquire about availability, make the reservation and then process the payment. The second model is the professionally managed model. This is primarily how our business operates at Wyndham Vacation Rentals. Approximately 60% of our bookings are transacted online. We, rather than the homeowner, control the inventory. We have uploaded in our system on a live and realtime basis. We hand-select and inspect the inventory. Homeowners provide homes to us primarily on an exclusive basis. We process the payments and handle the customer service. And unlike the listings model, the consumer rarely deals with the homeowner. We are the world's largest company in this professionally managed segment of this growing market. We expect 2011 revenues from our vacation rental business to be over $700 million and transactions to exceed 1.3 million. We have approximately 93,000 properties in 32 countries, representing over 51,000 homeowners. We have tremendous scale, which we continue to expand. Integration of our most recent acquisitions, James Villa Holidays and ResortQuest, is progressing very well with both businesses ahead of our earnings expectations. We are making great progress on integrating our systems and leveraging best practices in the inventory distribution strategies across all of our businesses. We are also the market leader in the exchange industry. While tempered growth in the timeshare industry has produced some headwinds for our exchange business, we have been able to drive growth through innovation resulting in a stable high free cash flow business. Through the end of 2010, our migration to online transactions has improved our exchange margin by over 130 basis points. The enhanced online experience also increases the overall value proposition to our members through greater flexibility, functionality and better online content. Online transactions in the second quarter of 2011 were 38% of total transactions, compared with 27% in the second quarter of 2010.
Now let's discuss the segment that's been receiving a lot of investor attention, vacation ownership. We had great response through an initiative Tom started about a year ago in repackaging this story. We recently had the management team out on the road, and the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. We're happy for the investor acknowledgment because we knew this timeshare business is a great business, and we also know that we have the best timeshare business in the world. Wyndham Vacation Ownership is a highly evolved and highly adaptable business model, resulting from years of innovation and operational excellence. With approximately 815,000 owners, 21,000 units and 160 resorts, we have the scale to fully leverage market opportunities such as WAAM, our asset-light model. Our owners have been investing in our points-based products for more than 20 years. They know it, they love it, and they buy more. Our points products offer owners a diverse range of vacation experiences, including CLUB WYNDHAM Access and Presidential Reserve in both resorts and urban locations. We have a seasoned team of sales professionals, and we have an execution-based culture led by an exceptional management team. They have met or exceeded our expectations quarter after quarter even during the economic downturn. The fruit is really in the numbers. Over the past 5 years, which everyone would agree, was pretty tumultuous, volume per guest is up approximately 50%. Adjusted EBITDA is up approximately 45%, and the EBITDA margin has increased by over 750 basis points.
Let me transition now to a broader Wyndham Worldwide story. We recently completed our annual strategic reviews. Our 5 main strategic initiatives remain the same with the top 3 being to growth cash flow, rebalance our portfolio to emphasize our fee-for-service businesses and increase market share. Since we established these strategic initiatives in 2009, we have remained on course and have delivered against each of them. And we continue to find and pursue new opportunities for growth that are consistent with these initiatives. For example, the distressed real estate market has created a great opportunity for Wyndham Vacation Ownership to acquire high-quality inventory at very attractive prices and drive improved margins. In addition to our asset-light opportunities, we're shifting a portion of our existing development budget to the purchase of inventory in a distressed real estate market. This initiative supports our strategy of optimizing the capital deployed to the vacation ownership business, while extending the tail of the inventory already on our balance sheet. In addition, we are exploring a new concept, WAAM 2.0, which is a hybrid asset-light solution. Under the WAAM 2.0 concept, we will sell third-party inventory for a commission, but we'll finance the receivables. This will enable us to take advantage of the great spreads and high advance rates that we as a company are best able to realize. Within Wyndham Exchange and Rentals, we continue to innovate RCI to drive margin as well as member and developer satisfaction. The Vacation Rental team is laser focused on building out the U.S. rental platform. We'll do this by applying our best-in-class strategies to grow organically and with small tuck-in acquisitions. In Wyndham Hotel Group, in addition to important initiatives to drive our core U.S. business such as Apollo, we are pursuing an aggressive growth strategy around the world. For example, we are the largest U.S. hotel company in China with over 50,000 rooms. We expect to double that number in the next 5 years, and our long-term vision is to have a footprint in China that rivals our presence in the U.S. And in key U.S. states, we are planning to -- cities rather -- we are planning to invest approximately $200 million in mezzanine and other financing over the next several years to support the growth of the Wyndham Hotel and Resorts brand. This entire strategic framework is consistent with our target of generating baseline free cash flow of at least $600 million to $700 million a year. This is approximately $3.50 to $4.10 per share based on our diluted share count guidance for 2011. I'm very optimistic about the future at Wyndham Worldwide and look forward to updating you as we execute these strategies. 
Before I turn the call over to Tom, I want to note a significant milestone. Next week, we will celebrate the 5-year anniversary of our listing on the New York Stock Exchange. At that time, nobody anticipated that a few years later, we all would experience the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. What we did know was that we had great businesses, great people and great potential. We are proud of what we have accomplished during this period. Between dividends and share repurchase, we have returned nearly $1.7 billion to our shareholders over the past 5 years. The cumulative impact of our share repurchase activity over this period has been a 17% reduction in our share count. This, combined with our growth, has driven significant increases in key metrics on a per share basis
Just to put a few numbers around it, revenues are up 38%. Adjusted EBITDA is up 87%, impressive results. With all 3 of these businesses in great shape and the economy continuing to recover, we're even more optimistic about what we can do over the next 5 years. Tom?"

We expect to continue to grow this important measure in the future, accelerate on our growth and enhancing shareholder value by supporting further investment in the businesses, share repurchases and dividends.
Let me begin our quarterly operating review with the Wyndham Hotel Group, which had a great quarter. Revenues were up 7%, and adjusted EBITDA was up 32%, driven by RevPAR improvements and lower bad debt expense. Adjusted margins improved 660 basis points. Systemwide RevPAR was up 9.7%. Now excluding the Tryp acquisition and in constant currency, RevPAR was up 5.8%. As in the first quarter, we saw occupancy gains across all regions and domestic chain scale segments. Encouragingly, we saw rate gains across all chain scale segments domestically and across all regions except for Asia-Pacific. We believe the recovery is in full progress in all lodging segments, including the economy and mid-scale segments. We ended the quarter with approximately 612,900 hotel rooms worldwide, and development efforts in the quarter were robust. We opened over 16,000 rooms, while terminating approximately 12,800 rooms in the quarter in line with our expectations. The development team executed over 150 deals this quarter, up 6% compared with a year ago. The total pipeline consisted nearly 111,000 rooms, up 3% from a year ago. 64% of the pipeline is international, up from 49% a year ago. The new construction pipeline is up 10%, all international. Now all of this is a good indication that we are successfully executing our international growth strategy. Wyndham Exchange and Rentals had another good quarter in spite of difficult market conditions with exchange and rentals results slightly better than expected. Segment revenue increased to $361 million, reflecting $53 million in incremental revenues from ResortQuest and James Villa Holidays, and a $19 million benefit from favorable currency translations. Now excluding the acquisition-related incremental revenues and the impact of foreign currency, revenues increased 3%, reflecting higher rental revenues in our Novasol and Landal GreenParks businesses, growth in exchange and the year-over-year change in the classification of some contra revenue items to expenses. Excluding currency impacts, exchange revenue in the second quarter increased about 2% compared with the same period in 2010. Consistent with our expectations, the average number of members remained flat. Excluding currency, exchange revenue per member increased 1%, reflecting an increase in other transaction revenue, resulting from some of our recent innovations at RCI.com. Now remember in the November 2010 RCI.com release, we enhanced our Weeks exchange program by providing more transparency to our members and change back on an exchange of lesser value. Change back deposit credits can be combined, along with timeshare deposits, to trade up into a higher value timeshare. In addition to the benefit of creating additional transactions, there is a fee for that service which is already providing some revenue gain. Vacation rentals revenue increased 57% to $180 million in the second quarter of 2011 compared with the same period of 2010. Now our most recent additions, U.S. based ResortQuest and U.K. based James Villa Holidays contributed $46 million of incremental rental revenue during the quarter, and foreign exchange movement had a $15 million favorable impact on vacation rental revenue. In constant currency and excluding the acquisitions, rental revenues increased 3%. The average net price per vacation rental increased 5%, primarily driven by a higher yield at our Novasol and Landal GreenParks businesses. Transaction volumes declined slightly due to difficult market conditions in the U.K. Wyndham Exchange and Rentals' adjusted EBITDA increased 5% in the quarter compared with the same period in 2010, primarily reflecting the benefits of the ResortQuest and James Villa Holidays acquisitions. Excluding the acquisitions, EBITDA was flat. Now we're pleased with that during these difficult economic times in Europe. Our European rentals business remained stable, while others in the market had revenue and profit declines.
Now moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. This business once again delivered strong results. Compared to the prior year, revenues increased 7%. Tours were up by 9%, and VPG increased 3%. Year-to-date, we have added over 12,000 new owners into our system, and we are ahead of our new owner goal of 25,000 for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter 2011 increased 25% to $130 million, compared with $104 million in the second quarter of 2010. The increase reflects great sales results, lower loan loss provisions and a growing contribution from our property management business. Property management fees grew 8% in the second quarter of 2011, compared with the comparable period in 2010. As you know, this business, which produced $50 million of EBITDA in 2010, provides a recurring fee-for-service revenue stream and steady, reliable growth. As anticipated, consumer finance revenues were down 3% due to a decrease in our contract receivables portfolio. However, interest expense decreased 21%, reflecting lower rates on our securitizations, which were partly offset by higher advance rates on our recent securitizations. Remember that higher advance rates improved cash flow but decreased EBITDA as we report the interest expense on securitized debt above the EBITDA line. Portfolio performance continues to improve somewhat. Write-offs during the second quarter were $75 million, down from $90 million a year ago. The provision for loan losses was $80 million, compared with $87 million in the second quarter of 2010. So we continue to see improvement in these important measures but at a moderate pace.
Now moving on to corporate. Excluding legacy related items, expenses increased $9 million, primarily reflecting increased information security and IT expenses. We are investing in our systems infrastructure and hiring additional information security staff to address the serious and increasing threat of data breaches, targeting the hospitality  industry. We will continue to keep you updated on this important progress.
Now let me review our activities in the capital markets where we had another busy and productive quarter. Last week, we announced the closing of a new $1 billion revolving credit facility to replace our $980 million facility, which was scheduled to mature in October of 2013. The maturity date of the new facility is July 15, 2016. There is no change to the overall corporate debt balance as a result of this transaction. Now the financing extends the credit facility to a 5-year term and has more favorable pricing terms, which further strengthens our liquidity profile and decreases our ongoing interest expense. All of our historical relationship banks participated in the financing, and several new participants were added, demonstrating the banking community's confidence in Wyndham Worldwide. Last month, we announced the renewal of our securitized timeshare receivables conduit facility. Our prior conduits were 1-year terms, and this is a 2-year  facility. This further strengthens our liquidity and balance sheet position and highlights the broad support enjoyed by our timeshare ABS program. The new facility maintains capacity of $600 million.
Now I'd like to spend a few moments on guidance, and we're going to post this to our website and email it to you following the call. For the third quarter, we expect earnings per share of $0.86 to $0.89, assuming a share count of 168 million shares. As you saw from the press release, we are increasing our full year revenue guidance to $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion, and our adjusted EBITDA guidance to $960 million to $975 million. We are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance from $2.15 to $2.25 to $2.32 to $2.40. The new EPS guidance is based on an expected diluted share count of 171 million shares, down from our original guidance of 181 million shares and our most recent guidance of 173 million shares. This new guidance reflects the benefits of our share repurchase program through the second quarter. The guidance excludes any further share repurchases. We have approximately $345 million remaining on our current repurchase authorization. We are narrowing the range on our D&A guidance by $5 million on the high end. The new range is $180 million to $185 million. Interest expense guidance has been reduced to $130 million to $135 million, reflecting lower borrowing cost and higher capitalized interest. We expect our tax rate for the year to be a little lower than expected at about 38%, and we think most of that reduction will come in the fourth quarter. Please note that the implied fourth quarter earnings per share guidance is $0.38 to $0.43 per share. Remember when considering year-over-year fourth quarter comparison that we benefited from an unusually low tax rate of 27% in 2010, and that the historic seasonality of our WER business has changed due to the acquisitions we did in 2010. Now drilling down to the business unit level. At the hotel group, we are increasing our revenue guidance to $710 million to $730 million, and adjusted EBITDA guidance to $208 million to $215 million. Our RevPAR guidance increases 100 basis points to 6% to 8% year-over-year growth, and room guidance remains unchanged at 1% to 3% year-over-year growth. We expect hotel margins to moderate for the remainder of the year, reflecting planned increases in advertising spend compared to last year and timing differences, which I touched on earlier. Based on the new guidance, the implied full year margin improvement in the hotel group is about 150 to 175 basis points for the year. Exchange and rentals revenue increased to $1.46 billion to $1.5 billion, and we're bringing up adjusted EBITDA to $343 million to $353 million. Exchange drivers remain unchanged. Average net price per vacation rental increases to 25% to 27% year-over-year growth. And rental transaction guidance decreases slightly to 16% to 18% year-over-year growth. The decline in transaction guidance is attributable to soft demand at our U.K. cottage business while the uplift in prices due to improved yield and the impact of currency in the first half of the year. Note that guidance assumes currency rates as of June 30. We're also raising vacation ownership revenues to $2 billion to $2.1 billion. We're bringing the EBITDA range up to $495 million to $510 million, reflecting a narrowing of the VPG guidance to 2% to 4%, and an increase in tour flow of 5% to 8% from last year. We now expect corporate expenses to be $90 million to $95 million, primarily reflecting increased information security costs as well as higher employee and bonus cost. We expect CapEx to be $225 million to $240 million, reflecting higher information technology and security cost. But we also expect vacation ownership inventory spending to be within our original budget of $80 million to $90 million. And finally, we are confident in our free cash flow guidance of $600 million to $700 million or approximately $3.50 to $4.10 per share in 2011. And all of this points to another great year of financial and operational performance for the company. So with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve."

Number one, typically, we spend more CapEx in the second half of the year than the first half of the year. So that's an important contributor. And as you know, we raised our CapEx guidance a bit. The second part is the seasonality of the rentals business. As you know, the way our rentals business in Europe works is we get cash early, we hold on to the cash, and then we pay the homeowner in the second half of the year. So the benefit that we get in the first half of the year of receiving cash early is the offset is in the second half of the year. And then finally, as we pointed out, there's about $50 million in our free cash flow number that's associated with the settlement that we had with the U.K. government on an outstanding value-added tax issue and on a cash flow basis that was a $50 million benefit for the quarter. So those are the 3 factors why we think that $600 million to $700 million is still the right number and still a very strong number on a per share basis."

We kind of look at it as a -- on a return on investment basis, which one are we going to get the best return for. And right now, taking advantage of what's out in the marketplace is marginally better than what we have in our balance sheet to finish. So we'll get around to finishing what's on our balance sheet.

The industry is growing. It's just not growing at the pace it was several years ago. So a lot of the big players like ourselves and Marriott,and Hilton and Disney are all continuing to sell products and therefore, there is growth in the industry. It's just not as fast as the growth historically was, and it really unfortunately is a story of the haves and have-nots. The larger companies have access to capital. The smaller companies do not yet have access to as readily available capital. We see new players coming into market all the time. We've seen new players, when I say new players, I mean new financing sources coming in. Hopefully, that will continue to fuel some of the smaller players who have had a difficult time accessing capital. There are some terrific operators out there who just can't access the kind of capital they need in order to sell timeshare and finance the receivables that, that sales generate. So it's still -- we still see improvement, but it's going to take some time as we previously said for that to return. As to the distressed inventory question, it's really, Mike, it's a combination of both. It's other developers who are looking to sell off portions of their development because they are unable to access that financing that I was speaking of. But it's also projects that were developed as whole ownership condos that are being converted into timeshare. And again, as long as it's in the right place, the product quality is right, and we can give an experience to our consumers that is consistent with what the Wyndham Vacation Ownership wants to provide, then it makes sense for us. Okay, and so thank you, all, very much for joining us. I think, Laurel said that was the last question in the queue. And we look forward to talking to you next quarter."

Adjusted EPS for the",1914,"Thanks, Margo, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report we had another great quarter as we continue to execute our operating and capital deployment plans. Second quarter revenues increased 13%, and adjusted EBITDA was up 17%. Adjusted EPS for the quarter grew 25% and came in $0.08 above the top end of our guidance range. Each of our businesses delivered growth in adjusted EBITDA and performed ahead of plan with particular strength this quarter in lodging and vacation ownership. This strong performance and further visibility into the second half of the year is allowing us to raise our guidance for 2011. Tom will go through the details in a few minutes. In addition, free cash flow is robust in the first half of the year coming in at $3.42 per share. We continue to implement our capital deployment strategy in a disciplined fashion to drive value for our shareholders. In the second quarter, we invested $200 million in share repurchases and July to date, we invested another $50 million. So far this year, we have spent nearly $425 million on share repurchases. Our weighted average diluted share count is down by $17 million from a year ago. This contributed $0.06 of earnings in the second quarter compared with last year. Our results this quarter, combined with our confidence in the short-term and long-term growth and cash flow potential of our businesses, convince us that share repurchase is a very solid investment. Having said that, our first priority is the continued investment in our business to drive earnings growth and increase cash flow in the years to come. Our baseline sustainable free cash flow guidance of $600 million to $700 million a year assumes continuing investment in existing growth projects such as Apollo and our hotel business, RCI.com and our vacation exchange business and voyager and our vacation ownership business.
We also continue to selectively evaluate potential acquisitions, which we will only pursue if they are strategically compelling and earnings accretive. Now moving to our business unit review. The Wyndham Hotel Group had a great quarter, exceeding our expectations with almost a 10% increase in RevPAR. Most significantly, we are seeing rate improvement across all chain scale segments in the U.S. The lodging recovery is continuing, and I believe we are exceptionally well positioned to capture more than our fair share of that recovery. The development environment is improving, but financing still remains tight. Developers are looking to diversify the composition and geographic reach of their portfolios to include economy and mid-scale properties outside major city centers, which is where the majority of our brands are positioned. And of course, the conversion market is always important in a tight credit environment. Both of these dynamics work to our benefit. We have a well seasoned development team able to capture opportunities both new build and conversion. We are the world's largest hotel franchisor based on a number of hotels with over 7,200 properties, which translates to almost 613,000 rooms in our system. We offer individual franchisees as well as multi-property developers a strong network of market-leading brands. Our brands cover every segment, and we have a broad geographic reach. As we have discussed before, we are strengthening this exceptional base through a series of technology and business enhancements we call Apollo aimed at further improving the value proposition to our hotel owners. We recently began an effort with our franchisees to improve the content and navigation of our websites. We launched our first beta test with the Baymont brand in June. Our early results are encouraging. Response times improved threefold, and conversions were up 30%. In another hotel group highlight, J.D. Power and Associates recently released the results of its annual guest satisfaction survey. For the 10th consecutive year, Microtel leads the economy/budget segment. In fact, Wyndham Hotel Group's economy/budget brands took the first 3 positions in the segment.
Now moving to Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. From a rental industry perspective, we were pleased with the enthusiasm of investors over the recent HomeAway IPO. As a reminder, there are 2 operating models in the vacation rentals market. First, there's a rent-by-owner or listings model used by HomeAway and others. In this model, the vacation homeowner lists his or her property on a website for a listing fee. The listing company refers the potential renter back to the homeowner to inquire about availability, make the reservation and then process the payment. The second model is the professionally managed model. This is primarily how our business operates at Wyndham Vacation Rentals. Approximately 60% of our bookings are transacted online. We, rather than the homeowner, control the inventory. We have uploaded in our system on a live and realtime basis. We hand-select and inspect the inventory. Homeowners provide homes to us primarily on an exclusive basis. We process the payments and handle the customer service. And unlike the listings model, the consumer rarely deals with the homeowner. We are the world's largest company in this professionally managed segment of this growing market. We expect 2011 revenues from our vacation rental business to be over $700 million and transactions to exceed 1.3 million. We have approximately 93,000 properties in 32 countries, representing over 51,000 homeowners. We have tremendous scale, which we continue to expand. Integration of our most recent acquisitions, James Villa Holidays and ResortQuest, is progressing very well with both businesses ahead of our earnings expectations. We are making great progress on integrating our systems and leveraging best practices in the inventory distribution strategies across all of our businesses. We are also the market leader in the exchange industry. While tempered growth in the timeshare industry has produced some headwinds for our exchange business, we have been able to drive growth through innovation resulting in a stable high free cash flow business. Through the end of 2010, our migration to online transactions has improved our exchange margin by over 130 basis points. The enhanced online experience also increases the overall value proposition to our members through greater flexibility, functionality and better online content. Online transactions in the second quarter of 2011 were 38% of total transactions, compared with 27% in the second quarter of 2010.
Now let's discuss the segment that's been receiving a lot of investor attention, vacation ownership. We had great response through an initiative Tom started about a year ago in repackaging this story. We recently had the management team out on the road, and the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. We're happy for the investor acknowledgment because we knew this timeshare business is a great business, and we also know that we have the best timeshare business in the world. Wyndham Vacation Ownership is a highly evolved and highly adaptable business model, resulting from years of innovation and operational excellence. With approximately 815,000 owners, 21,000 units and 160 resorts, we have the scale to fully leverage market opportunities such as WAAM, our asset-light model. Our owners have been investing in our points-based products for more than 20 years. They know it, they love it, and they buy more. Our points products offer owners a diverse range of vacation experiences, including CLUB WYNDHAM Access and Presidential Reserve in both resorts and urban locations. We have a seasoned team of sales professionals, and we have an execution-based culture led by an exceptional management team. They have met or exceeded our expectations quarter after quarter even during the economic downturn. The fruit is really in the numbers. Over the past 5 years, which everyone would agree, was pretty tumultuous, volume per guest is up approximately 50%. Adjusted EBITDA is up approximately 45%, and the EBITDA margin has increased by over 750 basis points.
Let me transition now to a broader Wyndham Worldwide story. We recently completed our annual strategic reviews. Our 5 main strategic initiatives remain the same with the top 3 being to growth cash flow, rebalance our portfolio to emphasize our fee-for-service businesses and increase market share. Since we established these strategic initiatives in 2009, we have remained on course and have delivered against each of them. And we continue to find and pursue new opportunities for growth that are consistent with these initiatives. For example, the distressed real estate market has created a great opportunity for Wyndham Vacation Ownership to acquire high-quality inventory at very attractive prices and drive improved margins. In addition to our asset-light opportunities, we're shifting a portion of our existing development budget to the purchase of inventory in a distressed real estate market. This initiative supports our strategy of optimizing the capital deployed to the vacation ownership business, while extending the tail of the inventory already on our balance sheet. In addition, we are exploring a new concept, WAAM 2.0, which is a hybrid asset-light solution. Under the WAAM 2.0 concept, we will sell third-party inventory for a commission, but we'll finance the receivables. This will enable us to take advantage of the great spreads and high advance rates that we as a company are best able to realize. Within Wyndham Exchange and Rentals, we continue to innovate RCI to drive margin as well as member and developer satisfaction. The Vacation Rental team is laser focused on building out the U.S. rental platform. We'll do this by applying our best-in-class strategies to grow organically and with small tuck-in acquisitions. In Wyndham Hotel Group, in addition to important initiatives to drive our core U.S. business such as Apollo, we are pursuing an aggressive growth strategy around the world. For example, we are the largest U.S. hotel company in China with over 50,000 rooms. We expect to double that number in the next 5 years, and our long-term vision is to have a footprint in China that rivals our presence in the U.S. And in key U.S. states, we are planning to -- cities rather -- we are planning to invest approximately $200 million in mezzanine and other financing over the next several years to support the growth of the Wyndham Hotel and Resorts brand. This entire strategic framework is consistent with our target of generating baseline free cash flow of at least $600 million to $700 million a year. This is approximately $3.50 to $4.10 per share based on our diluted share count guidance for 2011. I'm very optimistic about the future at Wyndham Worldwide and look forward to updating you as we execute these strategies. 
Before I turn the call over to Tom, I want to note a significant milestone. Next week, we will celebrate the 5-year anniversary of our listing on the New York Stock Exchange. At that time, nobody anticipated that a few years later, we all would experience the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. What we did know was that we had great businesses, great people and great potential. We are proud of what we have accomplished during this period. Between dividends and share repurchase, we have returned nearly $1.7 billion to our shareholders over the past 5 years. The cumulative impact of our share repurchase activity over this period has been a 17% reduction in our share count. This, combined with our growth, has driven significant increases in key metrics on a per share basis
Just to put a few numbers around it, revenues are up 38%. Adjusted EBITDA is up 87%, impressive results. With all 3 of these businesses in great shape and the economy continuing to recover, we're even more optimistic about what we can do over the next 5 years. Tom?"

Our second quarter results reflect continued momentum and execution across our businesses and our ongoing commitment to return cash to shareholders. Adjusted EBITDA increased 17%, and adjusted earnings per share increased 25% compared with the second quarter of 2010. These results reflect improved RevPAR performance and lower bad debt expense at the Wyndham Hotel Group, growth in our Wyndham Vacation Exchange and Rentals business, higher sales and a reduction in the loan loss provision at Wyndham Vacation Ownership, and the meaningful impact of our ongoing share repurchase program. We came in $0.08 above the top end of our guidance range. Each business performed better than our expectations. In addition, there was some benefit about $0.03, primarily in lodging, from the timing of expenses in the quarter which we'll give back in the second half of the year. Share repurchase, which is excluded from our guidance, also contributed to the b. Free cash flow increased to $595 million or $3.42 per share for the first 6 months in 2011. 
[Technical Difficulty] 
great enabler of our long-term business goals. For 2011, we expect free cash flow of $3.50 to $4.10 per diluted share based on our diluted share count guidance of $171 million. We expect to continue to grow this important measure in the future, accelerate on our growth and enhancing shareholder value by supporting further investment in the businesses, share repurchases and dividends.
Let me begin our quarterly operating review with the Wyndham Hotel Group, which had a great quarter. Revenues were up 7%, and adjusted EBITDA was up 32%, driven by RevPAR improvements and lower bad debt expense. Adjusted margins improved 660 basis points. Systemwide RevPAR was up 9.7%. Now excluding the Tryp acquisition and in constant currency, RevPAR was up 5.8%. As in the first quarter, we saw occupancy gains across all regions and domestic chain scale segments. Encouragingly, we saw rate gains across all chain scale segments domestically and across all regions except for Asia-Pacific. We believe the recovery is in full progress in all lodging segments, including the economy and mid-scale segments. We ended the quarter with approximately 612,900 hotel rooms worldwide, and development efforts in the quarter were robust. We opened over 16,000 rooms, while terminating approximately 12,800 rooms in the quarter in line with our expectations. The development team executed over 150 deals this quarter, up 6% compared with a year ago. The total pipeline consisted nearly 111,000 rooms, up 3% from a year ago. 64% of the pipeline is international, up from 49% a year ago. The new construction pipeline is up 10%, all international. Now all of this is a good indication that we are successfully executing our international growth strategy. Wyndham Exchange and Rentals had another good quarter in spite of difficult market conditions with exchange and rentals results slightly better than expected. Segment revenue increased to $361 million, reflecting $53 million in incremental revenues from ResortQuest and James Villa Holidays, and a $19 million benefit from favorable currency translations. Now excluding the acquisition-related incremental revenues and the impact of foreign currency, revenues increased 3%, reflecting higher rental revenues in our Novasol and Landal GreenParks businesses, growth in exchange and the year-over-year change in the classification of some contra revenue items to expenses. Excluding currency impacts, exchange revenue in the second quarter increased about 2% compared with the same period in 2010. Consistent with our expectations, the average number of members remained flat. Excluding currency, exchange revenue per member increased 1%, reflecting an increase in other transaction revenue, resulting from some of our recent innovations at RCI.com. Now remember in the November 2010 RCI.com release, we enhanced our Weeks exchange program by providing more transparency to our members and change back on an exchange of lesser value. Change back deposit credits can be combined, along with timeshare deposits, to trade up into a higher value timeshare. In addition to the benefit of creating additional transactions, there is a fee for that service which is already providing some revenue gain. Vacation rentals revenue increased 57% to $180 million in the second quarter of 2011 compared with the same period of 2010. Now our most recent additions, U.S. based ResortQuest and U.K. based James Villa Holidays contributed $46 million of incremental rental revenue during the quarter, and foreign exchange movement had a $15 million favorable impact on vacation rental revenue. In constant currency and excluding the acquisitions, rental revenues increased 3%. The average net price per vacation rental increased 5%, primarily driven by a higher yield at our Novasol and Landal GreenParks businesses. Transaction volumes declined slightly due to difficult market conditions in the U.K. Wyndham Exchange and Rentals' adjusted EBITDA increased 5% in the quarter compared with the same period in 2010, primarily reflecting the benefits of the ResortQuest and James Villa Holidays acquisitions. Excluding the acquisitions, EBITDA was flat. Now we're pleased with that during these difficult economic times in Europe. Our European rentals business remained stable, while others in the market had revenue and profit declines.
Now moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. This business once again delivered strong results. Compared to the prior year, revenues increased 7%. Tours were up by 9%, and VPG increased 3%. Year-to-date, we have added over 12,000 new owners into our system, and we are ahead of our new owner goal of 25,000 for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter 2011 increased 25% to $130 million, compared with $104 million in the second quarter of 2010. The increase reflects great sales results, lower loan loss provisions and a growing contribution from our property management business. Property management fees grew 8% in the second quarter of 2011, compared with the comparable period in 2010. As you know, this business, which produced $50 million of EBITDA in 2010, provides a recurring fee-for-service revenue stream and steady, reliable growth. As anticipated, consumer finance revenues were down 3% due to a decrease in our contract receivables portfolio. However, interest expense decreased 21%, reflecting lower rates on our securitizations, which were partly offset by higher advance rates on our recent securitizations. Remember that higher advance rates improved cash flow but decreased EBITDA as we report the interest expense on securitized debt above the EBITDA line. Portfolio performance continues to improve somewhat. Write-offs during the second quarter were $75 million, down from $90 million a year ago. The provision for loan losses was $80 million, compared with $87 million in the second quarter of 2010. So we continue to see improvement in these important measures but at a moderate pace.
Now moving on to corporate. Excluding legacy related items, expenses increased $9 million, primarily reflecting increased information security and IT expenses. We are investing in our systems infrastructure and hiring additional information security staff to address the serious and increasing threat of data breaches, targeting the hospitality  industry. We will continue to keep you updated on this important progress.
Now let me review our activities in the capital markets where we had another busy and productive quarter. Last week, we announced the closing of a new $1 billion revolving credit facility to replace our $980 million facility, which was scheduled to mature in October of 2013. The maturity date of the new facility is July 15, 2016. There is no change to the overall corporate debt balance as a result of this transaction. Now the financing extends the credit facility to a 5-year term and has more favorable pricing terms, which further strengthens our liquidity profile and decreases our ongoing interest expense. All of our historical relationship banks participated in the financing, and several new participants were added, demonstrating the banking community's confidence in Wyndham Worldwide. Last month, we announced the renewal of our securitized timeshare receivables conduit facility. Our prior conduits were 1-year terms, and this is a 2-year  facility. This further strengthens our liquidity and balance sheet position and highlights the broad support enjoyed by our timeshare ABS program. The new facility maintains capacity of $600 million.
Now I'd like to spend a few moments on guidance, and we're going to post this to our website and email it to you following the call. For the third quarter, we expect earnings per share of $0.86 to $0.89, assuming a share count of 168 million shares. As you saw from the press release, we are increasing our full year revenue guidance to $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion, and our adjusted EBITDA guidance to $960 million to $975 million. We are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance from $2.15 to $2.25 to $2.32 to $2.40. The new EPS guidance is based on an expected diluted share count of 171 million shares, down from our original guidance of 181 million shares and our most recent guidance of 173 million shares. This new guidance reflects the benefits of our share repurchase program through the second quarter. The guidance excludes any further share repurchases. We have approximately $345 million remaining on our current repurchase authorization. We are narrowing the range on our D&A guidance by $5 million on the high end. The new range is $180 million to $185 million. Interest expense guidance has been reduced to $130 million to $135 million, reflecting lower borrowing cost and higher capitalized interest. We expect our tax rate for the year to be a little lower than expected at about 38%, and we think most of that reduction will come in the fourth quarter. Please note that the implied fourth quarter earnings per share guidance is $0.38 to $0.43 per share. Remember when considering year-over-year fourth quarter comparison that we benefited from an unusually low tax rate of 27% in 2010, and that the historic seasonality of our WER business has changed due to the acquisitions we did in 2010. Now drilling down to the business unit level. At the hotel group, we are increasing our revenue guidance to $710 million to $730 million, and adjusted EBITDA guidance to $208 million to $215 million. Our RevPAR guidance increases 100 basis points to 6% to 8% year-over-year growth, and room guidance remains unchanged at 1% to 3% year-over-year growth. We expect hotel margins to moderate for the remainder of the year, reflecting planned increases in advertising spend compared to last year and timing differences, which I touched on earlier. Based on the new guidance, the implied full year margin improvement in the hotel group is about 150 to 175 basis points for the year. Exchange and rentals revenue increased to $1.46 billion to $1.5 billion, and we're bringing up adjusted EBITDA to $343 million to $353 million. Exchange drivers remain unchanged. Average net price per vacation rental increases to 25% to 27% year-over-year growth. And rental transaction guidance decreases slightly to 16% to 18% year-over-year growth. The decline in transaction guidance is attributable to soft demand at our U.K. cottage business while the uplift in prices due to improved yield and the impact of currency in the first half of the year. Note that guidance assumes currency rates as of June 30. We're also raising vacation ownership revenues to $2 billion to $2.1 billion. We're bringing the EBITDA range up to $495 million to $510 million, reflecting a narrowing of the VPG guidance to 2% to 4%, and an increase in tour flow of 5% to 8% from last year. We now expect corporate expenses to be $90 million to $95 million, primarily reflecting increased information security costs as well as higher employee and bonus cost. We expect CapEx to be $225 million to $240 million, reflecting higher information technology and security cost. But we also expect vacation ownership inventory spending to be within our original budget of $80 million to $90 million. And finally, we are confident in our free cash flow guidance of $600 million to $700 million or approximately $3.50 to $4.10 per share in 2011. And all of this points to another great year of financial and operational performance for the company. So with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve."

The second part is the seasonality of the rentals business. As you know, the way our rentals business in Europe works is we get cash early, we hold on to the cash, and then we pay the homeowner in the second half of the year. So the benefit that we get in the first half of the year of receiving cash early is the offset is in the second half of the year. And then finally, as we pointed out, there's about $50 million in our free cash flow number that's associated with the settlement that we had with the U.K. government on an outstanding value-added tax issue and on a cash flow basis that was a $50 million benefit for the quarter. So those are the 3 factors why we think that $600 million to $700 million is still the right number and still a very strong number on a per share basis."

So a lot of the big players like ourselves and Marriott,and Hilton and Disney are all continuing to sell products and therefore, there is growth in the industry. It's just not as fast as the growth historically was, and it really unfortunately is a story of the haves and have-nots. The larger companies have access to capital. The smaller companies do not yet have access to as readily available capital. We see new players coming into market all the time. We've seen new players, when I say new players, I mean new financing sources coming in. Hopefully, that will continue to fuel some of the smaller players who have had a difficult time accessing capital. There are some terrific operators out there who just can't access the kind of capital they need in order to sell timeshare and finance the receivables that, that sales generate. So it's still -- we still see improvement, but it's going to take some time as we previously said for that to return. As to the distressed inventory question, it's really, Mike, it's a combination of both. It's other developers who are looking to sell off portions of their development because they are unable to access that financing that I was speaking of. But it's also projects that were developed as whole ownership condos that are being converted into timeshare.

Compared to the prior year, third quarter revenues increased 14% and adjusted EBITDA was up 19%. Adjusted EPS for the quarter grew close to 40%. Each of our business units exceeded our expectations. The Wyndham Hotel Group benefited from RevPAR increases driven by improvements in both occupancy and rates. Wyndham Exchange and Rentals delivered strong results despite the turmoil in Europe and benefited from acquisitions we made last year. In our Timeshare business, Wyndham Vacation Ownership, once again exceeded expectations delivering EBITDA growth of over 20%. In terms of capital allocation, we committed $300 million to repurchase 10 million shares of our stock during the third quarter.
In October to date, we have repurchased an additional 1.4 million shares for $40 million. This reflects our confidence in the growth and sustainable cash flow of our businesses. And as you saw from the press release, we have given you the first few of our 2012 outlook. We expect EBITDA growth of 6% to 8% and EPS growth of 10% to 14%. We expect 2012 free cash flow of 6% to $700 million dollars. We will allocate capital to drive shareholder value and that includes investing in our businesses, paying dividends and share repurchases.
We have a well-established proven track record of successful acquisition. We know how to value businesses, we know how to integrate acquisitions and we know how to build successful momentum.
Last year, we enhanced our fee-for-service revenue streams with 3 acquisitions in the rentals space and one in lodging totaling $232 million. Hoseasons, which we acquired in the first quarter 2010 is now fully integrated into our systems, contributed into adjusted EBITDA 20% ahead of our expectations last year.
The other acquisitions, James [ph] Resort Quest and also outperforming our expectations producing over 30% more EBITDA in 2011 than we expected when we completed the deals. This year, our capital deployment is more focused on share repurchases. Through October 25, we've invested over $750 million in share repurchases. We have reduced our weighted average diluted share count by 22 million shares or 12% from the third quarter of a year ago.
Now moving to the business unit review. At the Hotel Group, industry fundamentals continued to improve with the recovery tracking to our expectations. During the quarter, we saw continued improvement in both rate and occupancy and we believe the overall health of the franchisee base continues to strengthen as we see improvement in bad debt trends. Tom will address this point in more detail later.
We have a number of significant hotel openings recently most notably, the Wyndham Grand, in Orlando, our only owned hotel opened September 30 both on-time and on budget. The hotel, located in the Walt Disney World resort gates, is managed by our Wyndham Hotel Management Group and is next to our 1,149 Bonnet Creek Timeshare Resort. The hotel is being well received by both guests and vacation ownership members and the transient booking pace has been robust. Also in Hotel Group, we continue to make significant progress on the Apollo, our series of technology and business initiatives. These initiatives were designed to transform the reservation experience for consumers and to maximize our contribution to franchisee performance.
We achieved a significant milestone recently with the completion of the content solicitation initiative. This involves a complete overhaul of the information and images of 7,000 properties worldwide.
The backbone of Apollo is the relaunch of our various hotel brand websites, which began this year with the Baymont and Travelodge brands. The conversion results have been terrific for these first 2 brands. We are planning a series of rollouts with additional brands for the coming weeks with the majority of our hotel brands having new websites by the end of the year.
This is one example of how we are working to enhance our brand positioning and value proposition.
Now moving to Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. Our North American Rental business is taking off and our European Rental business continues to perform well despite the recent political turmoil and economic challenges in Europe. In North America, ResortQuest is performing significantly better than expectations. In the third quarter, we bolted on 2 small vacation rental acquisitions: One in Colorado and one in Florida adding 1,500 new rental units to our platform in those 2 high demand markets. We now have over 7,000 rental units in North America and nearly 99,000 units worldwide.
On our past 2 earning calls, we talked about the consumer benefit of our full service vacation rental model as compared to the listing model. Today, I want to share an example of our full service model is superior when challenges arise. ResortQuest has years of experience in emergency management planning that came into play when hurricane Irene hit in August. Irene's path was forecasted to move directly over our Delaware operations. We began evacuating guests on the Thursday before one of the highest occupancy weekends of the year. By the weekend, mandatory evacuations were ordered for all Delaware locations where ResortQuest properties reside. ResortQuest rerouted its call center operations to Northwest Florida. They guided visiting guests through evacuation and safety instructions and contacted guests who were scheduled to arrive over the weekend.
ResortQuest employees more than 1,000 miles away put in over time to ensure the highest level of support to its customers in the time of need. The extra effort went a long way to comfort guests and property owners and ResortQuest's ability to leverage its vast inventory allowed arriving guest in many cases to postpone travel to future dates without penalty. This level of service is fundamental to ResortQuest and the professionally managed value proposition. Now looking at the Exchange business. At RCI, we recently completed another significant release of the rci.com web enhancements. We began this transformational journey in 2008 with web penetration of 13%. Today, our Web penetration is 39%. On October 15, we brought even more simplicity, speed and efficiency to vacation a exchange experience with another major milestone technology upgrade.
This included a new property information management platform, as well as a new enhanced search function for our points members.
In addition, we launched an innovative recommendation imaging technology where members see realtime vacation suggestions that best fit their unique travel preferences. We are transforming RCI from a high-touch, high-cost call center-based business into an innovative industry-leading technology driven company.
These enhancements build on other innovations such as the training power transparency and change that benefits of our weeks enhancement upgrade we implemented last November and previously discussed. Combined, these are for RCI members what they need to transact with us on the web and through mobile devices. We expect these innovations to help drive membership, transactions and margins.
Now let's turn to Wyndham Vacation Ownership, which also has a long history of innovation. In the early 1990s, we were among the first to introduce a point system for timeshare holders and have continued to lead the way with many product development initiatives. We are once again breaking new grounds in sales and marketing. As you know, unlike other lodging products, timeshare is not a demand driven business model and since timeshare is sold rather than sought, finding good prospects has always been key to our success. In recent years, Wyndham Vacation Ownership has been especially focused on finding highly qualified prospects who meet our credit standards. To that end, we recently launched a fully proprietary and innovative creditworthiness prescreening program.
The program has increased the efficiency of our model by identifying the most qualified prospects for our sales people. The results already speak for themselves. Eliminating thousands of otherwise unprepped unprofitable sales tours and resulting in significant cost savings. These program is now live at close to 3 quarters of our off-site marketing locations and some locations are realizing BPG lists of applicable tour types in excess of 30%.
This is truly a new way of doing business for Wyndham Vacation Ownership and we believe it is unlike anything employed by our competitors. The team who conceived and developed these initiative won our inaugural chairman's award for innovation at Wyndham Worldwide. Earlier this year, we launched a formal recognition program for something that we believe will have we have long excel that, coming up with innovative ways to improve our business.
We received 81 award nominations across our business units and corporate teams reflecting the great energy and enthusiasm for innovation in the company. Innovation was also recognized in RCI last year when the team was honored for the industry-leading weeks enhancement rollout, which garnered widespread recognition for promoting transparency in the timeshare exchange process. Whether it is WAAM, points-based timeshare or the RCI.com initiative to name a few, we have a long track record of innovation.
Sustainability is another area of innovation and it is core value here at Wyndham Worldwide, and so we are proud to recently be ranked among the top 100 greenest companies in the U.S. by Newsweek magazine. We were #1 among hotels and the rest of our companies. This follows closely our recent recognition as an S&P carbon disclosure index leader. I couldn't be more pleased by the progress we're making. Of course, another top cornerstone of our company is our account on these service culture. Wyndham Hotel Group is energizing Count on Me to an innovative new program designed to ensure the leaders of the business walk a mile in the customers' shoes. 80 members of our Hotel Group senior leader team recently completed a 3-day work visits at our franchisees hotels. We have received fantastic feedback from franchisees and employees who are coming back with a deeper understanding of customers' needs. I am very proud that through outstanding service innovation, our company continues to shine an operational performance.
Before I turn the call over to Tom, I want to take a minute to reflect upon the broader macroeconomic environment. In 2012, we expect moderate economic growth in the U.S., continued economic difficulties in Europe and higher growth in the developing markets.
This is the underlying basis for our 2012 plan and budget. But regardless of the environment as we showed in 2008 and 2009, our businesses are built for performance in all economic conditions. Further, we are fiscally conservative. We have an investment grade profile. Our balance sheet is strong. We have a well-stacked capital debt with no significant near-term maturities. And while the ABS market has performed very well in recent months, it's a bonus to our business, not a necessity. Our securitized conduit facility, which isn't up for renewal until June 2013 has ample capacity to fund the business for over a year before we even consider our operating cash flow or our revolver.
Finally and maybe most currently, we expect to sustain baseline annual free cash flow of $600 million to $700 million. Tom and I have great confidence in that number and in the future. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom."
31063165,141310272,178201,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2011",2011-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Travel + Leisure Co.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results reflect continued momentum and execution across our businesses and our ongoing commitment to thoughtful capital allocation. We came in $0.05 above the top end of our guidance range with shar",1869,"Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results reflect continued momentum and execution across our businesses and our ongoing commitment to thoughtful capital allocation. We came in $0.05 above the top end of our guidance range with share repurchases contributing 3 pennies to the beat. Free cash flow increased to $699 million or $4.11 per share for the first 9 months in 2011 compared with $564 million to $3.03 per share during the same period in 2010, which excludes $145 million cash payment related to our contingent IRS tax liabilities.
The 36% increase in free cash flow on a per-share basis reflects the strong operational performance of our businesses, solid working capital management, the impact in our share count from our ongoing share repurchase program and a $67 million benefit from our refund of value-added taxes and related interest income.
During the first 9 months of 2011, we generated $779 million in available cash, which we defined as free cash flow plus net proceeds from securitized borrowings. Now we spent 86% of that money on share repurchases, 10% of that cash on dividends and 3% on M&A. While we expect higher CapEx and working capital requirements in the fourth quarter, it is clear that our free cash flow generation for the year will exceed our expectations. We expect our free cash flow in 2011 to be about $725 million or $658 million if you exclude the value added tax refund and related interest income.
Now let me begin our quarterly operating review with the Hotel Group, which had a solid quarter. Revenues were up 9% compared with the third quarter of 2010 driven by RevPAR improvement. Now a portion of that increase also reflects the reporting reclassification of $12 million related to certain reservation fees, which had no impact on EBITDA but reduced margin by approximately 180 basis points. EBITDA was flat reflecting the unfavorable timing of higher marketing cost and preopening costs for the Bonnet Creek hotel.
As we've mentioned in our previous 2 calls this year, timing difference in marketing spend can have significant impact on the Hotel Group's quarterly financial results. While timing was favorable in the first half of the year, it's going against us in the second half. Not as without the impact if you look at the nine-month results, we see a 7% increase in revenues and a 16% increase in adjusted EBITDA. This is being driven by continued improvement in lodging fundamentals including improving bad debt trends. Now returning to the quarter, systemwide RevPAR were 6% or 4.8% in constant currency. The RevPAR increase came from occupancy and ADR gains of 3% each. We saw strong great performance as well as occupancy gains across all regions except Asia-Pacific, which was down slightly due to a difficult comparison in Shanghai, the site of last year's World Expo.
We're encouraged that rate has returned and appears to be sticking. We ended the quarter with approximately 611,200 hotel rooms worldwide, up about 1% from a year ago. This modest increase included the loss of a 5 master licensor in the U.K. that filed for bankruptcy. The effect of this was the loss of 24 hotels or 2,676 rooms from the system. Excluding the loss of the [ph]  master, terminations were in line with our expectations and openings were up about 8%. Overall, we believe the financial health of our franchisees have been improving steadily throughout the year. Our year-to-date bad debt expense for the Hotel Group has improved by $6.6 million. We're seeing senior growth and development pipeline as well with good contributions from some strong international markets. The total pipeline consists of 114,600 rooms, up about 7% from a year ago. 62% of the pipeline is international, up from 47% a year ago. The new construction pipeline is up 14%, however, all international.
We are concentrating our new construction development efforts in China, India and Brazil, all high-growth markets. Now moving on to Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. Revenue was up 32% in the third quarter of 2011 compared with the same period of 2010. Recent acquisitions contributed over $90 million of incremental revenue in the quarter. A weaker U.S. dollar favorably impacted revenue by $16 million in the third quarter 2011. So excluding acquisitions and the net effect of foreign currency, revenue for the segment was flat.
Adjusted EBITDA increased 30% in the third quarter of 2011 compared with the same period in 2010 driven primarily by the impact of acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions and the net effect of foreign currency, adjusted EBITDA in quarter 3 2011 was flat compared to same period in 2010 as growth in our Rental businesses was offset by a decline in our Exchange business.
In constant currency, exchange revenue decreased by 3% in the third quarter. The average number of members was flat and exchange revenue per member decreased by 2.2%. This reflects a continued shift in the mix of clubs, which have a lower propensity to transact and the timing of sales promotions compared to the prior year. The Exchange business continue to drive operating efficiencies through prudent expense management and continued success in driving transactions online.
For the quarter, the mix of online transactions in our Exchange business increased from 28% during 2010 to 39% during last quarter. Vacation rental revenue increased 61% in the third quarter of 2011 compared with the same period 2010. Excluding the impact of acquisitions in currency, vacation rental revenue increased 2% in the quarter and average net price per rental was up 1.4%, primarily driven by higher yield at our business. Transaction volumes excluding acquisitions were flat compared to the third quarter of 2010. So in our minds, this quarter once again demonstrated the resiliency of our European Rentals business. The current economic challenges in Europe as we all know is ongoing. So despite those challenges, our Vacation Exchange and Rentals business continues to deliver solid results. This consistent performance is a reflection of the strong execution of our management teams and the strength of our global product offerings.
Moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. This business once again delivered exceptional results. Compared to the prior year, segment revenues increased 5%. Growth vacation ownership interest sales grew 10.4% reflecting a 5.3% increase in tours and a 5.6% increase in BPG. EBITDA in the quarter increased 21% to $149 million compared with $123 million in the third quarter of 2010. And margin improved 360 basis points. These results reflect great sales momentum in both traditional and WAAM sales, higher VPG and lower commission rates and cost of sales. Consumer finance revenues were down 2% due to a decrease in our contract receivables portfolio. However, interest expense on securitized debt decreased 22% reflecting lower rates, partly offset by higher advance rates.
Now remember that higher advance rates improve the company's available cash but decrease EBITDA as we report the interest expense on securitized debt above the EBITDA line.
Write-offs in the portfolio during the third quarter was $73 million, down from $77 million a year ago. So the good news is that we saw slight improvement in the performance of the portfolio. However, based on our experience during the 2008, 2009 downturn, we have concluded that it's prudent to maintain a slightly higher reserve balance. Therefore, in the third quarter, we booked a $96 million provision for loan loss compared with $85 million in the third quarter of 2010. This brings the reserve relative to the overall portfolio to 11.9%, up from 11.1% at the end of second quarter 2011. And 10.8% at the end of 2010. This means that we'll end the year slightly higher than the provision that we had originally expected, somewhere around 23% of gross realized sales.
Our third revenue stream, vacation ownership, property management also showed some good strength. While property management revenues were flat, property was up 6% reflecting higher efficiencies. Now turning to the ABS markets. In August, we announced a $300 million timeshare securitization with an advanced rate of 92% and a weighted-average coupon of 4.01%.
The transaction was oversubscribed enabling us to increase the size of the offering. The terms of these financing were among the best ever for an ABS deal by Wyndham Worldwide. We were pleased but not surprised to see continued investors support for our program given the strong performance of our portfolio. Finally, corporate expenses increased $3 million in the quarter, excluding legacy items, primarily reflects the increased information security and IT expense. We continue to invest in data security to address this serious and increasing threat of data breaches facing all businesses today.
Now I'd like to spend a few moments on guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $0.40 to $0.44 assuming a diluted share count of 158 million shares. As you saw from the press release, we are narrowing our full-year revenue guidance to $4.25 billion to $4.75 billion, our adjusted EBITDA guidance to $965 million to $975 million and our G&A guidance to approximately $100 million. We are adjusting our full year-adjusted EPS guidance to $2.41 to $2.45. The new EPS guidance is based on an expected diluted share count of 167 million shares, down from our most recent guidance of 171 million shares. This new guidance reflects the benefits of our share repurchase program through the third quarter. The guidance excludes any further share repurchases.
We currently have approximately as of yesterday $515 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization.
One final note on 2011, when you do the math, you'll see that we expect adjusted EBITDA to be slightly down in the fourth quarter when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Now this is explainable. It reflects the seasonality of our larger rentals business, continued unfavorable timing of higher marketing costs at the Hotel Group and increased information security cost at corporate. Our 2012 outlook indicates continued momentum in the businesses and significant growth enabled through free cash flow. We expect revenues of $4.425 billion to $4.6 billion. EBITDA of $1,030,000,000 to $1,055,000,000 and adjusted earnings per share of $2.72 to $2.82 assuming a diluted share count of 160 million shares. The share count assumption includes our repurchases through the end of the quarter, third quarter 2011.
So let me conclude my remarks by reminding you that our capital allocation mantra is that cash is the great enabler. And our philosophy is simple. First, our current leverage ratio reflects an investment grade profile plus, we will seek to maintain our current leverage ratio. This means as we grow EBITDA, we will prudently add debt. Second, we will not retain cash on the balance sheet beyond our basic liquidity needs, which we believe are minimal. We will continue to deploy our significant available cash flow in a timely fashion to enhance shareholder value. And then finally, we will increased dividends at least at the rate of growth earnings. That translates a cash commitment or dividend of approximately $100 million for 2011 based on our current payout. With all investments accounted for in the business, we will use the remainder of cash for share repurchases and growing our business. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve."

Effectively, it people work at that equivalent level of debt we'll be delivering because of our business models, Carlo, we don't think we really need to delever because they're all cash flow and we feel quite good at staying at that level. Right now the ratio is around 3.3x EBITDA that we're trying to manage to. So as we look at it simplistically, if we were to add $70 million or $80 million of EBITDA next year, then along those lines, assuming that the environment stays reasonably more normal, we would simply add over million dollars of that for our balance sheet. Again the reason we are comfortable saying that is because our business model are structured in a way that the generate significant amounts of cash flow and we have ample levers to pull if we needed to.

Not all product is easy to deliver on because may be there's already been sold in the regime that requires some time to convert it to timeshare. So it's not as if it's sitting out there on the shelf just waiting to be picked and brought into our inventory. But on the other hand, there's a tremendous amount of product out there. So we are constantly looking, we have a team that travel around the country looking a product, turning over rocks, finding the best possible product for us. So I would characterize it as there is a lot of product out there. One of the dynamics that you see in place is when the downturn hit in 2008, 2009, there were a lot funds that were pulled together to buy distressed inventory. They bought inventory, they've been sitting on it for 3 years now and it's not moving very much. They don't see the recovery happening and so, there are opportunities now to harvest some of that off. These people want to move their investments along and they want to reallocate capital. So I think that there will be and we will continue to see, the industry will see a lot of product flowing and available by it all takes work because it requires -- there are usually broken situation that needs to be fixed, but that's something we're pretty good at."

It's not something that we necessarily want to do long-term. However, the market at this time, is not attractive for selling. We're going to get a great return on this asset.

So first on the fourth quarter EBITDA decline, I don't completely understand the seasonality issue or the timing of higher marketing costs at the hotel group or information security. Those seem like relatively modest expenses yet it's putting pressure on the overall EBITDA. So that's number one. And then just broadly on margins. You mentioned earlier that your cost of goods sold is going lower from 25% to 20% and I don't understand why that's happening. I think that's for Timeshare. And is there really a bigger opportunity -- margin opportunity for Timeshare sales because you're really moving to more asset like financing more of this. And is that being offset by paying for higher fees or product cost to the property owner?"

So let's answer your first question first, which was fourth quarter decline in EBITDA. Okay. So as you know we made acquisitions the Vacation Rental business because the Vacation Rental business is a highly seasonal business where the EBITDA is generated in quarters 2 and 3 and easily sustained losses. In quarters 1 and 4. And stop losses just marginal profitability. So as we sort of double down the bit last year on these European Vacation Rental businesses, we saw an exacerbation that seasonal effect. These bigger businesses are larger commitment to the business where there are losses in the fourth quarter. So I think that's pretty easily understood at least I understand it. The second issue is information security costs this year, Steve, every quarterly call that we've made, we said that we were investing information security. Really we kick off initiative the third quarter of last year but we really have increased investment spending on information security, which is a corporate expense significantly this year. I mean the incremental spend on information is measured in the tens of millions of dollars incremental spending against last year. So for doing more of that than we had at the end of last year where the program was more of a program and now fully functioning program. That would seem to indicate that wer going to spend more in information security on the quarter-over-quarter basis in the fourth quarter than we did last year.
And then the final issue is the timing of marketing spend. And so the timing of marketing expand, which this is directed strictly at our Hotel business. We have benefited in the first after the year by delayed marketing spend where we received the royalty equivalent for marketing spend from franchisees but understand the amount of money that came in. And in the third and fourth quarter, we're effectively spending that money, which was already taken in previously but reflected a benefit for us in the first half of the year. Now it's working against us because we're spending more than we're actually taking in on a quarter-to-quarter basis but that's because money is accumulated in the first half of the year that the spending in the second half of the year."

The only thing I'd add to that is bear in mind that the fourth quarter overall is about 50% less than the third quarter so when you have this impacts like IT and it has a more meaningful impact on a much smaller base. I'm sure it's about margin I think and you're right, Steve. It's in the cost of goods sales, which was your specific question is in the Timeshare business. The reason that it's 20% versus 25% is some of its distressed inventory that we have picked up and we've been able to flowthrough our P&L and sell, it's just a matter of basically managing the environment well to be quite honest, the Real Estate group and the Timeshare group has done a great job of managing our costs and I'll sales down. In addition, our efficiency has gone up. So we're actually selling more efficiently, which means that if you have the same base of cost more efficient sale the also your cost of goods sold."

So as long as people keep returning to us, we'll always be able to sell them inventory that's returned to us because of our points base system at a higher price than the price of original inventory. So I think it was a structural bias to a lower cost of goods sold. I don't know how low it's going to take us but Steve, our plans are that one of the drivers of EBITDA performance in this business as we go forward will be continuing lower cost of goods sold over the next 5 years."

We will continue to be very critical of the product quality that we bring in. Not that others wouldn't be but we're are going to keep a very close eye on product quality. So I think that there would be other people in the market doing this. They are there now and I think they'll continue to be. But I don't think that's at all an impediment to our ability to bring product on board. I think the bigger impediment frankly and the bigger timing issue is what I mentioned before, you've got a let's say, a whole ownership condo development that only sold out 5% of their inventory. It's sitting there 95% unsold but the homeowner document say that they can't do timeshare. So that 5% that's bought previously has to kind of open their eyes and say, if we don't agree to allow a timeshare regime to come in, we're going to sit with this half-baked product and it's going to be very difficult for us to improve the product and keep it up because we got 95% of the product sitting owned by some bank that really doesn't want to invest in it. So that's more the process of distressed inventory situation. And I think that we've been in the midst for now a couple of years. We know what needs to be done. We know, which ones are likely to be able to and we'll continue to work the marketplace."

Free cash flow, we're guiding you it's going to $600 million to $700 million last year. This year we said it's $725 million. But $67 million of that $725 million is a onetime benefit that we got from recovering some bad payments that have been made previously along with associated interests. So if you take the $725 million and you subtract the $67 million, you get to what number it's like, $660 million or something like that I thing. So around $660 million. So I'd say that free cash flow right now is probably going to be ballpark on an aggregate. Our guidance is $600 million to $700 billion. It's in the ballpark of free cash flow. One of the benefits we got this year that enabled to spend a little extra on capital allocation was our advance rate differential on our ABS transaction was materially better this year than it was last year. And we showed previously that, that advanced rate differential benefited us to the tune of around $100 million plus of incremental cash. Now our advanced rates this year have been 92%, 98%. We're not encouraging anyone to model anything better than that. And so may be that advantage that we had in 2011 won't accrue to us in 2012. We're not sure. It's too early to tell. And then the final question is what will we do and continuing to maintain our leverage ratio. Right now, I think our guidance is incremental $70 million, $80 million of EBITDA. So if we were to lever on top of the $70 million to $80 million at EBITDA, that will generate a couple of $100 million potentially available cash. So why think that's pretty consistent with this year's. So I think and a year-to-year comparison may be the only difference will be and I'm talking in approximations here, the only difference will be that we are not counting on better advanced rates than 98% advance rates."

We are pleased to report strong performance again this quarter. Compared with the prior year, third quarter revenues increased 14%, and adjusted EBITDA was up 19%. Adjusted EPS for the quarter grew close to 40%.",1868,"Thanks, Margo, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report strong performance again this quarter. Compared with the prior year, third quarter revenues increased 14%, and adjusted EBITDA was up 19%. Adjusted EPS for the quarter grew close to 40%. 
Each of our business units exceeded our expectations. The Wyndham Hotel Group benefited from RevPAR increases driven by improvements in both occupancy and rate. Wyndham Exchange and Rentals delivered strong results despite the turmoil in Europe and benefited from the acquisitions we made last year. And our timeshare business, Wyndham Vacation Ownership, once again exceeded expectations, delivering EBITDA growth of over 20%. 
In terms of capital allocation, we committed $300 million to repurchase 10 million shares of our stock during the third quarter. In October to date, we have repurchased an additional 1.4 million shares for $40 million. This reflects our confidence in the growth and the sustainable cash flow of our businesses. 
And as you saw from the press release, we have given you the first view of our 2012 outlook. We expect EBITDA growth of 6% to 8% and EPS growth of 10% to 14%. We expect 2012 free cash flow of $600 million to $700 million. 
We will allocate capital to drive shareholder value, and that includes investing in our businesses, paying dividends and share repurchases. We have a well established proven track record of successful acquisitions. We know how to value businesses. We know how to integrate acquisitions, and we know how to build successful momentum. 
Last year, we enhanced our fee-for-service revenue streams with 3 acquisitions in the rental space and one in lodging, totaling $232 million. Hoseasons, which we acquired in the first quarter of 2010, is now fully integrated into our systems, contributing to adjusted EBITDA 20%, ahead of our expectations last year. The other acquisitions, James Villa, ResortQuest and TRYP also outperforming our expectations, producing over 30% more EBITDA in 2011 than we expected when we completed the deals. 
This year, our capital deployment has been more focused on share repurchases. Through October 25, we have invested over $715 million in share repurchases. We have reduced our weighted average diluted share count by $22 million -- or by 22 million shares or 12% from the third quarter a year ago.
Now moving to the business unit review. At the Hotel Group, industry fundamentals continued to improve, with the recovery tracking to our expectations. During the quarter, we saw continued improvement in both rate and occupancy, and we believe the overall health of the franchisee base continues to strengthen as we've seen improvement in bad debt trends. Tom will address this point in more detail later.
We had a number of significant hotel openings recently. Most notably, the Wyndham Grand at Bonnet Creek in Orlando, our wholly owned hotel, opened September 30 both on time and on budget. The hotel, located within the Walt Disney World resort gates, is managed by our Wyndham Hotel Management group and is next to our 1,149-unit Bonnet Creek timeshare resort. The hotel is being well received by both guests and vacation ownership members, and the transient booking pace has been robust. 
Also in the Hotel Group, we continue to make significant progress on Apollo, our series of technology and business initiatives. These initiatives were designed to transform the reservation experience for consumers and to maximize our contribution to franchisee performance. We achieved a significant milestone recently with the completion of the content solicitation initiative. This involved a complete overhaul of the information and images of 7,000 properties worldwide.
The backbone of Apollo is the relaunch of our various hotel brand websites, which began this year with the Baymont and Travelodge brands. The conversion results have been terrific for these first 2 brands. We are planning a series of rollouts for the additional brands in the coming weeks with the majority of our hotel brands having new websites by the end of the year. This is one example of how we are working to enhance our brand positioning and value proposition.
Now moving to Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. Our North American rentals business is taking off, and our European rental business continues to perform well despite the recent political turmoil and the economic challenges in Europe. In North America, ResortQuest is performing significantly better than our expectations. In the third quarter, we bolted on 2 small vacation rental acquisitions, one in Colorado and one in Florida, adding over 1,500 new rental units to our platform in those 2 high-demand markets. We now have over 7,000 rental units in North America and nearly 99,000 units globally.
On our past 2 earnings calls, we talked about the consumer benefits of our full service vacation rental model as compared to the listing model. Today, I want to share an example of how our full service model is superior when challenges arise. 
ResortQuest has years of experience in emergency management planning that came into play when hurricane Irene hit in August. Irene's path was forecasted to move directly over our Delaware operations. We began evacuating guests on the Thursday before one of the highest occupancy weekends of the year. By the weekend, mandatory evacuations were ordered for all Delaware locations where ResortQuest properties reside. ResortQuest rerouted its call center operations to Northwest Florida. They guided visiting guests through evacuation and safety instructions and contacted guests who were scheduled to arrive over the weekend.
ResortQuest employees more than 1,000 miles away put in overtime to ensure the highest level of support to its customers in a time of need. The extra effort went a long way to comfort guests and property owners, and ResortQuest's ability to leverage its vast inventory allowed arriving guests, in many cases, to postpone travel to future dates without penalty. This level of service is fundamental to ResortQuest and the professionally managed value proposition. 
Now looking at the exchange business. At RCI, we recently completed another significant release of the rci.com web enhancements. We began this transformational journey in 2008 with web penetration of 13%. Today, our web penetration is 39%. On October 15, we brought even more simplicity, speed and efficiency to the vacation exchange experience with another major milestone technology upgrade. This included a new property information management platform as well as a new enhanced search function for our Points members.
In addition, we launched an innovative recommendation engine technology where members see realtime vacation suggestions that best fit their unique travel preferences. We are transforming RCI from a high-touch, high-cost, call center-based business into a innovative, industry-leading, technology-driven company.
These enhancements build on other innovations such as the trading power transparency and change back benefits of our Weeks enhancement upgrade we implemented last November and previously discussed. Combined, these are, for RCI members, what they need to transact with us on the web and through mobile devices. We expect these innovations to help drive membership, transactions and margins.
Now let's turn to Wyndham Vacation Ownership, which also has a long history of innovation. In the early 1990s, we were among the first to introduce a point system for timeshare owners and have continued to lead the way with many product development initiatives. We are once again breaking new ground in sales and marketing. 
As you know, unlike other lodging products, timeshare is not a demand-driven business model. And since timeshare is sold rather than sought, finding good prospects has always been key to our success. In recent years, Wyndham Vacation Ownership has been especially focused on finding highly qualified prospects who meet our credit standards. 
To that end, we recently launched a fully proprietary and innovative credit worthiness prescreening program. The program has increased the efficiency of our model by identifying the most qualified prospects for our sales people. The results already speak for themselves, eliminating thousands of otherwise un-prepped profitable sales tours and resulting in significant cost savings. This program is now live at close to 3/4 of our offsite marketing locations, and some locations are realizing BPG lists of applicable tour types in excess of 30%. This is truly a new way of doing business for Wyndham Vacation Ownership, and we believe it is unlike anything employed by our competitors. 
The team who conceived and developed this initiative won our inaugural Chairman's award for innovation at Wyndham Worldwide. Earlier this year, we launched a formal recognition program for something that we believe will have long -- we believe we have long excelled at: coming up with innovative ways to improve our business. We received 81 award nominations across our business units and corporate teams, reflecting the great energy and enthusiasm for innovation in the company. 
Innovation was also recognized in RCI last year when the team was honored for the industry-leading Weeks enhancement rollout, which garnered widespread recognition for promoting transparency in the timeshare exchange process. Whether it is WAAM, points-based timeshare or the rci.com initiative to name a few, we have a long track record of innovation.
Sustainability is another area of innovation, and it is a core value here at Wyndham Worldwide. And so we're proud to be -- to recently be ranked among the top 100 greenest companies in the U.S. by Newsweek magazine. We were #1 among hotels and restaurant companies. This follows closely on our recent recognition as an S&P Carbon Disclosure Index leader. I couldn't be more pleased by the progress we're making. 
Of course, another top cornerstone of our company is our Count On Me! service culture. Wyndham Hotel Group is energizing Count on Me!! through an innovative new program designed to ensure the leaders of the business walk a mile in the customers' shoes. 80 members of our Hotel Group senior leadership team recently completed 3-day work visits at our franchisees' hotels. We have received fantastic feedback from franchisees and employees who are coming back with a deeper understanding of customers' needs. I am very proud that through outstanding service innovation, our company continues to shine in operational performance.
Before I turn the call over to Tom, I want to take a minute to reflect upon the broader economic -- macroeconomic environment. In 2012, we expect moderate economic growth in the U.S., continued economic difficulties in Europe and higher growth in the developing markets. This is the underlying basis for our 2012 plan and budget. But regardless of the environment, as we showed in 2008 and 2009, our businesses are built for performance in all economic conditions. 
Further, we are fiscally conservative. We have an investment grade profile. Our balance sheet is strong. We have a well stacked capital deck with no significant near-term maturities. And while the ABS market has performed very well in recent months, it's a bonus to our business, not a necessity. Our securitized conduit facility, which isn't up for renewal until June 2013, has ample capacity to fund the business for over a year before we even consider our operating cash flow or our revolver.
Finally and maybe most importantly, we expect to sustain baseline annual free cash flow of $600 million to $700 million. Tom and I have great confidence in that number and in the future. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom."
31063165,141310272,178397,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2011",2011-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Travel + Leisure Co.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results reflect continued momentum and execution across our businesses and our ongoing commitment to thoughtful capital allocation. We came in $0.05 above the top end of our guidance range, with sha",1888,"Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results reflect continued momentum and execution across our businesses and our ongoing commitment to thoughtful capital allocation. We came in $0.05 above the top end of our guidance range, with share repurchases contributing $0.03 to the bp. 
Free cash flow increased to $699 million or $4.11 per share for the first 9 months in 2011 compared with $564 million or $3.03 per share during the same period in 2010, which excludes a $145 million cash payment related to our contingent IRS tax liabilities. The 36% increase in free cash flow on a per-share basis reflects the strong operational performance of our businesses, solid working capital management, the impact on our share count from our ongoing share repurchase program and a $67 million benefit from a refund of value-added taxes and related interest income.
During the first 9 months of 2011, we generated $779 million in available cash, which we defined as free cash flow plus net proceeds from securitized borrowings. Now we spent 86% of that money on share repurchases, 10% of that cash on dividends and 3% on M&A. While we expect higher CapEx and working capital requirements in the fourth quarter, it is clear that our free cash flow generation for the year will exceed our expectations. We expect our free cash flow in 2011 to be about $725 million or $658 million if you exclude the value-added tax refund and related interest income.
Now let me begin our quarterly operating review with the Hotel Group, which had a solid quarter. Revenues were up 9% compared with the third quarter of 2010, driven by RevPAR improvement. Now a portion of that increase also reflects the reporting reclassification of $12 million related to certain reservation fees which had no impact on EBITDA but reduced margin by approximately 180 basis points. EBITDA was flat, reflecting the unfavorable timing of higher marketing cost and preopening costs for the Bonnet Creek hotel.
As we've mentioned on our previous 2 calls this year, timing difference in marketing spend can have a significant impact on the Hotel Group's quarterly financial results. While timing was favorable in the first half of the year, it's going against us in the second half. Now to smoothe out the impact, if we look at nine-month results, we see a 7% increase in revenues and a 16% increase in adjusted EBITDA. This is being driven by continued improvement in lodging fundamentals, including improving bad debt trends. 
Now returning to the quarter, systemwide RevPAR was up 6.3% or 4.8% in constant currency. The RevPAR increase came from occupancy and ADR gains of 3% each. We saw a strong rate performance as well as occupancy gains across all regions except Asia Pacific, which was down slightly due to a difficult comparison in Shanghai, the site of last year's World Expo. We're encouraged that rate has returned and appears to be sticking. 
We ended the quarter with approximately 611,200 hotel rooms worldwide, up about 1% from a year ago. This modest increase included the loss of a Ramada master licensor in the U.K. that filed for bankruptcy. The effect of this was the loss of 24 hotels or 2,676 rooms from the system. Excluding the loss of the Ramada master, terminations were in line with our expectations, and openings were up about 8%. Overall, we believe the financial health of our franchisees has been improving steadily throughout the year. Our year-to-date bad debt expense for the Hotel Group has improved by $6.6 million. 
We're seeing continued growth in the development pipeline as well, with good contributions from some strong international markets. The total pipeline consists of 114,600 rooms, up about 7% from a year ago. 62% of the pipeline is international, up from 47% a year ago. The new construction pipeline is up 14%, however, all international. We are concentrating our new construction development efforts in China, India and Brazil, all high-growth markets. 
Now moving on to Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. Revenue was up 32% in the third quarter of 2011 compared with the same period of 2010. Recent acquisitions contributed over $90 million of incremental revenue in the quarter. A weaker U.S. dollar favorably impacted revenue by $16 million in the third quarter of 2011. So excluding acquisitions and the net effect of foreign currency, revenue for the segment was flat.
Adjusted EBITDA increased 30% in the third quarter of 2011 compared with the same period in 2010, driven primarily by the impact of acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions and the net effect of foreign currency, adjusted EBITDA in quarter 3 2011 was flat compared to the same period in 2010 as growth in our rental businesses was offset by a decline in our exchange business.
In constant currency, exchange revenue decreased by 3% in the third quarter. The average number of members was flat, and exchange revenue per member decreased by 2.2%. This reflects a continued shift in the mixed clubs, which have a lower propensity to transact and the timing of sales promotions compared to the prior year. The exchange business continued to drive operating efficiencies through prudent expense management and continued success in driving transactions online. For the quarter, the mix of online transactions in our exchange business increased from 28% during 2010 to 39% during the last quarter. 
Vacation rental revenue increased 61% in the third quarter of 2011 compared with the same period of 2010. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and currency, vacation rental revenue increased 2% in the quarter, and average net price per rental was up 1.4%, primarily driven by higher yield at our Landal parks business. Transaction volumes, excluding acquisitions, were flat compared with the third quarter of 2010. 
So in our minds, this quarter once again demonstrated the resiliency of our European rentals business. The current economic challenges in Europe, as we all know, are ongoing. So despite those challenges, our vacation Exchange and Rentals business continues to deliver solid results. This consistent performance is a reflection of the strong execution of our management teams and the strength of our global product offerings.
Moving on to the Wyndham Vacation Ownership. This business once again delivered exceptional results. Compared to the prior year, segment revenues increased 5%. Growth vacation ownership interest sales were up 10.4%, reflecting a 5.3% increase in tours and a 5.6% increase in VPG. 
EBITDA in the quarter increased 21% to $149 million compared with $123 million in the third quarter of 2010, and margin improved 360 basis points. These results reflect great sales momentum in both traditional and WAAM sales, higher VPG and lower commission rates and cost of sales. Consumer finance revenues were down 2% due to a decrease in our contract receivables portfolio. However, interest expense on securitized debt decreased 22%, reflecting lower rates, partly offset by higher advance rates. Now remember that higher advance rates improve the company's available cash but decrease EBITDA as we report the interest expense on securitized debt above the EBITDA line.
Write-offs in the portfolio during the third quarter were $73 million, down from $77 million a year ago. So the good news is that we saw a slight improvement in the performance of the portfolio. However, based on our experience during the 2008, 2009 downturn, we have concluded that it's prudent to maintain a slightly higher reserve balance. Therefore, in the third quarter, we booked a $96 million provision for loan loss compared with $85 million in the third quarter of 2010. This brings the reserve, relative to the overall portfolio, to 11.9%, up from 11.1% at the end of second quarter 2011 and 10.8% at the end of 2010. This means that we'll end the year slightly higher on the provision than we had originally expected, somewhere around 23% of gross realized sales.
Our third revenue stream at Vacation Ownership, property management, also showed good strength. While property management revenues were flat, profit was up 6%, reflecting higher efficiencies. 
Now turning to the ABS markets. In August, we announced a $300 million timeshare securitization with an advanced rate of 92% and a weighted average coupon of 4.01%. The transaction was oversubscribed, enabling us to increase the size of the offering. The terms of this financing were among the best ever for an ABS deal by Wyndham Worldwide. We were pleased, but not surprised, to see continued investor support for our program given the strong performance of our portfolio. 
Finally, corporate expenses increased $3 million in the quarter, excluding legacy items, which primarily reflects the increased information security and IT expense. We continue to invest in data security to address this serious and increasing threat of data breaches facing all businesses today.
Now I'd like to spend a few moments on guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $0.40 to $0.44, assuming a diluted share count of 158 million shares. As you saw from the press release, we are narrowing our full year revenue guidance to $4.225 billion to $4.275 billion, our adjusted EBITDA guidance to $965 million to $975 million and our G&A guidance to approximately $180 million. We are increasing our full year adjusted EPS guidance to $2.41 to $2.45. 
The new EPS guidance is based on an expected diluted share count of 167 million shares, down from our most recent guidance of 171 million shares. This new guidance reflects the benefit of our share repurchase program through the third quarter. The guidance excludes any further share repurchases. We currently have approximately, as of yesterday, $515 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization.
One final note on 2011. When you do the math, you'll see that we expect adjusted EBITDA to be slightly down in the fourth quarter when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Now this is explainable. It reflects the seasonality of our larger rentals business, continued unfavorable timing of higher marketing cost at the Hotel Group and increased information security cost here at corporate. 
Our 2012 outlook indicates continued momentum in the businesses and significant growth enabled through free cash flow. We expect revenues of $4.425 billion to $4.6 billion, EBITDA of $1,030,000,000 to $1,055,000,000 and adjusted earnings per share of $2.72 to $2.82, assuming a diluted share count of 160 million shares. The share count assumption includes our repurchases through the end of the quarter, third quarter 2011.
So let me conclude my remarks by reminding you that our capital allocation mantra is that cash is the great enabler. And our philosophy is simple. First, our current leverage ratio reflects an investment grade profile, plus we will seek to maintain our current leverage ratio. This means as we grow EBITDA, we will prudently add debt. Second, we will not retain cash on the balance sheet beyond our basic liquidity needs, which we believe are minimal. We will continue to deploy our significant available cash flow in a timely fashion to enhance shareholder value. 
And then finally, we will increase dividends at least at the rate of growth of earnings. That translates to a cash commitment for dividends of approximately $100 million in 2011 based on our current payout. With all investment accounted for in the business, we will use the remainder of cash for share repurchases and growing our business. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve."

We're one notch off of investment grade with Moody's with a positive outlook, so we're encouraged by that qualification. And we think, in this environment, it's really important to remain investment grade. We want to remain investment grade. And so we don't really believe that we need to de-lever when we grow EBITDA. Effectively, it we weren't to add that equivalent level of debt, then we deceptively will be de-levering. We're -- because of our business models, Carlos -- Carlo, we don't think we really need to de-lever, because they're all structure, degenerate cash flow, and so we feel quite good at staying at that level. And right now, the ratio is around  3 to 3.3x EBITDA that we're trying to manage to. So as we look at it simplistically, if we were to add $70 million or $80 million of EBITDA next year, then along those lines, assuming that the environment stays reasonably normal, we would seek to add another couple of hundred million dollars of debt to our balance sheet or thereabouts. Again, the reason we're comfortable saying that is because our business models are structured in a way that generates significant amounts of cash flow, and we have ample levers to pull if we needed to to sustain or even enhance that cash flow if we wanted to without impacting the momentum of the business."

It's going to be at 20% or below level probably if we can acquire it. The way I would characterize the market is there's a tremendous amount of product out there. Not all product is easy to deliver on, because maybe there's some that's already been sold in a regime that requires some time to convert it to timeshare. So it's not as if it's sitting out there on a shelf to just be picked and brought into our inventory. But on the other hand, there's a tremendous amount of product out there. So we are constantly looking. We have a team that travels around the country looking at product, turning over rocks, finding the best possible product for us. So I would characterize it as there is a lot of product out there. One of the dynamics that you see in place is when the downturn hit in 2008, 2009, there were a lot of funds that were pulled together to buy distressed inventory. They bought the inventory. They've been sitting on it for 3 years now, and it's not moving very much. They don't see the recovery happening. And so there are opportunities now to harvest some of that off, because people want to move their investments along, and they want to reallocate capital. So I think that there will be and we will continue to see, the industry will see a lot of product kind of flowing and available.

And right now, the environment is still what it was 2 years ago, which is the medium and small developers having a hard time getting access to capital. Therefore, it's difficult for them to finance the receivables they generate when they sell timeshare, and therefore, their sales are off pretty dramatically. The big guys are still selling and still doing very well. Those of us who access the ABS markets, obviously, that's been terrific. And there are a number of the large players in our industry who don't even use the ABS market. They just work off their own balance sheet. So for the big guys, it's still good. For the little guys, it's still challenged. We need those little guys to come back to really drive membership base growth. We'll win a few and lose a few affiliates over the years. We always have, and we always probably will, but the real difference maker will be when development comes back online and we see those smaller developers selling more product. I think that the online capabilities we have now and the flexibility that we're giving our members might attract some that have lapsed to come back on when they see that they can really learn how to use the product better, and they can have more flexibility, and they can have more control over their own destiny.

So as you know, we made acquisitions in the vacation rental business. The vacation rental business is a highly seasonal business where the EBITDA is generated in quarters 2 and 3, and you basically sustain losses in the quarters 1 and 4. It's not losses, just marginal profitability. So as we sort of double down a bit, last year, on these European vacation rental businesses, we saw an exacerbation of that seasonal effect, just bigger businesses or a larger commitment to a business where there are losses in the fourth quarter. So that -- I think that's pretty easily understood. At least, I understand it. The second issue is information security costs. I think on every call that we've made this year, Steve, every quarterly call that we've made, we said that we were investing in information security. Really, we kicked off the initiative at the third quarter of last year, but we really have increased investment spending on information security, which is a corporate expense, significantly this year. I mean, it's -- the incremental spend on information is measured in the tens of millions of dollars, incremental spending against last year. So if we're doing more of that than we had at the end of last year, where the program was more of nascent program and now, a fully functioning program, that would seem to indicate that we're going to spend more in information security on a quarter-over-quarter basis in the fourth quarter than we did last year. And then the final issue is the timing of marketing spend. And so the timing of marketing spend which -- this is directed strictly at our hotel business. We have benefited in the first half of year by delayed marketing spend, where we received the royalty equivalent for marketing spend from franchisees but underspent the amount of money that came in. And in the third and fourth quarter, we're effectively spending that money, which was already taken in previously but reflected a benefit for us in the first half of the year. Now it's working against us, because we're spending more than we're actually taking in on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but that's because money is accumulated in the first half of the year that we're spending in the second half of the year."

Well, to be quite honest, the real estate group and the timeshare group have done a great job of managing our costs and our sales down. In addition, our efficiency has gone up, so we're actually selling more efficiently, which means that if you have the same base of cost with a more efficient sale, you also will dry down your cost of goods sold."

The other thing that I think is really important for everyone to realize, and we talk this on our visits with investors and analysts, is that there is a structural bias to lower cost of goods sold in this business. And that's because when we take back inventory for defaults, we resell them at considerably higher prices than they were first sold. So as long as people keep returning to us, we'll always be able to sell them inventory that's returned to us because of our points base system at a higher price than the price of the original inventory. And so I think there is a structural bias to a lower cost of goods sold. I don't know how low it's going to take us, but Steve, our plans are that one of the drivers of EBITDA performance in this business as we go forward will be continuing lowered cost of goods sold over the next 5 years."

The rental business is growing more rapidly than the exchange business. So as long as the rental business with the lower margin is growing faster than the exchange business with a higher margin, there'll be some pressure on margin within that overall unit. And as I've said, I think a year ago, our goal for that business was to try to keep the overall segment, Exchange and Rentals, at a constant margin by being more efficient on the exchange side as we grew the rental side. And depending on how quickly that rental fees grows, we may or may not be successful in achieving that goal, but that has been our goal for that business. Hopefully, this year kind of sets a level that will be add going forward, because we didn't have any acquisitions that we've done this year, but I can't predict what we're going to do in the future."

I think any good idea has followers, so I'm sure that others are following. And in fact, I know others are following the -- our WAAM concept in looking at products to be brought in on a -- on our -- what we call our WAAM basis. I don't think it's significant though, because there's so much out there. We're, frankly, more efficient than anybody else. So I think we're probably -- as we've been in the past, probably the most likely buyer of product that we want to get our hands on. We will continue to be very critical of the product quality that we bring in. Not that others wouldn't be, but we're going to keep a very close eye on product quality. So I think that there will be other people in the market doing this. They are there now, and I think they'll continue to be. But I don't think that's at all an impediment to our ability to bring product on board. I think the bigger impediment, frankly, and the bigger timing issue is what I mentioned before. You've got a, let's say, a whole ownership condo development that only sold out 5% of their inventory. It's sitting there, 95% unsold, but the homeowner document say that they can't do timeshare. So that 5% that's bought previously has to kind of open their eyes and say, ""If we don't agree to allow a timeshare regime to come in, we're going to sit with this half-baked product. And it's going to be very difficult for us to improve the product and keep it up, because you got 95% of the product sitting, owned by some bank that really doesn't want to invest in it."" So that's more the process of this distressed inventory situation, and I think that we're -- we've been in the midst of it for now, a couple of years. We know what needs to be done. We know which ones are likely to be able to move, and we will continue to work the marketplace."

Free cash flow, we're guiding is going to be $600 million to $700 million last year. This year, we set it $725 million. But $67 million of that $725 million is a onetime benefit that we got from recovering some bad payments that had been made previously along with associated interest. So if you take the $725 million and you subtract out $67 million, you get to -- what's that number? It's like $660 million? Okay, something like that. Thanks. So around $660 million. So I'd say that free cash flow right now is probably going to be, ballpark, on an aggregate, our guidance is $600 million to $700 million, it's in the ballpark, on free cash flow. One of the benefits we got this year that enabled to spend a little extra on capital allocation was our advance rate differential on our ABS transactions was materially better this year than it was last year. And we shared previously that that advance rate differential benefited us to the tune of around $100 million plus of incremental cash. Now our advance rates this year have been 92%, 98%. We're not encouraging anyone to model anything better than that. And so maybe that advantage that we had in 2011 won't accrue to us in 2012. We're not sure. It's too early to tell. And then the final question is what will we do in continuing to maintain our leverage ratio. Right now, I think our guidance is for an incremental $70 million to $80 million of EBITDA. So if we were to lever on top of the $70 million to $80 million of EBITDA, that would generate another couple of hundred million dollars, potentially, of available cash. So I think that's pretty consistent with this year. So I think at a year-to-year comparison, maybe the only difference will be -- and I'm talking in approximations here. The only difference will be that we're not counting on better advance rates than 98% advance rates."

We are pleased to report strong performance again this quarter. Compared with the prior year, third quarter revenues increased 14%, and adjusted EBITDA was up 19%. Adjusted EPS for the quarter grew close to 40%.",1868,"Thanks, Margo, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report strong performance again this quarter. Compared with the prior year, third quarter revenues increased 14%, and adjusted EBITDA was up 19%. Adjusted EPS for the quarter grew close to 40%. 
Each of our business units exceeded our expectations. The Wyndham Hotel Group benefited from RevPAR increases driven by improvements in both occupancy and rate. Wyndham Exchange and Rentals delivered strong results despite the turmoil in Europe and benefited from the acquisitions we made last year. And our timeshare business, Wyndham Vacation Ownership, once again exceeded expectations, delivering EBITDA growth of over 20%. 
In terms of capital allocation, we committed $300 million to repurchase 10 million shares of our stock during the third quarter. In October to date, we have repurchased an additional 1.4 million shares for $40 million. This reflects our confidence in the growth and the sustainable cash flow of our businesses. 
And as you saw from the press release, we have given you the first view of our 2012 outlook. We expect EBITDA growth of 6% to 8% and EPS growth of 10% to 14%. We expect 2012 free cash flow of $600 million to $700 million. 
We will allocate capital to drive shareholder value, and that includes investing in our businesses, paying dividends and share repurchases. We have a well-established proven track record of successful acquisitions. We know how to value businesses. We know how to integrate acquisitions, and we know how to build successful momentum. 
Last year, we enhanced our fee-for-service revenue streams with 3 acquisitions in the rental space and one in lodging, totaling $232 million. Hoseasons, which we acquired in the first quarter of 2010, is now fully integrated into our systems, contributing to adjusted EBITDA 20%, ahead of our expectations last year. The other acquisitions, James Villa, ResortQuest and TRYP are also outperforming our expectations, producing over 30% more EBITDA in 2011 than we expected when we completed the deals. 
This year, our capital deployment has been more focused on share repurchases. Through October 25, we have invested over $715 million in share repurchases. We have reduced our weighted average diluted share count by $22 million -- or by 22 million shares or 12% from the third quarter a year ago.
Now moving to the business unit review. At the Hotel Group, industry fundamentals continued to improve, with the recovery tracking to our expectations. During the quarter, we saw continued improvement in both rate and occupancy, and we believe the overall health of the franchisee base continues to strengthen as we've seen improvement in bad debt trends. Tom will address this point in more detail later.
We had a number of significant hotel openings recently. Most notably, the Wyndham Grand at Bonnet Creek in Orlando, our wholly owned hotel, opened September 30 both on time and on budget. The hotel, located within the Walt Disney World resort gates, is managed by our Wyndham Hotel Management group and is next to our 1,149-unit Bonnet Creek timeshare resort. The hotel is being well received by both guests and vacation ownership members, and the transient booking pace has been robust. 
Also in the Hotel Group, we continue to make significant progress on Apollo, our series of technology and business initiatives. These initiatives were designed to transform the reservation experience for consumers and to maximize our contribution to franchisee performance. We achieved a significant milestone recently with the completion of the content solicitation initiative. This involved a complete overhaul of the information and images of 7,000 properties worldwide.
The backbone of Apollo is the relaunch of our various hotel brand websites, which began this year with the Baymont and Travelodge brands. The conversion results have been terrific for these first 2 brands. We are planning a series of rollouts for the additional brands in the coming weeks with the majority of our hotel brands having new websites by the end of the year. This is one example of how we are working to enhance our brand positioning and value proposition.
Now moving to Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. Our North American rentals business is taking off, and our European rental business continues to perform well despite the recent political turmoil and the economic challenges in Europe. In North America, ResortQuest is performing significantly better than our expectations. In the third quarter, we bolted on 2 small vacation rental acquisitions, one in Colorado and one in Florida, adding over 1,500 new rental units to our platform in those 2 high-demand markets. We now have over 7,000 rental units in North America and nearly 99,000 units globally.
On our past 2 earnings calls, we talked about the consumer benefits of our full service vacation rental model as compared to the listing model. Today, I want to share an example of how our full service model is superior when challenges arise. 
ResortQuest has years of experience in emergency management planning that came into play when hurricane Irene hit in August. Irene's path was forecasted to move directly over our Delaware operations. We began evacuating guests on the Thursday before one of the highest occupancy weekends of the year. By the weekend, mandatory evacuations were ordered for all Delaware locations where ResortQuest properties reside. ResortQuest rerouted its call center operations to Northwest Florida. They guided visiting guests through evacuation and safety instructions and contacted guests who were scheduled to arrive over the weekend.
ResortQuest employees more than 1,000 miles away put in overtime to ensure the highest level of support to its customers in a time of need. The extra effort went a long way to comfort guests and property owners, and ResortQuest's ability to leverage its vast inventory allowed arriving guests, in many cases, to postpone travel to future dates without penalty. This level of service is fundamental to ResortQuest and the professionally managed value proposition. 
Now looking at the exchange business. At RCI, we recently completed another significant release of the rci.com web enhancements. We began this transformational journey in 2008 with web penetration of 13%. Today, our web penetration is 39%. On October 15, we brought even more simplicity, speed and efficiency to the vacation exchange experience with another major milestone technology upgrade. This included a new property information management platform as well as a new enhanced search function for our Points members.
In addition, we launched an innovative recommendation engine technology where members see realtime vacation suggestions that best fit their unique travel preferences. We are transforming RCI from a high-touch, high-cost, call center-based business into a innovative, industry-leading, technology-driven company.
These enhancements build on other innovations such as the trading power transparency and change back benefits of our Weeks enhancement upgrade we implemented last November and previously discussed. Combined, these are, for RCI members, what they need to transact with us on the web and through mobile devices. We expect these innovations to help drive membership, transactions and margins.
Now let's turn to Wyndham Vacation Ownership, which also has a long history of innovation. In the early 1990s, we were among the first to introduce a point system for timeshare owners and have continued to lead the way with many product development initiatives. We are once again breaking new ground in sales and marketing. 
As you know, unlike other lodging products, timeshare is not a demand-driven business model. And since timeshare is sold rather than sought, finding good prospects has always been key to our success. In recent years, Wyndham Vacation Ownership has been especially focused on finding highly qualified prospects who meet our credit standards. 
To that end, we recently launched a fully proprietary and innovative credit worthiness prescreening program. The program has increased the efficiency of our model by identifying the most qualified prospects for our sales people. The results already speak for themselves, eliminating thousands of otherwise un-prepped profitable sales tours and resulting in significant cost savings. This program is now live at close to 3/4 of our offsite marketing locations, and some locations are realizing BPG lists of applicable tour types in excess of 30%. This is truly a new way of doing business for Wyndham Vacation Ownership, and we believe it is unlike anything employed by our competitors. 
The team who conceived and developed this initiative won our inaugural Chairman's award for innovation at Wyndham Worldwide. Earlier this year, we launched a formal recognition program for something that we believe will have long -- we believe we have long excelled at: coming up with innovative ways to improve our business. We received 81 award nominations across our business units and corporate teams, reflecting the great energy and enthusiasm for innovation in the company. 
Innovation was also recognized in RCI last year when the team was honored for the industry-leading Weeks enhancement rollout, which garnered widespread recognition for promoting transparency in the timeshare exchange process. Whether it is WAAM, points-based timeshare or the rci.com initiative to name a few, we have a long track record of innovation.
Sustainability is another area of innovation, and it is a core value here at Wyndham Worldwide. And so we're proud to be -- to recently be ranked among the top 100 greenest companies in the U.S. by Newsweek magazine. We were #1 among hotels and restaurant companies. This follows closely on our recent recognition as an S&P Carbon Disclosure Index leader. I couldn't be more pleased by the progress we're making. 
Of course, another top cornerstone of our company is our Count On Me! service culture. Wyndham Hotel Group is energizing Count on Me! through an innovative new program designed to ensure the leaders of the business walk a mile in the customers' shoes. 80 members of our Hotel Group senior leadership team recently completed 3-day work visits at our franchisees' hotels. We have received fantastic feedback from franchisees and employees who are coming back with a deeper understanding of customers' needs. I am very proud that through outstanding service innovation, our company continues to shine in operational performance.
Before I turn the call over to Tom, I want to take a minute to reflect upon the broader economic -- macroeconomic environment. In 2012, we expect moderate economic growth in the U.S., continued economic difficulties in Europe and higher growth in the developing markets. This is the underlying basis for our 2012 plan and budget. But regardless of the environment, as we showed in 2008 and 2009, our businesses are built for performance in all economic conditions. 
Further, we are fiscally conservative. We have an investment grade profile. Our balance sheet is strong. We have a well stacked capital deck with no significant near-term maturities. And while the ABS market has performed very well in recent months, it's a bonus to our business, not a necessity. Our securitized conduit facility, which isn't up for renewal until June 2013, has ample capacity to fund the business for over a year before we even consider our operating cash flow or our revolver.
Finally and maybe most importantly, we expect to sustain baseline annual free cash flow of $600 million to $700 million. Tom and I have great confidence in that number and in the future. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom."

Our third quarter results reflect continued momentum and execution across our businesses and our ongoing commitment to thoughtful capital allocation.

Our third quarter results reflect continued momentum and execution across our businesses and our ongoing commitment to thoughtful capital allocation. We came in $0.05 above the top end of our guidance range, with share repurchases contributing $0.03 to the bp. 
Free cash flow increased to $699 million or $4.11 per share for the first 9 months in 2011 compared with $564 million or $3.03 per share during the same period in 2010, which excludes a $145 million cash payment related to our contingent IRS tax liabilities. The 36% increase in free cash flow on a per-share basis reflects the strong operational performance of our businesses, solid working capital management, the impact on our share count from our ongoing share repurchase program and a $67 million benefit from a refund of value-added taxes and related interest income.
During the first 9 months of 2011, we generated $779 million in available cash, which we defined as free cash flow plus net proceeds from securitized borrowings. Now we spent 86% of that money on share repurchases, 10% of that cash on dividends and 3% on M&A. While we expect higher CapEx and working capital requirements in the fourth quarter, it is clear that our free cash flow generation for the year will exceed our expectations. We expect our free cash flow in 2011 to be about $725 million or $658 million if you exclude the value-added tax refund and related interest income.
Now let me begin our quarterly operating review with the Hotel Group, which had a solid quarter. Revenues were up 9% compared with the third quarter of 2010, driven by RevPAR improvement. Now a portion of that increase also reflects the reporting reclassification of $12 million related to certain reservation fees which had no impact on EBITDA but reduced margin by approximately 180 basis points. EBITDA was flat, reflecting the unfavorable timing of higher marketing cost and preopening costs for the Bonnet Creek hotel.
As we've mentioned on our previous 2 calls this year, timing difference in marketing spend can have a significant impact on the Hotel Group's quarterly financial results. While timing was favorable in the first half of the year, it's going against us in the second half. Now to smooth out the impact, if we look at nine-month results, we see a 7% increase in revenues and a 16% increase in adjusted EBITDA. This is being driven by continued improvement in lodging fundamentals, including improving bad debt trends. 
Now returning to the quarter, systemwide RevPAR was up 6.3% or 4.8% in constant currency. The RevPAR increase came from occupancy and ADR gains of 3% each. We saw a strong rate performance as well as occupancy gains across all regions except Asia Pacific, which was down slightly due to a difficult comparison in Shanghai, the site of last year's World Expo. We're encouraged that rate has returned and appears to be sticking. 
We ended the quarter with approximately 611,200 hotel rooms worldwide, up about 1% from a year ago. This modest increase included the loss of a Ramada master licensor in the U.K. that filed for bankruptcy. The effect of this was the loss of 24 hotels or 2,676 rooms from the system. Excluding the loss of the Ramada master, terminations were in line with our expectations, and openings were up about 8%. Overall, we believe the financial health of our franchisees has been improving steadily throughout the year. Our year-to-date bad debt expense for the Hotel Group has improved by $6.6 million. 
We're seeing continued growth in the development pipeline as well, with good contributions from some strong international markets. The total pipeline consists of 114,600 rooms, up about 7% from a year ago. 62% of the pipeline is international, up from 47% a year ago. The new construction pipeline is up 14%, however, all international. We are concentrating our new construction development efforts in China, India and Brazil, all high-growth markets. 
Now moving on to Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. Revenue was up 32% in the third quarter of 2011 compared with the same period of 2010. Recent acquisitions contributed over $90 million of incremental revenue in the quarter. A weaker U.S. dollar favorably impacted revenue by $16 million in the third quarter of 2011. So excluding acquisitions and the net effect of foreign currency, revenue for the segment was flat.
Adjusted EBITDA increased 30% in the third quarter of 2011 compared with the same period in 2010, driven primarily by the impact of acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions and the net effect of foreign currency, adjusted EBITDA in quarter 3 2011 was flat compared to the same period in 2010 as growth in our rental businesses was offset by a decline in our exchange business.
In constant currency, exchange revenue decreased by 3% in the third quarter. The average number of members was flat, and exchange revenue per member decreased by 2.2%. This reflects a continued shift in the mixed clubs, which have a lower propensity to transact and the timing of sales promotions compared to the prior year. The exchange business continued to drive operating efficiencies through prudent expense management and continued success in driving transactions online. For the quarter, the mix of online transactions in our exchange business increased from 28% during 2010 to 39% during the last quarter. 
Vacation rental revenue increased 61% in the third quarter of 2011 compared with the same period of 2010. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and currency, vacation rental revenue increased 2% in the quarter, and average net price per rental was up 1.4%, primarily driven by higher yield at our Landal parks business. Transaction volumes, excluding acquisitions, were flat compared with the third quarter of 2010. 
So in our minds, this quarter once again demonstrated the resiliency of our European rentals business. The current economic challenges in Europe, as we all know, are ongoing. So despite those challenges, our vacation Exchange and Rentals business continues to deliver solid results. This consistent performance is a reflection of the strong execution of our management teams and the strength of our global product offerings.
Moving on to the Wyndham Vacation Ownership. This business once again delivered exceptional results. Compared to the prior year, segment revenues increased 5%. Growth vacation ownership interest sales were up 10.4%, reflecting a 5.3% increase in tours and a 5.6% increase in VPG. 
EBITDA in the quarter increased 21% to $149 million compared with $123 million in the third quarter of 2010, and margin improved 360 basis points. These results reflect great sales momentum in both traditional and WAAM sales, higher VPG and lower commission rates and cost of sales. Consumer finance revenues were down 2% due to a decrease in our contract receivables portfolio. However, interest expense on securitized debt decreased 22%, reflecting lower rates, partly offset by higher advance rates. Now remember that higher advance rates improve the company's available cash but decrease EBITDA as we report the interest expense on securitized debt above the EBITDA line.
Write-offs in the portfolio during the third quarter were $73 million, down from $77 million a year ago. So the good news is that we saw a slight improvement in the performance of the portfolio. However, based on our experience during the 2008, 2009 downturn, we have concluded that it's prudent to maintain a slightly higher reserve balance. Therefore, in the third quarter, we booked a $96 million provision for loan loss compared with $85 million in the third quarter of 2010. This brings the reserve, relative to the overall portfolio, to 11.9%, up from 11.1% at the end of second quarter 2011 and 10.8% at the end of 2010. This means that we'll end the year slightly higher on the provision than we had originally expected, somewhere around 23% of gross realized sales.
Our third revenue stream at Vacation Ownership, property management, also showed good strength. While property management revenues were flat, profit was up 6%, reflecting higher efficiencies. 
Now turning to the ABS markets. In August, we announced a $300 million timeshare securitization with an advanced rate of 92% and a weighted average coupon of 4.01%. The transaction was oversubscribed, enabling us to increase the size of the offering. The terms of this financing were among the best ever for an ABS deal by Wyndham Worldwide. We were pleased, but not surprised, to see continued investor support for our program given the strong performance of our portfolio. 
Finally, corporate expenses increased $3 million in the quarter, excluding legacy items, which primarily reflects the increased information security and IT expense. We continue to invest in data security to address this serious and increasing threat of data breaches facing all businesses today.
Now I'd like to spend a few moments on guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $0.40 to $0.44, assuming a diluted share count of 158 million shares. As you saw from the press release, we are narrowing our full year revenue guidance to $4.225 billion to $4.275 billion, our adjusted EBITDA guidance to $965 million to $975 million and our G&A guidance to approximately $180 million. We are increasing our full year adjusted EPS guidance to $2.41 to $2.45. 
The new EPS guidance is based on an expected diluted share count of 167 million shares, down from our most recent guidance of 171 million shares. This new guidance reflects the benefit of our share repurchase program through the third quarter. The guidance excludes any further share repurchases. We currently have approximately, as of yesterday, $515 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization.
One final note on 2011. When you do the math, you'll see that we expect adjusted EBITDA to be slightly down in the fourth quarter when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Now this is explainable. It reflects the seasonality of our larger rentals business, continued unfavorable timing of higher marketing cost at the Hotel Group and increased information security cost here at corporate. 
Our 2012 outlook indicates continued momentum in the businesses and significant growth enabled through free cash flow. We expect revenues of $4.425 billion to $4.6 billion, EBITDA of $1,030,000,000 to $1,055,000,000 and adjusted earnings per share of $2.72 to $2.82, assuming a diluted share count of 160 million shares. The share count assumption includes our repurchases through the end of the quarter, third quarter 2011.
So let me conclude my remarks by reminding you that our capital allocation mantra is that cash is the great enabler. And our philosophy is simple. First, our current leverage ratio reflects an investment grade profile, plus we will seek to maintain our current leverage ratio. This means as we grow EBITDA, we will prudently add debt. Second, we will not retain cash on the balance sheet beyond our basic liquidity needs, which we believe are minimal. We will continue to deploy our significant available cash flow in a timely fashion to enhance shareholder value. 
And then finally, we will increase dividends at least at the rate of growth of earnings. That translates to a cash commitment for dividends of approximately $100 million in 2011 based on our current payout. With all investment accounted for in the business, we will use the remainder of cash for share repurchases and growing our business. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve."

We're one notch off of investment grade with Moody's with a positive outlook, so we're encouraged by that qualification. And we think, in this environment, it's really important to remain investment grade. We want to remain investment grade. And so we don't really believe that we need to de-lever when we grow EBITDA. Effectively, it we weren't to add that equivalent level of debt, then we deceptively will be de-levering. We're -- because of our business models, Carlos -- Carlo, we don't think we really need to de-lever, because they're all structure, degenerate cash flow, and so we feel quite good at staying at that level. And right now, the ratio is around  3 to 3.3x EBITDA that we're trying to manage to. So as we look at it simplistically, if we were to add $70 million or $80 million of EBITDA next year, then along those lines, assuming that the environment stays reasonably normal, we would seek to add another couple of hundred million dollars of debt to our balance sheet or thereabouts. Again, the reason we're comfortable saying that is because our business models are structured in a way that generates significant amounts of cash flow, and we have ample levers to pull if we needed to, to sustain or even enhance that cash flow if we wanted to without impacting the momentum of the business."

It's going to be at that 20% or below level probably if we can acquire it. The way I would characterize the market is there's a tremendous amount of product out there. Not all product is easy to deliver on, because maybe there's some that's already been sold in a regime that requires some time to convert it to timeshare. So it's not as if it's sitting out there on a shelf to just be picked and brought into our inventory. But on the other hand, there's a tremendous amount of product out there. So we are constantly looking. We have a team that travels around the country looking at product, turning over rocks, finding the best possible product for us. So I would characterize it as there is a lot of product out there. One of the dynamics that you see in place is when the downturn hit in 2008, 2009, there were a lot of funds that were pulled together to buy distressed inventory. They bought the inventory. They've been sitting on it for 3 years now, and it's not moving very much. They don't see the recovery happening. And so there are opportunities now to harvest some of that off, because people want to move their investments along, and they want to reallocate capital. So I think that there will be and we will continue to see, the industry will see a lot of product kind of flowing and available. But it all takes work, because it requires -- there are usually broken situations that need to be fixed, but that's something we happen to be pretty good at."

And right now, the environment is still what it was 2 years ago, which is the medium and small developers having a hard time getting access to capital. Therefore, it's difficult for them to finance the receivables they generate when they sell timeshare, and therefore, their sales are off pretty dramatically. The big guys are still selling and still doing very well. Those of us who access the ABS markets, obviously, that's been terrific. And there are a number of the large players in our industry who don't even use the ABS market. They just work off their own balance sheet. So for the big guys, it's still good. For the little guys, it's still challenged. We need those little guys to come back to really drive membership base growth. We'll win a few and lose a few affiliates over the years. We always have, and we always probably will, but the real difference maker will be when development comes back online and we see those smaller developers selling more product. I think that the online capabilities we have now and the flexibility that we're giving our members might attract some that have lapsed to come back on when they see that they can really learn how to use the product better, and they can have more flexibility, and they can have more control over their own destiny. I think that will help re-attract members who have lapsed, but to see new ones come on board will require the development at the mid to small developer level."

So first on the fourth quarter EBITDA decline, I don't completely understand the seasonality issue or the timing of higher marketing cost at the Hotel Group or information security.

And then just broadly on margins, you mentioned earlier that your cost of goods sold is going lower, from 25% to 20%, and I don't understand why that's happening. I think that's for timeshare.

So as you know, we made acquisitions in the vacation rental business. The vacation rental business is a highly seasonal business where the EBITDA is generated in quarters 2 and 3, and you basically sustain losses in the quarters 1 and 4. It's not losses, just marginal profitability. So as we sort of double down a bit, last year, on these European vacation rental businesses, we saw an exacerbation of that seasonal effect, just bigger businesses or a larger commitment to a business where there are losses in the fourth quarter. So that -- I think that's pretty easily understood. At least, I understand it. The second issue is information security costs. I think on every call that we've made this year, Steve, every quarterly call that we've made, we said that we were investing in information security. Really, we kicked off the initiative at the third quarter of last year, but we really have increased investment spending on information security, which is a corporate expense, significantly this year. I mean, it's -- the incremental spend on information is measured in the tens of millions of dollars, incremental spending against last year. So if we're doing more of that than we had at the end of last year, where the program was more of nascent program and now, a fully functioning program, that would seem to indicate that we're going to spend more in information security on a quarter-over-quarter basis in the fourth quarter than we did last year. And then the final issue is the timing of marketing spend. And so the timing of marketing spend which -- this is directed strictly at our hotel business. We have benefited in the first half of year by delayed marketing spend, where we received the royalty equivalent for marketing spend from franchisees but underspent the amount of money that came in. And in the third and fourth quarter, we're effectively spending that money, which was already taken in previously but reflected a benefit for us in the first half of the year. Now it's working against us, because we're spending more than we're actually taking in on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but that's because money is accumulated in the first half of the year that we're spending in the second half of the year."

So when you have these impacts, like IT, additional spend, it has a more meaningful impact on a much smaller base. I'm pretty sure it was about margins, I think. And you're right, Steve. It's in the -- the cost of goods sale, which was your specific question, is in the timeshare business. The reason that it's 20% versus 25% is some of that distressed inventory that we have picked up and we've been able to flow through our P&L and sell, it's just a matter of basically managing the environment. Well, to be quite honest, the real estate group and the timeshare group have done a great job of managing our costs and our sales down. In addition, our efficiency has gone up, so we're actually selling more efficiently, which means that if you have the same base of cost with a more efficient sale, you also will dry down your cost of goods sold."

The other thing that I think is really important for everyone to realize, and we talk this on our visits with investors and analysts, is that there is a structural bias to lower cost of goods sold in this business. And that's because when we take back inventory for defaults, we resell them at considerably higher prices than they were first sold. So as long as people keep returning to us, we'll always be able to sell them inventory that's returned to us because of our points base system at a higher price than the price of the original inventory. And so I think there is a structural bias to a lower cost of goods sold. I don't know how low it's going to take us, but Steve, our plans are that one of the drivers of EBITDA performance in this business as we go forward will be continuing lowered cost of goods sold over the next 5 years."

The rental business is growing more rapidly than the exchange business. So as long as the rental business with the lower margin is growing faster than the exchange business with a higher margin, there'll be some pressure on margin within that overall unit. And as I've said, I think a year ago, our goal for that business was to try to keep the overall segment, Exchange and Rentals, at a constant margin by being more efficient on the exchange side as we grew the rental side. And depending on how quickly that rental fees grows, we may or may not be successful in achieving that goal, but that has been our goal for that business. Hopefully, this year kind of sets a level that will be add going forward, because we didn't have any acquisitions that we've done this year, but I can't predict what we're going to do in the future."

And in fact, I know others are following the -- our WAAM concept in looking at products to be brought in on a -- on our -- what we call our WAAM basis. I don't think it's significant though, because there's so much out there. We're, frankly, more efficient than anybody else. So I think we're probably -- as we've been in the past, probably the most likely buyer of product that we want to get our hands on. We will continue to be very critical of the product quality that we bring in. Not that others wouldn't be, but we're going to keep a very close eye on product quality. So I think that there will be other people in the market doing this. They are there now, and I think they'll continue to be. But I don't think that's at all an impediment to our ability to bring product on board. I think the bigger impediment, frankly, and the bigger timing issue is what I mentioned before. You've got a, let's say, a whole ownership condo development that only sold out 5% of their inventory. It's sitting there, 95% unsold, but the homeowner documents say that they can't do timeshare. So that 5% that's bought previously has to kind of open their eyes and say, ""If we don't agree to allow a timeshare regime to come in, we're going to sit with this half-baked product. And it's going to be very difficult for us to improve the product and keep it up, because you got 95% of the product sitting, owned by some bank that really doesn't want to invest in it."" So that's more the process of this distressed inventory situation, and I think that we're -- we've been in the midst of it for now, a couple of years. We know what needs to be done. We know which ones are likely to be able to move, and we will continue to work the marketplace."

Free cash flow, we're guiding is going to be $600 million to $700 million last year. This year, we set it $725 million. But $67 million of that $725 million is a onetime benefit that we got from recovering some bad payments that had been made previously along with associated interest. So if you take the $725 million and you subtract out $67 million, you get to -- what's that number? It's like $660 million? Okay, something like that. Thanks. So around $660 million. So I'd say that free cash flow right now is probably going to be, ballpark, on an aggregate, our guidance is $600 million to $700 million, it's in the ballpark, on free cash flow. One of the benefits we got this year that enabled to spend a little extra on capital allocation was our advance rate differential on our ABS transactions was materially better this year than it was last year. And we shared previously that that advance rate differential benefited us to the tune of around $100 million plus of incremental cash. Now our advance rates this year have been 92%, 98%. We're not encouraging anyone to model anything better than that. And so maybe that advantage that we had in 2011 won't accrue to us in 2012. We're not sure. It's too early to tell. And then the final question is what will we do in continuing to maintain our leverage ratio. Right now, I think our guidance is for an incremental $70 million to $80 million of EBITDA. So if we were to lever on top of the $70 million to $80 million of EBITDA, that would generate another couple of hundred million dollars, potentially, of available cash. So I think that's pretty consistent with this year. So I think at a year-to-year comparison, maybe the only difference will be -- and I'm talking in approximations here. The only difference will be that we're not counting on better advance rates than 98% advance rates."
