During the fourth quarter, our teams across the company delivered an exceptional customer experience in a safe environment.

During the fourth quarter, our teams across the company delivered an exceptional customer experience in a safe environment. They showed amazing flexibility and execution, managing extraordinary volume in a dynamic situation, and they strive every day to create safe shopping experiences often in the face of pandemic fatigue. As a result, today, we are reporting strong Q4 financial results, which include comparable sales growth of 12.6% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 20%. 
We continue to leverage our unique capabilities, including our supply chain expertise, flexible store operating model and ability to shift quickly to digital to meet the ongoing elevated demand for stay-at-home products and services. 
Online sales grew almost 90% to a record $6.7 billion and made up 43% of our total Domestic sales. Our stores played a pivotal role in the fulfillment of these sales as almost 2/3 of our online revenue was either picked up in-store or curbside, shipped from a store or delivered by a store employee. The percent of online sales picked up by customers at our stores was 48%, representing a 90% increase in volume. Ship-to-home volume was up 38%. And even with that increase in volume, we were able to accelerate the delivery speed to our customers on a year-over-year basis by strategically using our partners, our stores and our employee delivery. For additional context, same-day shipping volume was up 376%, and our employees delivered more than 1 million units. 
From a product category perspective, the biggest contributors to the strong comp sales growth in the quarter were computing, appliances, gaming, virtual reality and home theater. 
As you recall, this year, we started holiday promotions in October, which is in our third quarter. We started these events early and spread them over the course of several weeks to help avoid overly crowded days in our stores in order to create a safer shopping experience. These efforts can manage the traffic flow into our stores proved effective and even out some of the peaks and valleys through the holiday season. As planned, it also resulted in some holiday sales being pulled into Q3. After reaching 33% comp growth in October, our growth rate moderated as we lapped last year's November and December holiday sales before accelerating again in January due to the ongoing elevated stay-at-home demand boosted by government stimulus actions. That sales growth momentum we saw in January has largely continued into February. As a result of both the successful early holiday sales and the product availability issues the industry has been seeing all year, we continue to experience product availability constraints during the fourth quarter, which we believe moderated our holiday sales, particularly in large appliances, computing and televisions. In addition, demand for the new gaming consoles far outstrip supply across the industry as was well documented. Our teams work closely and effectively with our vendors to bring in as much inventory as possible, and inventory positions improved through the quarter. 
As I step back and reflect upon the whole year, it was truly a year like no other. In addition to an international pandemic, there was social unrest across the nation and numerous natural disasters. I am proud of and inspired by the way our teams have navigated the challenges and what they have accomplished. We saw remarkable customer demand and delivered outstanding execution that led to a very strong financial results. For the year, we delivered comparable sales growth of 9.7% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 30%. We drove record free cash flow of $4.2 billion and ended the year with $5.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. 
Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have responded to the impacts of it with a focus on safety and helping customers get the products they need to work, learn, cook, entertain and communicate at home. We provided customers with multiple options for how, when and where they shop with us to ensure we met their definition of safe retailing, and customers noticed. The percent of customers surveyed who said we made them feel safe while they were in our stores and while we were in their homes was consistently above 97% throughout the year. 
To best serve our customers during the pandemic, we had to be innovative and flexible. Early in the year, we quickly rolled out enhanced curbside pickup across our stores to provide our customers convenience when we made the difficult decision to close our stores in March. In May, we developed an in-store appointment model that provided our customers with an option to shop in our stores as we prepare to open stores back up to customer shopping. We developed solutions like virtual consultations with advisers and video chats with our store associates. In addition, we made significant improvements to the functionality and customer experience of our app to provide access to shopping, support and fulfillment. This served not only new users of the app, but also increased levels of customer engagement with the app. In Q4, first time launches of the app were up almost 80%, and the average number of app visits per unique user were up 34%. 
During the year, we also increased our investment in support of our employees. Early on in the pandemic, we continued to pay employees who weren't working for a full month after we closed our stores to customer shopping. We paid hourly appreciation pay for those who are working on the front lines and established multiple hardship funds for anyone impacted physically, emotionally or financially by COVID. We provided enhanced benefits that included 100% coverage of COVID-related health care expenses, expanded caregiver leave, additional support for backup childcare, tutoring reimbursement and access to physical and mental health virtual visits. Including our estimates for fiscal '22, we will have invested more than $75 million on enhancements to our structural employee benefits over a 3- year period. In addition to enhanced benefits, starting in August, we raised the starting minimum wage to $15 per hour for all our employees, which brought our average hourly wage for hourly employees up to $17.67. To show our appreciation for their hard work over the past year and in recognition of their ongoing efforts in the face of pandemic fatigue, we are paying employees an additional cash gratitude bonus. In the next few weeks, all hourly U.S. employees will receive $500 at full-time and $200 at part-time or occasional seasonal. 
In addition, to help keep employees and customers safe, we are encouraging all employees to get COVID vaccinations as they are available by providing them with paid time off when they receive the vaccine and providing them absence time to be used in the event they develop side effects that warrant they're needing to stay home and rest after receiving the vaccination. 
In all, the COVID-related decisions we have made since the beginning of the pandemic to support our employees totaled more than $350 million. This includes paying employees while they weren't working during store closures, appreciation pay, guaranteed pay, bonuses, vaccination support and hardship funds. 
We've also deepened our commitment to community. Last year, we made a $40 million donation to the Best Buy Foundation to accelerate the progress toward our goal to reach 100 teen tech centers across the U.S. And we committed to making systemic permanent changes that address social injustices to improve our company and our communities. We also signed the climate pledge, committing to be carbon neutral across our operations by 2040, a decade earlier than our previous goal of 2050. We were honored to be recognized for our efforts by Barron's earlier this month when we were named to the top of their most sustainable public companies list. The list rated the 1,000 largest public companies on 5 key stakeholder categories: Shareholders, employees, customers, community and planet. Notably, Best Buy was also called out as the company with the leading COVID response, citing our efforts to maintain employee and customer safety, health employees experiencing hardship and continue to meet the technology needs of customers. This is the fourth time we have been in the top 5 and the second time we have been in the #1 position. 
As we think about our strategy moving forward, many of the themes we discussed at our 2019 investor update came to life in a very accelerated way last year. It is important to reiterate the following 3 concepts we believe to be permanent and structural implications of the pandemic that are shaping our strategic priorities. One, customer shopping behavior will be permanently changed in a way that is even more digital and puts customers entirely in control to shop how they want. Our strategy is to embrace that reality and to lead, not follow. It is too early to know exactly how much of our sales and customer shopping activity will be via digital channels over time. But as I mentioned earlier, online sales were up 43% of our Domestic -- online sales worth 43% of our Domestic sales in fiscal '21, and we are planning for the mix to be approximately 40% in fiscal '22. That compares to 19% in fiscal '20 and only 5% just 10 years ago. 
Two, our workforce will need to evolve in a way that meets the needs of customers while providing more flexible opportunities for our employees. 
And three, technology is playing an even more crucial role in people's lives. And, as a result, our purpose to enrich lives through technology has never been more important. We play a vital role in bringing technology to life for both our customers and our vendor partners. 
These concepts are extensive and interdependent, and we are, as quickly as possible, both implementing change today and assessing future implications across our entire business including how we evolve our stores and labor model and how we spend our investment dollars. 
Our research indicates our customers look to Best Buy to serve 4 shopping needs: Inspiration, research, convenience and support. And customers expect to be able to seamlessly interact with physical and digital channels. We must be ready to serve all of these needs at all times in all channels. We are building all of our experiences around meeting these needs as we move from being a big box retailer with a strong omnichannel presence to an omnichannel retailer with a large store footprint for support and fulfillment. 
Fundamentally, when you're looking for help and want to be inspired, the best experience will always be in our stores, talking to one of our amazing employees. The proximity to a physical store still matters to many customers. And our stores serve an important role in fulfillment and support, and also provide awareness and convenience that are critical to retaining and growing sales. But we also know that customer shopping behaviors are changing, and we need to evolve with them. 
In the fourth quarter, the pandemic drove a roughly 15% reduction in traffic to our stores, including both in-store shoppers and customers picking up online orders via in-store or curbside. And while some traffic will likely shift back to our store channel in fiscal '22, like many retailers, we believe much of what we saw last year will be permanent. Our employees and the stores will always be central to our strategy. We are simply looking at how we can best deploy our team and our physical assets to meet customer expectations and needs. 
As we discussed last quarter, we are taking the opportunity to test and pilot a range of models and initiatives in order to chart the best path forward. We must balance urgency for change with the need to learn and understand how customer shopping behavior is changing. We are already gathering learnings and iterating on our initiative. An example is our ship-from-store hub pilot that we've talked about for the past few quarters. During Q4, we used 340 stores or roughly 35% of our store locations to handle about 70% of our total ship-from-store units. We believe that we can achieve similar results, consolidating volume using a smaller group of stores as hubs over time. In addition, in a subset of these stores, we plan to reduce the sales floor square footage and install warehouse-grade packaging, station equipment and supplies. As a result, we expect to drive both efficiency and effectiveness. We also continue to pilot reduced selling square footage and alternative layouts in a number of stores in the Minneapolis market. 
As you would expect, pandemic or not, we're constantly looking at our store network, responding to customer and demographic shifts just as any retailer does. We will continue our normal review process, which involves putting stores through rigorous evaluations as their leases come up for renewal. 
As we look to the near term, there will be higher thresholds on renewing leases as we evaluate the role each store plays in its market, the investments required to meet our customer needs and the expected return based on a new retail landscape. For context, we have approximately 450 leases coming up for renewal in the next 3 years or an average of 150 each year. As part of the review process, we have closed approximately 20 large-format locations each of the past 2 years, and expect to close a higher number this year. We have also been reducing the length of our average lease term, which will continue to provide us flexibility. 
In addition to our physical stores, our operating model needs to evolve to meet our customers' changing shopping behaviors that have been accelerated by the pandemic. The sudden and lasting shift customers have made to shopping more regularly and seamlessly across all of our channels has forced us to look at how we get our work done. Our response to the pandemic has shown our ability to be successful when broadening the scope of responsibility of our associates and has highlighted the importance of ongoing flexibility and adaptability. This, too, was a hypothesis we shared at our 2019 investor update and was massively accelerated by customer shopping behavior changes. 
Since the pandemic began, our overall headcount has been going through a transformation. As a reminder, we made the difficult decision to furlough approximately 51,000 retail employees due to store closures last April. By August, we had brought back about 2/3 of them. As we approach the fourth quarter, any remaining employees that had been on furlough were asked to return to work as seasonal employees for the holidays. As employees who are on furlough decided not to come back and other employees left as a result of attrition, we have not been backfilling positions as we consider how to adjust our operations to better meet our customers' needs going forward. As a result, we entered fiscal '21 with 123,000 employees across the entire organization, and we are leaving the year with about 102,000 team members, a decline of roughly 21,000 or 17%. Even though headcount across the enterprise has been declining primarily due to this attrition, we still have had to make difficult decisions. Earlier this month, one of those decisions was to adjust the mix of full-time and part-time employees at each of our store locations. At an aggregate level, this was due to having too many full-time and not enough part-time employees. As part of the process, part-time roles were offered to many of the displaced full-time employees who are interested and qualified. The end result was that we laid off and provided severance to approximately 5,000 in place, the majority of which were full time. At the same time, we are adding approximately 2,000 additional part-time positions. Decisions like these are never easy or taken lightly, but they position us to be more responsive and flexible as we continue to refine our operating model going forward in response to the incredibly rapid change in how customers want to shop with us. 
It is important to add that we are intent on reskilling and retraining employees wherever possible, so we can retain our people and employees can flexibly work across all our channels. Our vision of a flexible workforce is about more than having our associates gain the knowledge and skills to be effective in more areas within the traditional store setting. It expands to include the type of interactions that have become even more relevant in a digital shopping environment. Over the past year, thousands of employees who possess unique skills were leveraged across multiple areas of our business like virtual sales, chat, phone and remote support. In addition, we are investing in people and hiring in areas like supply chain, small parcel delivery, customer care and technology in support of our long-term strategy. 
As the last year has demonstrated, technology is playing an even more crucial role in people's lives. We are excited about the technology trends and innovation we see over the next several years. As expected, there has been immense innovation in the consumer health category. The fitness industry has pivoted quickly, and the category is exploding as consumers want to stay fit at home and outfit home gyms. Beyond the connected equipment, customers now have the ability to integrate data for different types of activities like rowing, biking and running into any number of wearable devices to measure their overall fitness and progress more seamlessly. There is also innovation around more chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease with wearables that monitor insulin levels and heart rates. Hearing aids is another category going through innovation, and we are excited to help our customers with hearing needs, both online and in our stores. The proliferation of health-related devices has become so great we created a health and wellness digital shopping experience accessible directly from the homepage of our website. 
Of course, there's an innovation curve in products that help people work at home as well. There is an influx of products around all aspects from high-tech chairs to monitors to standing desks. These are products that were not even on vendor road maps before the pandemic and now truly complete the working-at-home experience. 
Access to 5G is still growing as networks are rolling out across cities. As we move into next year and the year after, it will be more mainstream and accessible for all of us. We are excited about the introduction of new products over time that will leverage the speed and capabilities of 5G beyond the mobile phone. 
Of course, our customers expect Best Buy to be there to help inspire and support all their technology. Our consultation program continues to be an important differentiator, and advisers are inspiring technology solutions via customer consultations happening in homes, digitally, in stores and via chat and phone. We are also leveraging our consultation program with our partners. For example, customers can schedule an appointment with one of our advisers while shopping on samsung.com. 
On the support side, our total tech support program continues to receive very strong customer ratings and is a unique program that we believe only we can offer. Membership growth recovered after we opened our stores more broadly. We continue to see significant opportunity over time to evolve all of our many customer memberships, which also includes our millions of My Best Buy customers. We purposefully pressed pause on this initiative at the start of the pandemic and are planning to roll out a pilot in the next few months that will leverage our learnings from the material evolution of customer shopping behavior over the past year. 
I'd also like to update you on our health business more broadly. The pandemic has only served to underscore our purpose and strategy. The adoption of virtual care and telehealth by patients and physicians has been greatly accelerated by COVID-19 and is expected to continue to grow. We see significant opportunity over the long-term to make the experience much better for both patients and physicians by providing an integrated seamless technology solution that is easy to use. To that end, our Best Buy health strategy focuses on 3 areas that start with our strength in retail and build to connect patients and physicians. 
The first focus area is the consumer health category I spoke about a little earlier. These products are for customers who want to be healthier, sleep better or need to monitor a chronic condition like diabetes or heart disease, for example. 
The second area is active aging, which includes device-based emergency response and other services for generation a, who wish to continue to live independently in their homes. Active aging builds on the great call, CST and Biosensics acquisitions. 
The third focus area is virtual care, and includes digital health caring center services that connect patients and physicians to enable virtual care and remote patient monitoring. We provide personal emergency response, remote patient monitoring and care counseling services to payers serving Medicare Advantage and Medicaid populations. And we will expand these services to help people monitor their chronic disease and connect to their physician. 
Our differentiated approach combines Best Buy's in-home and care counseling services with digital health. By digital health, we mean curated monitoring devices, packaged with the consumer in mind, with a platform to distribute, activate and test the devices to ensure the consumer can use them and connect to their physician. 
In fiscal '22, we plan to expand the consumer health product assortment and additional devices and services to our active aging business, and add new remote patient monitoring offerings and a new technology platform in virtual care. In order to do this, we plan to invest in people, product development and the ongoing development of our health technology platform in our data, analytics and intelligence engines. In addition to the investments in our health strategy, our investments in technology and automation will be important aspects in defining how our model continues to evolve in the future. 
As has been our practice for the past 8 years, we have continued our commitment to leverage cost reductions and efficiencies to help offset investments and pressures. Our current target set in 2019 is to achieve an additional $1 billion in annualized cost reductions and efficiencies by the end of fiscal '25. We achieved approximately $340 million toward our new goal during fiscal '21, taking our total to $500 million toward this goal. 
In summary, during fiscal '21, we managed through the challenging environment in a way that allowed us to accelerate many aspects of our strategy to deliver on our purpose and thrive in a new and forever changed environment. Our teams collectively changed the way we do business at a pace we never imagined, and I must reiterate how proud I am of their perseverance and commitment. As a result, we advanced our 5-year plan, both strategically and financially, much further than we expected. While we are ahead of plan in several strategic areas, the disruption of the pandemic has also impacted other strategic initiatives. 
For example, while our health business has proven to be even more strategically relevant to our mission, the pandemic certainly disrupted the progress and the path forward will take time. We also still have meaningful opportunity to evolve our membership and services models to drive loyalty. In addition, we will need to invest in our future as we proactively evolve all the channels of our business to deliver amazing customer experiences in a world where half of the revenue might be initiated online. All that being said, we see a path that leads to margin expansion beyond what we articulated at our last investor update. In fiscal '22, we expect our operating income rate to be lower than fiscal '21's 5.8% operating income rate as we continue to navigate and cycle impacts of the pandemic while investing in our strategy, as Matt will discuss. We are still in the midst of the pandemic. So we are not updating with a specific metric, but we see long-term non-GAAP operating income rate that is beyond the 5% fiscal '25 target we introduced in September 2019. 
Now, I would like to turn the call over to Matt for details on our results and insights on our outlook for fiscal '22."
255397,702760909,2223106,"Best Buy Co., Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2021",2021-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Best Buy Co., Inc.","Executives","Good morning. Our financial results for the year far surpassed what we thought was possible entering the year. We are leading fiscal '21 with an even healthier balance sheet than when we started the year and saw our non-GAAP operating income rate expand 9",1750,"Good morning. Our financial results for the year far surpassed what we thought was possible entering the year. We are leading fiscal '21 with an even healthier balance sheet than when we started the year and saw our non-GAAP operating income rate expand 90 basis points versus the prior year. The rate expansion was possible due to both our ability to capitalize on the elevated demand for technology and by reducing spend early in the year in certain discretionary areas beyond the unknown -- based on the unknown situation we were facing at the beginning of the pandemic. We also accelerated strategies that allowed us to begin adjusting our cost structure to what we believe will be a permanent shift in how customers want to shop. Despite the difficult decisions we made throughout the year, we remain committed on investing in areas we felt were most crucial to delivering our future growth plans. 
Let me now share more details specific to our fourth quarter. On Enterprise revenue of $16.9 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.48, an increase of 20% versus last year. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 6.9% increased 40 basis points. This rate expansion was driven by approximately 90 basis points of leverage from the higher sales volume on our SG&A, which was partially offset by a 60 basis point decline in our gross profit rate. In addition, a lower effective tax rate had an $0.08 favorable year-over-year impact on our non-GAAP diluted EPS. 
In our Domestic segment, revenue for the quarter increased 11% to $15.4 billion, an all-time high for revenue in a single quarter. Comparable sales growth of 12% was partially offset by the loss of revenue from stores that were permanently closed in the past year. 
From a merchandising perspective, we had broad-based strength across most of our categories, with the largest drivers of comparable growth coming from computing, appliances, gaming, virtual reality and home theater. This growth was partially offset by declines in headphones and mobile phones. 
Turning now to gross profit. The domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate declined 50 basis points to 20.7%, primarily driven by supply chain costs associated with a higher mix of online revenue. In the fourth quarter, our online sales were 43% of our overall Domestic sales in the quarter compared to 25% last year. Although it was a smaller impact than the supply chain cost, our category mix was also a pressure this quarter. These items were partially offset by a promotional environment that was more favorable compared to last year. 
Our International non-GAAP gross profit rate decreased 180 basis points to 20.8%, primarily due to increased supply chain costs from a higher mix of online sales and a lower sales mix from the higher-margin services category. 
Moving next to SG&A. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A increased 5% compared to last year and decreased 90 basis points as a percentage of revenue. As expected, the largest drivers of the expense increase versus last year were: One, higher incentive compensation for corporate and field employees of approximately $55 million; two, increased variable costs associated with higher sales volume, which included items such as credit card processing fees; and three, technology investments, which also include support of our health initiatives. These increased expenses were partially offset by lower store payroll expense. 
Let me share some additional context on the increased expense from our technology investments. Technology has, and increasingly will be, the foundation of how we will operate and how we accelerate our strategy. This includes continued technology investments and capabilities to support our health initiatives, increasing and improving our digital interactions with customers, simplifying task in our stores and building upon our analytics to support decisions we make on a daily basis. We are also modernizing our systems and tools as well as utilizing more cloud-based solutions. For example, we are partnering with Microsoft to leverage its cloud to help power our health care offerings. In addition, we are transforming the structure of our technology teams by bringing more headcount in-house versus using contract workers. 
Let me next provide more context on $129 million in restructuring charges from this quarter, which also include a $13 million benefit within cost of sales. About $88 million of the charges related to changes in our domestic segment to realign our organizational structure with our strategic priorities. The remaining $41 million is primarily related to our previously announced plans to exit operations in Mexico. We don't anticipate any additional material charges in Mexico in future quarters, and all of our store locations in Mexico will be closed by the end of Q1. 
Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $5.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. At the end of Q4, our inventory balance was approximately 8% higher than last year's comparable period to support the current demand for technology. Approximately half of the year-over-year increase is related to inventory still in transit. Although trends have improved from earlier in the year, we are still experiencing constraints driven by the high demand in several of our key categories. 
During fiscal '21, we returned $880 million to shareholders through $568 million in dividends and $312 million in share repurchases. We resumed share repurchases during the fourth quarter after suspending activity last March. This morning, we announced a 27% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.70 per share. We also announced our plans to spend at least $2 billion on share repurchases in fiscal '22. In addition, our Board of Directors approved a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization, replacing the existing authorization dated February 2019, which had a $1.7 billion in repurchases remaining at the end of fiscal '21. 
As we look to our fiscal '22, we are not providing our traditional guidance, but I would like to share our planning assumptions as we enter the year. As we start fiscal '22, the demand for technology remains at elevated levels, and the sales growth momentum we saw in January has continued through the first 3 weeks of February. The uncertainty around the administration of the COVID vaccine and the subsequent impact to customer demand and shopping patterns makes it difficult to predict how sustainable these trends will be. Other factors to consider include government stimulus actions and the risk of continued high unemployment. With that being said, we estimate fiscal '22 total comparable sales growth in the range of down 2% to up 1%. This range reflects a scenario in which customers resume or accelerate spend in areas that were slowed during the pandemic, such as travel and dining out in the back half of this year. Overall, we expect growth to be positive in the first half of the year and then negative in the back half as we lap strong comp growth in Q3 and Q4 of fiscal '21. We will update our expectations during the year, if needed, as there is more clarity to the various factors driving our outlook. Regardless, we anticipate revenue for fiscal '22 will be higher than what we would have expected to be at this time last year. 
From a gross profit rate perspective, we are planning for a non-GAAP rate that is slightly below our fiscal '21 rate. We anticipate more promotional pressure than we experienced this past year as inventory becomes more available and competition likely increases. As Corie mentioned, we are planning for online sales to represent approximately 40% of our Domestic sales in fiscal '22, which is only slightly lower than our mix in fiscal '21. As a result, supply chain-related costs are not expected to have a material impact on our rate compared to the prior year. 
From an SG&A standpoint, we're expecting dollars to increase as a percentage in the low single-digit range. There are a number of factors driving the expected increase. First, we expect our SG&A increase -- expense to increase approximately $100 million on a year-over-year basis as we lap COVID-related decisions we made last year to preserve liquidity. This includes returning to more normalized spend on items such as 401(k) company match, advertising spend, store overhead items such as maintenance. This $100 million increase includes the benefit of lapping the $40 million donation to the Best Buy Foundation we made in Q3 of fiscal '21. 
Second, we plan to increase our investments in depreciation and depreciation in support of technology and our health initiatives by approximately $150 million compared to fiscal '21. 
Third, we expect store payroll costs to be lower compared to fiscal '21, even after including the impact of lapping $81 million of employee retention credits from the Cares Act we received in the first half of fiscal '21. 
There are clearly other puts and takes that we will manage through, some that will be more impactful in 1 quarter versus the next, but the previous items are the key drivers of how we are viewing the full year. 
Based on the drivers I just outlined, our expectation is for our operating income rate to decline on a year-over-year basis, which is primarily a result of our increased investments in technology and in support of our health initiatives as well as the impact of lapping the temporary actions from fiscal '21 I just shared. 
In relation to capital expenditures, we expect to spend approximately $750 million to $850 million during fiscal '22 compared to $713 million in fiscal '21. 
Now I will provide some color on Q1. We expect comparable sales to be approximately 20%. As a reminder, in Q1 of last year, we closed all of our stores to customer shopping and moved to curbside service only for the last 7 weeks of the quarter. We anticipate our gross profit rate will be slightly lower than last year due to more promotional environment and increased delivery expense. As a reminder, we suspended in-home services for about 5 weeks during last year's Q1. 
We expect SG&A dollars to increase by approximately 10%. This increase is primarily related to incentive compensation as we suspended all expense during Q1 of last year for corporate and field employees as well as the gratitude- and vaccination-related bonuses that Corie discussed. These items, combined, are expected to result in more than $100 million in additional expense versus last year. In addition, we anticipate increased expense from our investments in technology and health as well as higher variable expense associated with expected growth. 
I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

And we likely are going to have to invest a bit more to remain price competitive, which, of course, since the beginning has been our priority. So I think your intuition is right there that we would expect things to normalize a bit in terms of promotionality."

I think we strongly believe our competitive advantage is our ability to provide both support and advice across all the channel -- any channel that anyone wants to shop in. And obviously, there are different challenges and different modes of doing that across the different channels. But regardless, we know our employee -- or our customers, excuse me, are looking for both that advice and that support across channels. And we've been investing in our capabilities and technology in order to deliver that. 
We've also talked about the fact that what our customers expect from us from a support perspective has changed over time. And it's less about that break-fix support, although that's still important, and we need to be there when that happens. And it's much more about supporting your technology seamlessly across your devices. And it's more about -- is my printer staying on my network or is my content streaming the way that I want it to. And hence, the reason we've been migrating to a model that looks more like total tech support, which provides you obviously coverage for all the technology devices in your home, regardless of where you bought them. 
And so it's not just about now for your question specifically, digitally, it's not just about the buying experience. It's actually about using digital across all aspects of the shopping experience. And so we have been working, and we are continuing to work, and as you think about the investments that Matt mentioned in technology, we're investing in things like video chats, virtual consultations, adding digital checkout in the app, this is still all empowered by our amazing blue shirts who are actually creating these experiences. We're just creating them digitally. And so while the gross margin rate has been lower online, over time, it's constantly improving because we're constantly improving that customer experience. And we are seeing increases in our ability to transact total tech support or digital consultations, we're seeing more in home adviser leads online as an example. So I think it's hard to replace that and support you get by visiting our stores, but we are seeing customers get more comfortable with experiencing some of those things online. And it's less about exactly which channels are happening and more about how to in every channel we interact with you, we're constantly trying to improve that experience. So to your point and your question, it does become more natural to make these buying decisions in a digital environment."

So in the role we play in that is extremely important and even stronger than it was before. And so as we look at next year and we think about it being probably a tale of 2 halves with growth in the first and then declines in the latter, I think we still see opportunity for innovation to keep fundamentally technology important in people's lives. 
Clearly, at a micro level there, you could imagine some categories could see a little bit of pull at any given point. But there's also an element of personal savings rates being so elevated now. Right now, they're about 14%, which is twice what they were going into the pandemic. So there are a lot of puts and takes in the year. Fundamentally, the guide for next year really incorporates a view that as we get towards maybe the middle of the year, we start to see that shifting of consumer behavior back to places that were a little muted as the pandemic hit. 
So we wouldn't characterize the pullback, but just changing how people deciding to use their wallet."

When we set that target in 2019, the good news is our strategic hypothesis was spot on. The interesting part is we have made a massive amount of progress even faster. The customer has made a massive amount of progress. We knew digital penetration was going to grow pretty substantially. What we didn't know is that it was going to double in the span of a year. And so we need to take, and we are taking, the appropriate time to think about the longer-term given these seismic changes that we've seen. And there are lots of uncertainties, including the fact we're still in the middle of a pandemic. And so we're testing and piloting a number of different models that are going to balance this kind of urgency for change with the need to learn how the customer is changing their behavior.

There's also periods of time where we had some -- our stores closed and we did -- we weren't able to offer all of our services for installations and delivery. There's a little bit of pressure there. 
In addition, I think online mix being assumed at 40% versus 43% this last year, is not a meaningful difference in terms of the impact of supply chain costs. So that's why we don't think supply chain costs fundamentally are much of a benefit as you start to move into next year, as you are assuming the same amount of sales between the fundamental 2 years. 
I also think within there, you've got a little bit of promotional favorability, offset by a little bit of category mix changes that will happen throughout the year. So fundamental, it's that assumption that online mix stays pretty much the same."

We have yet to put the new generation of gaming consoles into our stores. We anticipate to do that soon, but we haven't done that because there just hasn't been enough inventory to meet demand. So those are some of the things that, pandemic aside, it would have likely been constrained in is only more heightened based on people wanting to dramatically change their at-home experiences. 
Other categories like printing have been constrained since the sort of pandemic and there's some challenges in that industry at large getting back into a better inventory position. I think in most some of the bigger categories around computing and home theater were going through some natural time transitions. This would be now our second home theater transition, as an example, during a pandemic. And I think our vendors are getting smarter about the timing of new model introductions and then what do they use for demand generation. 
So I can't give you a good window as to what our inventory will look like 12 months from now. I feel we're going to be in better stock overall, but we'll still have a handful of constraints that we have to navigate through. I think the one thing our teams really do well, and I know that you know this that we work so far upstream with all of our partners with collaborative forecasting, demand generation, even feature sets on models, which can actually help us give us -- help give our vendors the best forecast possible. So I always look at our forecast accuracy and our percent of [indiscernible] and I feel really good about what I can see going forward. And then the rest is based on consumer demand.

It's a little bit about everything you just mentioned, in fact. And so, in other words, there are multiple ways in which employees can, in many cases, opt in to gaining further certifications and skills. Sometimes that looks like within the 4 walls of the store, I might opt in to garnering more skills in home theater and computing. I might opt in to garnering more skills around services, therefore, I am more flexible throughout the store. 
In some cases, that might also mean I am willing to spend some of my time doing fulfillment work. Fulfilling on car side -- curbside, excuse me, orders or packing inventory in the back out of some of those ship-from-store locations. So I may add those skills, which might add more hours and more flexibility. 
And then there are some new digital experiences that we are leveraging our associates for. I might opt in to being able to answer calls from a national call queue while I'm on my shift, it's not that busy, and I can pick up a customer's question by a call or I might opt in to being more of an expert that's virtual, that can help you with whatever your question is in a virtual connection through our app. All of those are different ways in which we're reskilling.
And then you can imagine, on top of that, there might flexibility to go work in a supply chain location or there might be flexibility to train myself into more of a technology job and be able to do that remotely.

I think what's important for us right now is we are trying to build in flexibility that will allow us to meet the customer wherever they're deciding to interact with us across both channels. And we're worrying a little less about exactly what the optimal mix is and instead really trying to figure out how best can we use that employee hour space across all the things that we need to do and therefore, staff appropriately against that. 
So optimal, I don't think we know yet, given that we're still in the midst of a pandemic, we still have a lot of unknowns in front of us, but we do feel pretty strongly that we are now set up in a better position be able to flex with the changing customer dynamic.

During the fourth quarter, our teams across the company delivered an exceptional customer experience in a safe environment.

During the fourth quarter, our teams across the company delivered an exceptional customer experience in a safe environment. They showed amazing flexibility and execution, managing extraordinary volume in a dynamic situation, and they strive every day to create safe shopping experiences often in the face of pandemic fatigue. As a result, today, we are reporting strong Q4 financial results, which include comparable sales growth of 12.6% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 20%.
We continued to leverage our unique capabilities, including our supply chain expertise, flexible store operating model and ability to shift quickly to digital to meet the ongoing elevated demand for stay-at-home products and services. Online sales grew almost 90% to a record $6.7 billion and made up 43% of our total Domestic sales. Our stores played a pivotal role in the fulfillment of these sales as almost 2/3 of our online revenue was either picked up in-store or curbside, shipped from a store or delivered by a store employee. The percent of online sales picked up by customers at our stores was 48%, representing a 90% increase in volume. Ship-to-home volume was up 38%. And even with that increase in volume, we were able to accelerate the delivery speed to our customers on a year-over-year basis by strategically using our partners, our stores and our employee delivery. For additional context, same-day shipping volume was up 376%, and our employees delivered more than 1 million units.
From a product category perspective, the biggest contributors to the strong comp sales growth in the quarter were computing, appliances, gaming, virtual reality and home theater.
As you recall, this year, we started holiday promotions in October, which is in our third quarter. We started these events early and spread them over the course of several weeks to help avoid overly crowded days in our stores in order to create a safer shopping experience. These efforts can manage the traffic flow into our stores proved effective and evened out some of the peaks and valleys through the holiday season. As planned, it also resulted in some holiday sales being pulled into Q3. After reaching 33% comp growth in October, our growth rate moderated as we lapped last year's November and December holiday sales before accelerating again in January due to the ongoing elevated stay-at-home demand boosted by government stimulus actions. That sales growth momentum we saw in January has largely continued into February.
As a result of both the successful early holiday sales and the product availability issues the industry has been seeing all year, we continued to experience product availability constraints during the fourth quarter, which we believe moderated our holiday sales, particularly in large appliances, computing and televisions. In addition, demand for the new gaming consoles far outstrip supply across the industry as was well documented. Our teams work closely and effectively with our vendors to bring in as much inventory as possible, and inventory positions improved through the quarter.
As I step back and reflect upon the whole year, it was truly a year like no other. In addition to an international pandemic, there was social unrest across the nation and numerous natural disasters. I am proud of and inspired by the way our teams have navigated the challenges and what they have accomplished. We saw remarkable customer demand and delivered outstanding execution that led to a very strong financial results. For the year, we delivered comparable sales growth of 9.7% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 30%. We drove record free cash flow of $4.2 billion and ended the year with $5.5 billion in cash and short-term investments.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have responded to the impacts of it with a focus on safety and helping customers get the products they need to work, learn, cook, entertain and communicate at home. We provided customers with multiple options for how, when and where they shop with us to ensure we met their definition of safe retailing, and customers noticed. The percent of customers surveyed who said we made them feel safe while they were in our stores and while we were in their homes was consistently above 97% throughout the year.
To best serve our customers during the pandemic, we had to be innovative and flexible. Early in the year, we quickly rolled out enhanced curbside pickup across our stores to provide our customers convenience when we made the difficult decision to close our stores in March. In May, we developed an in-store appointment model that provided our customers with an option to shop in our stores as we prepare to open stores back up to customer shopping. We developed solutions like virtual consultations with advisers and video chats with our store associates.
In addition, we made significant improvements to the functionality and customer experience of our app to provide access to shopping, support and fulfillment. This served not only new users of the app, but also increased levels of customer engagement with the app. In Q4, first time launches of the app were up almost 80%, and the average number of app visits per unique user were up 34%.
During the year, we also increased our investment in support of our employees. Early on in the pandemic, we continued to pay employees who weren't working for a full month after we closed our stores to customer shopping. We paid hourly appreciation pay for those who are working on the front lines and established multiple hardship funds for anyone impacted physically, emotionally or financially by COVID. We provided enhanced benefits that included 100% coverage of COVID-related health care expenses, expanded caregiver leave, additional support for backup childcare, tutoring reimbursement and access to physical and mental health virtual visits.
Including our estimates for fiscal '22, we will have invested more than $75 million on enhancements to our structural employee benefits over a 3- year period. In addition to enhanced benefits, starting in August, we raised the starting minimum wage to $15 per hour for all our employees, which brought our average hourly wage for hourly employees up to $17.67. To show our appreciation for their hard work over the past year and in recognition of their ongoing efforts in the face of pandemic fatigue, we are paying employees an additional cash gratitude bonus. In the next few weeks, all hourly U.S. employees will receive $500 at full time and $200 at part-time or occasional seasonal.
In addition, to help keep employees and customers safe, we are encouraging all employees to get COVID vaccinations as they are available by providing them with paid time off when they receive the vaccine and providing them absence time to be used in the event they develop side effects that warrant they're needing to stay home and rest after receiving the vaccination.
In all, the COVID-related decisions we have made since the beginning of the pandemic to support our employees totaled more than $350 million. This includes paying employees while they weren't working during store closures, appreciation pay, guaranteed pay, bonuses, vaccination support and hardship funds.
We've also deepened our commitment to community. Last year, we made a $40 million donation to the Best Buy Foundation to accelerate the progress toward our goal to reach 100 teen tech centers across the U.S., and we committed to making systemic permanent changes that address social injustices to improve our company and our communities. We also signed The Climate Pledge, committing to be carbon neutral across our operations by 2040, a decade earlier than our previous goal of 2050. We were honored to be recognized for our efforts by Barron's earlier this month when we were named to the top of their most sustainable public companies list. The list rated the 1,000 largest public companies on 5 key stakeholder categories: shareholders, employees, customers, community and planet.
Notably, Best Buy was also called out as the company with the leading COVID response, citing our efforts to maintain employee and customer safety, health employees experiencing hardship and continue to meet the technology needs of customers. This is the fourth time we have been in the top 5 and the second time we have been in the #1 position.
As we think about our strategy moving forward, many of the themes we discussed at our 2019 investor update came to life in a very accelerated way last year. It is important to reiterate the following 3 concepts we believe to be permanent and structural implications of the pandemic that are shaping our strategic priorities. One, customer shopping behavior will be permanently changed in a way that is even more digital and puts customers entirely in control to shop how they want. Our strategy is to embrace that reality and to lead, not follow. It is too early to know exactly how much of our sales and customer shopping activity will be via digital channels over time. But as I mentioned earlier, online sales were up 43% of our domestic -- online sales were 43% of our domestic sales in fiscal '21, and we are planning for the mix to be approximately 40% in fiscal '22. That compares to 19% in fiscal '20 and only 5% just 10 years ago.
Two, our workforce will need to evolve in a way that meets the needs of customers while providing more flexible opportunities for our employees. And three, technology is playing an even more crucial role in people's lives. And, as a result, our purpose to enrich lives through technology has never been more important. We play a vital role in bringing technology to life for both our customers and our vendor partners. These concepts are extensive and interdependent, and we are, as quickly as possible, both implementing change today and assessing future implications across our entire business, including how we evolve our stores and labor models and how we spend our investment dollars.
Our research indicates our customers look to Best Buy to serve 4 shopping needs: inspiration, research, convenience and support. And customers expect to be able to seamlessly interact with physical and digital channels. We must be ready to serve all of these needs at all times in all channels. We are building all of our experiences around meeting these needs as we move from being a big box retailer with a strong omnichannel presence to an omnichannel retailer with a large store footprint for support and fulfillment.
Fundamentally, when you're looking for help and want to be inspired, the best experience will always be in our stores, talking to one of our amazing employees. The proximity to a physical store still matters to many customers. And our stores serve an important role in fulfillment and support, and also provide awareness and convenience that are critical to retaining and growing sales. But we also know that customer shopping behaviors are changing, and we need to evolve with them.
In the fourth quarter, the pandemic drove a roughly 15% reduction in traffic to our stores, including both in-store shoppers and customers picking up online orders via in-store or curbside. And while some traffic will likely shift back to our store channel in fiscal '22, like many retailers, we believe much of what we saw last year will be permanent. Our employees and the stores will always be central to our strategy. We are simply looking at how we can best deploy our team and our physical assets to meet customer expectations and needs.
As we discussed last quarter, we are taking the opportunity to test and pilot a range of models and initiatives in order to chart the best path forward. We must balance the urgency for change with the need to learn and understand how customer shopping behavior is changing. We are already gathering learnings and iterating on our initiative. An example is our ship-from-store hub pilot that we've talked about for the past few quarters. During Q4, we used 340 stores or roughly 35% of our store locations to handle about 70% of our total ship-from-store units. We believe that we can achieve similar results, consolidating volume using a smaller group of stores as hubs over time.
In addition, in a subset of these stores, we plan to reduce the sales floor square footage and install warehouse-grade packaging, station equipment and supplies. As a result, we expect to drive both efficiency and effectiveness. We also continue to pilot reduced selling square footage and alternative layouts in a number of stores in the Minneapolis market.
As you would expect, pandemic or not, we're constantly looking at our store network, responding to customer and demographic shifts just as any retailer does. We will continue our normal review process, which involves putting stores through rigorous evaluations as their leases come up for renewal.
As we look to the near term, there will be higher thresholds on renewing leases as we evaluate the role each store plays in its market, the investments required to meet our customer needs and the expected return based on a new retail landscape. For context, we have approximately 450 leases coming up for renewal in the next 3 years or an average of 150 each year. As part of the review process, we have closed approximately 20 large-format locations each of the past 2 years, and expect to close a higher number this year. We have also been reducing the length of our average lease term, which will continue to provide us flexibility.
In addition to our physical stores, our operating model needs to evolve to meet our customers' changing shopping behaviors that have been accelerated by the pandemic. The sudden and lasting shift customers have made to shopping more regularly and seamlessly across all of our channels has forced us to look at how we get our work done. Our response to the pandemic has shown our ability to be successful when broadening the scope of responsibility of our associates and has highlighted the importance of ongoing flexibility and adaptability. This, too, was a hypothesis we shared at our 2019 investor update and was massively accelerated by customer shopping behavior changes.
Since the pandemic began, our overall headcount has been going through a transformation. As a reminder, we made the difficult decision to furlough approximately 51,000 retail employees due to store closures last April. By August, we had brought back about 2/3 of them. As we approach the fourth quarter, any remaining employees that had been on furlough were asked to return to work as seasonal employees for the holidays. As employees who are on furlough decided not to come back and other employees left as a result of attrition, we have not been backfilling positions as we consider how to adjust our operations to better meet our customers' needs going forward. As a result, we entered fiscal '21 with 123,000 employees across the entire organization, and we are leaving the year with about 102,000 team members, a decline of roughly 21,000 or 17%.
Even though headcount across the enterprise has been declining primarily due to this attrition, we still have had to make difficult decisions. Earlier this month, one of those decisions was to adjust the mix of full-time and part-time employees at each of our store locations. At an aggregate level, this was due to having too many full-time and not enough part-time employees. As part of the process, part-time roles were offered to many of the displaced full-time employees who are interested and qualified. The end result was that we laid off and provided severance to approximately 5,000 in place, the majority of which were full time. At the same time, we are adding approximately 2,000 additional part-time positions. Decisions like these are never easy or taken lightly, but they position us to be more responsive and flexible as we continue to refine our operating model going forward in response to the incredibly rapid change in how customers want to shop with us.
It is important to add that we are intent on reskilling and retraining employees wherever possible, so we can retain our people and employees can flexibly work across all our channels. Our vision of a flexible workforce is about more than having our associates gain the knowledge and skills to be effective in more areas within the traditional store setting. It expands to include the type of interactions that have become even more relevant in a digital shopping environment. Over the past year, thousands of employees who possess unique skills were leveraged across multiple areas of our business like virtual sales, chat, phone and remote support. In addition, we are investing in people and hiring in areas like supply chain, small parcel delivery, customer care and technology in support of our long-term strategy.
As the last year has demonstrated, technology is playing an even more crucial role in people's lives. We are excited about the technology trends and innovation we see over the next several years. As expected, there has been immense innovation in the consumer health category. The fitness industry has pivoted quickly, and the category is exploding as consumers want to stay fit at home and outfit home gyms. Beyond the connected equipment, customers now have the ability to integrate data for different types of activities like rowing, biking and running into any number of wearable devices to measure their overall fitness and progress more seamlessly. There is also innovation around more chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease with wearables that monitor insulin levels and heart rates. Hearing aids is another category going through innovation, and we are excited to help our customers with hearing needs, both online and in our stores.
The proliferation of health-related devices has become so great, we created a health and wellness digital shopping experience accessible directly from the homepage of our website. Of course, there's an innovation curve in products that help people work at home as well.
There is an influx of products around all aspects from high-tech chairs to monitors to standing desks. These are products that were not even on vendor road maps before the pandemic and now truly complete the working-at-home experience. Access to 5G is still growing as networks are rolling out across cities. As we move into next year and the year after, it will be more mainstream and accessible for all of us. We are excited about the introduction of new products over time that will leverage the speed and capabilities of 5G beyond the mobile phone.
Of course, our customers expect Best Buy to be there to help inspire and support all their technology. Our consultation program continues to be an important differentiator, and advisers are inspiring technology solutions via customer consultations happening in homes, digitally, in stores and via chat and phone. We are also leveraging our consultation program with our partners. For example, customers can schedule an appointment with one of our advisers while shopping on samsung.com.
On the support side, our total tech support program continues to receive very strong customer ratings and is a unique program that we believe only we can offer. Membership growth recovered after we opened our stores more broadly. We continue to see significant opportunity over time to evolve all of our many customer memberships, which also includes our millions of My Best Buy customers. We purposefully pressed pause on this initiative at the start of the pandemic and are planning to roll out a pilot in the next few months that will leverage our learnings from the material evolution of customer shopping behavior over the past year.
I'd also like to update you on our health business more broadly. The pandemic has only served to underscore our purpose and strategy. The adoption of virtual care and telehealth by patients and physicians has been greatly accelerated by COVID-19 and is expected to continue to grow. We see significant opportunity over the long term to make the experience much better for both patients and physicians by providing an integrated seamless technology solution that is easy to use. To that end, our Best Buy health strategy focuses on 3 areas that start with our strength in retail and build to connect patients and physicians.
The first focus area is the consumer health category I spoke about a little earlier. These products are for customers who want to be healthier, sleep better or need to monitor a chronic condition like diabetes or heart disease, for example.
The second area is active aging, which includes device-based emergency response and other services for Generation A, who wish to continue to live independently in their homes. Active aging builds on the GreatCall, CST and BioSensics acquisitions.
The third focus area is virtual care, and includes digital health caring center services that connect patients and physicians to enable virtual care and remote patient monitoring. We provide personal emergency response, remote patient monitoring and care counseling services to payers serving Medicare Advantage and Medicaid populations. And we will expand these services to help people monitor their chronic disease and connect to their physician.
Our differentiated approach combines Best Buy's in-home and care counseling services with digital health. By digital health, we mean curated monitoring devices, packaged with the consumer in mind, with a platform to distribute, activate and test the devices to ensure the consumer can use them and connect to their physician.
In fiscal '22, we plan to expand the consumer health product assortment and additional devices and services to our active aging business, and add new remote patient monitoring offerings and a new technology platform in virtual care. In order to do this, we plan to invest in people, product development and the ongoing development of our health technology platform in our data, analytics and intelligence engines.
In addition to the investments in our health strategy, our investments in technology and automation will be important aspects in defining how our model continues to evolve in the future. As has been our practice for the past 8 years, we have continued our commitment to leverage cost reductions and efficiencies to help offset investments and pressures. Our current target set in 2019 is to achieve an additional $1 billion in annualized cost reductions and efficiencies by the end of fiscal '25. We achieved approximately $340 million toward our new goal during fiscal '21, taking our total to $500 million toward this goal.
In summary, during fiscal '21, we managed through the challenging environment in a way that allowed us to accelerate many aspects of our strategy to deliver on our purpose and thrive in a new and forever changed environment. Our teams collectively changed the way we do business at a pace we never imagined, and I must reiterate how proud I am of their perseverance and commitment. As a result, we advanced our 5-year plan, both strategically and financially, much further than we expected.
While we are ahead of plan in several strategic areas, the disruption of the pandemic has also impacted other strategic initiatives. For example, while our health business has proven to be even more strategically relevant to our mission, the pandemic certainly disrupted the progress and the path forward will take time. We also still have meaningful opportunity to evolve our membership and services models to drive loyalty. In addition, we will need to invest in our future as we proactively evolve all the channels of our business to deliver amazing customer experiences in a world where half of the revenue might be initiated online.
All that being said, we see a path that leads to margin expansion beyond what we articulated at our last investor update. In fiscal '22, we expect our operating income rate to be lower than fiscal '21's 5.8% operating income rate as we continue to navigate and cycle impacts of the pandemic while investing in our strategy, as Matt will discuss. We are still in the midst of the pandemic. So we are not updating with a specific metric, but we see long-term non-GAAP operating income rate that is beyond the 5% fiscal '25 target we introduced in September 2019.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Matt for details on our results and insights on our outlook for fiscal '22."

Our financial results for the year far surpassed what we thought was possible entering the year.

Our financial results for the year far surpassed what we thought was possible entering the year. We are leading fiscal '21 with an even healthier balance sheet than we -- than when we started the year and saw our non-GAAP operating income rate expand 90 basis points versus the prior year. The rate expansion was possible due to both our ability to capitalize on the elevated demand for technology and by reducing spend early in the year in certain discretionary areas beyond the unknown -- based on the unknown situation we were facing at the beginning of the pandemic. We also accelerated strategies that allowed us to begin adjusting our cost structure to what we believe will be a permanent shift in how customers want to shop. Despite the difficult decisions we made, throughout the year, we remain committed on investing in areas we felt were most crucial to delivering our future growth plans.
Let me now share more details specific to our fourth quarter. On Enterprise revenue of $16.9 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.48, an increase of 20% versus last year. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 6.9% increased 40 basis points. This rate expansion was driven by approximately 90 basis points of leverage from the higher sales volume on our SG&A, which was partially offset by a 60 basis point decline in our gross profit rate. In addition, a lower effective tax rate had an $0.08 favorable year-over-year impact on our non-GAAP diluted EPS. In our Domestic segment, revenue for the quarter increased 11% to $15.4 billion, an all-time high for revenue in a single quarter. Comparable sales growth of 12% was partially offset by the loss of revenue from stores that were permanently closed in the past year.
From a merchandising perspective, we had broad-based strength across most of our categories, with the largest drivers of comparable growth coming from computing, appliances, gaming, virtual reality and home theater. This growth was partially offset by declines in headphones and mobile phones.
Turning now to gross profit. The Domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate declined 50 basis points to 20.7%, primarily driven by supply chain costs associated with a higher mix of online revenue. In the fourth quarter, our online sales were 43% of our overall Domestic sales in the quarter compared to 25% last year. Although it was a smaller impact than the supply chain cost, our category mix was also a pressure this quarter. These items were partially offset by a promotional environment that was more favorable compared to last year. Our International non-GAAP gross profit rate decreased 180 basis points to 20.8%, primarily due to increased supply chain costs from a higher mix of online sales and a lower sales mix from the higher-margin services category.
Moving next to SG&A. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A increased 5% compared to last year and decreased 90 basis points as a percentage of revenue. As expected, the largest drivers of the expense increase versus last year were: one, higher incentive compensation for corporate and field employees of approximately $55 million; two, increased variable costs associated with higher sales volume, which included items such as credit card processing fees; and three, technology investments, which also include support of our health initiatives. These increased expenses were partially offset by lower store payroll expense.
Let me share some additional context on the increased expense from our technology investments. Technology has, and increasingly will be, the foundation of how we will operate and how we accelerate our strategy. This includes continued technology investments and capabilities to support our health initiatives, increasing and improving our digital interactions with customers, simplifying task in our stores and building upon our analytics to support decisions we make on a daily basis. We are also modernizing our systems and tools as well as utilizing more cloud-based solutions. For example, we are partnering with Microsoft to leverage its cloud to help power our health care offerings. In addition, we are transforming the structure of our technology teams by bringing more headcount in-house versus using contract workers.
Let me next provide more context on $129 million in restructuring charges from this quarter, which also include a $13 million benefit within cost of sales. About $88 million of the charges related to changes in our Domestic segment to realign our organizational structure with our strategic priorities. The remaining $41 million is primarily related to our previously announced plans to exit operations in Mexico. We don't anticipate any additional material charges in Mexico in future quarters, and all of our store locations in Mexico will be closed by the end of Q1.
Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $5.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. At the end of Q4, our inventory balance was approximately 8% higher than last year's comparable period to support the current demand for technology. Approximately half of the year-over-year increase is related to inventory still in transit. Although trends have improved from earlier in the year, we are still experiencing constraints driven by the high demand in several of our key categories.
During fiscal '21, we returned $880 million to shareholders through $568 million in dividends and $312 million in share repurchases. We resumed share repurchases during the fourth quarter after suspending activity last March. This morning, we announced a 27% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.70 per share. We also announced our plans to spend at least $2 billion on share repurchases in fiscal '22. In addition, our Board of Directors approved a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization replacing the existing authorization dated February 2019, which had a $1.7 billion in repurchases remaining at the end of fiscal '21.
As we look to our fiscal '22, we are not providing our traditional guidance, but I would like to share our planning assumptions as we enter the year. As we start fiscal '22, the demand for technology remains at elevated levels, and the sales growth momentum we saw in January has continued through the first 3 weeks of February. The uncertainty around the administration of the COVID vaccine and the subsequent impact to customer demand and shopping patterns makes it difficult to predict how sustainable these trends will be. Other factors to consider include government stimulus actions and the risk of continued high unemployment.
With that being said, we estimate fiscal '22 total comparable sales growth in the range of down 2% to up 1%. This range reflects a scenario in which customers resume or accelerate spend in areas that were slowed during the pandemic, such as travel and dining out in the back half of this year. Overall, we expect growth to be positive in the first half of the year and then negative in the back half as we lap strong comp growth in Q3 and Q4 of fiscal '21. We will update our expectations during the year, if needed, as there is more clarity to the various factors driving our outlook. Regardless, we anticipate revenue for fiscal '22 will be higher than what we would have expected to be at this time last year.
From a gross profit rate perspective, we are planning for a non-GAAP rate that is slightly below our fiscal '21 rate. We anticipate more promotional pressure than we experienced this past year as inventory becomes more available and competition likely increases. As Corie mentioned, we are planning for online sales to represent approximately 40% of our Domestic sales in fiscal '22, which is only slightly lower than our mix in fiscal '21. As a result, supply chain-related costs are not expected to have a material impact on our rate compared to the prior year.
From an SG&A standpoint, we're expecting dollars to increase as a percentage in the low single-digit range. There are a number of factors driving the expected increase. First, we expect our SG&A increase -- expense to increase approximately $100 million on a year-over-year basis as we lap COVID-related decisions we made last year to preserve liquidity. This includes returning to more normalized spend on items such as 401(k) company match, advertising spend, store overhead items such as maintenance. This $100 million increase includes the benefit of lapping the $40 million donation to the Best Buy Foundation we made in Q3 of fiscal '21.
Second, we plan to increase our investments in depreciation -- and depreciation in support of technology and our health initiatives by approximately $150 million compared to fiscal '21. Third, we expect store payroll costs to be lower compared to fiscal '21, even after including the impact of lapping $81 million of employee retention credits from the CARES Act we received in the first half of fiscal '21. There are clearly other puts and takes that we will manage through, some that will be more impactful in 1 quarter versus the next, but the previous items are the key drivers of how we are viewing the full year.
Based on the drivers I just outlined, our expectation is for our operating income rate to decline on a year-over-year basis, which is primarily a result of our increased investments in technology and in support of our health initiatives as well as the impact of lapping the temporary actions from fiscal '21 I just shared. In relation to capital expenditures, we expect to spend approximately $750 million to $850 million during fiscal '22 compared to $713 million in fiscal '21.
Now I will provide some color on Q1. We expect comparable sales to be approximately 20%. As a reminder, in Q1 of last year, we closed all of our stores to customer shopping and moved to curbside service only for the last 7 weeks of the quarter. We anticipate our gross profit rate will be slightly lower than last year due to more promotional environment and increased delivery expense. As a reminder, we suspended in-home services for about 5 weeks during last year's Q1.
We expect SG&A dollars to increase by approximately 10%. This increase is primarily related to incentive compensation as we suspended all expense during Q1 of last year for corporate and field employees as well as the gratitude- and vaccination-related bonuses that Corie discussed. These items combined are expected to result in more than $100 million in additional expense versus last year. In addition, we anticipate increased expense from our investments in technology and health as well as higher variable expense associated with expected growth.

I think we strongly believe our competitive advantage is our ability to provide both support and advice across all the channel -- any channel that anyone wants to shop in. And obviously, there are different challenges and different modes of doing that across the different channels. But regardless, we know our employee -- or our customers, excuse me, are looking for both that advice and that support across channels. And we've been investing in our capabilities and technology in order to deliver that.
We've also talked about the fact that what our customers expect from us from a support perspective has changed over time. And it's less about that break-fix support, although that's still important, and we need to be there when that happens. And it's much more about supporting your technology seamlessly across your devices. And it's more about -- is my printer staying on my network or is my content streaming the way that I want it to. And hence, the reason we've been migrating to a model that looks more like total tech support, which provides you obviously coverage for all the technology devices in your home, regardless of where you bought them.
And so it's not just about now -- for your question specifically, digitally, it's not just about the buying experience. It's actually about using digital across all aspects of the shopping experience. And so we have been working, and we are continuing to work, and as you think about the investments that Matt mentioned in technology, we're investing in things like video chats, virtual consultations, adding digital checkout in the app. This is still all empowered by our amazing Blue Shirts who are actually creating these experiences. We're just creating them digitally.
And so while the gross margin rate has been lower online, over time, it's constantly improving because we're constantly improving that customer experience. And we are seeing increases in our ability to transact total tech support or digital consultations, we're seeing more in home adviser leads online as an example. So I think it's hard to replace that expertise and support you get by visiting our stores, but we are seeing customers getting more comfortable with experiencing some of those things online. And it's less about exactly which channels are happening and more about how to in every channel we interact with you, we're constantly trying to improve that experience. So to your point and your question, it does become more natural to make these buying decisions in a digital environment."

I think fundamentally, if we step all the way back, we believe through all technology and people's lives is only intensified as a result of the pandemic. And the proliferation of devices in people's lives will continue to support advancement as innovation continues. So in the role we play in that is extremely important and even stronger than it was before. And so as we look at next year and we think about it being probably a tale of 2 halves with growth in the first and then declines in the latter, I think we still see opportunity for innovation to keep fundamentally technology important in people's lives.
Clearly, at a micro level there, you could imagine some categories could see a little bit of pull at any given point. But there's also an element of personal savings rates being so elevated now. Right now, they're about 14%, which is twice what they were going into the pandemic. So there are a lot of puts and takes in the year. Fundamentally, the guide for next year really incorporates a view that as we get towards maybe the middle of the year, we start to see that shifting of consumer behavior back to places that were a little muted as the pandemic hit. So we wouldn't characterize the pullback, but just changing how people deciding to use their wallet."

There's also periods of time where we had some -- our stores closed and we did -- we weren't able to offer all of our services for installations and delivery. There's a little bit of pressure there.
In addition, I think online mix being assumed at 40% versus 43% this last year, is not a meaningful difference in terms of the impact of supply chain costs. So that's why we don't think supply chain costs fundamentally are much of a benefit as you start to move into next year, as you are assuming the same amount of sales between the fundamental 2 years. I also think within there, you've got a little bit of promotional favorability, offset by a little bit of category mix changes that will happen throughout the year.

We feel better about our inventory position now versus the last 4 calls we've had. So I'll start with that because we've finally gotten back into better stock. That said, we still have constraints in parts of our business that we don't think will solve themselves in the first half of this year. Gaming is a good example. We have yet to put the new generation of gaming consoles into our stores. We anticipate to do that soon, but we haven't done that because there just hasn't been enough inventory to meet demand. So those are some of the things that, pandemic aside, it would have likely been constrained and is only more heightened based on people wanting to dramatically change their at-home experiences.
Other categories like printing have been constrained since the start of pandemic and there's some challenges in that industry at large getting back into a better inventory position. I think in most some of the bigger categories around computing and home theater were going through some natural time transitions. This would be now our second home theater transition, as an example, during a pandemic. And I think our vendors are getting smarter about the timing of new model introductions and then what do they use for demand generation.
So I can't give you a good window as to what our inventory will look like 12 months from now. I feel we're going to be in better stock overall, but we'll still have a handful of constraints that we have to navigate through. I think the one thing our teams really do well, and I know that you know this, but we work so far upstream with all of our partners with collaborative forecasting, demand generation, even feature sets on models, which can actually help us give us -- help give our vendors the best forecast possible. So I always look at our forecast accuracy and our percent to fill, and I feel really good about what I can see going forward. And then the rest is based on consumer demand. And I think Matt talked about there are some things on the back half of this year that we have to plan for 2 different vectors on, and I know our teams will be ready."

It's a little bit about everything you just mentioned, in fact. And so, in other words, there are multiple ways in which employees can, in many cases, opt in to gaining further certifications and skills. Sometimes that looks like within the 4 walls of the store, I might opt in to garnering more skills in home theater and computing. I might opt in to garnering more skills around services, therefore, I am more flexible throughout the store. In some cases, that might also mean I am willing to spend some of my time doing fulfillment work. Fulfilling on car side -- curbside, excuse me, orders or packing inventory in the back out of some of those ship-from-store locations. So I may add those skills, which might add more hours and more flexibility.
And then there are some new digital experiences that we are leveraging our associates for. I might opt in to being able to answer calls from a national call queue. While I'm on my shift, it's not that busy, and I can pick up a customer's question via call or I might opt in to being more of an expert that's virtual, that can help you with whatever your question is in a virtual connection through our app. All of those are different ways in which we're reskilling. And then you can imagine, on top of that, there might flexibility to go work in a supply chain location or there might be flexibility to train myself into more of a technology job and be able to do that remotely.
And so in all of those different vectors, we are actually starting to create training modules and create opportunities for our employees, not just for us to use them flexibly, but for them to flexibly opt in to different roles and different hours in a way that might meet their lives with a little bit more flexibility and progress their careers, frankly."

During the fourth quarter, our teams across the company delivered an exceptional customer experience in a safe environment.

During the fourth quarter, our teams across the company delivered an exceptional customer experience in a safe environment. They showed amazing flexibility and execution, managing extraordinary volume in a dynamic situation, and they strive every day to create safe shopping experiences often in the face of pandemic fatigue. As a result, today, we are reporting strong Q4 financial results, which include comparable sales growth of 12.6% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 20%.
We continued to leverage our unique capabilities, including our supply chain expertise, flexible store operating model and ability to shift quickly to digital to meet the ongoing elevated demand for stay-at-home products and services. Online sales grew almost 90% to a record $6.7 billion and made up 43% of our total Domestic sales. Our stores played a pivotal role in the fulfillment of these sales as almost 2/3 of our online revenue was either picked up in-store or curbside, shipped from a store or delivered by a store employee. 
The percent of online sales picked up by customers at our stores was 48%, representing a 90% increase in volume. Ship-to-home volume was up 38%. And even with that increase in volume, we were able to accelerate the delivery speed to our customers on a year-over-year basis by strategically using our partners, our stores and our employee delivery. For additional context, same-day shipping volume was up 376%, and our employees delivered more than 1 million units.  From a product category perspective, the biggest contributors to the strong comp sales growth in the quarter were computing, appliances, gaming, virtual reality and home theater.
As you recall, this year, we started holiday promotions in October, which is in our third quarter. We started these events early and spread them over the course of several weeks to help avoid overly crowded days in our stores in order to create a safer shopping experience. These efforts can manage the traffic flow into our stores proved effective and evened out some of the peaks and valleys through the holiday season. As planned, it also resulted in some holiday sales being pulled into Q3. After reaching 33% comp growth in October, our growth rate moderated as we lapped last year's November and December holiday sales before accelerating again in January due to the ongoing elevated stay-at-home demand boosted by government stimulus actions. That sales growth momentum we saw in January has largely continued into February.
As a result of both the successful early holiday sales and the product availability issues the industry has been seeing all year, we continued to experience product availability constraints during the fourth quarter, which we believe moderated our holiday sales, particularly in large appliances, computing and televisions. In addition, demand for the new gaming consoles far outstrip supply across the industry as was well documented. Our teams work closely and effectively with our vendors to bring in as much inventory as possible, and inventory positions improved through the quarter.
As I step back and reflect upon the whole year, it was truly a year like no other. In addition to an international pandemic, there was social unrest across the nation and numerous natural disasters. I am proud of and inspired by the way our teams have navigated the challenges and what they have accomplished. We saw remarkable customer demand and delivered outstanding execution that led to a very strong financial results. For the year, we delivered comparable sales growth of 9.7% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 30%. We drove record free cash flow of $4.2 billion and ended the year with $5.5 billion in cash and short-term investments.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have responded to the impacts of it with a focus on safety and helping customers get the products they need to work, learn, cook, entertain and communicate at home. We provided customers with multiple options for how, when and where they shop with us to ensure we met their definition of safe retailing, and customers noticed. The percent of customers surveyed who said we made them feel safe while they were in our stores and while we were in their homes was consistently above 97% throughout the year.
To best serve our customers during the pandemic, we had to be innovative and flexible. Early in the year, we quickly rolled out enhanced curbside pickup across our stores to provide our customers convenience when we made the difficult decision to close our stores in March. In May, we developed an in-store appointment model that provided our customers with an option to shop in our stores as we prepare to open stores back up to customer shopping. We developed solutions like virtual consultations with advisers and video chats with our store associates.
In addition, we made significant improvements to the functionality and customer experience of our app to provide access to shopping, support and fulfillment. This served not only new users of the app but also increased levels of customer engagement with the app. In Q4, first-time launches of the app were up almost 80%, and the average number of app visits per unique user were up 34%.
During the year, we also increased our investment in support of our employees. Early on in the pandemic, we continued to pay employees who weren't working for a full month after we closed our stores to customer shopping. We paid hourly appreciation pay for those who are working on the front lines and established multiple hardship funds for anyone impacted physically, emotionally or financially by COVID. We provided enhanced benefits that included 100% coverage of COVID-related health care expenses, expanded caregiver leave, additional support for backup childcare, tutoring reimbursement and access to physical and mental health virtual visits.
Including our estimates for fiscal '22, we will have invested more than $75 million on enhancements to our structural employee benefits over a 3- year period. In addition to enhanced benefits, starting in August, we raised the starting minimum wage to $15 per hour for all our employees, which brought our average hourly wage for hourly employees up to $17.67. To show our appreciation for their hard work over the past year and in recognition of their ongoing efforts in the face of pandemic fatigue, we are paying employees an additional cash gratitude bonus. In the next few weeks, all hourly U.S. employees will receive $500 as full time and $200 as part-time or occasional seasonal.
In addition, to help keep employees and customers safe, we are encouraging all employees to get COVID vaccinations as they are available by providing them with paid time off when they receive the vaccine and providing them absence time to be used in the event they develop side effects that warrant they're needing to stay home and rest after receiving the vaccination.
In all, the COVID-related decisions we have made since the beginning of the pandemic to support our employees totaled more than $350 million. This includes paying employees while they weren't working during store closures, appreciation pay, guaranteed pay, bonuses, vaccination support and hardship funds.
We've also deepened our commitment to community. Last year, we made a $40 million donation to the Best Buy Foundation to accelerate the progress toward our goal to reach 100 Teen Tech Centers across the U.S., and we committed to making systemic permanent changes that address social injustices to improve our company and our communities. We also signed The Climate Pledge, committing to be carbon neutral across our operations by 2040, a decade earlier than our previous goal of 2050. We were honored to be recognized for our efforts by Barron's earlier this month when we were named to the top of their most sustainable public companies list. The list rated the 1,000 largest public companies on 5 key stakeholder categories: shareholders, employees, customers, community and planet.
Notably, Best Buy was also called out as the company with the leading COVID response, citing our efforts to maintain employee and customer safety, help employees experiencing hardship and continue to meet the technology needs of customers. This is the fourth time we have been in the top 5 and the second time we have been in the #1 position.
As we think about our strategy moving forward, many of the themes we discussed at our 2019 investor update came to life in a very accelerated way last year. It is important to reiterate the following 3 concepts we believe to be permanent and structural implications of the pandemic that are shaping our strategic priorities. 
One, customer shopping behavior will be permanently changed in a way that is even more digital and puts customers entirely in control to shop how they want. Our strategy is to embrace that reality and to lead, not follow. It is too early to know exactly how much of our sales and customer shopping activity will be via digital channels over time. But as I mentioned earlier, online sales were up 43% of our domestic -- online sales were 43% of our domestic sales in fiscal '21, and we are planning for the mix to be approximately 40% in fiscal '22. That compares to 19% in fiscal '20 and only 5% just 10 years ago.
Two, our workforce will need to evolve in a way that meets the needs of customers while providing more flexible opportunities for our employees. And three, technology is playing an even more crucial role in people's lives. And as a result, our purpose to enrich lives through technology has never been more important. We play a vital role in bringing technology to life for both our customers and our vendor partners. These concepts are extensive and interdependent, and we are, as quickly as possible, both implementing change today and assessing future implications across our entire business, including how we evolve our stores and labor models and how we spend our investment dollars.
Our research indicates our customers look to Best Buy to serve 4 shopping needs: inspiration, research, convenience and support. And customers expect to be able to seamlessly interact with physical and digital channels. We must be ready to serve all of these needs at all times in all channels. We are building all of our experiences around meeting these needs as we move from being a big-box retailer with a strong omnichannel presence to an omnichannel retailer with a large store footprint for support and fulfillment.
Fundamentally, when you're looking for help and want to be inspired, the best experience will always be in our stores, talking to one of our amazing employees. The proximity to a physical store still matters to many customers. And our stores serve an important role in fulfillment and support and also provide awareness and convenience that are critical to retaining and growing sales. But we also know that customer shopping behaviors are changing, and we need to evolve with them.
In the fourth quarter, the pandemic drove a roughly 15% reduction in traffic to our stores, including both in-store shoppers and customers picking up online orders via in-store or curbside. And while some traffic will likely shift back to our store channel in fiscal '22, like many retailers, we believe much of what we saw last year will be permanent. Our employees and the stores will always be central to our strategy. We are simply looking at how we can best deploy our team and our physical assets to meet customer expectations and needs.
As we discussed last quarter, we are taking the opportunity to test and pilot a range of models and initiatives in order to chart the best path forward. We must balance the urgency for change with the need to learn and understand how customer shopping behavior is changing. We are already gathering learnings and iterating on our initiative. An example is our ship-from-store hub pilot that we've talked about for the past few quarters. During Q4, we used 340 stores or roughly 35% of our store locations to handle about 70% of our total ship-from-store units. We believe that we can achieve similar results, consolidating volume using a smaller group of stores as hubs over time.
In addition, in a subset of these stores, we plan to reduce the sales floor square footage and install warehouse-grade packaging, station equipment and supplies. As a result, we expect to drive both efficiency and effectiveness. We also continue to pilot reduced selling square footage and alternative layouts in a number of stores in the Minneapolis market.
As you would expect, pandemic or not, we're constantly looking at our store network, responding to customer and demographic shifts just as any retailer does. We will continue our normal review process, which involves putting stores through rigorous evaluations as their leases come up for renewal.
As we look to the near term, there will be higher thresholds on renewing leases as we evaluate the role each store plays in its market, the investments required to meet our customer needs and the expected return based on a new retail landscape. For context, we have approximately 450 leases coming up for renewal in the next 3 years or an average of 150 each year. As part of the review process, we have closed approximately 20 large-format locations each of the past 2 years and expect to close a higher number this year. We have also been reducing the length of our average lease term, which will continue to provide us flexibility.
In addition to our physical stores, our operating model needs to evolve to meet our customers' changing shopping behaviors that have been accelerated by the pandemic. The sudden and lasting shift customers have made to shopping more regularly and seamlessly across all of our channels has forced us to look at how we get our work done. Our response to the pandemic has shown our ability to be successful when broadening the scope of responsibility of our associates and has highlighted the importance of ongoing flexibility and adaptability. This, too, was a hypothesis we shared at our 2019 investor update and was massively accelerated by customer shopping behavior changes.
Since the pandemic began, our overall head count has been going through a transformation. As a reminder, we made the difficult decision to furlough approximately 51,000 retail employees due to store closures last April. By August, we had brought back about 2/3 of them. As we approach the fourth quarter, any remaining employees that had been on furlough were asked to return to work as seasonal employees for the holidays. As employees who are on furlough decided not to come back and other employees left as a result of attrition, we have not been backfilling positions as we consider how to adjust our operations to better meet our customers' needs going forward. As a result, we entered fiscal '21 with 123,000 employees across the entire organization, and we are leaving the year with about 102,000 team members, a decline of roughly 21,000 or 17%.
Even though head count across the enterprise has been declining primarily due to this attrition, we still have had to make difficult decisions. Earlier this month, one of those decisions was to adjust the mix of full-time and part-time employees at each of our store locations. At an aggregate level, this was due to having too many full-time and not enough part-time employees. As part of the process, part-time roles were offered to many of the displaced full-time employees who are interested and qualified. The end result was that we laid off and provided severance to approximately 5,000 in place, the majority of which were full time. At the same time, we are adding approximately 2,000 additional part-time positions. Decisions like these are never easy or taken lightly, but they position us to be more responsive and flexible as we continue to refine our operating model going forward in response to the incredibly rapid change in how customers want to shop with us.
It is important to add that we are intent on reskilling and retraining employees wherever possible so we can retain our people and employees can flexibly work across all our channels. Our vision of a flexible workforce is about more than having our associates gain the knowledge and skills to be effective in more areas within the traditional store setting. It expands to include the type of interactions that have become even more relevant in a digital shopping environment. Over the past year, thousands of employees who possess unique skills were leveraged across multiple areas of our business like virtual sales, chat, phone and remote support. In addition, we are investing in people and hiring in areas like supply chain, small parcel delivery, customer care and technology in support of our long-term strategy.
As the last year has demonstrated, technology is playing an even more crucial role in people's lives. We are excited about the technology trends and innovation we see over the next several years. As expected, there has been immense innovation in the consumer health category. The fitness industry has pivoted quickly, and the category is exploding as consumers want to stay fit at home and outfit home gyms. Beyond the connected equipment, customers now have the ability to integrate data for different types of activities like rowing, biking and running into any number of wearable devices to measure their overall fitness and progress more seamlessly. There is also innovation around more chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease with wearables that monitor insulin levels and heart rates. Hearing aids is another category going through innovation, and we are excited to help our customers with hearing needs both online and in our stores.
The proliferation of health-related devices has become so great. We created a health and wellness digital shopping experience accessible directly from the homepage of our website. Of course, there's an innovation curve in products that help people work at home as well.  There is an influx of products around all aspects from high-tech chairs to monitors to standing desks. These are products that were not even on vendor road maps before the pandemic and now truly complete the working-at-home experience. 
Access to 5G is still growing as networks are rolling out across cities. As we move into next year and the year after, it will be more mainstream and accessible for all of us. We are excited about the introduction of new products over time that will leverage the speed and capabilities of 5G beyond the mobile phone.  Of course, our customers expect Best Buy to be there to help inspire and support all their technology. Our consultation program continues to be an important differentiator, and advisers are inspiring technology solutions via customer consultations happening in homes, digitally, in stores and via chat and phone. We are also leveraging our consultation program with our partners. For example, customers can schedule an appointment with one of our advisers while shopping on samsung.com.
On the support side, our total tech support program continues to receive very strong customer ratings and is a unique program that we believe only we can offer. Membership growth recovered after we opened our stores more broadly. We continue to see significant opportunity over time to evolve all of our many customer memberships, which also includes our millions of My Best Buy customers. We purposefully pressed pause on this initiative at the start of the pandemic and are planning to roll out a pilot in the next few months that will leverage our learnings from the material evolution of customer shopping behavior over the past year.
I'd also like to update you on our health business more broadly. The pandemic has only served to underscore our purpose and strategy. The adoption of virtual care and telehealth by patients and physicians has been greatly accelerated by COVID-19 and is expected to continue to grow. We see significant opportunity over the long term to make the experience much better for both patients and physicians by providing an integrated seamless technology solution that is easy to use. To that end, our Best Buy health strategy focuses on 3 areas that start with our strength in retail and build to connecting patients and physicians.
The first focus area is the consumer health category I spoke about a little earlier. These products are for customers who want to be healthier, sleep better or need to monitor a chronic condition like diabetes or heart disease, for example.
The second area is active aging, which includes device-based emergency response and other services for Generation A, who wish to continue to live independently in their homes. Active aging builds on the GreatCall, CST and BioSensics acquisitions.
The third focus area is virtual care and includes digital health caring center services that connect patients and physicians to enable virtual care and remote patient monitoring. We provide personal emergency response, remote patient monitoring and care counseling services to payers serving Medicare Advantage and Medicaid populations. And we will expand these services to help people monitor their chronic disease and connect to their physician.
Our differentiated approach combines Best Buy's in-home and care counseling services with digital health. By digital health, we mean curated monitoring devices packaged with the consumer in mind, with a platform to distribute, activate and test the devices to ensure the consumer can use them and connect to their physician.
In fiscal '22, we plan to expand the consumer health product assortment and additional devices and services to our active aging business and add new remote patient monitoring offerings and a new technology platform in virtual care. In order to do this, we plan to invest in people, product development and the ongoing development of our health technology platform in our data, analytics and intelligence engines.
In addition to the investments in our health strategy, our investments in technology and automation will be important aspects in defining how our model continues to evolve in the future. As has been our practice for the past 8 years, we have continued our commitment to leverage cost reductions and efficiencies to help offset investments and pressures. Our current target set in 2019 is to achieve an additional $1 billion in annualized cost reductions and efficiencies by the end of fiscal '25. We achieved approximately $340 million toward our new goal during fiscal '21, taking our total to $500 million toward this goal.
In summary, during fiscal '21, we managed through the challenging environment in a way that allowed us to accelerate many aspects of our strategy to deliver on our purpose and thrive in a new and forever changed environment. Our teams collectively changed the way we do business at a pace we never imagined, and I must reiterate how proud I am of their perseverance and commitment. As a result, we advanced our 5-year plan both strategically and financially much further than we expected.
While we are ahead of plan in several strategic areas, the disruption of the pandemic has also impacted other strategic initiatives. For example, while our health business has proven to be even more strategically relevant to our mission, the pandemic certainly disrupted the progress and the path forward will take time. We also still have meaningful opportunity to evolve our membership and services models to drive loyalty. In addition, we will need to invest in our future as we proactively evolve all the channels of our business to deliver amazing customer experiences in a world where half of the revenue might be initiated online.
All that being said, we see a path that leads to margin expansion beyond what we articulated at our last investor update. In fiscal '22, we expect our operating income rate to be lower than fiscal '21's 5.8% operating income rate as we continue to navigate and cycle impacts of the pandemic while investing in our strategy, as Matt will discuss. We are still in the midst of the pandemic. So we are not updating with a specific metric, but we see long-term non-GAAP operating income rate that is beyond the 5% fiscal '25 target we introduced in September 2019.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Matt for details on our results and insights on our outlook for fiscal '22."

Our financial results for the year far surpassed what we thought was possible entering the year. We are leading fiscal '21 with an even healthier balance sheet than we -- than when we started the year and saw our non-GAAP operating income rate expand 90 basis points versus the prior year. The rate expansion was possible due to both our ability to capitalize on the elevated demand for technology and by reducing spend early in the year in certain discretionary areas beyond the unknown -- based on the unknown situation we were facing at the beginning of the pandemic. We also accelerated strategies that allowed us to begin adjusting our cost structure to what we believe will be a permanent shift in how customers want to shop. Despite the difficult decisions we made, throughout the year, we remain committed on investing in areas we felt were most crucial to delivering our future growth plans.
Let me now share more details specific to our fourth quarter. On Enterprise revenue of $16.9 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.48, an increase of 20% versus last year. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 6.9% increased 40 basis points. This rate expansion was driven by approximately 90 basis points of leverage from the higher sales volume on our SG&A, which was partially offset by a 60 basis point decline in our gross profit rate. In addition, a lower effective tax rate had an $0.08 favorable year-over-year impact on our non-GAAP diluted EPS. 
In our Domestic segment, revenue for the quarter increased 11% to $15.4 billion, an all-time high for revenue in a single quarter. Comparable sales growth of 12% was partially offset by the loss of revenue from stores that were permanently closed in the past year.
From a merchandising perspective, we had broad-based strength across most of our categories, with the largest drivers of comparable growth coming from computing, appliances, gaming, virtual reality and home theater. This growth was partially offset by declines in headphones and mobile phones.
Turning now to gross profit. The Domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate declined 50 basis points to 20.7%, primarily driven by supply chain costs associated with a higher mix of online revenue. In the fourth quarter, our online sales were 43% of our overall Domestic sales in the quarter compared to 25% last year. Although it was a smaller impact than the supply chain cost, our category mix was also a pressure this quarter. These items were partially offset by a promotional environment that was more favorable compared to last year. Our International non-GAAP gross profit rate decreased 180 basis points to 20.8%, primarily due to increased supply chain costs from a higher mix of online sales and a lower sales mix from the higher-margin services category.
Moving next to SG&A. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A increased 5% compared to last year and decreased 90 basis points as a percentage of revenue. As expected, the largest drivers of the expense increase versus last year were: one, higher incentive compensation for corporate and field employees of approximately $55 million; two, increased variable costs associated with higher sales volume, which included items such as credit card processing fees; and three, technology investments, which also include support of our health initiatives. These increased expenses were partially offset by lower store payroll expense.
Let me share some additional context on the increased expense from our technology investments. Technology has, and increasingly will be, the foundation of how we will operate and how we accelerate our strategy. This includes continued technology investments and capabilities to support our health initiatives, increasing and improving our digital interactions with customers, simplifying task in our stores and building upon our analytics to support decisions we make on a daily basis. We are also modernizing our systems and tools as well as utilizing more cloud-based solutions. For example, we are partnering with Microsoft to leverage its cloud to help power our health care offerings. In addition, we are transforming the structure of our technology teams by bringing more head count in-house versus using contract workers.
Let me next provide more context on $129 million in restructuring charges from this quarter, which also include a $13 million benefit within cost of sales. About $88 million of the charges related to changes in our Domestic segment to realign our organizational structure with our strategic priorities. The remaining $41 million is primarily related to our previously announced plans to exit operations in Mexico. We don't anticipate any additional material charges in Mexico in future quarters, and all of our store locations in Mexico will be closed by the end of Q1.
Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $5.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. At the end of Q4, our inventory balance was approximately 8% higher than last year's comparable period to support the current demand for technology. Approximately half of the year-over-year increase is related to inventory still in transit. Although trends have improved from earlier in the year, we are still experiencing constraints driven by the high demand in several of our key categories.
During fiscal '21, we returned $880 million to shareholders through $568 million in dividends and $312 million in share repurchases. We resumed share repurchases during the fourth quarter after suspending activity last March. This morning, we announced a 27% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.70 per share. We also announced our plans to spend at least $2 billion on share repurchases in fiscal '22. In addition, our Board of Directors approved a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization replacing the existing authorization dated February 2019, which had a $1.7 billion in repurchases remaining at the end of fiscal '21.
As we look to our fiscal '22, we are not providing our traditional guidance, but I would like to share our planning assumptions as we enter the year. As we start fiscal '22, the demand for technology remains at elevated levels, and the sales growth momentum we saw in January has continued through the first 3 weeks of February. The uncertainty around the administration of the COVID vaccine and the subsequent impact to customer demand and shopping patterns makes it difficult to predict how sustainable these trends will be. Other factors to consider include government stimulus actions and the risk of continued high unemployment.
With that being said, we estimate fiscal '22 total comparable sales growth in the range of down 2% to up 1%. This range reflects a scenario in which customers resume or accelerate spend in areas that were slowed during the pandemic, such as travel and dining out in the back half of this year. Overall, we expect growth to be positive in the first half of the year and then negative in the back half as we lap strong comp growth in Q3 and Q4 of fiscal '21. We will update our expectations during the year, if needed, as there is more clarity to the various factors driving our outlook. Regardless, we anticipate revenue for fiscal '22 will be higher than what we would have expected to be at this time last year.
From a gross profit rate perspective, we are planning for a non-GAAP rate that is slightly below our fiscal '21 rate. We anticipate more promotional pressure than we experienced this past year as inventory becomes more available and competition likely increases. As Corie mentioned, we are planning for online sales to represent approximately 40% of our Domestic sales in fiscal '22, which is only slightly lower than our mix in fiscal '21. As a result, supply chain-related costs are not expected to have a material impact on our rate compared to the prior year.
From an SG&A standpoint, we're expecting dollars to increase as a percentage in the low single-digit range. There are a number of factors driving the expected increase. First, we expect our SG&A increase -- expense to increase approximately $100 million on a year-over-year basis as we lap COVID-related decisions we made last year to preserve liquidity. This includes returning to more normalized spend on items such as 401(k) company match, advertising spend, store overhead items such as maintenance. This $100 million increase includes the benefit of lapping the $40 million donation to the Best Buy Foundation we made in Q3 of fiscal '21.
Second, we plan to increase our investments in depreciation -- and depreciation in support of technology and our health initiatives by approximately $150 million compared to fiscal '21. Third, we expect store payroll costs to be lower compared to fiscal '21, even after including the impact of lapping $81 million of employee retention credits from the CARES Act we received in the first half of fiscal '21. There are clearly other puts and takes that we will manage through, some that will be more impactful in 1 quarter versus the next, but the previous items are the key drivers of how we are viewing the full year.
Based on the drivers I just outlined, our expectation is for our operating income rate to decline on a year-over-year basis, which is primarily a result of our increased investments in technology and in support of our health initiatives as well as the impact of lapping the temporary actions from fiscal '21 I just shared. In relation to capital expenditures, we expect to spend approximately $750 million to $850 million during fiscal '22 compared to $713 million in fiscal '21.
Now I will provide some color on Q1. We expect comparable sales to be approximately 20%. As a reminder, in Q1 of last year, we closed all of our stores to customer shopping and moved to curbside service only for the last 7 weeks of the quarter. We anticipate our gross profit rate will be slightly lower than last year due to more promotional environment and increased delivery expense. As a reminder, we suspended in-home services for about 5 weeks during last year's Q1.
We expect SG&A dollars to increase by approximately 10%. This increase is primarily related to incentive compensation as we suspended all expense during Q1 of last year for corporate and field employees as well as the gratitude- and vaccination-related bonuses that Corie discussed. These items combined are expected to result in more than $100 million in additional expense versus last year. In addition, we anticipate increased expense from our investments in technology and health as well as higher variable expense associated with expected growth.
I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

I think we strongly believe our competitive advantage is our ability to provide both support and advice across all the channel -- any channel that anyone wants to shop in. And obviously, there are different challenges and different modes of doing that across the different channels. But regardless, we know our employee -- or our customers, excuse me, are looking for both that advice and that support across channels. And we've been investing in our capabilities and technology in order to deliver that.
We've also talked about the fact that what our customers expect from us from a support perspective has changed over time. And it's less about that break-fix support, although that's still important, and we need to be there when that happens. And it's much more about supporting your technology seamlessly across your devices. And it's more about is my printer staying on my network or is my content streaming the way that I want it to. And hence, the reason we've been migrating to a model that looks more like total tech support, which provides you obviously coverage for all the technology devices in your home, regardless of where you bought them.
And so it's not just about now -- for your question specifically, digitally, it's not just about the buying experience. It's actually about using digital across all aspects of the shopping experience. And so we have been working, and we are continuing to work, and as you think about the investments that Matt mentioned in technology, we're investing in things like video chats, virtual consultations, adding digital checkout in the app. This is still all empowered by our amazing Blue Shirts who are actually creating these experiences. We're just creating them digitally.
And so while the gross margin rate has been lower online, over time, it's constantly improving because we're constantly improving that customer experience. And we are seeing increases in our ability to transact total tech support or digital consultations. We're seeing more in-home adviser leads online as an example. So I think it's hard to replace that expertise and support you get by visiting our stores, but we are seeing customers getting more comfortable with experiencing some of those things online. And it's less about exactly which channels that's happening and more about how to in every channel we interact with you. We're constantly trying to improve that experience. So to your point and your question, it does become more natural to make these buying decisions in a digital environment."

I think fundamentally, if we step all the way back, we believe the role of technology in people's lives is only intensified as a result of the pandemic. And the proliferation of devices in people's lives will continue to support advancement as innovation continues. So -- and the role we play in that is extremely important and even stronger than it was before. And so as we look at next year and we think about it being probably a tale of 2 halves with growth in the first and then declines in the latter, I think we still see opportunity for innovation to keep fundamentally technology important in people's lives.
Clearly, at a micro level there, you could imagine some categories could see a little bit of pull at any given point. But there's also an element of personal savings rates being so elevated now. Right now, they're about 14%, which is twice what they were going into the pandemic. So there are a lot of puts and takes in the year. Fundamentally, the guide for next year really incorporates a view that as we get towards maybe the middle of the year, we start to see that shifting of consumer behavior back to places that were a little muted as the pandemic hit. So we wouldn't characterize it as a pullback but just a changing how people deciding to use their wallet."

There's also periods of time where we had some -- our stores closed and we did -- we weren't able to offer all of our services for installations and delivery. There's a little bit of pressure there.
In addition, I think with online mix being assumed at 40% versus 43% this last year, is that a meaningful difference in terms of the impact of supply chain costs. So that's why we don't think supply chain costs fundamentally are much of a benefit as you start to move into next year, as you are assuming the same amount of sales between the fundamentally  2 years. I also think within there, you've got a little bit of promotional favorability It was offset by a little bit of category mix changes that will happen throughout the year. So fundamentally, it's that assumption that online mix will stay pretty much the same."

We feel better about our inventory position now versus the last 4 calls we've had. So I'll start with that because we've finally gotten back into better stock. That said, we still have constraints in parts of our business that we don't think will solve themselves in the first half of this year. Gaming is a good example. We have yet to put the new generation of gaming consoles into our stores. We anticipate to do that soon, but we haven't done that because there just hasn't been enough inventory to meet demand. So those are some of the things that, pandemic aside, it would have likely been constrained and is only more heightened based on people wanting to dramatically change their at-home experiences.
Other categories like printing have been constrained since the start of pandemic and there's some challenges in that industry at large getting back into a better inventory position. I think in most some of the bigger categories around computing and home theater, we're going through some natural time transitions. This would be now our second home theater transition, as an example, during a pandemic. And I think our vendors are getting smarter about the timing of new model introductions and then what do they use for demand generation.
So I can't give you a good window as to what our inventory will look like 12 months from now. I feel we're going to be in better stock overall, but we'll still have a handful of constraints that we have to navigate through. I think the one thing our teams really do well, and I know that you know this, but we work so far upstream with all of our partners with collaborative forecasting, demand generation, even feature sets on models, which can actually help us give us -- help give our vendors the best forecast possible. So I always look at our forecast accuracy and our percent to fill, and I feel really good about what I can see going forward. And then the rest is based on consumer demand. And I think Matt talked about there are some things on the back half of this year that we have to plan for 2 different vectors on, and I know our teams will be ready."

It's a little bit about everything you just mentioned, in fact. And so in other words, there are multiple ways in which employees can, in many cases, opt in to gaining further certifications and skills. Sometimes that looks like within the 4 walls of the store, I might opt in to garnering more skills in home theater and computing. I might opt in to garnering more skills around services, therefore, I am more flexible throughout the store. In some cases, that might also mean I am willing to spend some of my time doing fulfillment work, fulfilling on car side -- curbside, excuse me, orders or packing inventory in the back out of some of those ship-from-store locations. So I may add those skills, which might add more hours and more flexibility.
And then there are some new digital experiences that we are leveraging our associates for. I might opt in to being able to answer calls from a national call queue. While I'm on my shift, it's not that busy, and I can pick up a customer's question via call, or I might opt in to being more of an expert that's virtual that can help you with whatever your question is in a virtual connection through our app. All of those are different ways in which we're reskilling. And then you can imagine, on top of that, there might flexibility to go work in a supply chain location, or there might be flexibility to train myself into more of a technology job and be able to do that remotely.
And so in all of those different vectors, we are actually starting to create training modules and create opportunities for our employees not just for us to use them flexibly but for them to flexibly opt in to different roles and different hours in a way that might meet their lives with a little bit more flexibility and progress their careers, frankly."

During the fourth quarter, our teams across the company delivered an exceptional customer experience in a safe environment. They showed amazing flexibility and execution, managing extraordinary volume in a dynamic situation, and they strive every day to create safe shopping experiences often in the face of pandemic fatigue. As a result, today, we are reporting strong Q4 financial results, which include comparable sales growth of 12.6% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 20%.
We continued to leverage our unique capabilities, including our supply chain expertise, flexible store operating model and ability to shift quickly to digital to meet the ongoing elevated demand for stay-at-home products and services. Online sales grew almost 90% to a record $6.7 billion and made up 43% of our total Domestic sales. Our stores played a pivotal role in the fulfillment of these sales as almost 2/3 of our online revenue was either picked up in-store or curbside, shipped from a store or delivered by a store employee. 
The percent of online sales picked up by customers at our stores was 48%, representing a 90% increase in volume. Ship-to-home volume was up 38%. And even with that increase in volume, we were able to accelerate the delivery speed to our customers on a year-over-year basis by strategically using our partners, our stores and our employee delivery. For additional context, same-day shipping volume was up 376%, and our employees delivered more than 1 million units.  From a product category perspective, the biggest contributors to the strong comp sales growth in the quarter were computing, appliances, gaming, virtual reality and home theater.
As you recall, this year, we started holiday promotions in October, which is in our third quarter. We started these events early and spread them over the course of several weeks to help avoid overly crowded days in our stores in order to create a safer shopping experience. These efforts can manage the traffic flow into our stores proved effective and evened out some of the peaks and valleys through the holiday season. As planned, it also resulted in some holiday sales being pulled into Q3. After reaching 33% comp growth in October, our growth rate moderated as we lapped last year's November and December holiday sales before accelerating again in January due to the ongoing elevated stay-at-home demand boosted by government stimulus actions. That sales growth momentum we saw in January has largely continued into February.
As a result of both the successful early holiday sales and the product availability issues the industry has been seeing all year, we continued to experience product availability constraints during the fourth quarter, which we believe moderated our holiday sales, particularly in large appliances, computing and televisions. In addition, demand for the new gaming consoles far outstrip supply across the industry as was well documented. Our teams work closely and effectively with our vendors to bring in as much inventory as possible, and inventory positions improved through the quarter.
As I step back and reflect upon the whole year, it was truly a year like no other. In addition to an international pandemic, there was social unrest across the nation and numerous natural disasters. I am proud of and inspired by the way our teams have navigated the challenges and what they have accomplished. We saw remarkable customer demand and delivered outstanding execution that led to a very strong financial results. For the year, we delivered comparable sales growth of 9.7% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 30%. We drove record free cash flow of $4.2 billion and ended the year with $5.5 billion in cash and short-term investments.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have responded to the impacts of it with a focus on safety and helping customers get the products they need to work, learn, cook, entertain and communicate at home. We provided customers with multiple options for how, when and where they shop with us to ensure we met their definition of safe retailing, and customers noticed. The percent of customers surveyed who said we made them feel safe while they were in our stores and while we were in their homes was consistently above 97% throughout the year.
To best serve our customers during the pandemic, we had to be innovative and flexible. Early in the year, we quickly rolled out enhanced curbside pickup across our stores to provide our customers convenience when we made the difficult decision to close our stores in March. In May, we developed an in-store appointment model that provided our customers with an option to shop in our stores as we prepare to open stores back up to customer shopping. We developed solutions like virtual consultations with advisers and video chats with our store associates.
In addition, we made significant improvements to the functionality and customer experience of our app to provide access to shopping, support and fulfillment. This served not only new users of the app but also increased levels of customer engagement with the app. In Q4, first-time launches of the app were up almost 80%, and the average number of app visits per unique user were up 34%.
During the year, we also increased our investment in support of our employees. Early on in the pandemic, we continued to pay employees who weren't working for a full month after we closed our stores to customer shopping. We paid hourly appreciation pay for those who are working on the front lines and established multiple hardship funds for anyone impacted physically, emotionally or financially by COVID. We provided enhanced benefits that included 100% coverage of COVID-related health care expenses, expanded caregiver leave, additional support for backup childcare, tutoring reimbursement and access to physical and mental health virtual visits.
Including our estimates for fiscal '22, we will have invested more than $75 million on enhancements to our structural employee benefits over a 3- year period. In addition to enhanced benefits, starting in August, we raised the starting minimum wage to $15 per hour for all our employees, which brought our average hourly wage for hourly employees up to $17.67. To show our appreciation for their hard work over the past year and in recognition of their ongoing efforts in the face of pandemic fatigue, we are paying employees an additional cash gratitude bonus. In the next few weeks, all hourly U.S. employees will receive $500 as full time and $200 as part-time or occasional seasonal.
In addition, to help keep employees and customers safe, we are encouraging all employees to get COVID vaccinations as they are available by providing them with paid time off when they receive the vaccine and providing them absence time to be used in the event they develop side effects that warrant they're needing to stay home and rest after receiving the vaccination.
In all, the COVID-related decisions we have made since the beginning of the pandemic to support our employees totaled more than $350 million. This includes paying employees while they weren't working during store closures, appreciation pay, guaranteed pay, bonuses, vaccination support and hardship funds.
We've also deepened our commitment to community. Last year, we made a $40 million donation to the Best Buy Foundation to accelerate the progress toward our goal to reach 100 Teen Tech Centers across the U.S., and we committed to making systemic permanent changes that address social injustices to improve our company and our communities. We also signed The Climate Pledge, committing to be carbon neutral across our operations by 2040, a decade earlier than our previous goal of 2050. We were honored to be recognized for our efforts by Barron's earlier this month when we were named to the top of their most sustainable public companies list. The list rated the 1,000 largest public companies on 5 key stakeholder categories: shareholders, employees, customers, community and planet.
Notably, Best Buy was also called out as the company with the leading COVID response, citing our efforts to maintain employee and customer safety, help employees experiencing hardship and continue to meet the technology needs of customers. This is the fourth time we have been in the top 5 and the second time we have been in the #1 position.
As we think about our strategy moving forward, many of the themes we discussed at our 2019 investor update came to life in a very accelerated way last year. It is important to reiterate the following 3 concepts we believe to be permanent and structural implications of the pandemic that are shaping our strategic priorities. 
One, customer shopping behavior will be permanently changed in a way that is even more digital and puts customers entirely in control to shop how they want. Our strategy is to embrace that reality and to lead, not follow. It is too early to know exactly how much of our sales and customer shopping activity will be via digital channels over time. But as I mentioned earlier, online sales were up 43% of our domestic -- online sales were 43% of our domestic sales in fiscal '21, and we are planning for the mix to be approximately 40% in fiscal '22. That compares to 19% in fiscal '20 and only 5% just 10 years ago.
Two, our workforce will need to evolve in a way that meets the needs of customers while providing more flexible opportunities for our employees. And three, technology is playing an even more crucial role in people's lives. And as a result, our purpose to enrich lives through technology has never been more important. We play a vital role in bringing technology to life for both our customers and our vendor partners. These concepts are extensive and interdependent, and we are, as quickly as possible, both implementing change today and assessing future implications across our entire business, including how we evolve our stores and labor models and how we spend our investment dollars.
Our research indicates our customers look to Best Buy to serve 4 shopping needs: inspiration, research, convenience and support. And customers expect to be able to seamlessly interact with physical and digital channels. We must be ready to serve all of these needs at all times in all channels. We are building all of our experiences around meeting these needs as we move from being a big-box retailer with a strong omnichannel presence to an omnichannel retailer with a large store footprint for support and fulfillment.
Fundamentally, when you're looking for help and want to be inspired, the best experience will always be in our stores, talking to one of our amazing employees. The proximity to a physical store still matters to many customers. And our stores serve an important role in fulfillment and support and also provide awareness and convenience that are critical to retaining and growing sales. But we also know that customer shopping behaviors are changing, and we need to evolve with them.
In the fourth quarter, the pandemic drove a roughly 15% reduction in traffic to our stores, including both in-store shoppers and customers picking up online orders via in-store or curbside. And while some traffic will likely shift back to our store channel in fiscal '22, like many retailers, we believe much of what we saw last year will be permanent. Our employees and the stores will always be central to our strategy. We are simply looking at how we can best deploy our team and our physical assets to meet customer expectations and needs.
As we discussed last quarter, we are taking the opportunity to test and pilot a range of models and initiatives in order to chart the best path forward. We must balance the urgency for change with the need to learn and understand how customer shopping behavior is changing. We are already gathering learnings and iterating on our initiative. An example is our ship-from-store hub pilot that we've talked about for the past few quarters. During Q4, we used 340 stores or roughly 35% of our store locations to handle about 70% of our total ship-from-store units. We believe that we can achieve similar results, consolidating volume using a smaller group of stores as hubs over time.
In addition, in a subset of these stores, we plan to reduce the sales floor square footage and install warehouse-grade packaging, station equipment and supplies. As a result, we expect to drive both efficiency and effectiveness. We also continue to pilot reduced selling square footage and alternative layouts in a number of stores in the Minneapolis market.
As you would expect, pandemic or not, we're constantly looking at our store network, responding to customer and demographic shifts just as any retailer does. We will continue our normal review process, which involves putting stores through rigorous evaluations as their leases come up for renewal.
As we look to the near term, there will be higher thresholds on renewing leases as we evaluate the role each store plays in its market, the investments required to meet our customer needs and the expected return based on a new retail landscape. For context, we have approximately 450 leases coming up for renewal in the next 3 years or an average of 150 each year. As part of the review process, we have closed approximately 20 large-format locations each of the past 2 years and expect to close a higher number this year. We have also been reducing the length of our average lease term, which will continue to provide us flexibility.
In addition to our physical stores, our operating model needs to evolve to meet our customers' changing shopping behaviors that have been accelerated by the pandemic. The sudden and lasting shift customers have made to shopping more regularly and seamlessly across all of our channels has forced us to look at how we get our work done. Our response to the pandemic has shown our ability to be successful when broadening the scope of responsibility of our associates and has highlighted the importance of ongoing flexibility and adaptability. This, too, was a hypothesis we shared at our 2019 investor update and was massively accelerated by customer shopping behavior changes.
Since the pandemic began, our overall head count has been going through a transformation. As a reminder, we made the difficult decision to furlough approximately 51,000 retail employees due to store closures last April. By August, we had brought back about 2/3 of them. As we approach the fourth quarter, any remaining employees that had been on furlough were asked to return to work as seasonal employees for the holidays. As employees who are on furlough decided not to come back and other employees left as a result of attrition, we have not been backfilling positions as we consider how to adjust our operations to better meet our customers' needs going forward. As a result, we entered fiscal '21 with 123,000 employees across the entire organization, and we are leaving the year with about 102,000 team members, a decline of roughly 21,000 or 17%.
Even though head count across the enterprise has been declining primarily due to this attrition, we still have had to make difficult decisions. Earlier this month, one of those decisions was to adjust the mix of full-time and part-time employees at each of our store locations. At an aggregate level, this was due to having too many full-time and not enough part-time employees. As part of the process, part-time roles were offered to many of the displaced full-time employees who are interested and qualified. The end result was that we laid off and provided severance to approximately 5,000 in place, the majority of which were full time. At the same time, we are adding approximately 2,000 additional part-time positions. Decisions like these are never easy or taken lightly, but they position us to be more responsive and flexible as we continue to refine our operating model going forward in response to the incredibly rapid change in how customers want to shop with us.
It is important to add that we are intent on reskilling and retraining employees wherever possible so we can retain our people and employees can flexibly work across all our channels. Our vision of a flexible workforce is about more than having our associates gain the knowledge and skills to be effective in more areas within the traditional store setting. It expands to include the type of interactions that have become even more relevant in a digital shopping environment. Over the past year, thousands of employees who possess unique skills were leveraged across multiple areas of our business like virtual sales, chat, phone and remote support. In addition, we are investing in people and hiring in areas like supply chain, small parcel delivery, customer care and technology in support of our long-term strategy.
As the last year has demonstrated, technology is playing an even more crucial role in people's lives. We are excited about the technology trends and innovation we see over the next several years. As expected, there has been immense innovation in the consumer health category. The fitness industry has pivoted quickly, and the category is exploding as consumers want to stay fit at home and outfit home gyms. Beyond the connected equipment, customers now have the ability to integrate data for different types of activities like rowing, biking and running into any number of wearable devices to measure their overall fitness and progress more seamlessly. There is also innovation around more chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease with wearables that monitor insulin levels and heart rates. Hearing aids is another category going through innovation, and we are excited to help our customers with hearing needs both online and in our stores.
The proliferation of health-related devices has become so great. We created a health and wellness digital shopping experience accessible directly from the homepage of our website. Of course, there's an innovation curve in products that help people work at home as well.  There is an influx of products around all aspects from high-tech chairs to monitors to standing desks. These are products that were not even on vendor road maps before the pandemic and now truly complete the working-at-home experience. 
Access to 5G is still growing as networks are rolling out across cities. As we move into next year and the year after, it will be more mainstream and accessible for all of us. We are excited about the introduction of new products over time that will leverage the speed and capabilities of 5G beyond the mobile phone.  Of course, our customers expect Best Buy to be there to help inspire and support all their technology. Our consultation program continues to be an important differentiator, and advisers are inspiring technology solutions via customer consultations happening in homes, digitally, in stores and via chat and phone. We are also leveraging our consultation program with our partners. For example, customers can schedule an appointment with one of our advisers while shopping on samsung.com.
On the support side, our total tech support program continues to receive very strong customer ratings and is a unique program that we believe only we can offer. Membership growth recovered after we opened our stores more broadly. We continue to see significant opportunity over time to evolve all of our many customer memberships, which also includes our millions of My Best Buy customers. We purposefully pressed pause on this initiative at the start of the pandemic and are planning to roll out a pilot in the next few months that will leverage our learnings from the material evolution of customer shopping behavior over the past year.
I'd also like to update you on our health business more broadly. The pandemic has only served to underscore our purpose and strategy. The adoption of virtual care and telehealth by patients and physicians has been greatly accelerated by COVID-19 and is expected to continue to grow. We see significant opportunity over the long term to make the experience much better for both patients and physicians by providing an integrated seamless technology solution that is easy to use. To that end, our Best Buy health strategy focuses on 3 areas that start with our strength in retail and build to connecting patients and physicians.
The first focus area is the consumer health category I spoke about a little earlier. These products are for customers who want to be healthier, sleep better or need to monitor a chronic condition like diabetes or heart disease, for example.
The second area is active aging, which includes device-based emergency response and other services for Generation A, who wish to continue to live independently in their homes. Active aging builds on the GreatCall, CST and BioSensics acquisitions.
The third focus area is virtual care and includes digital health caring center services that connect patients and physicians to enable virtual care and remote patient monitoring. We provide personal emergency response, remote patient monitoring and care counseling services to payers serving Medicare Advantage and Medicaid populations. And we will expand these services to help people monitor their chronic disease and connect to their physician.
Our differentiated approach combines Best Buy's in-home and care counseling services with digital health. By digital health, we mean curated monitoring devices packaged with the consumer in mind, with a platform to distribute, activate and test the devices to ensure the consumer can use them and connect to their physician.
In fiscal '22, we plan to expand the consumer health product assortment and additional devices and services to our active aging business and add new remote patient monitoring offerings and a new technology platform in virtual care. In order to do this, we plan to invest in people, product development and the ongoing development of our health technology platform in our data, analytics and intelligence engines.
In addition to the investments in our health strategy, our investments in technology and automation will be important aspects in defining how our model continues to evolve in the future. As has been our practice for the past 8 years, we have continued our commitment to leverage cost reductions and efficiencies to help offset investments and pressures. Our current target set in 2019 is to achieve an additional $1 billion in annualized cost reductions and efficiencies by the end of fiscal '25. We achieved approximately $340 million toward our new goal during fiscal '21, taking our total to $500 million toward this goal.
In summary, during fiscal '21, we managed through the challenging environment in a way that allowed us to accelerate many aspects of our strategy to deliver on our purpose and thrive in a new and forever changed environment. Our teams collectively changed the way we do business at a pace we never imagined, and I must reiterate how proud I am of their perseverance and commitment. As a result, we advanced our 5-year plan both strategically and financially much further than we expected.
While we are ahead of plan in several strategic areas, the disruption of the pandemic has also impacted other strategic initiatives. For example, while our health business has proven to be even more strategically relevant to our mission, the pandemic certainly disrupted the progress and the path forward will take time. We also still have meaningful opportunity to evolve our membership and services models to drive loyalty. In addition, we will need to invest in our future as we proactively evolve all the channels of our business to deliver amazing customer experiences in a world where half of the revenue might be initiated online.
All that being said, we see a path that leads to margin expansion beyond what we articulated at our last investor update. In fiscal '22, we expect our operating income rate to be lower than fiscal '21's 5.8% operating income rate as we continue to navigate and cycle impacts of the pandemic while investing in our strategy, as Matt will discuss. We are still in the midst of the pandemic. So we are not updating with a specific metric, but we see long-term non-GAAP operating income rate that is beyond the 5% fiscal '25 target we introduced in September 2019.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Matt for details on our results and insights on our outlook for fiscal '22."

Our financial results for the year far surpassed what we thought was possible entering the year. We are leading fiscal '21 with an even healthier balance sheet than we -- than when we started the year and saw our non-GAAP operating income rate expand 90 basis points versus the prior year. The rate expansion was possible due to both our ability to capitalize on the elevated demand for technology and by reducing spend early in the year in certain discretionary areas beyond the unknown -- based on the unknown situation we were facing at the beginning of the pandemic. We also accelerated strategies that allowed us to begin adjusting our cost structure to what we believe will be a permanent shift in how customers want to shop. Despite the difficult decisions we made, throughout the year, we remain committed on investing in areas we felt were most crucial to delivering our future growth plans.
Let me now share more details specific to our fourth quarter. On Enterprise revenue of $16.9 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.48, an increase of 20% versus last year. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 6.9% increased 40 basis points. This rate expansion was driven by approximately 90 basis points of leverage from the higher sales volume on our SG&A, which was partially offset by a 60 basis point decline in our gross profit rate. In addition, a lower effective tax rate had an $0.08 favorable year-over-year impact on our non-GAAP diluted EPS. 
In our Domestic segment, revenue for the quarter increased 11% to $15.4 billion, an all-time high for revenue in a single quarter. Comparable sales growth of 12% was partially offset by the loss of revenue from stores that were permanently closed in the past year.
From a merchandising perspective, we had broad-based strength across most of our categories, with the largest drivers of comparable growth coming from computing, appliances, gaming, virtual reality and home theater. This growth was partially offset by declines in headphones and mobile phones.
Turning now to gross profit. The Domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate declined 50 basis points to 20.7%, primarily driven by supply chain costs associated with a higher mix of online revenue. In the fourth quarter, our online sales were 43% of our overall Domestic sales in the quarter compared to 25% last year. Although it was a smaller impact than the supply chain cost, our category mix was also a pressure this quarter. These items were partially offset by a promotional environment that was more favorable compared to last year. Our International non-GAAP gross profit rate decreased 180 basis points to 20.8%, primarily due to increased supply chain costs from a higher mix of online sales and a lower sales mix from the higher-margin services category.
Moving next to SG&A. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A increased 5% compared to last year and decreased 90 basis points as a percentage of revenue. As expected, the largest drivers of the expense increase versus last year were: one, higher incentive compensation for corporate and field employees of approximately $55 million; two, increased variable costs associated with higher sales volume, which included items such as credit card processing fees; and three, technology investments, which also include support of our health initiatives. These increased expenses were partially offset by lower store payroll expense.
Let me share some additional context on the increased expense from our technology investments. Technology has, and increasingly will be, the foundation of how we will operate and how we accelerate our strategy. This includes continued technology investments and capabilities to support our health initiatives, increasing and improving our digital interactions with customers, simplifying task in our stores and building upon our analytics to support decisions we make on a daily basis. We are also modernizing our systems and tools as well as utilizing more cloud-based solutions. For example, we are partnering with Microsoft to leverage its cloud to help power our health care offerings. In addition, we are transforming the structure of our technology teams by bringing more head count in-house versus using contract workers.
Let me next provide more context on $129 million in restructuring charges from this quarter, which also include a $13 million benefit within cost of sales. About $88 million of the charges related to changes in our Domestic segment to realign our organizational structure with our strategic priorities. The remaining $41 million is primarily related to our previously announced plans to exit operations in Mexico. We don't anticipate any additional material charges in Mexico in future quarters, and all of our store locations in Mexico will be closed by the end of Q1.
Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $5.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. At the end of Q4, our inventory balance was approximately 8% higher than last year's comparable period to support the current demand for technology. Approximately half of the year-over-year increase is related to inventory still in transit. Although trends have improved from earlier in the year, we are still experiencing constraints driven by the high demand in several of our key categories.
During fiscal '21, we returned $880 million to shareholders through $568 million in dividends and $312 million in share repurchases. We resumed share repurchases during the fourth quarter after suspending activity last March. This morning, we announced a 27% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.70 per share. We also announced our plans to spend at least $2 billion on share repurchases in fiscal '22. In addition, our Board of Directors approved a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization replacing the existing authorization dated February 2019, which had a $1.7 billion in repurchases remaining at the end of fiscal '21.
As we look to our fiscal '22, we are not providing our traditional guidance, but I would like to share our planning assumptions as we enter the year. As we start fiscal '22, the demand for technology remains at elevated levels, and the sales growth momentum we saw in January has continued through the first 3 weeks of February. The uncertainty around the administration of the COVID vaccine and the subsequent impact to customer demand and shopping patterns makes it difficult to predict how sustainable these trends will be. Other factors to consider include government stimulus actions and the risk of continued high unemployment.
With that being said, we estimate fiscal '22 total comparable sales growth in the range of down 2% to up 1%. This range reflects a scenario in which customers resume or accelerate spend in areas that were slowed during the pandemic, such as travel and dining out in the back half of this year. Overall, we expect growth to be positive in the first half of the year and then negative in the back half as we lap strong comp growth in Q3 and Q4 of fiscal '21. We will update our expectations during the year, if needed, as there is more clarity to the various factors driving our outlook. Regardless, we anticipate revenue for fiscal '22 will be higher than what we would have expected to be at this time last year.
From a gross profit rate perspective, we are planning for a non-GAAP rate that is slightly below our fiscal '21 rate. We anticipate more promotional pressure than we experienced this past year as inventory becomes more available and competition likely increases. As Corie mentioned, we are planning for online sales to represent approximately 40% of our Domestic sales in fiscal '22, which is only slightly lower than our mix in fiscal '21. As a result, supply chain-related costs are not expected to have a material impact on our rate compared to the prior year.
From an SG&A standpoint, we're expecting dollars to increase as a percentage in the low single-digit range. There are a number of factors driving the expected increase. First, we expect our SG&A increase -- expense to increase approximately $100 million on a year-over-year basis as we lap COVID-related decisions we made last year to preserve liquidity. This includes returning to more normalized spend on items such as 401(k) company match, advertising spend, store overhead items such as maintenance. This $100 million increase includes the benefit of lapping the $40 million donation to the Best Buy Foundation we made in Q3 of fiscal '21.
Second, we plan to increase our investments in depreciation -- and depreciation in support of technology and our health initiatives by approximately $150 million compared to fiscal '21. Third, we expect store payroll costs to be lower compared to fiscal '21, even after including the impact of lapping $81 million of employee retention credits from the CARES Act we received in the first half of fiscal '21. There are clearly other puts and takes that we will manage through, some that will be more impactful in 1 quarter versus the next, but the previous items are the key drivers of how we are viewing the full year.
Based on the drivers I just outlined, our expectation is for our operating income rate to decline on a year-over-year basis, which is primarily a result of our increased investments in technology and in support of our health initiatives as well as the impact of lapping the temporary actions from fiscal '21 I just shared. In relation to capital expenditures, we expect to spend approximately $750 million to $850 million during fiscal '22 compared to $713 million in fiscal '21.
Now I will provide some color on Q1. We expect comparable sales to be approximately 20%. As a reminder, in Q1 of last year, we closed all of our stores to customer shopping and moved to curbside service only for the last 7 weeks of the quarter. We anticipate our gross profit rate will be slightly lower than last year due to more promotional environment and increased delivery expense. As a reminder, we suspended in-home services for about 5 weeks during last year's Q1.
We expect SG&A dollars to increase by approximately 10%. This increase is primarily related to incentive compensation as we suspended all expense during Q1 of last year for corporate and field employees as well as the gratitude- and vaccination-related bonuses that Corie discussed. These items combined are expected to result in more than $100 million in additional expense versus last year. In addition, we anticipate increased expense from our investments in technology and health as well as higher variable expense associated with expected growth.

I think we strongly believe our competitive advantage is our ability to provide both support and advice across all the channel -- any channel that anyone wants to shop in. And obviously, there are different challenges and different modes of doing that across the different channels. But regardless, we know our employee -- or our customers, excuse me, are looking for both that advice and that support across channels. And we've been investing in our capabilities and technology in order to deliver that.
We've also talked about the fact that what our customers expect from us from a support perspective has changed over time. And it's less about that break-fix support, although that's still important, and we need to be there when that happens. And it's much more about supporting your technology seamlessly across your devices. And it's more about is my printer staying on my network or is my content streaming the way that I want it to. And hence, the reason we've been migrating to a model that looks more like total tech support, which provides you obviously coverage for all the technology devices in your home, regardless of where you bought them.
And so it's not just about now -- for your question specifically, digitally, it's not just about the buying experience. It's actually about using digital across all aspects of the shopping experience. And so we have been working, and we are continuing to work, and as you think about the investments that Matt mentioned in technology, we're investing in things like video chats, virtual consultations, adding digital checkout in the app. This is still all empowered by our amazing Blue Shirts who are actually creating these experiences. We're just creating them digitally.
And so while the gross margin rate has been lower online, over time, it's constantly improving because we're constantly improving that customer experience. And we are seeing increases in our ability to transact total tech support or digital consultations. We're seeing more in-home adviser leads online as an example. So I think it's hard to replace that expertise and support you get by visiting our stores, but we are seeing customers getting more comfortable with experiencing some of those things online. And it's less about exactly which channels that's happening and more about how to in every channel we interact with you. We're constantly trying to improve that experience. So to your point and your question, it does become more natural to make these buying decisions in a digital environment."

I think fundamentally, if we step all the way back, we believe the role of technology in people's lives is only intensified as a result of the pandemic.

So -- and the role we play in that is extremely important and even stronger than it was before. And so as we look at next year and we think about it being probably a tale of 2 halves with growth in the first and then declines in the latter, I think we still see opportunity for innovation to keep fundamentally technology important in people's lives.
Clearly, at a micro level there, you could imagine some categories could see a little bit of pull at any given point. But there's also an element of personal savings rates being so elevated now. Right now, they're about 14%, which is twice what they were going into the pandemic. So there are a lot of puts and takes in the year. Fundamentally, the guide for next year really incorporates a view that as we get towards maybe the middle of the year, we start to see that shifting of consumer behavior back to places that were a little muted as the pandemic hit. So we wouldn't characterize it as a pullback but just a changing how people deciding to use their wallet."

When we set that target in 2019, the good news is our strategic hypothesis was spot on. The interesting part is we have made a massive amount of progress even faster. The customer has made a massive amount of progress. We knew digital penetration was going to grow pretty substantially. What we didn't know is that it was going to double in the span of a year.
And so we need to take, and we are taking, the appropriate time to think about the longer-term given these seismic changes that we've seen. And there are lots of uncertainties, including the fact we're still in the middle of a pandemic. And so we're testing and piloting a number of different models that are going to balance this kind of urgency for change with the need to learn how the customer is changing their behavior.
But what we can see in front of us and then what we can see based on the plans we have in place is that we do think there is that room for operating rate expansion. And Matt will talk a little bit about what we're seeing even in the profitability of the channel."

I think the biggest parts of that are a belief that, like we said, that there'll be a bit more promotionality and competitive environment as we start to get into the latter half of Q1 going forward. There's also periods of time where we had some -- our stores closed and we did -- we weren't able to offer all of our services for installations and delivery. There's a little bit of pressure there.
In addition, I think with online mix being assumed at 40% versus 43% this last year, is that a meaningful difference in terms of the impact of supply chain costs. So that's why we don't think supply chain costs fundamentally are much of a benefit as you start to move into next year, as you are assuming the same amount of sales between the fundamentally  2 years. I also think within there, you've got a little bit of promotional favorability It was offset by a little bit of category mix changes that will happen throughout the year. So fundamentally, it's that assumption that online mix will stay pretty much the same."

We feel better about our inventory position now versus the last 4 calls we've had. So I'll start with that because we've finally gotten back into better stock. That said, we still have constraints in parts of our business that we don't think will solve themselves in the first half of this year. Gaming is a good example. We have yet to put the new generation of gaming consoles into our stores. We anticipate to do that soon, but we haven't done that because there just hasn't been enough inventory to meet demand. So those are some of the things that, pandemic aside, it would have likely been constrained and is only more heightened based on people wanting to dramatically change their at-home experiences.
Other categories like printing have been constrained since the start of pandemic and there's some challenges in that industry at large getting back into a better inventory position. I think in most some of the bigger categories around computing and home theater, we're going through some natural time transitions. This would be now our second home theater transition, as an example, during a pandemic. And I think our vendors are getting smarter about the timing of new model introductions and then what do they use for demand generation.
So I can't give you a good window as to what our inventory will look like 12 months from now. I feel we're going to be in better stock overall, but we'll still have a handful of constraints that we have to navigate through. I think the one thing our teams really do well, and I know that you know this, but we work so far upstream with all of our partners with collaborative forecasting, demand generation, even feature sets on models, which can actually help us give us -- help give our vendors the best forecast possible. So I always look at our forecast accuracy and our percent to fill, and I feel really good about what I can see going forward. And then the rest is based on consumer demand. And I think Matt talked about there are some things on the back half of this year that we have to plan for 2 different vectors on, and I know our teams will be ready."

It's a little bit about everything you just mentioned, in fact. And so in other words, there are multiple ways in which employees can, in many cases, opt in to gaining further certifications and skills. Sometimes that looks like within the 4 walls of the store, I might opt in to garnering more skills in home theater and computing. I might opt in to garnering more skills around services, therefore, I am more flexible throughout the store. In some cases, that might also mean I am willing to spend some of my time doing fulfillment work, fulfilling on car side -- curbside, excuse me, orders or packing inventory in the back out of some of those ship-from-store locations. So I may add those skills, which might add more hours and more flexibility.
And then there are some new digital experiences that we are leveraging our associates for. I might opt in to being able to answer calls from a national call queue. While I'm on my shift, it's not that busy, and I can pick up a customer's question via call, or I might opt in to being more of an expert that's virtual that can help you with whatever your question is in a virtual connection through our app. All of those are different ways in which we're reskilling. And then you can imagine, on top of that, there might flexibility to go work in a supply chain location, or there might be flexibility to train myself into more of a technology job and be able to do that remotely.
And so in all of those different vectors, we are actually starting to create training modules and create opportunities for our employees not just for us to use them flexibly but for them to flexibly opt in to different roles and different hours in a way that might meet their lives with a little bit more flexibility and progress their careers, frankly."

Today, we are reporting record Q1 financial results, which include comparable sales growth of 37% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of more than 230%. We are lapping an unusual quarter last year",3477,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 
Today, we are reporting record Q1 financial results, which include comparable sales growth of 37% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of more than 230%. We are lapping an unusual quarter last year that included both periods of high demand and periods when our stores were closed to customer traffic. When we compare to 2 years ago, our results are very strong. 
Compared to the first quarter of fiscal '20, revenue is up 27% and our earnings per share are up more than 100%. Customer demand for technology products and services during the quarter was extraordinarily high. This demand is being driven by continued focus on the home, which encompasses many aspects of our lives, including working, learning, cooking, entertaining, redecorating and remodeling. The demand was also bolstered by government stimulus programs and the strong housing environment. 
Our teams across the organization met that demand with remarkable execution, from our merchant and supply chain teams working behind the scenes, to our blue shirts and Geek Squad agents on the front lines. Our employees once again showed amazing flexibility and execution, managing extraordinary volumes. Most importantly, they provided exceptional customer service in a safe environment. 
From a merchandising perspective, we saw strong comparable sales across virtually all product and service categories. The biggest contributors to the sales growth in the quarter were home theater, computing and appliances. 
With the extraordinarily high customer demand as well as production and distribution disruptions, product availability constraints continued to be a theme during Q1, as they have been throughout the pandemic, particularly in large appliances, computing, televisions and gaming. Our teams collaborated closely and effectively with our vendors to bring in as much inventory as possible. This is a testament to the trust and unique relationships that our merchants have built with vendors over decades of partnership. 
Our results this quarter also highlight the strength of our supply chain. We were able to efficiently move the amount of inventory necessary to drive 37% comp sales growth, while navigating record demand across retail, container shortages and port congestion. We also improved our speed to customer, as our online sales package delivery was not only much faster than last year, it was faster than 2 years ago pre-pandemic. In fact, same-day delivery to customers' homes was up 90% on a year-over-year basis. 
In addition, we continue to leverage our stores to drive fast and convenient fulfillment of online orders. In Q1, about 60% of our online revenue was either picked up in store or curbside, shipped from a store or delivered by a store employee, which is becoming an increasingly important aspect of our delivery experience. The percent of online sales picked up by customers at our stores was 44%, similar to last year's first quarter. 
This strong performance would not have been possible without an amazing and resourceful team of people and the multiyear investments we have made in our supply chain transformation. 
Best Buy has a unique ability to inspire and support customers in ways no one else can. And as the impacts of the pandemic have evolved, customers across all age demographics are feeling more comfortable coming back into stores to see products firsthand, seek expert advice from our associates or get technical support from our Geek Squad agents. 
At the same time, sales originating online continued to be much higher than pre-pandemic and were 33% of our domestic sales compared to 15% 2 years ago in Q1 of fiscal '20. In addition, we continue to innovatively help customers via phone and chat. We learned a great deal last year by bringing more of our expert blue shirts onto our digital and phone platforms to support our customers. 
In fact, most aspects of our unique and full suite of services have rebounded to pre-pandemic levels. For example, install, delivery and in-store in home repair volume is all up over last year and higher than 2 years ago. Active My Best Buy loyalty program members have grown considerably, and members are using the program more than last year and 2 years ago. Our Total Tech Support membership acquisition metrics, such as sales per store per day, have rebounded and are even higher than what they were 2 years ago. In addition, total usage of the program is up more than last year and 2 years ago. 
During Q1, we saw strong growth from engaged and reengaged customers. Starting at the beginning of the pandemic through March, we saw elevated growth in new customers. In total, new customer growth was about 50% higher than pre-pandemic levels. These new customers gained during the pandemic have slightly different demographics from our historical new customers, such as slightly younger, slightly more female and slightly lower income. We are encouraged by the fact that we are retaining these new customers at rates similar to historical levels, considering they are not only a slightly different demographic, but they also represent a much larger group of new customers than we have historically seen. 
As I mentioned earlier, online sales were 33% of domestic sales this quarter compared to 15% 2 years ago in Q1 of fiscal '20. For the year, we have updated our working assumption regarding the mix of online sales, and now expect it to be in the mid-30% range from our original expectation of approximately 40%. This compares to 19% for the full year 2 years ago in fiscal '20. Nevertheless, clearly, the pandemic has accelerated the evolution of customer shopping behavior. 
Our research indicates our customers look to Best Buy to serve 4 distinct shopping needs: inspiration, research, convenience and support. And customers expect to be able to seamlessly interact with physical and digital channels. We have a unique ability to serve all of these needs at all times in all channels. 
We are currently looking at how we can best deploy our team and our physical assets to meet these customer expectations and needs. As we discussed in our past few earnings calls, we are taking the opportunity to test and pilot a range of models and initiatives to better understand how we can leverage our stores and facilities for more fulfillment purposes and how we can deliver customer experiences with a more flexible and engaged workforce. 
Late last year, we launched a pilot in Houston to test a much more experiential store. For example, from an inspire and support standpoint, it has new PC gaming, headphone and fitness experiences. as well as fully remodeled premium home theater and appliance experiences. In addition, it has a much bigger geek spud presence in the store. From a fulfillment standpoint, we reoriented the location of the store warehouse to be adjacent to a new covered drive-up curbside experience and lockers. Early results from this pilot show higher NPS and sales relative to its group of control stores. 
Late last year, we also began piloting new store formats to test our hypothesis of stores as more primary fulfillment hubs in 4 Minneapolis locations. In these locations, we reduced the shoppable square footage to provide incremental space for staging product for in-store pickup and to support ship-from-store transactions. The product assortment on the sales floor still includes the primary categories these locations had before the remodel, but the merchandise SKU count is reduced to focus on the most popular items. Accordingly, the pilot stores have fewer store associates, and we are testing a queue functionality for customers who would like to consult with an associate. 
In 1 of the 4 locations, we are utilizing some of the available space to increase the previous allocation to our Geek Squad business. Our goal is to retain customers and improve customer satisfaction, while reducing selling square footage, improving speed and convenience and operating a more efficient model. We will continue to refine and iterate to learn and evolve our hypothesis. 
Later this year, we will be piloting a new market approach. To best address local customer needs, we will leverage all our assets in a portfolio strategy across stores, fulfillment, services, and outlet, lockers, our digital app, and both in-store and in-home consultation labor. 
From a physical store standpoint in this market, we will be testing an array of different prototypes, including 15,000, 25,000 and 35,000 square foot stores, a new outlet store and even smaller 5,000 square foot stores. Our goal is to improve customer penetration by delivering new, more efficient and still experiential store formats that are more proximate and relevant to customers. 
In addition, we believe we can operate more efficiently, for example, by reducing total retail square footage across the market, reducing open box costs, and improving utilization of our repair and auto tech capabilities. 
We also continue to refine our ship-from-store hub concept. While all stores will continue to ship online orders, we are driving efficiency and effectiveness by consolidating ship-from-store units in a limited number of stores across the country. 
In addition to our physical stores, our operating model is evolving to meet our customers' changing shopping behaviors that have been accelerated by the pandemic. The sudden and lasting shift customers have made to shopping more regularly and seamlessly across all of our channels has amplified the need to look at how we get our work done. 
As we think about our labor operating model, we are designing for employee choice, flexibility and career opportunity. Our response to the pandemic has shown our ability to be successful when broadening the scope of responsibility of our associates and has highlighted the importance of ongoing flexibility and adaptability. 
A core aspect of our strategy going forward is upskilling and reskilling field employees. The benefits of this go beyond just a more flexible workforce. Yes, it allows our employees and us to schedule shifts more flexibly within the store and between channels, like virtual sales, chat, phone and remote support. But just as importantly, our employees are gaining skills that can be used across their career journey, and they're gaining more confidence. Early results are showing us that once employees add skills, they tend to drive a higher customer NPS. And we are making significant progress as to date, thousands of employees have earned multiple skill sets. 
As we continue to evolve our labor model, we have not lost sight of the competitive advantage our team members provide, especially in more complex sales transactions. Specifically, our in-home advisers, the Pacific Kitchen & Home Experts and Magnolia system designers have the unique ability to create and build relationships and have developed clienteling skills. 
Earlier this month, we brought these 3 previously siloed teams together into one team. This will allow us to serve customers more seamlessly across all the ways they want to interact with us, whether it is virtually, in our stores or in their homes. This change positions our most skilled employees against the most complex work within an entire market and will provide improved career progression opportunities for our sales team. Now called consultants and designers, the members of this coordinated team currently number nearly 3,000. 
We shared last quarter that our overall headcount was down approximately 17% as we entered the fiscal year. The percent of our total employees that are now full time is approximately 60% compared to 54% pre-pandemic. We are iterating to find the balance between providing employees full-time opportunities that come with benefits and guaranteed hours and schedules, while also maintaining the flexibility that is often important in retail. Overall, we are doubling down on the expertise by investing in our people, in their training, skill sets and career progression. 
We also continue to expand our employee benefits, most recently adding new programs focused on diabetes, physical therapy, and supporting, and advocating for employees in the LGBTQIA+ community, and those managing complex chronic or ongoing care needs. These are in addition to benefits we added over the past few years, that include 100% coverage of COVID-related health care expenses, expanded caregiver leave, additional support for backup childcare, tutoring reimbursement, and access to physical and mental health virtual visits. 
In addition, to show our appreciation for their hard work over the last several months and in recognition of their ongoing efforts in the face of pandemic fatigue, we paid employee gratitude bonuses this year. In March, all hourly U.S. employees received $500 for full time and $200 part-time or occasional seasonal. Furthermore, all hourly field employees will receive an incremental $150 recognition award over the next 2 weeks. 
Clearly, the landscape as it relates to the pandemic has been changing rapidly. And we remain keenly focused on keeping employees and customers safe. We are continuing to encourage all employees to get COVID vaccinations by providing them with paid time off when they receive the vaccine and providing them absence time to be used in the event they develop side effects that warrant their needing to stay home and rest after receiving the vaccination. 
I would like to now share the latest developments of our membership strategy. 
As we mentioned on our last call, we purposefully pressed pause on this initiative at the start of the pandemic. Last month, we began piloting a new membership program called Best Buy Beta in 60 stores. This offer combines compelling benefits from our total tech support program, our My Best Buy loyalty program and our credit card program, in addition to other benefits. 
To be clear, what we are piloting is not in direct competition with Amazon Prime, Walmart Plus, or frankly, any other membership programs in the market today. It is playing to our unique strengths and what customers want from Best Buy. It includes exclusive member pricing, unlimited Geek Squad technical support, up to 2 years of warranty protection on product purchases, a 60-day extended return window, free standard shipping and delivery, and free installation on most products and appliances. I would note that all Best Buy customers already receive free and fast shipping on orders over $35, while Best Buy Beta customers get free and fast shipping on everything, including same-day deliveries. Membership also includes access to a support concierge service that is available only to Best Buy Beta members. The Best Buy Concierge team is available 24/7 by phone, chat, e-mail or through the Best Buy app. The cost is the same as our current total tech support program, $199.99 per year or $179.99 per year for the Best Buy credit card holders. 
The goal of Best Buy Beta is to create a membership experience that customers will love and value, which in turn results in a higher customer lifetime value and drives a larger share of CE wallet dollars to Best Buy. It is very early. And the test results and insights will inform what we ultimately end up rolling out on a national level. But so far, we like what we are seeing from a customer and employee proposition perspective. 
Changing topics for a moment. I want to reflect on the fact that this week marks the 1-year anniversary of George Floyd's murder. For us, his death last year was a long overdue catalyst for change. And as you may recall, I shared at that time that we would do better, and I'm proud to report that we have on many fronts. 
One area of particular emphasis for us is our role in underserved communities. In fact, just last week, we announced we're investing $10 million over 5 years to create pathways to opportunity for teams from disinvested communities in Los Angeles. As part of that effort, we will build a network of 10 to 12 team tech centers, providing access to cutting-edge technology, scale building and career mentorship, with a specific focus on connections and training in creative and entertainment careers. We will also provide localized post-secondary guidance, scholarships and mental health and wellness support. 
This Los Angeles Community Impact Hub is a key step toward our goal to build a network of 100 team tech centers by 2025, which is part of our broader commitment to address technology inequities and advance economic and social justice. 
One particularly exciting aspect of this initiative is that we are using a new approach that engages deep partnerships with like-minded public and private organizations in the local community, in this case, founding partners Anneberg Foundation and Greater L.A. Education Foundation and a variety of vendor partners and other organizations. We believe this will be an effective model for amplifying our social impact efforts, and we expect to deploy something similar in other markets. 
In summary, the year has clearly started out much stronger than we originally expected. That momentum is continuing into Q2, and we are raising our outlook. 
As we think more short term, specifically the back half of this year, we expect shopping behavior will continue to evolve, as customers are able to spend more time on activities like eating out, traveling and other events. And there remains uncertainty as to how this may impact our business, especially as we lap particularly strong sales in the back half of last year. 
That being said, there are a number of factors that reinforce our confidence over the longer term. 
First, it has become evident throughout the pandemic that technology is even more important to people's lives. And we are excited about what that means for our business going forward, especially in combination with both the heightened technology innovation that supports our more home-based way of work and life and our unique ability to inspire and support our customers. These are permanent structural shifts that we are seeing towards more hybrid work and learning models, streaming entertainment and a sustained focus on the home. This increased penetration of consumer electronics presents opportunity, as we grow our consultative in-home model to help our customers optimize the potential of their technology as well as our unique support model that keeps it all working the way they want. 
Second, we believe the consumer is in a materially improved position, with higher savings, stronger credit, more prolific vaccination and more available jobs. 
Third, even with the elevated demand we have seen throughout the pandemic, we believe the nesting phenomenon will continue to drive demand for products and services that help customers improve their home experience. And our vendor partners are already innovating to create new solutions that cater to this nesting phenomenon, like cameras and televisions and portable computing geared toward video interactions. 
And fourth, we believe there remains opportunity in the install base that has not yet replaced or upgraded their technology products. For example, NPD estimates 15% of the TV installed base upgraded more quickly than expected. There is also opportunity in low penetration categories, like health, fitness and small appliances, that have room for growth. Furthermore, inventory constraints in areas like gaming support sustained demand as customers continue to seek out ways to entertain at home. 
But before I turn the call over to Matt, I want to say a few words about Mike Mohan, who is participating today in his last earnings call as Best Buy's President and COO. 
When Mike shared that it might be time for him to leave Best Buy, I was met with many emotions. We've worked together for so many years and built a true friendship I have grown to cherish. As his friend, I was proud that he was ready to leave the company he loves and set out to pursue his desire to do more. As a colleague, I was truly saddened that the idea that I wouldn't be able to count on his advice and insights as I have for so long. 
What Mike leaves behind is a legacy of countless people whose careers he supported and thousands of decisions, large and small, that always prioritized Best Buy's success in good times and bad. When things were at their worst, he helped study the company with his trademark candor and almost intuitive understanding of what makes this company tick. We saw him at its best this past year, bringing a lifetime of experience to drive clarity in a truly unique time. Most significantly, he has created a team that is, I believe, the best in the country, a team that will now step up and build on the strengths and growth opportunities that Mike himself has been so instrumental in creating. 
Because we will not be replacing either the President or Chief Operating Officer role, 3 of Mike's 6 direct reports will now report to me. They include Rob Bass, who continues to run our supply chain and Global Properties organization; Damian Harman as our Head of Omnichannel Operations; and Jason Bonfigt, who is our Chief Merchant. 
Now I would like to turn the call over to Matt for details on our results and insights on our outlook for next quarter and the full year."

Let me start by thanking our employees for the extraordinary results they delivered in the first quarter. Our team's ability to not only keep pace with the strong customer demand, but also provide an unmatched customer experience",1224,"Good morning, everyone. 
Let me start by thanking our employees for the extraordinary results they delivered in the first quarter. Our team's ability to not only keep pace with the strong customer demand, but also provide an unmatched customer experience while making strategic progress is truly remarkable. As a result, our performance was well ahead of our working assumptions we laid out at the start of the quarter. 
Enterprise comparable sales growth of 37% far surpassed our estimate of approximately 20%. We were able to capitalize on the elevated demand for technology that has remained throughout the pandemic. The sales originating from inside our stores was also higher than we anticipated and was a contributor to our higher sales volume versus expectations. In addition, our original outlook did not include the benefit of the March stimulus payments. 
Our non-GAAP gross profit rate improved approximately 30 basis points versus last year, which exceeded our expectations of a slight rate decline. The primary driver was a more favorable promotional environment, as the demand for technology remains strong throughout the entire quarter. In addition, the impact of supply chain costs was slightly favorable to our gross profit rate due to the higher mix of sales originating from our stores. Lastly, non-GAAP SG&A dollars grew approximately 15% compared to last year, which was higher than our outlook of approximately 10% growth, primarily due to higher incentive compensation and increased variable costs from higher sales. 
Let me now share more details specific to our first quarter versus last year. 
On Enterprise revenue of $11.6 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.23, an increase of 233% versus last year. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 6.4% increased 350 basis points. This rate expansion was driven by approximately 310 basis points of leverage from the higher sales volume on our SG&A and the 30 basis point improvement in our gross profit rate. In addition, a lower effective tax rate had a $0.14 favorable year-over-year impact on our non-GAAP diluted EPS. 
Store closures in the various operating model changes we experienced last year during the early phases of the pandemic played a factor in our growth this quarter and will continue to impact our year-over-year financial performance throughout the year. As a reminder, we closed our stores to in-person shopping on March 22, shifting to curbside fulfillment to keep our employees and customers safe. By June 22, most of our stores were open to in-store shopping, with capacity limits and reduced store hours. 
While these operating model changes certainly impacted our financial results in Q1, they by no means should take away from the team's ability to successfully execute and serve our customers. 
As Corie mentioned, when comparing our results against 2 years ago or the first quarter of our fiscal '20, total revenue grew more than 27%. Also, our domestic store channel revenue was higher than 2 years ago, despite more than 40 fewer stores and online revenue growth of 175% in that time frame. As a result of the higher revenue, our non-GAAP operating income rate was 260 basis points higher this quarter than the comparable quarter from 2 years ago. 
Now moving back to our performance versus last year. 
In our Domestic segment, revenue for the quarter increased 37% to $10.8 billion. Comparable sales growth of 38% was partially offset by the loss of revenue from stores that were permanently closed in the past year. As a reminder, our comparable sales calculation includes revenue from all stores that were temporarily closed or operating in a curbside-only operating model during the period. 
International revenue of $796 million increased 23%, and included comparable sales growth of 28% and the benefit of approximately 1,000 basis points of a favorable foreign currency exchange rates. These items were partially offset by exiting our operations in Mexico, which resulted in approximately $69 million less revenue this quarter compared to last year. 
Turning now to gross profit. The Domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 30 basis points to 23.3%, which was driven by improved product margin rates, which included reduced promotions and rate improvement from our supply chain costs. These items were partially offset by increased large product installation and delivery [indiscernible] [ ago ], our gross profit rate this quarter was approximately 40 basis points lower, primarily due to supply chain costs from the higher [ 23% ], primarily due to [Audio Gap] 
Moving next to SG&A. [Audio Gap] Last year and decreased 290 basis points as a percentage of revenue. As expected, the largest [indiscernible] increased $156 million and decreased 280 basis points as a percentage of revenue. The drivers of the increase versus fiscal '20 were consistent with the drivers versus last year higher the investments and increased variable costs and the higher incentive compensation expense. 
First, it was much higher than expected in the first quarter due to the strong performance. This also includes the gratitude bonuses that Corie discussed. 
Second, we expect incentive compensation for the full year to be a larger expense than our original working assumptions. As a reminder, from a comparison standpoint, we did not record short-term incentive expense for the first half of last year due to the temporary suspension of our plans. 
Moving to the balance sheet. 
We ended the quarter with $4.3 billion in cash and short-term investments. At the end of Q1, our inventory balance was 43% higher than last year's comparable period and was 10% higher than our Q1 ending inventory balance from 2 years ago. The increased inventory represents our plans to support the current demand for technology as well as actions we took last year to lower inventory receipts based on our reduced sales outlook at the time. 
The health of our inventory remains -- which demonstrates the rapid pace -- experiencing constraints driven by the high demand in several of our key categories. [Audio Gap] and dividends of $175 million [Audio Gap] share repurchases during fiscal '22, which compares to our previous outlook [Audio Gap] has only intensified as a result of pandemic. Our working assumptions still reflect a scenario in which customers  or accelerate spend in areas that. 
From an SG&A standpoint, we expect dollars to increase as a percentage of revenue in the range [Audio Gap] 
There are a number of factors driving the expense increase. First, we expect our SG&A expense to increase approximately $100 million on a year-over-year basis, as we lap COVID-related, returning to a more normalized spend on items such as 401(k), company match, advertising spend and store overhead items, such as maintenance. This $100 million increase includes the benefit in support of technology and our health initiatives by approximately $150 million compared to fiscal '21. This increase also includes depreciation expense. [ Depreciation ] awards from Q1 to increase in the range of to $225 million -- $275 million [Audio Gap] impactful in one quarter versus the next. The previous items are the key drivers of how we are viewing the full year. 
In relation to capital expenditure, we still expect to spend approximately [Audio Gap] Comparable sales to be up approximately 17%. The trends we have seen to start this quarter have remained strong, and our revenue growth for the first 3 weeks of the quarter has been at an approximately 30%.

We -- since the beginning of the pandemic, we have definitely said that we've seen at least some spotty inventory shortages. And so obviously, to your point, the team has done an amazing job navigating an environment where they can drive a 37% comp. And our days of supply have been improving throughout the quarter, and we think they'll continue to improve into Q2. 
But given the unprecedented demand and some of the production disruptions, we have seen constraints, particularly in appliances, computing, TVs. And then we've talked about gaming, obviously, which has been a bit spotty. We're seeing some of that disruption driven by really 4 things. You've got raw materials and production capacity. You've got the very well-documented chip shortages. You've got port and container constraints and delays. And then ultimately, over all of that is this kind of sustained unprecedented, truly global demand in our space. 
And I think what's interesting about our business is we have a high degree of transferability. Meaning because we are a special PCE player, especially for, and then what are the variety of products that might meet your needs. So if you come in for a certain SKU, Scott, as an example, we'll have an associate there who might say, we don't have that one, but here is another SKU that will meet your same needs, same-size TV, same spec, kind of thing. And so I think that helps us navigate this inventory situation in a way that's a little bit different than others. 
And like I said, I think we're going to continue, we believe, to see some level of inventory constraints likely in pockets throughout the rest of the year, assuming that you kind of continue to see the sustained level of demand. But I'm very proud of and the way the team is navigating through it. And then the last thing I would say before we got is our inventory is also in the best situation, I see in terms of at risk. It's very clean inventory. Much of it is new. It's turning really fast, like Matt said. So it's that -- it's actually some of the highest inventory quality we've ever seen."

We know that we're going to continue developing technology or continue to invest in technology and health. And that's about $150 million. That's still in our guide for the year. And then as well, we do know that there's about $100 million of COVID-related decisions we made last year that we have to lap this year. And that's inclusive of the $40 million contribution to the foundation we made in Q3. So those are consistent. The biggest increase is really around that incentive compensation adjustment."

I think the category is also going to be constrained. We talked a little bit around inventory. We feel we have enough inventory to meet the demands, and inventory is getting better. We're going to have a -- maybe more normal back-to-school selling season as kind of things normalize. In an environment where the inventory remains relatively tight, and some of the form factors are changing quickly, we moved from things needed to be ultra portable and very productivity-driven to things that need bigger screens, for example. That means new product revs when we see new product revs, we usually see less promotionality. So overall, I think you guys know that computing does have a lower profit rate than some of the other businesses at Best Buy, but the actual revenue contribution and then actual EBIT flow-through is really attractively, we like it.

And we really left the back half unchanged at this point because there's still a lot of uncertainty. We are seeing customers shop in the service category areas now in addition to ours. We're still seeing some strength even though people are returning to more normalized shopping behavior. But we also are thoughtful about the fact that stimulus will probably have a less event impact as we get into the back half of the year. And so those are some of the bigger things in our mind. 
I think we do believe that the hybrid work model will continue. So there could be some continued opportunity there as well. As you look at the back half, the personal saving rate is very high and people's financial credit stability is very strong. And again, there could be some additional child tax credits coming in earlier this back half of the year. And then in addition, we have -- we continue to be optimistic about innovation and how continued relationships with partners like T-Mobile will help our business. But there's still a lot of uncertainty in terms of what the back half will hold in terms of the customer shopping trends. 
And also, we just still are wary of inventory availability. We have a lot of inventory. We can still support a high level of sales with constraints, but there is a very high demand that we have to be thoughtful about as well. So that's essentially the thoughts that went into the year guide."

Today, we are reporting record Q1 financial results, which include comparable sales growth of 37% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of more than 230%. We are lapping an unusual quarter last year t",3481,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we are reporting record Q1 financial results, which include comparable sales growth of 37% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of more than 230%. We are lapping an unusual quarter last year that included both periods of high demand and periods when our stores were closed to customer traffic. When we compare to 2 years ago, our results are very strong. Compared to the first quarter of fiscal '20, revenue is up 27% and our earnings per share are up more than 100%. 
Customer demand for technology products and services during the quarter was extraordinarily high. This demand is being driven by continued focus on the home, which encompasses many aspects of our lives, including working, learning, cooking, entertaining, redecorating and remodeling. The demand was also bolstered by government stimulus programs and the strong housing environment.  
Our teams across the organization met that demand with remarkable execution, from our merchant and supply chain teams working behind the scenes to our Blue Shirts and Geek Squad agents on the front lines. Our employees once again showed amazing flexibility and execution, managing extraordinary volumes. Most importantly, they provided exceptional customer service in a safe environment.  
From a merchandising perspective, we saw strong comparable sales across virtually all product and service categories. The biggest contributors to the sales growth in the quarter were home theater, computing and appliances. With the extraordinarily high customer demand as well as production and distribution disruptions, product availability constraints continued to be a theme during Q1 as they have been throughout the pandemic, particularly in large appliances, computing, televisions and gaming. Our teams collaborated closely and effectively with our vendors to bring in as much inventory as possible. This is a testament to the trust and unique relationships that our merchants have built with vendors over decades of partnership.  
Our results this quarter also highlight the strength of our supply chain. We were able to efficiently move the amount of inventory necessary to drive 37% comp sales growth while navigating record demand across retail, container shortages and port congestion. We also improved our speed to customer, as our online sales package delivery was not only much faster than last year, it was faster than 2 years ago pre pandemic. In fact, same-day delivery to customers' homes was up 90% on a year-over-year basis.  
In addition, we continue to leverage our stores to drive fast and convenient fulfillment of online orders. In Q1, about 60% of our online revenue was either picked up in store or curbside, shipped from a store or delivered by a store employee, which is becoming an increasingly important aspect of our delivery experience. The percent of online sales picked up by customers at our stores was 44%, similar to last year's first quarter. This strong performance would not have been possible without an amazing and resourceful team of people and the multiyear investments we have made in our supply chain transformation.  
Best Buy has a unique ability to inspire and support customers in ways no one else can. And as the impacts of the pandemic have evolved, customers across all age demographics are feeling more comfortable coming back into stores to see products firsthand, seek expert advice from our associates or get technical support from our Geek Squad agents. At the same time, sales originating online continued to be much higher than pre pandemic and were 33% of our Domestic sales compared to 15% 2 years ago in Q1 of fiscal '20. In addition, we continue to innovatively help customers via phone and chat. We learned a great deal last year by bringing more of our expert Blue Shirts on to our digital and phone platforms to support our customers. 
In fact, most aspects of our unique and full suite of services have rebounded to pre-pandemic levels. For example, install, delivery and in-store and in-home repair volume is all up over last year and higher than 2 years ago. Active My Best Buy loyalty program members have grown considerably, and members are using the program more than last year and 2 years ago. Our Total Tech Support membership acquisition metrics, such as sales per store per day, have rebounded and are even higher than what they were 2 years ago. In addition, total usage of the program is up more than last year and 2 years ago.  
During Q1, we saw strong growth from engaged and reengaged customers. Starting at the beginning of the pandemic through March, we saw elevated growth in new customers. In total, new customer growth was about 50% higher than pre-pandemic levels. These new customers gained during the pandemic have slightly different demographics from our historical new customers, such as slightly younger, slightly more female and slightly lower income. We are encouraged by the fact that we are retaining these new customers at rates similar to historical levels, considering they are not only a slightly different demographic but they also represent a much larger group of new customers than we have historically seen.  
As I mentioned earlier, online sales were 33% of Domestic sales this quarter compared to 15% 2 years ago in Q1 of fiscal '20. For the year, we have updated our working assumption regarding the mix of online sales and now expect it to be in the mid-30% range from our original expectation of approximately 40%. This compares to 19% for the full year 2 years ago in fiscal '20. Nevertheless, clearly, the pandemic has accelerated the evolution of customer shopping behavior. 
Our research indicates our customers look to Best Buy to serve 4 distinct shopping needs: inspiration, research, convenience and support. And customers expect to be able to seamlessly interact with physical and digital channels. We have a unique ability to serve all of these needs at all times in all channels. We are currently looking at how we can best deploy our team and our physical assets to meet these customer expectations and needs. As we discussed in our past few earnings calls, we are taking the opportunity to test and pilot a range of models and initiatives to better understand how we can leverage our stores and facilities for more fulfillment purposes and how we can deliver customer experiences with a more flexible and engaged workforce.  
Late last year, we launched a pilot in Houston to test a much more experiential store. For example, from an inspire and support standpoint, it has new PC gaming, headphone and fitness experiences as well as fully remodeled premium home theater and appliance experiences. In addition, it has a much bigger Geek Squad presence in the store. From a fulfillment standpoint, we reoriented the location of the store warehouse to be adjacent to a new covered drive-up curbside experience and lockers. Early results from this pilot show higher NPS and sales relative to its group of control stores.  
Late last year, we also began piloting new store formats to test our hypothesis of stores as more primary fulfillment hubs in 4 Minneapolis locations. In these locations, we reduced the shoppable square footage to provide incremental space for staging product for in-store pickup and to support ship-from-store transactions. The product assortment on the sales floor still includes the primary categories these locations had before the remodel but the merchandise SKU count is reduced to focus on the most popular items. Accordingly, the pilot stores have fewer store associates, and we are testing a queue functionality for customers who would like to consult with an associate.  
In 1 of the 4 locations, we are utilizing some of the available space to increase the previous allocation to our Geek Squad business. Our goal is to retain customers and improve customer satisfaction while reducing selling square footage, improving speed and convenience and operating a more efficient model. We will continue to refine and iterate to learn and evolve our hypothesis.  
Later this year, we will be piloting a new market approach. To best address local customer needs, we will leverage all our assets in a portfolio strategy across stores, fulfillment, services, in outlet, lockers, our digital app and both in-store and in-home consultation labor. From a physical store standpoint, in this market, we will be testing an array of different prototypes, including 15,000, 25,000 and 35,000 square foot stores, a new outlet store and even smaller 5,000 square foot stores. Our goal is to improve customer penetration by delivering new, more efficient and still experiential store formats that are more proximate and relevant to customers. In addition, we believe we can operate more efficiently, for example, by reducing total retail square footage across the market, reducing open box costs and improving utilization of our repair and other tech capabilities. 
We also continue to refine our ship-from-store hub concept. While all stores will continue to ship online orders, we are driving efficiency and effectiveness by consolidating ship-from-store units in a limited number of stores across the country. In addition to our physical stores, our operating model is evolving to meet our customers' changing shopping behaviors that have been accelerated by the pandemic. The sudden and lasting shift customers have made to shopping more regularly and seamlessly across all of our channels has amplified the need to look at how we get our work done. 
As we think about our labor operating model, we are designing for employee choice, flexibility and career opportunity. Our response to the pandemic has shown our ability to be successful when broadening the scope of responsibility of our associates and has highlighted the importance of ongoing flexibility and adaptability. A core aspect of our strategy going forward is upskilling and reskilling field employees. The benefits of this go beyond just a more flexible workforce. 
Yes, it allows our employees and us to schedule shifts more flexibly within the store and between channels like virtual sales, chat, phone and remote support. But just as importantly, our employees are gaining skills that can be used across their career journey, and they're gaining more confidence. Early results are showing us that once employees add skills, they tend to drive a higher customer NPS. And we are making significant progress as to date thousands of employees have earned multiple skill sets.  
As we continue to evolve our labor model, we have not lost sight of the competitive advantage our team members provide, especially in more complex sales transactions. Specifically, our in-home advisers, the Pacific Kitchen & Home experts and Magnolia system designers have the unique ability to create and build relationships and have developed clienteling skills. Earlier this month, we brought these 3 previously siloed teams together into one team. 
This will allow us to serve customers more seamlessly across all the ways they want to interact with us, whether it is virtually, in our stores or in their homes. This change positions our most skilled employees against the most complex work within an entire market and will provide improved career progression opportunities for our sales team. Now called consultants and designers, the members of this coordinated team currently number nearly 3,000.  
We shared last quarter that our overall headcount was down approximately 17% as we entered the fiscal year. The percent of our total employees that are now full time is approximately 60% compared to 54% pre pandemic. We are iterating to find the balance between providing employees full-time opportunities that come with benefits and guaranteed hours and schedules while also maintaining the flexibility that is often important in retail. Overall, we are doubling down on the expertise by investing in our people, in their training, skill sets and career progression.  
We also continue to expand our employee benefits, most recently adding new programs focused on diabetes, physical therapy and supporting and advocating for employees in the LGBTQIA+ community and those managing complex, chronic or ongoing care needs. These are in addition to benefits we added over the past few years that include 100% coverage of COVID-related health care expenses, expanded caregiver leave, additional support for backup childcare, tutoring reimbursement and access to physical and mental health virtual visits.  
In addition, to show our appreciation for their hard work over the last several months and in recognition of their ongoing efforts in the face of pandemic fatigue, we paid employee gratitude bonuses this year. In March, all hourly U.S. employees received $500 if full time and $200 if part time or occasional/seasonal. Furthermore, all hourly field employees will receive an incremental $150 recognition award over the next 2 weeks.  
Clearly, the landscape as it relates to the pandemic has been changing rapidly, and we remain keenly focused on keeping employees and customers safe. We are continuing to encourage all employees to get COVID vaccinations by providing them with paid time off when they receive the vaccine and providing them absence time to be used in the event they develop side effects that warrant their needing to stay home and rest after receiving the vaccination.  
I would like to now share the latest developments of our membership strategy. As we mentioned on our last call, we purposefully pressed pause on this initiative at the start of the pandemic. Last month, we began piloting a new membership program called Best Buy Beta in 60 stores. This offer combines compelling benefits from our Total Tech Support program, our My Best Buy loyalty program and our credit card program, in addition to other benefits. 
To be clear, what we are piloting is not in direct competition with Amazon Prime, Walmart+ or frankly, any other membership programs in the market today. It is playing to our unique strengths and what customers want from Best Buy. It includes exclusive member pricing, unlimited Geek Squad technical support, up to 2 years of warranty protection on product purchases, a 60-day extended return window, free standard shipping and delivery and free installation on most products and appliances. I would note that all Best Buy customers already receive free and fast shipping on orders over $35 while Best Buy Beta customers get free and fast shipping on everything, including same-day deliveries. 
Membership also includes access to a support concierge service that is available only to Best Buy Beta members. The Best Buy concierge team is available 24/7 by phone, chat, e-mail or through the Best Buy app. The cost is the same as our current Total Tech Support program, $199.99 per year or $179.99 per year for the Best Buy credit card holders.  
The goal of Best Buy Beta is to create a membership experience that customers will love and value, which in turn results in a higher customer lifetime value and drives a larger share of CE wallet dollars to Best Buy. It is very early and the test results and insights will inform what we ultimately end up rolling out on a national level. But so far, we like what we are seeing from a customer and employee proposition perspective.  
Changing topics for a moment. I want to reflect on the fact that this week marks the 1-year anniversary of George Floyd's murder. For us, his death last year was a long overdue catalyst for change. And as you may recall, I shared at that time that we would do better, and I'm proud to report that we have on many fronts.  
One area of particular emphasis for us is our role in underserved communities. In fact, just last week, we announced we're investing $10 million over 5 years to create pathways to opportunity for teams from disinvested communities in Los Angeles. As part of that effort, we will build a network of 10 to 12 team tech centers, providing access to cutting-edge technology, scale building and career mentorship with a specific focus on connections and training in creative and entertainment careers. We will also provide localized post-secondary guidance, scholarships and mental health and wellness support. This Los Angeles Community Impact Hub is a key step toward our goal to build a network of 100 team tech centers by 2025, which is part of our broader commitment to address technology inequities and advance economic and social justice. 
One particularly exciting aspect of this initiative is that we are using a new approach that engages deep partnerships with like-minded public and private organizations in the local community; in this case, founding partners Anneberg Foundation and Greater LA Education Foundation and a variety of vendor partners and other organizations. We believe this will be an effective model for amplifying our social impact efforts, and we expect to deploy something similar in other markets.  
In summary, the year has clearly started out much stronger than we originally expected. That momentum is continuing into Q2, and we are raising our outlook. As we think more short term, specifically the back half of this year, we expect shopping behavior will continue to evolve as customers are able to spend more time on activities like eating out, traveling and other events, and there remains uncertainty as to how this may impact our business, especially as we lap particularly strong sales in the back half of last year. 
That being said, there are a number of factors that reinforce our confidence over the longer term. First, it has become evident throughout the pandemic that technology is even more important to people's lives, and we are excited about what that means for our business going forward, especially in combination with both the heightened technology innovation that supports our more home-based way of work and life and our unique ability to inspire and support our customers. These are permanent structural shifts that we are seeing towards more hybrid work and learning models, streaming entertainment and a sustained focus on the home. This increased penetration of consumer electronics presents opportunity as we grow our consultative in-home model to help our customers optimize the potential of their technology as well as our unique support model that keeps it all working the way they want.  
Second, we believe the consumer is in a materially improved position with higher savings, stronger credit, more prolific vaccination and more available jobs. Third, even with the elevated demand we have seen throughout the pandemic, we believe the nesting phenomenon will continue to drive demand for products and services that help customers improve their home experience, and our vendor partners are already innovating to create new solutions that cater to this nesting phenomenon like cameras and televisions and portable computing geared toward video interactions.  
And fourth, we believe there remains opportunity in the installed base that has not yet replaced or upgraded their technology products. For example, NPD estimates 15% of the TV installed base upgraded more quickly than expected. There is also opportunity in low penetration categories like health, fitness and small appliances that have room for growth. Furthermore, inventory constraints in areas like gaming support sustained demand as customers continue to seek out ways to entertain at home.  
So before I turn the call over to Matt, I want to say a few words about Mike Mohan, who is participating today in his last earnings call as Best Buy's President and COO. When Mike shared that it might be time for him to leave Best Buy, I was met with many emotions. We've worked together for so many years and built a true friendship I have grown to cherish. As his friend, I was proud that he was ready to leave the company he loves and set out to pursue his desire to do more. As his colleague, I was truly saddened of the idea that I wouldn't be able to count on his advice and insights as I have for so long.  
What Mike leaves behind is a legacy of countless people whose careers he supported and thousands of decisions, large and small, that always prioritized Best Buy's success in good times and bad. When things were at their worst, he helped steady the company with his trademark candor and almost intuitive understanding of what makes this company tick. We saw him at its best this past year, bringing a lifetime of experience to drive clarity in a truly unique time. Most significantly, he has created a team that is, I believe, the best in the country, a team that will now step up and build on the strengths and growth opportunities that Mike himself has been so instrumental in creating.  
Because we will not be replacing either the President or Chief Operating Officer role, 3 of Mike's 6 direct reports will now report to me. They include Rob Bass, who continues to run our supply chain and global properties organization; Damien Harmon as our Head of Omnichannel Operations; and Jason Bonfig, who is our Chief Merchant.  
Now I would like to turn the call over to Matt for details on our results and insights on our outlook for next quarter and the full year."

Let me start by thanking our employees for the extraordinary results they delivered in the first quarter. Our team's ability to not only keep pace with the strong customer demand but also provide an unmatched customer experience while making strategic progress is truly remarkable. As a result, our performance was well ahead of our working assumptions we laid out at the start of the quarter.  
Enterprise comparable sales growth of 37% far surpassed our estimate of approximately 20%. We were able to capitalize on the elevated demand for technology that has remained throughout the pandemic. The sales originating from inside our stores was also higher than we anticipated and was a contributor to our higher sales volume versus expectations. In addition, our original outlook did not include the benefit of the March stimulus payments.  
Our non-GAAP gross profit rate improved approximately 30 basis points versus last year, which exceeded our expectations of a slight rate decline. The primary driver was a more favorable promotional environment as the demand for technology remained strong throughout the entire quarter. In addition, the impact of supply chain costs was slightly favorable to our gross profit rate due to the higher mix of sales originating from our stores. Lastly, non-GAAP SG&A dollars grew approximately 15% compared to last year, which was higher than our outlook of approximately 10% growth primarily due to higher incentive compensation and increased variable costs from higher sales.  
Let me now share more details specific to our first quarter versus last year. On Enterprise revenue of $11.6 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.23, an increase of 233% versus last year. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 6.4% increased 350 basis points. This rate expansion was driven by approximately 310 basis points of leverage from the higher sales volume on our SG&A and the 30 basis point improvement in our gross profit rate. In addition, a lower effective tax rate had a $0.14 favorable year-over-year impact on our non-GAAP diluted EPS.  
Store closures and the various operating model changes we experienced last year during the early phases of the pandemic played a factor in our growth this quarter and will continue to impact our year-over-year financial performance throughout the year. As a reminder, we closed our stores to in-person shopping on March 22, shifting to curbside fulfillment to keep our employees and customers safe. By June 22, most of our stores were open to in-store shopping with capacity limits and reduced store hours. While these operating model changes certainly impacted our financial results in Q1, they by no means should take away from the team's ability to successfully execute and serve our customers.  
As Corie mentioned, when comparing our results against 2 years ago or the first quarter of our fiscal '20, total revenue grew more than 27%. Also, our domestic store channel revenue was higher than 2 years ago despite more than 40 fewer stores and online revenue growth of 175% in that time frame. As a result of the higher revenue, our non-GAAP operating income rate was 260 basis points higher this quarter than the comparable quarter from 2 years ago.  
Now moving back to our performance versus last year. In our Domestic segment, revenue for the quarter increased 37% to $10.8 billion. Comparable sales growth of 38% was partially offset by the loss of revenue from stores that were permanently closed in the past year. As a reminder, our comparable sales calculation includes revenue from all stores that were temporarily closed or operating in a curbside-only operating model during the period.  
International revenue of $796 million increased 23% and included comparable sales growth of 28% and the benefit of approximately 1,000 basis points of a favorable foreign currency exchange rate. These items were partially offset by exiting our operations in Mexico, which resulted in approximately $69 million less revenue this quarter compared to last year.  
Turning now to gross profit. The Domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 30 basis points to 23.3%, which was driven by improved product margin rates, which included reduced promotions and rate improvement from our supply chain costs. These items were partially offset by increased large product installation and delivery expense. As a reminder, we suspended in-home services for about 5 weeks during last year's first quarter. Compared to 2 years ago, our gross profit rate this quarter was approximately 40 basis points lower primarily due to supply chain costs and a higher mix of online revenue. Our International non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 70 basis points to 23% primarily due to improved product margin rates.
Moving next to SG&A. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A increased 16% compared to last year and decreased 290 basis points as a percentage of revenue. As expected, the largest drivers of expense increase versus last year were: one, higher incentive compensation for corporate and field employees of approximately $190 million, including approximately $40 million for the gratitude and appreciation awards Corie mentioned earlier; two, technology investments, which also include support of our health initiatives; and three, increased variable costs associated with a higher sales volume, which included items such as credit card processing fees. 
When comparing to 2 years ago, Domestic non-GAAP SG&A increased $156 million and decreased 280 basis points as a percentage of revenue. The drivers of the increase versus fiscal '20 were consistent with the drivers versus last year of higher incentive compensation, technology investments and increased variable costs due to higher sales volume. Partially offsetting the previous items was lower store payroll expense.   
Let me share some additional context on the higher incentive compensation expense. First, it was much higher than expected in the first quarter due to the strong performance. This also includes the gratitude bonuses that Corie discussed. Second, since we now expect the full year to exceed our original annual incentive performance targets, we expect incentive compensation for the full year to be a larger expense than our original working assumptions. As a reminder, from a comparison standpoint, we did not record short-term incentive expense for the first half of last year due to the temporary suspension of our plans.  
Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $4.3 billion in cash and short-term investments. At the end of Q1, our inventory balance was 43% higher than last year's comparable period and was 10% higher than our Q1 ending inventory balance from 2 years ago. The increased inventory represents our plans to support the current demand for technology as well as actions we took last year to lower inventory receipts based on our reduced sales outlook at the time.  
The health of our inventory remains very strong, and the increase in accounts payable this quarter was 44%, which demonstrates the rapid pace we continue to turn our inventory. Although trends have improved from the early phases of the pandemic, we are still experiencing constraints driven by the high demand in several of our key categories. 
During the quarter, we returned a total of $1.1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases of $927 million and dividends of $175 million. As we look to the full year, we now expect to spend approximately $2.5 billion in share repurchases during fiscal '22, which compares to our previous outlook of at least $2 billion. 
Let me next share more color on the full year outlook for fiscal '22. We are encouraged by our results in the first quarter and our outlook for the second quarter. We now estimate fiscal '22 comparable sales growth in the range of 3% to 6%, which compares to our previous working assumption of down 2% to up 1%. While we continue to believe the role of technology in people's lives has only intensified as a result of pandemic, our working assumptions still reflect a scenario in which customers resume or accelerate spend in areas that have slowed from the start of the pandemic in the back half of this year. From a gross profit rate perspective, we are planning for a non-GAAP rate that is approximately flat to fiscal '21. From an SG&A standpoint, we expect dollars to increase as a percentage of revenue in the range -- as a percentage in the range of 6% to 7%. 
Consistent with what I shared last quarter, there are a number of factors driving the expense increase. First, we expect our SG&A expense to increase approximately $100 million on a year-over-year basis as we lap COVID-related decisions we made last year to preserve liquidity. This includes returning to a more normalized spend on items such as 401(k) company match, advertising spend and store overhead items such as maintenance. This $100 million increase includes the benefit of lapping a $40 million donation to the Best Buy Foundation that we made in Q3 of fiscal '21.  
Second, we plan to increase our investments in support of technology and our health initiatives by approximately $150 million compared to fiscal '21. This increase also includes depreciation expense. Third, we now expect our incentive compensation, including the gratitude and appreciation awards from Q1, to increase in the range of $225 million to $275 million. There are clearly other puts and takes that we will manage through, some that will be more impactful in one quarter versus the next, but the previous items are the key drivers of how we are viewing the full year. In relation to capital expenditures, we still expect to spend approximately $750 million to $850 million during fiscal '22. 
Now I will provide some color on our second quarter. We expect comparable sales to be up approximately 17%. The trends we have seen at the start this quarter have remained strong, and our revenue growth for the first 3 weeks of the quarter has been approximately 30%. We anticipate that our gross profit rate will be approximately flat to last year. From a non-GAAP SG&A standpoint, we expect dollars to increase approximately 20% compared to last year. 
As a reminder, we made several cost decisions at the start of our second quarter last year to align with lower sales and channel trends we were seeing and expecting to continue at that point. The primary drivers of the expected year-over-year increase include: first, we expect our incentive compensation to increase by approximately $100 million. Second, we expect our store payroll cost to increase as we lap last year's store closures. Third, we lap COVID-related decisions we made last year to lower cost and reserve liquidity such as 401(k) company match, advertising spend and store overhead items. In addition, we plan to increase our investments in support of technology and our health initiatives.

Obviously, it's a little bit of a tricky compare to last year because we had our stores closed, as Matt said, for part of the quarter. So when you look back 2 years, we feel like, across the board, we've at least recovered our share positions. If not, there's obviously some puts and takes in categories. But especially as we got the stores back up and we were able to provide those installation and delivery experiences, then we were able to recover especially in some of those large cube areas like appliances and televisions. 
As it relates to some of the new customers that we're seeing, like we said on the call, we're seeing -- we saw about 50% growth in our new customer acquisitions. So we're always acquiring new customers. That's the good news. But -- during the pandemic, we've seen about 50% growth. 
And like we said, it's been skewing towards a slightly different and -- different customer mix than what we've seen, slightly more female, a little bit more low-income demographic and importantly, also a younger demographic. For the first time, the largest cohort that we have of customers over the last 12 months is actually millennials, which is good, and we're also seeing retention levels similar to what we've seen historically with these new customers.

And it's part of the reason -- as we look to the future, the back half of this year, we know that it has had some impact on why we would see the back half being a little bit different than the front half of this year. But it clearly is having an impact, and we'll have to watch and see where that goes. There is an element of childcare tax credits that are coming that could also help and replace some of the stimulus. So we'll watch that as close as we can."

So I mean first, I'm just going to take one gigantic step back to say I'm incredibly proud of our supply chain performance and the myriad teams that have helped us deliver throughout what is unprecedented demand. And I think it's interesting because there's such a portfolio approach to how we think about supply chain at Best Buy. I mean it's evolved from the conventional distribution center model. And think about all the touch points we have with customers for fulfillment: vending machines, lockers, alternate pickup locations, curbside, in-store, same day, next day, employee, ship-from-store. I actually think it's really important to set that context first because it allows us a great deal of flexibility to deliver with speed and with convenience to the customer. 
Specific to what we're seeing with our employee delivery, we saw about 2x the penetration that we had in Q1 -- or in Q4, excuse me, into Q1. And what those employees are trying to do, they're mostly actually supporting our next-day capabilities. And it's actually kind of a surprise and delight moment. They are able to leverage some of the extra capacity. They're driving around the neighborhoods near the store. They're able to walk up, deliver that package. And typically, the customer feedback we hear is ""I wasn't expecting a Blue Shirt necessarily to come walking up with the package and deliver it safely to my home."" So I think it's a way for us to leverage the brand and the unique aspects of our Blue Shirts but also do it with some level of convenience. 
Mike, do you have something to add?"

So that's why, like Corie  mentioned, most of this is next day so we can queue it up and have this amazing experience. 
I think what makes this interesting is that we have the permission from customers to get across the threshold, and we're thinking about that quite a bit. So today, it's I ring a doorbell and drop it on the step, but I think you can maybe pull on the string a little bit. And we have the ability to get into someone's home, have a conversation, set up a profile, maybe even have a discussion around membership and potentially get them set up as an adviser. 
So I think that's one of the things we're excited about the most, but also that we're going to give our employees a choice. In the moment that they want to pick up extra income, they can also be doing this and supporting the experience with our customers."

And so I will start with where I did in the prepared remarks, and that is our #1 goal is to ensure seamless customer experiences. And as we said, our customers look to us for everything from inspiration and support all the way to that really convenient fulfillment opportunity. And so the goal of the test right now is to say what is the right balance between that really deep experiential selling square footage, that fulfillment square footage that might be behind the scenes. 
And one of the things that you didn't quite hear in the prepared remarks is that often, you might have a little bit less selling square footage but all the SKUs are available in the back because it's like a mini fulfillment center so you can still deliver on the customer experiences.

I'd start by just reinforcing kind of where I ended the last question, and that is we're testing for the right mix of experience, space and location. And all those things need to play together in the right way. 
We obviously feel urgency. We wanted to make sure that we figure this out, but we don't want to be so urgent that we risk the customer and frankly, also the employee experience in this work. And it's important to note we're not even in a normalized environment yet, right? We still have the impacts of COVID, you have stimulus. Like there's a lot of things still impacting shopping behavior, which means you don't want to take a false read and then roll some of these out. And then even the full market test that I was talking about on the call, that's set to launch in the back half of this year, so we haven't even started the launch on that one. 
So we don't have anything to announce today. We wanted to start to give you more clarity on the true impacts we're trying to test, the true market-level tests that we're doing. And we want to make sure it wasn't just seen as on the fulfillment side, but it's also the new experiential aspects that we're adding. And I think -- we would say we have a pretty good history of rolling out concepts as soon as we feel like we have the right case sitting behind them. And so as we know more about and feel like we have a sustained understanding of what each of these concepts does for the customer and the employee, then we'll come back to you with the more distinct rollout plans.

Overarchingly, as we see the store sales rebound a bit from last year, we are seeing strong attach rates, pretty normal historical level of attach rates with our stores. And as we've talked about in the past, as e-commerce is a growing business, we're seeing continued improvement on e-commerce attach as well. 
So we're seeing good utilization. We're selling a lot of television and appliances, and so the installation and delivery is quite high that we've been talking about. So things are returning back to normal, if you will. And obviously, there's a lot of need to support people in their homes as they're living in a very hybrid way right now. So we're seeing a good return to our services business. 
From an e-com mix and what that does to the EBIT range, clearly, if you look at the implied math this year from our new guide, it does imply that -- even though our e-com mix is a bit lower than we estimated starting the year, the implied math is that our OI rates are actually a little stronger than it would have been at the start of the year. So even though we're mixing a little bit out of e-com, we are still seeing good leverage on our sales despite the fact we are shifting back a bit more into store sales."

We -- since the beginning of the pandemic, we have definitely said that we've seen at least some spotty inventory shortages. And so obviously, to your point, the team has done an amazing job navigating an environment where they can drive a 37% comp. And our days of supply have been improving throughout the quarter, and we think they'll continue to improve into Q2. 
But given the unprecedented demand and some of the production disruptions, we have seen constraints, particularly in appliances, computing, TVs. And then we've talked about gaming, obviously, which has been a bit spotty. We're seeing some of that disruption driven by really 4 things. You've got raw materials and production capacity. You've got the very well-documented chip shortages. You've got port and container constraints and delays. And then ultimately, over all of that is this kind of sustained unprecedented truly global demand in our space. 
And I think what's interesting about our business is we have a high degree of transferability. Meaning, because we are a specialty CE player, especially if you come into the store but I would argue even in our digital properties, we can help you navigate what exactly you're looking for and then what are the variety of products that might meet your needs. So if you come in for a certain SKU, Scot, as an example, we'll have an associate there who might say, ""Oh, we don't have that one. But here is another SKU that will meet your same needs,"" same size TV, same specs, that kind of thing. And so I think that helps us navigate this inventory situation in a way that's a little bit different than others. 
And like I said, I think we're going to continue, we believe, to see some level of inventory constraints, likely in pockets, throughout the rest of the year, assuming that you kind of continue to see the sustained level of demand. But I'm very proud of and impressed by the way the team is navigating through it. And then the last thing I would say before we're done is our inventory is also in the best situation I see in terms of at-risk. 
It's very clean inventory. Much of it is new. It's turning really fast, like Matt said. So it's actually some of the highest inventory quality we've ever seen."

In the previous guidance, essentially, short-term incentive was assumed to be flat for the year. As we looked through the first quarter and our performance and again, look outwards towards the end of the year, that performance clearly increased. And so that $225 million to $275 million is really the increased expectations on the full year business, and our original estimate was basically flat on a year-over-year basis. 
So the other elements of SG&A from a guide perspective is pretty consistent. We know that we're going to continue developing technology -- or continue to invest in technology and health, and that's about $150 million. That's still in our guide for the year. And then as well, we do know that there's about $100 million of COVID-related decisions we made last year that we have to lap this year, and that's inclusive of the $40 million contribution to the foundation we made in Q3. So those are consistent. The biggest increase is really around that incentive compensation adjustment."

Computing has been a phenomenal sales success story in the industry and for Best Buy. And I think the position that we created both for consumers and then for some of our direct to business segments was driving our good results. 
I think the category is also going to be constrained. We talked a little bit around inventory. We feel we have enough inventory to meet the demands, and inventory is getting better. We're going to have a maybe more normal back-to-school selling season as kind of things normalize. 
In an environment where the inventory remains relatively tight and some of the form factors are changing quickly, we've moved from things needed to be ultra portable and very productivity-driven to things that need bigger screens, for example. That means new product -- when we see new product rev, we usually see less promotionality. So overall, I think you guys know that computing does have a lower profit rate than some of the other businesses at Best Buy, but the actual revenue contribution and then the actual EBIT flow-through is really attractively and we like it.

And so essentially, what we've done is we took our Q1 beat and then increased our -- increased expectations for Q2. And we really left the back half unchanged at this point because there's still a lot of uncertainty. 
We are seeing customers shop in the service category areas now in addition to ours. So we're still seeing some strength even though people are returning to more normalized shopping behavior, but we also are thoughtful about the fact that stimulus will probably have less of an impact as we get into the back half of the year. And so those are some of the bigger things in our mind. 
I think we do believe that the hybrid work model will continue. So there could be some continued opportunity there as well as you look at the back half. The personal saving rate is very high, and people's financial/credit stability is very strong. And again, there could be some additional child tax credits coming in earlier this back half of the year. 
And then in addition, we have -- we continue to be optimistic about innovation and how continued relationships with partners like T-Mobile will help our business. But there's still a lot of uncertainty in terms of what the back half will hold in terms of the customer shopping trends. And also, we just still are wary of inventory availability. We have a lot of inventory. We can still support a high level of sales with constraints, but there is a very high demand that we have to be thoughtful about as well. So that's essentially the thoughts that went into the year guide."

Today, we are reporting record Q2 financial results of $11.8 billion in sales and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.98. Comparable sales growth was 20%, and our non-GAAP operating income growth",3818,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we are reporting record Q2 financial results of $11.8 billion in sales and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.98. Comparable sales growth was 20%, and our non-GAAP operating income growth was 40%. We are lapping an unusual quarter last year as our stores were limited to curbside service or in-store appointments for roughly half the quarter. When we compare to 2 years ago, our results are very strong. Compared to the second quarter of fiscal '20, revenue was up 24%, and our non-GAAP operating income is up 115%. Clearly, customer demand for technology products and services during the quarter remained very strong. 
Customers continue to leverage technology to meet their needs, and we provide solutions that help them work, learn, entertain, cook and connect at home. The demand was also bolstered by an overall strong consumer spending, aided by government stimulus, improving wages and high savings levels. From a merchandising perspective, we saw strong comparable sales growth in almost all categories. The biggest contributors to the sales growth in the quarter were home theater, appliances, computing, mobile phones and services. 
Product availability improved in the quarter. And except for some pockets in appliances and home theater, we do not believe it materially limited our overall sales growth. Our merchant demand planning and supply chain teams once again did an amazing job managing through the difficult and constantly evolving supply chain environment. They worked strategically to bring in as much inventory as possible during the quarter with actions like acquiring additional transportation, pulling up product flow and adjusting store assortment based on availability. There will continue to be challenges, particularly as it relates to congested ports and transportation disruptions. But our teams have set us up for as strong an inventory position as possible as we move forward into the back half of the year. 
As we think about the holiday period, we often have varying degrees of inventory and supply chain challenges, and this year will be no different. But we feel confident in our ability to serve our customers during the holiday. The continued strong demand across retail resulted in an overall less promotional environment, which was a significant driver of our better-than-expected profitability in the quarter. During the quarter, we provided customers multiple ways to interact with us depending on their needs, preference and comfort. Similar to last quarter, customers migrated back into stores to touch and feel products and to seek in-person expertise and service. At the same time, they continue to interact with us digitally at a significantly higher rate than prepandemic as online sales were 32% of Domestic revenues compared to 16% in Q2 of fiscal '20. Phone and chat volume also remained very high compared to prepandemic, and sales via these channels continue to climb. In addition, of course, we are interacting with customers in their homes, making large product deliveries, installing solutions, repairing products and providing sales consultations. In fact, overall, we are helping our customers with their technology needs in their homes 20% more than we did 2 years ago in Q2 of fiscal '20. Through all of these interactions, across all of these touch points, 98% of survey customers tell us they feel very safe, which we believe is still incredibly important at this stage in the pandemic. I want to genuinely thank our store and in-home teams for creating this safe environment for our customers and for continuing to provide exceptional service even in situations where customers resisted following safety guidelines and, in some cases, were disrespectful. 
For customers purchasing online, we delivered product with speed and convenience. Online sales package delivery was not only much faster than last year, it was faster than 2 years ago. Furthermore, we stack up extremely well versus our competition. Using a third-party service, we analyzed competitor websites on a daily basis, and we consistently lead in the proportion of 1 day or less for published shipping time across a sample of higher-volume ZIP codes and higher-demand items. In addition, we leveraged our stores to drive fast and convenient fulfillment of online orders. In Q2, we continue to see about 60% of our online revenue fulfilled by stores, including in-store or curbside pickup, ship-to-shore or Best Buy employees who are delivering product to customers out of more than 450 of our stores. The percent of online sales picked up by customers at our stores was 42%, similar to last year's second quarter. Clearly, the landscape as it relates to the pandemic has been changing rapidly and we remain keenly focused on keeping our employees and customers safe. 
We are continuing to encourage all employees to get COVID vaccinations by providing them with paid time off when they receive the vaccine and providing them absence time to be used in the event they develop side effects. In June, we launched an employee suite stakes with more than $100,000 in cash prices to encourage our team members to get vaccinated. To show our appreciation for their hard work and ongoing efforts in the face of pandemic fatigue, we paid employee gratitude bonuses at the beginning of the quarter. In summary, our team has delivered incredible results. To all of our associates across the company, I thank you for your customer obsession, perseverance and ingenuity. 
Of course, while we were driving these great Q2 results, we were also looking to the future. During the quarter, we continued to roll out and run several tests and pilots as we determine the best path forward to become an even more customer-centric, digitally focused and efficient company. We believe this is crucial to thriving in a new and different environment where customers expect to seamlessly interact with physical and digital channels throughout the shopping journey as they seek inspiration, research, convenience and support. Last year, we introduced a very important membership pilot called Best Buy Beta. As a reminder, it includes unlimited Geek Squad technical support on all of the technology in their home no matter where or when you purchased it, including 24/7 VIP access to dedicated phone and chat teams that are only available to members. It also includes up to 24 months of product protection on most purchases from Best Buy, free delivery and standard installation, exclusive member pricing, a 60-day extended return window and free shipping of online orders, all for $199 per year. The offer is designed to give our customers the confidence that whatever their technology needs are, we will be there to help. It leverages our unique strengths and what we can provide customers that no one else can. The goal is to create a membership experience that customers will love, which in turn results in a higher customer lifetime value and drives a larger share of CE spend to Best Buy. We are very excited about this membership offer, and we are encouraged by the pilot results. Membership acquisition has exceeded our initial forecast. In addition, data is showing that Beta members interact more frequently and have a higher incremental spend than nonmembers. Given the breadth of the offer, it is resonating well across all customer demographics, and our members are skewing younger than our Total Tech Support membership program. In addition, our employees love telling customers about the program. We plan to scale the program nationally in stores and online at the end of Q3 under the new name Best Buy Total Tech. As part of the national rollout, we will be converting our 3.1 million existing Total Tech Support members to the new program. I want to stress that the goal of the program is for customers to find value in the benefits and use them often. It is not designed to be a stand-alone, margin-driving service offering, particularly in the near term. In fact, as Matt will discuss later, a full rollout is a near-term investment, which we are confident will be justified with incremental sales growth and long-term customer value. 
As it relates to our physical stores and operating model, we are continuing to pilot and test many approaches and formats. Specifically, we are testing more experiential stores, how we can leverage our stores and facilities for more fulfillment purposes and how we can deliver customer experiences with a more flexible, digitally supported and engaged workforce. We are not going to outline all of our initiatives today, but I would like to provide a few updates and learnings. We have begun implementing the pilot of our new holistic market approach in Charlotte. As we mentioned last quarter, this pilot is designed to leverage all our assets in a portfolio strategy across stores, fulfillment, services and outlet, lockers, our digital app and both in-store and In-Home Consultation labor. We will be testing an array of different prototypes, including remodeling a number of stores to 15,000, 25,000 and 35,000 square foot stores as well as launching a few new smaller 5,000 square foot stores. We expect the full rollout of the pilot to span a few quarters. And several store remodels are currently underway, including the transition of 1 store into a new type of outlet. Our current 15 outlet stores focus mainly on large appliance and TV open-box product. With this new outlet pilot, we will have open-box products from all categories. It will also serve as the hub in a new services repair hub-and-spoke model we are testing as well as an auto tech mega hub for our car tech installation. Of course, the reason we are piloting and testing so much is because we are trying some unique prototypes, and we need the opportunity to learn and adjust before we roll more broadly. For example, in our 4 Minneapolis test stores where we reduced the shoppable square footage to 15,000 square feet to provide more space for fulfillment, we have been making adjustments based on customer and employee feedback. We've reflowed some of the layout, added signage to help customers understand the changes we are testing and added assortment in areas like small appliances, printing and accessories. We will continue to evolve these test stores based on learnings and feedback. 
As it relates to our Houston experiential 35,000 square foot store pilot, we continue to receive positive feedback from customers and employees on store design and the way we are showcasing products. In addition, year-to-date, this store generated higher revenue than control stores in the double-digit percent range. Another pilot that we are excited to launch preholiday is our virtual store. For this, we are building out a physical store in one of our distribution centers that will have merchandising and products and will be staffed by dedicated associates, including vendor-provided expert labor, but it will have no physical customers. Instead, customers can interact with our experts via chat, audio, video and screen sharing depending on their preference and be able to see live demos, displays and physical products. We are excited about the customer use cases this provides. For example, you could be on our dot-com experience, click on a product you like and be connected via video to a Blue Shirt in the Best Buy virtual store and never lead your living room. Or you could be standing in a store, scan a bar code and be taken through your phone directly to this virtual store where an associate could answer your question. 
From a fulfillment perspective, our ship-to-shore hubs we piloted last year were very successful and we are continuing to iterate on the model. As a reminder, while all stores will continue to ship online orders, we are driving efficiency and effectiveness by consolidating ship-from-store units in a limited number of stores across the country. As we have evolved the model overall, we are using fewer stores than last year as hubs. 
In addition, we've begun remodeling a subset of stores to deliver an even greater portion of the volume, reducing the sales floor square footage and installing warehouse-grade packaging station equipment and supplies. These 13 locations should be rolled out by holiday and take on about 25% of the national ship-to-shore volume. As you would expect, the various tests and pilots are intended to identify how our store portfolio should evolve from the role they serve to their look and feel. As we learn from these tests, we will develop plans that likely include a rollout of investments in more stores and markets. 
We have also been evolving our labor model to meet our customers' changing shopping behaviors. For our employees, we are designing for more choice, flexibility and career opportunity. We continue to see momentum with our flexible workforce initiative, which is centered on store employees becoming certified to gain expertise to perform roles outside of their primary job function. At the end of July, 80% of our associates were eligible to flex into different work zones, and 50% of associates have earned 4 or more jobs. This allows our employees and us to schedule shifts more flexibly within the store and between channels, like virtual sales, chat, phone, remote support or employee product delivery. And very soon, we will be able to schedule associates between stores within a market. This flexibility is important for all of our stores going forward, but even more important for our smaller stores with less labor. This new way of working empowers employees to develop their careers by giving them opportunities to learn new skills, broaden their experience and have more flexibility in their jobs. They are equipped to confidently help customers in more ways. And our data is showing us that once employees add skills they tend to drive a higher customer NPS. It also gives team members the ability to earn a different hourly wage depending on the job performed and the potential for working additional shifts that otherwise may not have been available in their primary job function. We believe our flexible workforce initiatives can add to our ability to attract and retain our employees, particularly in this tight labor market. And in addition to the training and flexibility we offer, we have also invested significantly in compensation and benefits for our associates. On top of raising our starting wage to $15 last year, we provide a wide array of competitive benefits across many dimensions, including tuition reimbursement, employee product discounts, paid time off for part-time associates, backup child care, child tutor reimbursement, mental health support and many others. Overall, we are operating with a smaller field workforce than we were prepandemic, which is very reflective how the business model has changed as our online revenue has more than doubled from 2 years ago. We feel like we are largely at the right number as it relates to the strategic evolution of our operating model, the demand we are seeing and the nature of our customer interactions. What is most important right now is to continue to learn and iterate. As you can imagine, having a more flexible workforce is a very important component of our operating with a smaller workforce. And technology is crucial to its success as well. In fact, technology is the underpinning to the success of our company strategy. We need technology tools and capabilities to help us as we transform and evolve the way we operate. This fact has been clearly reinforced by all of our pilots. 
There are a myriad of technology projects in development, but here are just a few examples. We will leverage the electronic sign labels in our stores to make it simpler and more seamless for customers to shop, especially in our stores with smaller shopping square footage. Specifically, we are adding messaging to the labels that mimics our dot-com experience. In other words, customers will easily be able to see if the product is in stock in that store or in another store nearby and when it could be delivered and installed. We are also piloting mobile app checkout so the customers, particularly grab-and-go customers, can quickly check out without needing to interact with an associate. For our virtual store to really come to life seamlessly for our customers, we are building out a new digital communication platform that will combine multiple systems into one experience for call, chat, video and screen sharing. This will quickly and seamlessly put our customers in control of how and when they want to be served across these vehicles. Of course, we are also continuing to make significant investments in fundamental technology capabilities like data and analytics and broader cloud migration in order to drive scale, efficiency and effectiveness. Earlier this month, fast company named us to its 2021 list of the 100 Best Workplaces for Innovators. This is our first time on the list, which recognizes companies that created cultures of innovation despite the challenges posed by the pandemic. 
During the quarter, we continued to expand our assortment in newer categories where we can leverage our ability to commercialize new technology. For example, in the past year, across fitness and wearables, wellness and health, we have more than doubled our vendor partners and grew our SKU count by more than 150%. These include new products important to our health strategy, specifically those focused on conditional health management that help customers track blood glucose levels, keep tabs on heart data, manage weight or even help identify allergens in foods. Furthermore, we are working with hospitals and care centers to curate health products for their patients on co-branded landing pages. 
Because customers are looking to us to complete their solutions, we are also expanding to additional adjacent categories. For example, we have expanded our assortment in categories like outdoor living as more and more consumers look to make over or upgrade their outdoor spaces. This includes products like patio furniture, grills, fire pits and electric mowers, to name a few. Many of these products are available online only as part of our digital-first strategy. Altogether, they are a small part of our overall business, but growing fast as we continue to add to the assortment. In the back half of the year, we expect to add more products in the fitness, beauty, sleep, pain management, vision, hearing and electric transportation categories. 
Before I conclude my prepared remarks, I want to update you on our ongoing commitment to inclusion and diversity and our community. During the second quarter, we announced our commitment to spend at least $1.2 billion with BIPOC and diverse businesses by 2025. This pledge includes plans to increase all forms of spending with black, indigenous and people of color businesses from nearly every corner of the company from how we bring goods and services to stores to where and how we advertise. The goal is to create a stronger community of diverse suppliers and to help increase BIPOC representation in the tech industry. 
In addition, earlier this month, we announced we are investing up to $10 million with Brown Venture Group, a venture capital firm that focuses exclusively on black, Latino and indigenous technology startups. The goal of this investment is to help break down the systemic barriers often faced by BIPOC entrepreneurs, including lack of access to funding and empowering the next tech generation. 
To make a difference in our local communities, we are passionate about building out our Teen Tech Center program. These provide teams in disinvested communities access to the training, tools and mentorship needed to succeed in post-secondary opportunities and careers. We are also building a diverse talent pipeline for jobs of the future. During the second quarter, we launched our first-ever opportunity for customers to donate to the Best Buy Foundation in support of Teen Tech Centers. Between July 11 and September 11, customers can choose to donate when they make a purchase, including at Best Buy store, bestbuy.com or the Best Buy app. We also just published our 16th annual ESG report, which outlines how we are working across the company to have a positive impact on our planet, employees, customers and communities. 
In terms of the environment, this past year, we exceeded our goal to reduce carbon emissions in our operations by 60% through investments in renewable energy and operational improvements. We are on track to reduce our carbon emissions 75% by 2030. And we signed the Climate Pledge Committee to be carbon neutral by 2040, a decade faster than our previous goal of 2050. We also have a robust trade-in program that brings a useful second life to products that might otherwise sit idle in someone's home or end up in a landfill. For products that need to be recycled, we continue to operate the most comprehensive consumer electronics and appliances take-back program in the U.S., taking back more than 2 billion pounds since 2009. Available on our corporate website, our ESG report also outlines the ways we support our employees and communities. 
In summary, we have delivered a remarkable first half against a volatile backdrop. I am so proud of the execution of our teams as they continue to safely meet the needs of our customers in ways that I would argue no one else can. Based on the strength of the business and our expectations for continued customer demand, we are raising our sales outlook for the back half. Of course, the environment as it relates to the pandemic is still rapidly evolving, and there is uncertainty as to the associated impact on many important factors, including consumer shopping behavior, share of wallet on services like dining and travel, return to office and return to school. Furthermore, we continue to believe the holiday season will remain unique against that backdrop. That being said, our teams have proven they can and will continue to proactively navigate these factors, and they remain ready to respond and adjust the business as the environment potentially changes. 
Over the longer term, we are fundamentally in a stronger position than we expected to be in just 2 years ago. There has been a dramatic and structural increase in the need for technology. And we now serve a much larger install base of consumer electronics with customers who have an elevated appetite to upgrade due to constant technology innovation and needs that reflect permanent life changes like hybrid work and streaming entertainment content. This is only underscored by the recent Senate passage of the Infrastructure Bill, which will provide even more access to broadband and give us the opportunity to serve the needs of currently underserved communities. Our unique omnichannel assets, including our ability to inspire what is possible across the breadth of CE products as well as our ability to keep it all working together the way customers want, truly differentiate us going forward in this new landscape. 
Now I would like to turn the call over to Matt for details on our results and insights on our outlook for the next quarter and the full year."
255397,1674861568,2384687,"Best Buy Co., Inc., Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 24, 2021",2021-08-24,"Earnings Calls","Best Buy Co., Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone. We are once again reporting very strong financial results as the demand for the products and services we provide remained high during the quarter. On Enterprise revenue of $11.8 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per s",1655,"Good morning, everyone. We are once again reporting very strong financial results as the demand for the products and services we provide remained high during the quarter. On Enterprise revenue of $11.8 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.98, an increase of 74% versus last year. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 6.9% increased 100 basis points. This rate expansion was driven by an 80-basis-point improvement in our gross profit rate. Despite lapping actions to reduce our SG&A spend last year, we were able to leverage our SG&A 20 basis points on the higher sales volume. In addition, a lower effective tax rate had a $0.47 favorable year-over-year impact on our non-GAAP diluted EPS. As a reminder, in Q2 of last year, our stores were closed to customer traffic for about half the quarter while we were helping customers through our curbside service and in-store appointments. We also made several cost-reduction decisions last year to align with the lower sales and channel trends we were seeing and expecting to continue at that point. 
As Corie mentioned, when comparing our results against 2 years ago or the second quarter of our fiscal '20, total revenue grew more than 24%. Also, our Domestic store channel revenue was higher than 2 years ago despite almost 50 fewer stores and online revenue growth of almost 150% in that time frame. As a result of the higher revenue and adjusting our business model to a new customer shopping behavior, our Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate was 290 basis points higher this quarter than the comparable quarter from 2 years ago. 
Let me now share a few comments on how our Q2 performance compared to the outlook we shared on our last call. Enterprise comparable sales growth of 20% was above our estimate of approximately 17%. Our non-GAAP gross profit rate improved 80 basis points versus last year compared to our outlook of approximately flat. As Corie stated, this better-than-expected gross profit rate performance was primarily driven by a more favorable promotional environment. Lastly, non-GAAP SG&A dollars grew 18% compared to last year, which was slightly favorable to our outlook of approximately 20% growth. 
Let me now share more details specific to our second quarter. In our Domestic segment, revenue for the quarter increased 21% to $11 billion. Our comparable sales growth was also 21% for the quarter. In recent quarters, our revenue growth has been lower than our comparable sales growth due to the loss of revenue from stores that were permanently closed in the past year. Although that was still true this quarter, that impact was partially offset by revenue growth from stores that were closed for remodel as a result of last year's unrest and fall outside of our comparable sales calculation. As a reminder, our comparable sales calculation includes revenue from all stores that were temporarily closed or operating in our curbside-only operating model during the period. This year, we expect to close approximately 30 U.S. stores compared to roughly 20 closures in each of the last 2 years. Consistent with our previous practice, we will make every effort to retain the employees from the closing locations. From a monthly cadence perspective, the strongest sales growth was in May. As expected, July's monthly comp was the lowest of the quarter as we lapped the reopening of our stores in June of last year. 
Turning now to gross profit. The Domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 90 basis points to 23.7%. The higher gross profit rate was driven by improved product margin rates, rate leverage from our supply chain costs and higher profit sharing revenue from our private label and co-branded credit card arrangement. Overall, the promotional mix and sales discounts for the full quarter were once again lower than the levels we experienced last year. However, our comparisons are now beginning to lap periods of very low promotional activity last year. In July, the overall promotional activity increased versus last year, but was still below the levels we experienced during fiscal '20. 
Moving next to SG&A. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A increased 19% compared to last year and decreased 30 basis points as a percentage of revenue. As expected, the largest drivers of the expense increase versus last year were: first, higher incentive compensation for corporate and field employees of approximately $100 million, which is partially due to the suspension of our short-term incentive program last year; second, higher store payroll costs to changes in our operating model last year; and third, the impact of lapping our COVID-related impacts last year that resulted in higher cost this year for advertising expense, medical claims expense and our 401(k) company match. Lastly, we increased investments this year in support of our technology initiatives. 
When comparing to 2 years ago, Domestic non-GAAP SG&A increased $94 million and decreased 310 basis points as a percentage of revenue. The largest drivers of the increase versus fiscal '20 were higher incentive compensation, technology investments and increased variable costs due to the higher sales volume. Partially offsetting these items was lower store payroll expense. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 8.4% versus 23% last year. The lower Q2 fiscal '22 rate was primarily due to a multijurisdiction, multiyear noncash benefit from the resolution of certain discrete tax matters. 
Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $4.3 billion in cash. At the end of Q2, our inventory balance was 55% higher than last year's comparable period and was 23% higher than our Q2 ending inventory balance from 2 years ago. The increased inventory represents our plans to support the current demand for technology as well as last year's unusually low inventory balance. The health of our inventory remains very strong. 
Let me next share more color on our outlook for the second half of fiscal '22 and our updated assumptions for the full year. As we entered the year, we expected revenue growth to be positive in the first half of the year and then negative in the back half as we lap the strong comp growth in Q3 and Q4 of fiscal '21. Our original outlook also reflected a scenario in which customers would resume or accelerate spend in areas that were slowed during the pandemic, such as travel and dining out. Although we are seeing some shift in consumer spending occur, the impact has been less pronounced than we previously anticipated. We now expect our comparable sales growth to be down 3% to flat to last year in the back half, which is a significant improvement from the high single-digit decline we expected entering the year. Like other companies, we continue to monitor the evolving impacts of the pandemic and supply chain pressures driven by global demand. We continue to be confident in our ability to navigate the ever-changing environment. For the second half of the year, we expect non-GAAP gross profit rate to be down approximately 30 basis points to last year, which compares to 60 basis points of expansion in the first half of the year. The primary drivers of the sequential decrease include the impact of rolling out Total Tech, increased promotional activity and less leverage on our supply chain costs than we experienced in the first half of this year. The gross profit rate pressure of our new membership offering primarily relates to the incremental customer benefits and the associated costs compared to our previous Total Tech Support offer. This pressure is expected to have a larger impact to our fourth quarter than in the third quarter. 
Now I will provide some color specific to our outlook for the third quarter. We expect comparable sales to be in the range of down 3% to down 1% to last year, which is on top of our 23% comparable sales growth in the third quarter of last year. Our revenue growth to start this quarter has been approximately flat to last year for the first 3 weeks. From a gross profit rate perspective, we are planning for a non-GAAP rate that is approximately 30 basis points below last year's rate. From a non-GAAP SG&A standpoint, we are planning dollars to be approximately flat compared to last year as we expect the lapping of last year's -- as we expect the lapping of last year's $40 million donation to the Best Buy Foundation and lower incentive compensation to be largely offset by increased technology investments and higher advertising expense. 
Turning to our full year outlook. We expect the following: Enterprise revenue in the range of $51 million to $52 billion, comparable sales growth of 9% to 11% and a non-GAAP gross profit rate slightly higher than last year. For SG&A, we expect growth of approximately 9%, which compares to the prior outlook of 6% to 7% growth. The increased expense is primarily due to higher store payroll costs and other variable items associated with the higher sales outlook. In addition, we expect the incentive compensation for the full year to increase by approximately $275 million or at the high end of our previously provided range. We expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 20%. We expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $800 million to $850 million. And lastly, we expect to spend at least $2.5 billion on share repurchases. 
In closing, over the last 2 years, our teams have been -- have successfully adapted to various changes to our operating model and a dramatic shift in customer shopping behavior. We have seen a surge in reliance and demand for technology as our customers also adapt to their changing needs. The result is that we now expect our sales will surpass $51 billion this year. That is more than $7 billion of increased sales over a 2-year period. Thank you to all our employees for driving these amazing results. 
I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

Is everyone sort of passing that through? Or do you see potential increases in promotional activity? 
And then the follow-up to that is, as we think about the Holiday period, right, and in past years, right, other competitors utilizing the category to drive traffic during the holiday period, can you sort of talk about the expectation right for holiday as a whole as it relates to frequency and depth of promotional activity?"

Overall, what we're seeing was the first half of this year was less promotional, similar to the trends we experienced last year during the pandemic. As we -- as I said in my comments, we are starting to see us lap those periods of very low promotionality. As in July, we're actually seeing the mix of items on promotion and the discounts associated with promotions are actually higher than last year. So we're starting to see a bit more return to promotional level that's more than last year, but still higher than still less promotional than 2 years ago. And so we do see that increasing. And over that period of time where promotions have been lower, customers have been essentially paying higher prices because the costs we haven't been promoting as much. And so that's certainly part of the aspect. 
Also within pricing, we certainly are seeing a little bit of inflation as well as you look at the prices of the goods. And in some cases, those are being passed on to consumers. Appliance is an example where there has been increases to the cost of those goods, which the industry is generally passing on. But overall, inflation hasn't been a bigger part of our ASP increases. It's been more on the promotionality versus inflation has been relatively small impact in the first half. It might be a little bit more in the back half, but I wouldn't expect inflation as it relates to pricing to be as significant."

I'll start, and then Matt can talk a little bit about financial ramifications. So what was important to us in Beta was understanding how can we build on some of what we're learning in Total Tech Support in terms of what our customers love, but add on to that what we think will continue to provide them value over time. Like many membership programs, ours is continuing to evolve based on what we are learning distinctly from our customers. And so we started testing Beta actually just at the very beginning of this fiscal year. And as we said in the prepared remarks, we're definitely seeing an uptake that is greater than both what we expected, greater than what we were seeing in Total Tech Support. And I think it's this combination of features that we talked about in the prepared remarks that are making our customers come to us more frequently and like we also said, spend a bit more each time that they're coming to see us because you have this combination that keeps customers very sticky to the Best Buy brand. And so this is really an evolution of what we have learned in Total Tech Support, started testing in the very beginning of this year, and then we plan to actually roll out toward the end of Q3. It will be in place, like Matt said, have a bigger impact for Q4. But the key for us is that we expect the membership

The intent of Total Tech is not to actually drive margin rate. The intent of Total Tech for us to increase sales and therefore, leverage more sales into the future. So the short-term impact certainly is going to be a gross profit rate impact. As you look forward, the intent is for not to be gross profit accretive because what we want people to do is to use it more. That usage will create more sales and create more leverage on our bottom line in the future. And that's kind of the take. But as you would imagine, the enhancements to come with more costs, but we believe that will keep people stickier and coming back and increase our share of wallet with them."

You previously assumed that we get more like down high single digits. It sounds like the difference being that consumers have yet to really shift their wallet to the categories that you expected. Do you think this reflects some permanent change in behavior? Or it's going to happen, it's just that it's not going to happen in the second half of the year and it's gone more like a 2022 event? And within that, can you also give us an indication of how you factored in any sort of composition of your inventory in the back half? Meaning while it's up significantly overall, are there any areas where you might be a little short on inventory that would lead to some out of stocks and you factor that into the flight to down 3%."

We noted in the prepared remarks that we definitely are seeing that shift happens slower than what we thought. And it's less than a shift. It's actually been -- for a while, we're seeing growth in both sides. And as Matt said, as the pandemic has kind of redoubled its efforts, we've seen it shifting away a little bit from some of the experiences. But we've just seen this growth continue, honestly, in both experiences and on the retail side. 
I think we're pragmatic. And we've said in the prepared remarks, we believe at some point, that shift will continue to happen. I think it is being pushed out of it. But importantly, there are also systemic changes that have happened in the way that all of us live, right? If you think about something like hybrid work models, that's not just something that's going to happen in the back half or in a quarter. That is likely a new way of working going forward. Or streaming and the amount of streaming content, that's not just in the moment change. That is a change in how people will consume content going forward. And so I think, honestly, you have a little bit of both sides here. You have real systemic changes that happened have in the way that we live. And there's, I think, been a pushout in people really shifting hard that spending to experiences. And then part of that just being how healthy the consumer is in terms of sales, savings rates that are at all-time highs and very healthy balance sheet, access to credit. And all of those fundamentals being really solid, I think, is helping buoy this demand across both experiences and retail."

We feel like we're in a good spot as we look at the back half of this year. I think you asked about inventory. We are still seeing pockets of inventory. But quite honestly, we're in a really healthy strong position and are preparing ourselves very, very well for the holiday season. So that clearly adds to our optimism to the back half as well.

But overall, I would say, the promotionality, we would say probably a little bit higher than what we experienced last year or fiscal '21, but still less promotional than we saw in fiscal '20 starting right now. Again, we'll look at that and manage it as it comes and as we see the holiday unfold a little bit because we will fundamentally always be competitive.

And in many cases, it's because people have consumer electronics for multiple locations and use cases in their lives, right? In the hybrid work model, I might have one set up at home. I might have one set up at work. I might even have one set up for on the go. And so you've seen this deeper penetration than ever into people's homes and lives. What's interesting about that is you hit on in terms of innovation. I mean obviously, you've got some of the world's largest companies that have both benefited from that deeper penetration, but also, of course, are going to continue innovate in a way that will inspire customers to replace. And we're definitely seeing, to your point, those replacement cycles condensing down as new attributes are coming online that are really useful to people. I mean if you think about the evolution of just cameras in computers over the last year because so many people are using video, now you've got cameras that track you even in tablets. And so there's just going to be this constant drive to be the next new interesting features and attributes that you add to products. And really what's fascinating is based on survey data that we're looking at right now, intent to purchase remains very high in the next 12-month window, which to us says you've got people who already are trying to think about what might be that either add-on or upgrade that's going to help me live through maybe another year of on and off at-home schooling or another extended period of working from home. And so while these are really difficult numbers to get our arms around in terms of upgrade frequency, we are for sure seeing a customer that more and more often is looking for those new attributes. And then importantly, vendor partners who are really working hard to create that next suite of solutions that will kind of solve what we just talked about as being really fundamental structural changes in how we're living our lives."

So just as a reminder,  there are 3 main aspects to our health strategy. The first is the consumer health category. We talked a lot about that today, which is how you monitor chronic conditions such as diabetes or heart disease and expanding our assortment of health care products in the way that only we can when it comes to commercializing new technology. The second area is active aging, which is all about emergency response, device-based tools that can help those who wish to live independently in their homes. And that builds on some of the acquisitions that we've already seen. And then the third, which is a little bit more nascent, is virtual care. And that includes digital health caring center services that can connect patients and physicians to enable virtual care and remote patient monitoring. That was the most nascent, and that one will take the longest to develop. The first 2, we remain really bullish. And you can hear even in our prepared remarks, the amount of devices that are proliferating right now to help people manage their own care is absolutely incredible. And so on the consumer side, we feel really strong as well as the active aging side, where we're starting to see that business rebound especially as we're starting to more people come back into our stores. And I think the appetite, as you think about virtual care, especially given the last 18 months that we've all gone through and that ability to not always rely on an in-person hospital visit, but instead be able to monitor some of your vitals, I think, obviously, there's an even greater use case now than there was 18 months ago. So when I put all of that together, I think broadly, we remain really optimistic about how the future of health care can be changed through technology and the role that we can play in that."

Comparable sales growth was 20%, and our non-GAAP operating income growth was 40%. We are lapping an unusual quarter last year as our stores were limited to curbside service or in-store appointments for roughly half the quarter. When we compare to 2 years ago, our results are very strong. Compared to the second quarter of fiscal '20, revenue was up 24%, and our non-GAAP operating income is up 115%. Clearly, customer demand for technology products and services during the quarter remained very strong. 
Customers continue to leverage technology to meet their needs, and we provide solutions that help them work, learn, entertain, cook and connect at home. The demand was also bolstered by an overall strong consumer spending, aided by government stimulus, improving wages and high savings levels. From a merchandising perspective, we saw strong comparable sales growth in almost all categories. The biggest contributors to the sales growth in the quarter were home theater, appliances, computing, mobile phones and services. 
Product availability improved in the quarter. And except for some pockets in appliances and home theater, we do not believe it materially limited our overall sales growth. Our merchant demand planning and supply chain teams once again did an amazing job managing through the difficult and constantly evolving supply chain environment. They worked strategically to bring in as much inventory as possible during the quarter with actions like acquiring additional transportation, pulling up product flow, and adjusting store assortment based on availability. There will continue to be challenges, particularly as it relates to congested ports and transportation disruptions. But our teams have set us up for as strong an inventory position as possible as we move forward into the back half of the year. 
As we think about the holiday period, we often have varying degrees of inventory and supply chain challenges, and this year will be no different. But we feel confident in our ability to serve our customers during the holiday. The continued strong demand across retail resulted in an overall less promotional environment, which was a significant driver of our better-than-expected profitability in the quarter. 
During the quarter, we provided customers multiple ways to interact with us depending on their needs, preference, and comfort. Similar to last quarter, customers migrated back into stores to touch and feel products and to seek in-person expertise and service. At the same time, they continue to interact with us digitally at a significantly higher rate than prepandemic as online sales were 32% of Domestic revenues compared to 16% in Q2 of fiscal '20. Phone and chat volume also remained very high compared to prepandemic, and sales via these channels continue to climb. 
In addition, of course, we are interacting with customers in their homes, making large product deliveries, installing solutions, repairing products, and providing sales consultations. In fact, overall, we are helping our customers with their technology needs in their homes 20% more than we did 2 years ago in Q2 of fiscal '20. Through all of these interactions, across all of these touchpoints, 98% of survey customers tell us they feel very safe, which we believe is still incredibly important at this stage in the pandemic. I want to genuinely thank our store and in-home teams for creating this safe environment for our customers and for continuing to provide exceptional service even in situations where customers resisted following safety guidelines and, in some cases, were disrespectful. 
For customers purchasing online, we delivered products with speed and convenience. Online sales package delivery was not only much faster than last year, it was faster than 2 years ago. Furthermore, we stack up extremely well versus our competition. Using a third-party service, we analyzed competitor websites on a daily basis, and we consistently lead in the proportion of 1 day or less for published shipping time across a sample of higher-volume ZIP codes and higher-demand items. 
In addition, we leveraged our stores to drive fast and convenient fulfillment of online orders. In Q2, we continue to see about 60% of our online revenue fulfilled by stores, including in-store or curbside pickup, ship-from-store or Best Buy employees who are delivering product to customers out of more than 450 of our stores. The percent of online sales picked up by customers at our stores was 42%, similar to last year's second quarter. Clearly, the landscape, as it relates to the pandemic, has been changing rapidly and we remain keenly focused on keeping our employees and customers safe. 
We are continuing to encourage all employees to get COVID vaccinations by providing them with paid time off when they receive the vaccine and providing them absence time to be used in the event they develop side effects. In June, we launched an employee sweepstakes with more than $100,000 in cash prices to encourage our team members to get vaccinated. To show our appreciation for their hard work and ongoing efforts in the face of pandemic fatigue, we paid employee gratitude bonuses at the beginning of the quarter. In summary, our team has delivered incredible results. To all of our associates across the company, I thank you for your customer obsession, perseverance, and ingenuity. 
Of course, while we were driving these great Q2 results, we were also looking to the future. During the quarter, we continued to roll out and run several tests and pilots as we determine the best path forward to become an even more customer-centric, digitally focused and efficient company. We believe this is crucial to thriving in a new and different environment where customers expect to seamlessly interact with physical and digital channels throughout the shopping journey as they seek inspiration, research, convenience and support.
Last year, we introduced a very important membership pilot called Best Buy Beta. As a reminder, it includes unlimited Geek Squad technical support on all of the technology in their home no matter where or when you purchased it, including 24/7 VIP access to dedicated phone and chat teams that are only available to members. It also includes up to 24 months of product protection on most purchases from Best Buy, free delivery and standard installation, exclusive member pricing, a 60-day extended return window and free shipping of online orders, all for $199 per year. 
The offer is designed to give our customers the confidence that whatever their technology needs are, we will be there to help. It leverages our unique strengths and what we can provide customers that no one else can. The goal is to create a membership experience that customers will love, which in turn results in a higher customer lifetime value and drives a larger share of CE spend to Best Buy. We are very excited about this membership offer, and we are encouraged by the pilot results. Membership acquisition has exceeded our initial forecast. In addition, data is showing that Beta members interact more frequently and have a higher incremental spend than nonmembers. Given the breadth of the offer, it is resonating well across all customer demographics, and our members are skewing younger than our Total Tech Support membership program. In addition, our employees love telling customers about the program. 
We plan to scale the program nationally in stores and online at the end of Q3 under the new name Best Buy Total Tech. As part of the national rollout, we will be converting our 3.1 million existing Total Tech Support members to the new program. I want to stress that the goal of the program is for customers to find value in the benefits and use them often. It is not designed to be a stand-alone, margin-driving service offering, particularly in the near term. In fact, as Matt will discuss later, a full rollout is a near-term investment, which we are confident will be justified with incremental sales growth and long-term customer value. 
As it relates to our physical stores and operating model, we are continuing to pilot and test many approaches and formats. Specifically, we are testing more experiential stores, how we can leverage our stores and facilities for more fulfillment purposes and how we can deliver customer experiences with a more flexible, digitally supported and engaged workforce. 
We are not going to outline all of our initiatives today, but I would like to provide a few updates and learnings. We have begun implementing the pilot of our new holistic market approach in Charlotte. As we mentioned last quarter, this pilot is designed to leverage all our assets in a portfolio strategy across stores, fulfillment, services, an outlet, lockers, our digital app and both in-store and In-Home Consultation labor. 
We will be testing an array of different prototypes, including remodeling a number of stores to 15,000, 25,000 and 35,000 square foot stores as well as launching a few new smaller 5,000 square foot stores. We expect the full rollout of the pilot to span a few quarters. And several store remodels are currently underway, including the transition of 1 store into a new type of outlet. Our current 15 outlet stores focus mainly on large appliance and TV open-box product. 
With this new outlet pilot, we will have open-box products from all categories. It will also serve as the hub in a new services repair hub-and-spoke model we are testing as well as an auto tech mega-hub for our car tech installation. Of course, the reason we are piloting and testing so much is because we are trying some unique prototypes, and we need the opportunity to learn and adjust before we roll more broadly. 
For example, in our 4 Minneapolis test stores where we reduced the shoppable square footage to 15,000 square feet to provide more space for fulfillment, we have been making adjustments based on customer and employee feedback. We've reflowed some of the layouts, added signage to help customers understand the changes we are testing and added assortment in areas like small appliances, printing and accessories. We will continue to evolve these test stores based on learnings and feedback. As it relates to our Houston experiential 35,000 square foot store pilot, we continue to receive positive feedback from customers and employees on store design and the way we are showcasing products. In addition, year-to-date, this store generated higher revenue than control stores in the double-digit percent range. 
Another pilot that we are excited to launch preholiday is our virtual store. For this, we are building out a physical store in one of our distribution centers that will have merchandising and products and will be staffed by dedicated associates, including vendor-provided expert labor, but it will have no physical customers. Instead, customers can interact with our experts via chat, audio, video and screen sharing depending on their preference and be able to see live demos, displays and physical products. 
We are excited about the customer use cases this provides. For example, you could be on our dot-com experience, click on a product you like and be connected via video to a Blue Shirt in the Best Buy virtual store and never lead your living room. Or you could be standing in a store, scan a bar code and be taken through your phone directly to this virtual store where an associate could answer your question. 
From a fulfillment perspective, our ship-from-store hubs we piloted last year were very successful and we are continuing to iterate on the model. As a reminder, while all stores will continue to ship online orders, we are driving efficiency and effectiveness by consolidating ship-from-store units in a limited number of stores across the country. As we evolve the model overall, we are using fewer stores than last year as hubs. 
In addition, we've begun remodeling a subset of stores to deliver an even greater portion of the volume, reducing the sales floor square footage and installing warehouse-grade packaging station equipment and supplies. These 13 locations should be rolled out by holiday and take on about 25% of the national ship-from-store volume. As you would expect, the various tests and pilots are intended to identify how our store portfolio should evolve from the role they serve to their look and feel. As we learn from these tests, we will develop plans that likely include a rollout of investments in more stores and markets. 
We have also been evolving our labor model to meet our customers' changing shopping behaviors. For our employees, we are designing for more choice, flexibility and career opportunity. We continue to see momentum with our flexible workforce initiative, which is centered on store employees becoming certified to gain expertise to perform roles outside of their primary job function. At the end of July, 80% of our associates were eligible to flex into different work zones, and 50% of associates have earned 4 or more jobs. This allows our employees and us to schedule shifts more flexibly within the store and between channels, like virtual sales, chat, phone, remote support or employee product delivery. And very soon, we will be able to schedule associates between stores within a market. 
This flexibility is important for all of our stores going forward, but even more important for our smaller stores with less labor. This new way of working empowers employees to develop their careers by giving them opportunities to learn new skills, broaden their experience and have more flexibility in their jobs. They are equipped to confidently help customers in more ways. And our data is showing us that once employees add skills they tend to drive a higher customer NPS. It also gives team members the ability to earn a different hourly wage depending on the job performed and the potential for working additional shifts that otherwise may not have been available in their primary job function. 
We believe our flexible workforce initiatives can add to our ability to attract and retain our employees, particularly in this tight labor market. And in addition to the training and flexibility we offer, we have also invested significantly in compensation and benefits for our associates. On top of raising our starting wage to $15 last year, we provide a wide array of competitive benefits across many dimensions, including tuition reimbursement, employee product discounts, paid time off for part-time associates, backup child care, child tutor reimbursement, mental health support and many others. 
Overall, we are operating with a smaller field workforce than we were prepandemic, which is very reflective how the business model has changed as our online revenue has more than doubled from 2 years ago. We feel like we are largely at the right number as it relates to the strategic evolution of our operating model, the demand we are seeing and the nature of our customer interactions. What is most important right now is to continue to learn and iterate. 
As you can imagine, having a more flexible workforce is a very important component of our operating with a smaller workforce. And technology is crucial to its success as well. In fact, technology is the underpinning to the success of our company strategy. We need technology tools and capabilities to help us as we transform and evolve the way we operate. This fact has been clearly reinforced by all of our pilots. 
There are a myriad of technology projects in development, but here are just a few examples. We will leverage the electronic sign labels in our stores to make it simpler and more seamless for customers to shop, especially in our stores with smaller shopping square footage. Specifically, we are adding messaging to the labels that mimics our dot-com experience. In other words, customers will easily be able to see if the product is in stock in that store or in another store nearby and when it could be delivered and installed. 
We are also piloting mobile app checkout so that customers, particularly grab-and-go customers, can quickly check out without needing to interact with an associate. For our virtual store to really come to life seamlessly for our customers, we are building out a new digital communication platform that will combine multiple systems into one experience for call, chat, video and screen sharing. This will quickly and seamlessly put our customers in control of how and when they want to be served across these vehicles. 
Of course, we are also continuing to make significant investments in fundamental technology capabilities like data and analytics and broader cloud migration in order to drive scale, efficiency and effectiveness. Earlier this month, Fast Company named us to its 2021 list of the 100 Best Workplaces for Innovators. This is our first time on the list, which recognizes companies that created cultures of innovation despite the challenges posed by the pandemic. 
During the quarter, we continued to expand our assortment in newer categories where we can leverage our ability to commercialize new technology. For example, in the past year, across fitness and wearables, wellness and health, we have more than doubled our vendor partners and grew our SKU count by more than 150%. These include new products important to our health strategy, specifically those focused on conditional health management that help customers track blood glucose levels, keep tabs on heart data, manage weight or even help identify allergens in foods. Furthermore, we are working with hospitals and care centers to curate health products for their patients on co-branded landing pages. 
Because customers are looking to us to complete their solutions, we are also expanding to additional adjacent categories. For example, we have expanded our assortment in categories like outdoor living as more and more consumers look to makeover or upgrade their outdoor spaces. This includes products like patio furniture, grills, fire pits and electric mowers, to name a few. Many of these products are available online only as part of our digital-first strategy. Altogether, they are a small part of our overall business, but growing fast as we continue to add to the assortment. In the back half of the year, we expect to add more products in the fitness, beauty, sleep, pain management, vision, hearing and electric transportation categories. 
Before I conclude my prepared remarks, I want to update you on our ongoing commitment to inclusion and diversity and our community. During the second quarter, we announced our commitment to spend at least $1.2 billion with BIPOC and diverse businesses by 2025. This pledge includes plans to increase all forms of spending with black, indigenous and people of color businesses from nearly every corner of the company from how we bring goods and services to stores to where and how we advertise. The goal is to create a stronger community of diverse suppliers and to help increase BIPOC representation in the tech industry. 
In addition, earlier this month, we announced we are investing up to $10 million with Brown Venture Group, a venture capital firm that focuses exclusively on black, Latino and indigenous technology startups. The goal of this investment is to help break down the systemic barriers often faced by BIPOC entrepreneurs, including lack of access to funding and empowering the next tech generation. 
To make a difference in our local communities, we are passionate about building out our Teen Tech Center program. These provide teens in disinvested communities access to the training, tools and mentorship needed to succeed in postsecondary opportunities and careers. We are also building a diverse talent pipeline for jobs of the future. During the second quarter, we launched our first-ever opportunity for customers to donate to the Best Buy Foundation in support of Teen Tech Centers. Between July 11 and September 11, customers can choose to donate when they make a purchase, including at Best Buy store, bestbuy.com or the Best Buy app. We also just published our 16th annual ESG report, which outlines how we are working across the company to have a positive impact on our planet, employees, customers and communities. 
In terms of the environment, this past year, we exceeded our goal to reduce carbon emissions in our operations by 60% through investments in renewable energy and operational improvements. We are on track to reduce our carbon emissions 75% by 2030. And we signed the Climate Pledge, committed to be carbon neutral by 2040, a decade faster than our previous goal of 2050. We also have a robust trade-in program that brings a useful second life to products that might otherwise sit idle in someone's home or end up in a landfill. For products that need to be recycled, we continue to operate the most comprehensive consumer electronics and appliances take-back program in the U.S., taking back more than 2 billion pounds since 2009. Available on our corporate website, our ESG report also outlines the ways we support our employees and communities. 
In summary, we have delivered a remarkable first half against a volatile backdrop. I am so proud of the execution of our teams as they continue to safely meet the needs of our customers in ways that I would argue no one else can. Based on the strength of the business and our expectations for continued customer demand, we are raising our sales outlook for the back half. Of course, the environment as it relates to the pandemic is still rapidly evolving, and there is uncertainty as to the associated impact on many important factors, including consumer shopping behavior, share of wallet on services like dining and travel, return to office and return to school. Furthermore, we continue to believe the holiday season will remain unique against that backdrop. That being said, our teams have proven they can and will continue to proactively navigate these factors, and they remain ready to respond and adjust the business as the environment potentially changes. 
Over the longer term, we are fundamentally in a stronger position than we expected to be in just 2 years ago. There has been a dramatic and structural increase in the need for technology. And we now serve a much larger install base of consumer electronics with customers who have an elevated appetite to upgrade due to constant technology innovation and needs that reflect permanent life changes like hybrid work and streaming entertainment content. This is only underscored by the recent Senate passage of the Infrastructure Bill, which will provide even more access to broadband and give us the opportunity to serve the needs of currently underserved communities. Our unique omnichannel assets, including our ability to inspire what is possible across the breadth of CE products as well as our ability to keep it all working together the way customers want, truly differentiate us going forward in this new landscape. 
Now I would like to turn the call over to Matt for details on our results and insights on our outlook for the next quarter and the full year."
255397,1674861568,2384801,"Best Buy Co., Inc., Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 24, 2021",2021-08-24,"Earnings Calls","Best Buy Co., Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone. We are once again reporting very strong financial results as the demand for the products and services we provide remained high during the quarter. On Enterprise revenue of $11.8 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per s",1656,"Good morning, everyone. We are once again reporting very strong financial results as the demand for the products and services we provide remained high during the quarter. On Enterprise revenue of $11.8 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.98, an increase of 74% versus last year. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 6.9% increased 100 basis points. This rate expansion was driven by an 80-basis-point improvement in our gross profit rate. Despite lapping actions to reduce our SG&A spend last year, we were able to leverage our SG&A 20 basis points on the higher sales volume. In addition, a lower effective tax rate had a $0.47 favorable year-over-year impact on our non-GAAP diluted EPS. As a reminder, in Q2 of last year, our stores were closed to customer traffic for about half the quarter while we were helping customers through our curbside service and in-store appointments. We also made several cost-reduction decisions last year to align with the lower sales and channel trends we were seeing and expecting to continue at that point. 
As Corie mentioned, when comparing our results against 2 years ago or the second quarter of our fiscal '20, total revenue grew more than 24%. Also, our Domestic store channel revenue was higher than 2 years ago despite almost 50 fewer stores and online revenue growth of almost 150% in that time frame. As a result of the higher revenue and adjusting our business model to a new customer shopping behavior, our Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate was 290 basis points higher this quarter than the comparable quarter from 2 years ago. 
Let me now share a few comments on how our Q2 performance compared to the outlook we shared on our last call. Enterprise comparable sales growth of 20% was above our estimate of approximately 17%. Our non-GAAP gross profit rate improved 80 basis points versus last year compared to our outlook of approximately flat. As Corie stated, this better-than-expected gross profit rate performance was primarily driven by a more favorable promotional environment. Lastly, non-GAAP SG&A dollars grew 18% compared to last year, which was slightly favorable to our outlook of approximately 20% growth. 
Let me now share more details specific to our second quarter. In our Domestic segment, revenue for the quarter increased 21% to $11 billion. Our comparable sales growth was also 21% for the quarter. In recent quarters, our revenue growth has been lower than our comparable sales growth due to the loss of revenue from stores that were permanently closed in the past year. Although that was still true this quarter, that impact was partially offset by revenue growth from stores that were closed for remodel as a result of last year's unrest and fall outside of our comparable sales calculation. 
As a reminder, our comparable sales calculation includes revenue from all stores that were temporarily closed or operating in our curbside-only operating model during the period. This year, we expect to close approximately 30 U.S. stores compared to roughly 20 closures in each of the last 2 years. Consistent with our previous practice, we will make every effort to retain the employees from the closing locations. From a monthly cadence perspective, the strongest sales growth was in May. As expected, July's monthly comp was the lowest of the quarter as we lapped the reopening of our stores in June of last year. 
Turning now to gross profit. The Domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 90 basis points to 23.7%. The higher gross profit rate was driven by improved product margin rates, rate leverage from our supply chain costs and higher profit sharing revenue from our private label and co-branded credit card arrangement. Overall, the promotional mix and sales discounts for the full quarter were once again lower than the levels we experienced last year. However, our comparisons are now beginning to lap periods of very low promotional activity last year. In July, the overall promotional activity increased versus last year, but was still below the levels we experienced during fiscal '20. 
Moving next to SG&A. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A increased 19% compared to last year and decreased 30 basis points as a percentage of revenue. As expected, the largest drivers of the expense increase versus last year were: first, higher incentive compensation for corporate and field employees of approximately $100 million, which is partially due to the suspension of our short-term incentive program last year; second, higher store payroll costs due to changes in our operating model last year; and third, the impact of lapping our COVID-related impacts last year that resulted in higher cost this year for advertising expense, medical claims expense and our 401(k) company match. Lastly, we increased investments this year in support of our technology initiatives. 
When comparing to 2 years ago, Domestic non-GAAP SG&A increased $94 million and decreased 310 basis points as a percentage of revenue. The largest drivers of the increase versus fiscal '20 were higher incentive compensation, technology investments and increased variable costs due to the higher sales volume. Partially offsetting these items was lower store payroll expense. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 8.4% versus 23% last year. The lower Q2 fiscal '22 rate was primarily due to a multijurisdiction, multiyear noncash benefit from the resolution of certain discrete tax matters. 
Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $4.3 billion in cash. At the end of Q2, our inventory balance was 55% higher than last year's comparable period and was 23% higher than our Q2 ending inventory balance from 2 years ago. The increased inventory represents our plans to support the current demand for technology as well as last year's unusually low inventory balance. The health of our inventory remains very strong. 
Let me next share more color on our outlook for the second half of fiscal '22 and our updated assumptions for the full year. As we entered the year, we expected revenue growth to be positive in the first half of the year and then negative in the back half as we lap the strong comp growth in Q3 and Q4 of fiscal '21. Our original outlook also reflected a scenario in which customers would resume or accelerate spend in areas that were slowed during the pandemic, such as travel and dining out.
Although we are seeing some shift in consumer spending occur, the impact has been less pronounced than we previously anticipated. We now expect our comparable sales growth to be down 3% to flat to last year in the back half, which is a significant improvement from the high single-digit decline we expected entering the year. Like other companies, we continue to monitor the evolving impacts of the pandemic and supply chain pressures driven by global demand. 
We continue to be confident in our ability to navigate the ever-changing environment. For the second half of the year, we expect non-GAAP gross profit rate to be down approximately 30 basis points to last year, which compares to 60 basis points of expansion in the first half of the year. The primary drivers of the sequential decrease include the impact of rolling out Total Tech, increased promotional activity and less leverage on our supply chain costs than we experienced in the first half of this year. The gross profit rate pressure of our new membership offering primarily relates to the incremental customer benefits and the associated costs compared to our previous Total Tech Support offer. This pressure is expected to have a larger impact to our fourth quarter than in the third quarter. 
Now I will provide some color specific to our outlook for the third quarter. We expect comparable sales to be in the range of down 3% to down 1% to last year, which is on top of our 23% comparable sales growth in the third quarter of last year. Our revenue growth to start this quarter has been approximately flat to last year for the first 3 weeks. From a gross profit rate perspective, we are planning for a non-GAAP rate that is approximately 30 basis points below last year's rate. From a non-GAAP SG&A standpoint, we are planning dollars to be approximately flat compared to last year as we expect the lapping of last year's -- as we expect the lapping of last year's $40 million donation to the Best Buy Foundation and lower incentive compensation to be largely offset by increased technology investments and higher advertising expense. 
Turning to our full year outlook. We expect the following: Enterprise revenue in the range of $51 billion to $52 billion, comparable sales growth of 9% to 11% and a non-GAAP gross profit rate slightly higher than last year. For SG&A, we expect growth of approximately 9%, which compares to the prior outlook of 6% to 7% growth. The increased expense is primarily due to higher store payroll costs and other variable items associated with the higher sales outlook. In addition, we expect the incentive compensation for the full year to increase by approximately $275 million or at the high end of our previously provided range. We expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 20%. We expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $800 million to $850 million. And lastly, we expect to spend at least $2.5 billion on share repurchases. 
In closing, over the last 2 years, our teams have been -- have successfully adapted to various changes to our operating model and a dramatic shift in customer shopping behavior. We have seen a surge in reliance and demand for technology as our customers also adapt to their changing needs. The result is that we now expect our sales will surpass $51 billion this year. That is more than $7 billion of increased sales over a 2-year period. Thank you to all our employees for driving these amazing results. 
I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

Overall, what we're seeing was the first half of this year was less promotional, similar to the trends we experienced last year during the pandemic. As we -- as I said in my comments, we are starting to see us lap those periods of very low promotionality. As in July, we're actually seeing the mix of items on promotion and the discounts associated with promotions are actually higher than last year. 
So we're starting to see a bit more return to a promotional level that's more than last year, but still higher than -- still less promotional than 2 years ago. And so we do see that increasing. And over that period of time where promotions have been lower, customers have been essentially paying higher prices because the costs -- we haven't been promoting as much. And so that's certainly part of the aspect. 
Also within pricing, we certainly are seeing a little bit of inflation as well as you look at the prices of the goods. And in some cases, those are being passed on to consumers. Appliance is an example where there has been increases to the cost of those goods, which the industry is generally passing on. But overall, inflation hasn't been a bigger part of our ASP increases. It's been more on the promotionality versus inflation that's been relatively small, impacting in the first half. It might be a little bit more in the back half, but I wouldn't expect inflation as it relates to pricing to be as significant."

I'll start, and then Matt can talk a little bit about financial ramifications. So what was important to us in Beta was understanding how can we build on some of what we're learning in Total Tech Support in terms of what our customers love, but add on to that what we think will continue to provide them value over time. 
Like many membership programs, ours is continuing to evolve based on what we are learning distinctly from our customers. And so we started testing Beta actually just at the very beginning of this fiscal year. And as we said in the prepared remarks, we're definitely seeing an uptake that is greater than both what we expected, greater than what we were seeing in Total Tech Support. And I think it's this combination of features that we talked about in the prepared remarks that are making our customers come to us more frequently and like we also said, spend a bit more each time that they're coming to see us, because you have this combination that keeps customers very sticky to the Best Buy brand. 
And so this is really an evolution of what we have learned in Total Tech Support, started testing in the very beginning of this year, and then we plan to actually roll out toward the end of Q3. So it will be in place, like Matt said, have a bigger impact for Q4. But the key for us is that we expect the membership to grow faster than what we saw in TTS, and we've seen it play out in the pilot. And we're going to keep iterating on the offers, frankly, depending on what it is that customers really value and what it is that keeps them loving our brand and very loyal to the brand. I'll let Matt talk a little bit about the financial implications."

And so with that, we're seeing more costs associated with Total Tech. It just has more enhanced benefits than what we had offered in TTS, and that is essentially driving the gross margin profit route, gross margin impact in the back half of this year. 
The intent of Total Tech is not to actually drive margin rate. The intent of Total Tech is for us to increase sales and therefore, leverage more sales into the future. So the short-term impact certainly is going to be a gross profit rate impact. As you look forward, the intent is for not to be gross profit accretive, because what we want people to do is to use it more. 
That usage will create more sales and create more leverage on our bottom line in the future, and that's kind of the Total Tech. But as you would imagine, the enhanced benefits do come with more costs, but we believe that will keep people stickier and coming back and increase our share of wallet with them."

We noted in the prepared remarks that we definitely are seeing that shift happens slower than what we thought. And it's less than a shift. It's actually been -- for a while, we're seeing growth in both sides. And as Matt said, as the pandemic has kind of redoubled its efforts, we've seen it shifting away a little bit from some of the experiences. But we've just seen this growth continue, honestly, in both experiences and on the retail side. 
I think we're pragmatic. And we've said in the prepared remarks, we believe at some point, that shift will continue to happen. I think it is being pushed out a bit. But importantly, there are also systemic changes that have happened in the way that all of us live, right? If you think about something like hybrid work models, that's not just something that's going to happen in the back half or in a quarter. That is likely a new way of working going forward. 
Or streaming and the amount of streaming content, that's not just an in-the-moment change. That is a change in how people will consume content going forward. And so I think, honestly, you have a little bit of both sides here. You have real systemic changes that happened have in the way that we live. And there's, I think, been a pushout in people really shifting hard that spending to experiences. And then part of that, just being how healthy the consumer is in terms of sales, savings rates that are at all-time highs and very healthy balance sheet, access to credit. And all of those fundamentals being really solid, I think, is helping buoy this demand across both experiences and retail."

And in many cases, it's because people have consumer electronics for multiple locations and use cases in their lives, right? In the hybrid work model, I might have one set up at home. I might have one set up at work. I might even have one set up for on the go. And so you've seen this deeper penetration than ever into people's homes and lives. 
What's interesting about that is you hit on in terms of innovation. I mean obviously, you've got some of the world's largest companies that have both benefited from that deeper penetration, but also, of course, are going to continue to innovate in a way that will inspire customers to replace. And we're definitely seeing, to your point, those replacement cycles condensing down as new attributes are coming online that are really useful to people. 
I mean if you think about the evolution of just cameras in computers over the last year because so many people are using video, now you've got cameras that track you even in tablets. And so there's just going to be this constant drive to be the next new interesting features and attributes that you add to products. And really what's fascinating is based on survey data that we're looking at right now, intent to purchase still remains very high in the next 12-month window, which to us says you've got people who already are trying to think about what might be that next product, either add-on or upgrade that's going to help me live through maybe another year of on and off at-home schooling or another extended period of working from home. 
And so while these are really difficult numbers to get our arms around in terms of upgrade frequency, we are, for sure, seeing a customer that more and more often is looking for those new attributes. And then importantly, vendor partners who are really working hard to create that next suite of solutions that will kind of solve what we just talked about as being really fundamental structural changes in how we're living our lives."

We talked a lot about that today, which is how you monitor a chronic conditions such as diabetes or heart disease and expanding our assortment of health care products in the way that only we can when it comes to commercializing new technology. 
The second area is active aging, which is all about emergency response, device-based tools that can help those who wish to live independently in their homes. And that builds on some of the acquisitions that we've already seen. 
And then the third, which is a little bit more nascent, is virtual care. And that includes digital health caring center services that can connect patients and physicians to enable virtual care and remote patient monitoring. That was the most nascent, and that one will take the longest to develop. 
The first 2, we remain really bullish. And you can hear even in our prepared remarks, the amount of devices that are proliferating right now to help people manage their own care is absolutely incredible. And so on the consumer side, we feel really strong as well as the active aging side, where we're starting to see that business rebound especially as we're starting to more people come back into our stores. And I think the appetite, as you think about virtual care, especially given the last 18 months that we've all gone through and that ability to not always rely on an in-person hospital visit, but instead be able to monitor some of your vitals, I think, obviously, there's an even greater use case now than there was 18 months ago.

Again",4104,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we are reporting record Q3 financial results of $11.9 billion in sales and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.08, which is up 1% over last year and up 84% compared to 2 years ago. 
Against a still of all the backdrop, our leaders continue to drive new ways of operating, and our employees continue to do amazing things to support our customers' technology needs and knowledgeable, fast and convenient ways. Our omnichannel capabilities and our ability to inspire and support across all of technology in a way no one else can means we are uniquely positioned to seize the opportunity in this environment and in the future. 
We continue to capitalize on strong customer demand as more people sustainably work, entertain, cook and connect at home. And Domestic comparable sales growth was up 2% on top of 23% last year. From a merchandising perspective, the biggest contributors to our comparable sales growth in the quarter were appliances, home theater and mobile phones. 
Product availability continued to improve throughout quarter. We have pockets of constraints in areas like appliances, gaming and mobile phones. Similar to last quarter, however, we do not believe this materially limited our overall sales growth. While we have faced and continue to face supply chain challenges, including delays and higher costs, we are proactively navigating a situation that we have been dealing with for several quarters as our industry has been facing disruptions and supply constraints since early in the pandemic. 
Our merchant demand planning and supply chain teams made strategic sourcing and inventory decisions early in the year to set us up well heading into holiday. And we are resourcefully adapting to the constantly evolving environment with actions like pulling up product flow, adjusting store assortment based on availability and acquiring additional alternative transportation. We have deep, long-standing relationships with our transportation and logistics vendors, and they have been incredibly supportive as we navigate. 
In addition, through our close partnerships with our product vendors, we have a great deal of visibility into and can influence the status of product in the supply chain process. We have varying degrees of inventory and supply chain challenges every holiday season, and this year will be no different, but we entered Q4 with 15% more inventory year-over-year and feel confident in our ability to serve our customers throughout the holiday. 
As expected, we did experience a more promotional environment for many of our products when compared to last year. When compared to 2 years ago, we still saw a less promotional environment during Q3. From a sales channel perspective, results were similar to last quarter. Customers are returning to stores and they are also choosing to interact with us digitally and via phone and chat at much higher rates than pre-pandemic. 
Online sales were 31% of domestic revenue compared to 16% in Q3 of fiscal '20, growing by more than $2 billion during that time. Our app saw a 19% increase in unique visitors versus last year, and phone and chat sales continued to climb versus last year and 2 years ago. 
We continue to be an industry leader in fast and convenient product fulfillment for our customers. During the third quarter, we reached our fastest small product delivery times ever. Compared to last year, same-day delivery was up 400% and we nearly doubled the percent of products delivered within 1 day. Based on a third-party analysis of competitor websites, we are the leader in 1 day or less published shipping time across a sample of higher-volume ZIP codes and higher demand items. 
In addition to partnering with a diversified set of delivery partners, we also thoughtfully used our employee delivery capability as we now have more than 400 stores doing employee deliveries, with almost 60% of our customers living within 10 miles of a delivery location. We also have an industry-leading in-store pickup experience. We have, by far, the broadest assortment of CE products available for pickup, and the process is incredibly fast. 
In Q3, more than 90% of online orders, that were available for product pickup, were ready in less than 30 minutes of the order being placed. Customers clearly find value in coming to our stores to pick up their products as the percent of online sales picked up at our stores remained high at 42%, even with our fast home delivery options, with 1/3 of our store pickup customers choosing our convenient curbside option. And our customer NPS for order pickup in Q3 was up versus last year and 2 years ago. In fact, in the last year, 31% of all our purchasing customers bought online and picked up in store at least once. 
These strong Q3 results and our market-leading omnichannel capabilities are due to our amazing associates across the company and the investment decisions we have made in the last several years in supply chain, store operations, our people and technology. Clearly, our business has changed dramatically in the last 2 years, with digital sales more than double pre-pandemic levels and phone, chat and in-home sales growing. Customers are starting their research and shopping online and then branching out from there to all forms of digital and physical shopping depending on their specific needs. 
Stores are crucial to our customer experience, and they need to be even more efficient and must keep pace with greater customer expectations. For example, we know customers sometimes seek out in-person help to answer questions, and other times, they would rather use digital tools to learn about products or pick up their orders in our stores. 
We have made the right investment decisions to position us as a leader in omnichannel retailing. While we are proud of our progress, there are even more opportunities ahead of us, and it is more important than ever to build on our position of strength and truly become a customer-obsessed company. This means we put the customer at the heart of all we do by anticipating their needs, listening, learning and applying those insights to create long-term relationships and seamless experiences. That led us to launch Best Buy Total Tech last month. 
Total Tech is a bold new membership program, leveraging our strengths across merchandising, fulfillment, installation, tech support and product repair, unique capabilities that customers value and no one else can match. Our membership program offers product discounts and periodic access to hard-to-get inventory, free delivery and installation, free technical support, free product protection and many other benefits. 
Let me provide a tangible example of how the offer can come to life. A Total Tech member purchases a 65-inch TV and gets a $150 member discount. She gets the TV delivered and mounted on the wall in her living room. The next month, she buys a new iPhone for her daughter. As long as she keeps up her membership, she gets 2 years of product protection on the TV she bought and 2 years of AppleCare Plus protection for the phone. 
A few weeks later, she can't get her laptop to connect to her printer. So she hops on a dedicated chat line with Geek Squad who fixes the problem by remoting into her computer so she can get on with a productive day of working from home. As a member, she received all those benefits for $199 per year. As you can see, not only do members receive significant savings, they can also be confident that whatever their technology needs are, we will be there to help. 
The goal is to create an experience that makes it inconceivable for members to purchase their tech from anyone else, driving a larger share of consumer electronic spend to Best Buy. We successfully rolled out the program nationally and online and converted more than 3 million former tech support members. It is very early as we just launched last month. But so far, we continue to see behaviors that we intend to drive and that we saw in the pilot, including more frequent interaction and higher incremental spend than nonmembers. 
Given the breadth of the offer, it is resonating well across all customer demographics and our new members are skewing younger than our former Total Tech Support membership program. MPS numbers across all channels are higher than for nonmembers as well. And importantly, our employees believe in and love articulating the value of membership to our customers. 
As we've discussed in previous calls, we are in the midst of multiple store pilots and tests. Of course, we are always piloting concepts. But right now, we are very focused on piloting and testing to build a framework that will move us from a retailer that focused foremost on its stores to a true omnichannel one that provides equal focus on all the ways customers shop with us. 
I will provide a few updates on our progress. We launched Phase 1 of our virtual store pilot last month. For this, we built out a physical store in one of our distribution centers with merchandising and products that is staffed with dedicated associates, including vendor-provided expert labor. It has no physical customers. Instead, customers interact with our experts via chat, audio, video and screen sharing depending on their preference and are able to see live demos, displays and physical products. 
It is early, and we have not rolled out all the product categories yet, but initial results are showing much higher conversion rates as well as higher average order value than we see with historical chat interactions. 
In Charlotte, we have made significant progress rolling out the market pilot designed to leverage all our assets in a portfolio strategy across stores, fulfillment, services and outlet lockers, our digital app in both in-store and in-home consultation labor. We launched our new outlet featuring all product categories in addition to a new services hub model and remodeled 8 stores. And in Houston, we are continuing to see strong results from our experiential store pilot and plan to roll out aspects of this more broadly in stores across the country as we enter next year. 
These are not the only pilots happening, and thus, they aren't the only pilots that will influence where we go as a company. From Northern California to Houston to the Bronx, we are assessing new formats and learning our way to the right physical model. At the same time, we are piloting and evolving our labor models in other markets to meet our customers' changing shopping behaviors. That means leveraging technology in stores that don't have as much labor and developing a much more flexible workforce. 
This is a workforce that cannot only provide expert help across product categories, both in-store and virtually but also flex into other activities like curbside fulfillment, and it empowers employees to flexibly pick up ships at other stores or at our distribution centers. 
I also want to highlight our unique ability to both inspire and support our customers through our consultation and our Geek Squad services. We have almost 3,000 consultants and design to provide free consultations across customers' homes, in stores and virtually. These consultations represent one of our highest NPS experiences consistently over 80. Importantly, they also lead to longer-term and stickier customer relationships as more than 85% of customers who use the program stated they intend to continue shopping with their consultants. 
Turning to the product support we provide. As many of you likely know. When something goes wrong with your products or delivery or installation, it is a highly unplanned and often emotional event. Not surprisingly, our customer research tells us that customers value quick response times and demand transparency, faster paradigms and quality repairs from a trusted provider. Our Geek Squad has an industry-leading set of capabilities that garner market-leading MPS and also drive additional revenue for Best Buy in the moment and over time. 
Around 20% of our phone and computer repair customers purchase additional products the day they see the repair. Additionally, our data shows that customers who have phone or computer repairs are far more likely to make a purchase in the following 12 months. Over time, we have also been evolving our partnerships with our vendors in response to changing customer shopping behavior. 
Our in-store vendor experiences are crucial to our customer experience and remain a significant source of competitive advantage. We have extended many of these in-store experiences to digital experiences. Our vendors partner with us to provide expert training and tools for our consultants and designers. And importantly, our vendors are increasingly sending sales leads from their own websites to our consultants and designers. 
We are also leveraging our unique Geek Squad capabilities to strengthen and expand our partnerships with our vendors. We are already the nation's largest physical destination for Apple authorized repair services, including same-day iPhone repairs, attracting new customers as 1/3 of these Apple repair customers are new or reengaged customers for Best Buy. 
In October, we launched Samsung authorized phone repair service nationally. Roughly 30% of our stores will offer same-day in-store repairs completed by Samsung certified Geek Squad agents, using Samsung parts, diagnostics and tools. Phone Repair is a universal need for customers, and this expansion gives Best Buy the capability to repair the overwhelming majority of phones in the marketplace. 
In addition, we are also starting to leverage our industry-leading and convenient buy online, pick up in store experience in partnerships with our vendors. Customers purchasing select items on samsung.com now have the option to pick up their products at their local Best Buy store and shoppers purchasing in Signia, Toshiba and pioneer Fire TVs on amazon.com can pick up their TVs at their local Best Buy stores. 
For many of our vendors, we use our considerable supply chain expertise to transport their product often from the country of origin to our distribution centers. In addition to helping our vendors, it allows us to increase our level of visibility into incoming inventory and to garner greater scale. 
And finally, we have been investing in our long-standing advertising business, building new capabilities to help vendors effectively reach our customers. Best Buy's relevance, customer relationships and first-party data have grown along with customers' technology needs and our ability to meet those needs. These are all great examples of value we can provide to our vendor partners that many other retailers cannot. 
In addition to focusing our performance on our core CE and appliance categories, we are continuing to expand our assortment in newer categories where we can leverage our ability to commercialize new technology. For example, we created a robust online experience and assortment for electric transportation. And during Q3, our sales in the category more than doubled. As a result, we are expanding our online assortment of electric bikes by 4x and also plan to assert them in physical stores early next year. 
And because customers are looking to us to complete their solutions, we have been expanding our assortment in categories like outdoor living as more and more consumers look to make over or upgrade their outdoor living spaces. This includes products like patio furniture, grills, fire pits and electric mowers, just to name a few. In fact, earlier this month, we acquired Yardbird, a leading direct-to-consumer company that specializes in premium sustainable outdoor furniture, including dining sets, lounge seating, fire tables and accessories. We are excited about the opportunity to use our expertise in merchandising and supply chain to scale this business, both online and in physical locations across the nation. 
We also made an exciting acquisition recently in the health space. Let me take a second to reiterate our overall health strategy and how the acquisition fits. Our Best Buy Health strategy focuses on 3 areas that start with our strength in retail and build to connecting patients to physicians. The first focus area is the consumer health category for customers who want to be healthier, sleep better, who need to monitor a chronic condition like diabetes or heart disease, for example. You can see this build out in a robust way on our website. 
The second area is active aging, which includes device-based emergency response and other services for Generation A who wish to live independently in their homes. This opportunity shows up prominently in our physical stores. The third focus area is virtual care. Best Buy's role in virtual care is to enable people in their homes to connect seamlessly with their health care providers. The trend to this type of care is increasing, accelerated in large measure by the pandemic. 
To more fully meet that growing customer demand and accelerate our work with new and innovative services, we acquired a company called Current Health. Current health developed a market-leading remote patient monitoring platform, that allows physicians to monitor and connect with patients in their home. Their platform includes an FDA-cleared wearable medical device that monitors vital science, a home hub, which integrates to hundreds of other monitoring devices and integration to the patient's electronic health record. 
With their remote monitoring platform, combined with the scale, expertise and connection to the home that Best Buy has, we will be able to create a holistic care ecosystem that shows up for customers across all their health care needs. To be clear, even though the health care industry is evolving quickly, in many ways as a result of the pandemic impacts, it adopts new ways of doing things at a much slower pace than other industries like retail. Virtual care is a truly nascent space with significant opportunity, but it will take time and investment to develop our offerings and scale. 
As you can see, technology developments are driving our initiatives across the company. We need technology tools and capabilities to help us as we transform and evolve the way we operate and serve our customers. That is why we continue to devote significant resources to technology investments. For example, we are leveraging our investments in electronic sign labels to very nimbly highlight Best Buy Total Tech member pricing for customers shopping in our stores. We also just launched the ability for our electronic sign labels to provide important messaging regarding product availability so that customers will easily be able to see if the product is in stock in that store or at another store nearby or when it could be delivered and installed. 
Technology was instrumental in recently launching the first of many new communication enhancements to improve our award-winning appliance customer experience. Metro delivery customers, that utilize the appointment tracker page on the day of their delivery, can now see how many stops away their driver is at any given time. It may seem like a small enhancement, but already, we can see significant customer engagement with the page. Another step toward our goal to make customers feel confident and in control throughout the research, purchase, fulfillment and use of their large products. 
Technology was also crucial in our recent launching of next-day delivery of appliances or TVs, which we are piloting first for in-store and online customers in our Minneapolis and Baltimore markets. Next month, we are launching a new capability, leveraging QR codes for high-velocity products that are locked up, particularly in areas of high. Instead of waiting for an associate to unlock the product, the customer can scan the QR code and then proceed to check out to pay and pick up the product. And we recently implemented enhancements to our digital platform, improving flexibility across our workforce by seamlessly giving employees the ability to pick up open shifts at nearby locations in addition to their home location. 
These examples are a small token of the work our digital and technology teams are doing to improve the customer and employee experience. And of course, we are also continuing to make significant investments in fundamental technology capabilities like data and analytics, and broader cloud migration in order to drive scale, efficiency and effectiveness. 
I would like to take a moment to extend my gratitude to our people. Over the past 21 months, they have flexibly dealt with rapidly changing store operations as we responded to impacts of the pandemic. They created safe environments for customers and worked tirelessly to provide excellent service, even in a situation where customers resisted following safety guidelines and in some cases, were disrespectful. 
In addition, we have increased the level of pilots and tests in the field as we evolve our operating model. This has introduced a great deal of change. We know that change is exciting, but we acknowledge it can also be challenging. I am truly grateful for and impressed by our associates' dedication, resourcefulness and flat-out determination. And I'm thrilled to say that our in-store NPS in Q3 increased versus last year and versus 2 years ago before the pandemic, despite all of these disruptions. 
Now I would like to briefly touch on our ESG efforts and how we are working across the company to have a positive impact on our planet. Earlier this month, we announced that we are a founding member of the Race to Zero initiative that aims to accelerate climate action within the retail industry. Best Buy's participation builds on our existing efforts to reduce our carbon footprint. We are proud of our progress in reducing emissions 61% since 2009, and we have pledged to be carbon neutral by 2040. 
We have also taken on a more specific focus on the circular economy within our operations and with our customers. In Q3, we collected and responsibly recycled more than 48 million pounds of consumer electronics, keeping products and commodities out of landfills. To help our customers live more sustainably, last quarter, we sold more than 5 million ENERGY STAR certified products, helping our customers reduce their carbon footprint and save on utility bills. 
We also kept more than 600,000 devices in-use longer and out of landfills or leveraging our customer trade-in program, Geek squad repair services and Best Buy outlets. These are initiatives our customers and vendors value and capabilities no one else has at our scale and breadth. 
In summary, we have delivered remarkable year-to-date results, and I am so proud of the execution of all our teams. We are looking forward to a strong holiday season and believe we are extremely well positioned with both the tech customers wants and fast and convenient ways to get it. We launched some of our Black Friday deals in mid-October that included a price guarantee for all customers. And this past Friday, started Black Friday early by making almost all of our Black Friday deals available. 
Throughout the holiday season, we are promising free next-day delivery on thousands of items. And of course, store pickup, whether in-store or curbside will be a great and convenient option for our customers to get their products. 
Building on that, as we think about next year and beyond, we are mindful of just how much the consumer has changed and how enduring that change will be. Terms like home nesting and virtual care have been invented to describe what all of us know so well, that when we work, entertain, receive health care and connect has changed, and our homes are now central to our lives more than ever before. The penetration of technology associated with this way of living has been and continues to be sizable. And we are already seeing shorter upgrade cycles as technology evolves and we constantly optimize our homes. 
The demand for convenience and experience on the customers' terms has exponentially driven change. Our hypothesis has consistently been that true omnichannel retailing would create differentiated experiences that allow us to seamlessly and conveniently engage and retain customers. As such, we have continuously invested in these experiences and notably, we never defined omnichannel as being stores and online. Instead, we included our unique and powerful service, virtual and in-home capabilities. 
We are certain that technology will continue to play a more dominant role in consumers' lives. Given our omnichannel capabilities, the ones we have today and the ones we are building for the future, we are fully confident that we will capitalize on a much larger, more broadly defined consumer electronics category and be able to better serve a customer who will be using and upgrading much of that CE more frequently. 
We plan to hold an investor event next March to share more detail on our initiatives, provide our thoughts on our financial model going forward and introduce longer-term financial targets. I will now turn the call over to Matt for more color on our financial results."

We are once again reporting strong financial results that continue to support our belief that technology plays an even more important role in everyone's lives, and we are uniquely positioned to serve them.

We are once again reporting strong financial results that continue to support our belief that technology plays an even more important role in everyone's lives, and we are uniquely positioned to serve them. 
Despite lapping the extraordinary 23% comparable growth from last year, we were once again able to generate positive comparable sales growth in each fiscal month of the third quarter. 
Compared to our guidance, Enterprise revenue of $11.9 billion ceded the high end of our revenue outlook of $11.6 billion, driven by the better-than-expected comparable sales growth of 1.6%. Our non-GAAP gross profit rate and SG&A expense were essentially in line with our expectations. 
Compared to last year, Enterprise revenue grew $57 million, and our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.08 increased $0.02. A lower share count resulted in a $0.12 per share benefit on a year-over-year basis. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 5.8% decreased 30 basis points as we invested in the launch of our new Total Tech membership. 
When comparing our results against 2 years ago for the third quarter of our fiscal '20, total revenue grew more than 20%. Additionally, our Domestic store channel revenue was approximately flat versus 2 years ago, while online revenue grew almost 150% in that time frame. As a result of the higher revenue and our ability to adjust to a new customer shopping behavior, our enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate was 160 basis points higher this quarter than the comparable quarter from 2 years ago. 
Let me now share more details specific to our third quarter. In our Domestic segment, revenue increased 1.2% to almost $11 billion. This increase was driven by a comparable sales increase of 2%, which was partially offset by the loss of revenue from store closures in the past year. As Corie shared, the biggest contributors to the comp sales growth in the quarter were appliances, home theater and mobile phones. 
After delivering a significant growth -- after delivering significant growth for the last several quarters and lapping a 46% comp in the third quarter of last year, computing comparable sales were down slightly on a year-over-year basis, but still up nearly $1 billion from 2 years ago. In addition, our services comparable sales declined 5.6% this quarter. This was primarily the result of our new Total Tech membership, which includes benefits that were previously stand-alone revenue-generating services such as warranty and installation. 
In our International segment, revenue decreased 7.8% to $925 million. This decrease was driven by the loss of approximately $90 million in revenue from exiting Mexico and a comparable sales decline of 3% in Canada. Partially offsetting these items was the benefit of approximately 450 basis points from foreign currency. 
Turning now to gross profit. The domestic gross profit rate decreased 60 basis points to 23.4%. As expected, the decrease was due to, one, lower profit margin rates, which were primarily driven by lapping lower levels of promotions, product damages and returns compared to last year as well as higher inventory shrink; and, two, lower services margin rates, which included rate pressure from Total Tech. The previous items were partially offset by higher profit sharing revenue from the company's private label and co-branded credit card arrangement. 
The gross profit rate pressure from our new membership offering primarily relates to the incremental customer benefits and associated costs compared to our previous Total Tech support offer. As Corie mentioned, like many others, we saw increased transportation costs within our supply chain. However, this pressure was offset by reduced parcel expense since our mix of online sales was lower than last year. 
The International non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 240 basis points to 25%. The higher gross profit rate was driven by improved product margin rates in Canada and a loss of lower-margin sales from the Mexico exit. 
Moving next to SG&A. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A increased $9 million and improved 20 basis points versus last year as a percentage of revenue. As expected, higher advertising expense and increased technology investments were partially offset by last year's $40 million donation to the Best Buy Foundation and lower incentive compensation. 
When comparing to 2 years ago, Domestic non-GAAP SG&A increased $155 million and decreased 230 basis points as a percentage of revenue. The largest driver of the increase versus fiscal '20 were higher incentive compensation, increased technology and advertising investments and additional variable costs due to the higher sales volume. Partially offsetting these items was lower store payroll expense. 
Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $3.5 billion in cash. At the end of Q3, our inventory balance was 15% higher than last year's comparable period and was 13% higher than our Q3 ending inventory balance from 2 years ago. The increased inventory represents our plans to support the current demand for technology as well as last year's unusually low inventory balance. 
Earlier this month, we completed our acquisitions of Current Health and Yardbird, which will be reflected on our cash flow statement in Q4. The combined purchase price of the 2 transactions was approximately $485 million and they were funded with cash. The Current Health acquisition was a larger cash outlay at approximately $400 million and is expected to have a slightly negative impact on our Q4 non-GAAP operating income. We are not expecting either acquisition to have a material impact on our revenue performance this year. 
During the quarter, we returned a total of $577 million to shareholders through share repurchases of $405 million and dividends of $172 million. With a year-to-date share buyback spend of $1.7 billion, we still expect to spend more than $2.5 billion in share repurchases this year. 
Let me next share more color on our guidance for the fourth quarter, which remains very similar to the implied guidance we provided last quarter. We expect comparable sales growth to be in the range of down 2% to up 1% to last year, which is on top of our 12.6% comparable sales growth in the fourth quarter of last year. Like other companies, we continue to monitor the evolving impacts of the pandemic and supply chain pressures, driven by global demand. 
We are confident in our ability to navigate the ever-changing environment. From a profit rate perspective, we are planning for a non-GAAP rate that is approximately 30 basis points below last year's rate due to the estimated impact of our new Total Tech offer, which we expect to be partially offset by a more favorable product mix. 
From a non-GAAP SG&A standpoint, we are planning dollars to increase approximately 8% compared to last year. The largest drivers of SG&A increase are expected to be technology investments, increased advertising, health investments and higher compensation and in addition, incentive compensation. In addition, we are planning on increased spend compared to our previous outlook for store labor and call center support this holiday season to better support the customer experience. 
Turning to our full year outlook. We expect the following: Enterprise revenue in the range of $51.8 billion to $52.3 billion compared to our previous guide of $51 billion to $52 billion. Comparable sales growth of 10.5% to 11.5% compared to our previous guide of 9% to 11% and a non-GAAP gross profit rate slightly higher than last year. For SG&A, we expect growth of approximately 9.5%, which compares to our prior outlook of 9%. We expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 20%, and we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $800 million to $850 million.

The guidance range we actually gave is slightly up from the implied guidance range from last quarter. As a reminder, in August, we materially raised our sales guidance for the back half of the year from the expectations we had that we started the year. We still feel really confident about our inventory levels and our positioning for the holiday. And so I'd say Q4 is a little bit more unique of a period of time, a place where our category is leveraged by many retailers over the holiday gifting season. 
I would also say that some sales probably got pulled into Octo summer last year as a lot of the narrative in the media and supply chain constraints were our consumers. So during the first 3 weeks of last year as well, the gaming consoles released, which provided a bit of a lift. And we're also very mindful of lapping the stimulus dollars that came in January. As we talked about last year, we saw strong results in October, the sales moderated, and they started to pick back up in January. 
The last thing I'd say about Q4 is Super Bowl actually, majority of the business is shifting into Q1 of next year. We're starting the November about flattish sales. So we're still encouraged by the holiday demand that the consumer is very strong still. And so we're excited and think we're well positioned."

But I'd also note that the whole goal of Total Tech is to actually drive more sales and then drive more product sales and that will take a little bit of time as we start to ramp up the program.

And specifically to your question, targeting the right messages to the right people, which is not just targeting the aging population, it's also targeting caregivers who may be looking for some of this product. 
And so you've seen us over time. We established a relationship with AARP back in March of 2020 as one of our venues. We have a lot of actually, in this space, direct mail and direct targeting because for the populations that we're looking at here, those are some of the most effective means that we have. And then over time, I think you're going to see some of our more broad-based Best Buy messaging, really pointing to the fact that we have a variety of solutions that can help people age in their homes. It's not always just the devices and the care wrappers. Sometimes it's things like a Facebook portal where you can connect with someone on the other side really simply and easily or a device -- a camera and a security system where I can easily lock my door without having to get up or I can keep an eye on that aging loved one. 
And I think already, you've seen me will continue to see run the gamut of both these very targeted messages to the population that we really want to inform all the way to these kind of more broad-based solution-driven messages about what we could help you do to care for a loved one."

And it also will help, obviously, this population, whether it's the caregiver again or the person being cared for, add more devices, feel comfortable adding devices. We can go to your own and help you install those, and then we can keep them up and running. And I think that's really important. 
In terms of the KPIs that we look at, it's really true across Total Tech. We're looking for things like increased frequency of interactions. And that may be everything from browsing on the website all the way to coming in the store and making an actual purchase. We're looking for stickiness of that consumer, meaning they're more willing to come back Best Buy bigger share of wallet, more purchase behavior with Best Buy over the longer term. And that will be true whether we're talking about aging in place or whether we're talking about the other aspects of Total Tech.

At this point, promotionality, we don't necessarily see it as a good guy or a bad guy in Q4. As you would imagine, Q4 is very promotional and competitive every year. And so right now, so last year, we were very focused on that as well. This year, we will continue to look at. But we don't expect it on a yearly basis to be necessarily more or less promotional. 
Now against 2 years ago, certainly, we would expect it to be a little less promotional than we saw 2 years ago. Where it heads is something that we're going to have to monitor. That's one of the kind of still things that we're evaluating for next year. Clearly, as inventory becomes more free, you can imagine that promotionality is going to start to increase in categories more one at a time as we get into next year.

Our advertising is also an area where it's up year-over-year. And that is included and that is the total tech launch that we've talked about. We're actually also increasing our store and call center labor to better support the customer experience. Last year, in Q4, it was probably -- we would say probably running the light from where we wanted to be. So we've made the decision to invest a little bit more from a customer experience standpoint. 
And while incentive compensation was flat on a year-over-year basis in the back half of this year,  is going to be flat. The pressure in Q4 is actually a pressure in Q4 versus a slight of a good eye in Q3. So those are what's driving the SG&A on a year-over-year basis.

The nice part is you should be able to get very good from one location in",551,"So I'll start with virtual store. Obviously, really early into this. So we're really just getting our legs under is. So it's hard for me to say whether or not there's more than one. The nice part is you should be able to get very good from one location in a model like this, right? Because you can flexibly queue people and you can move them through at your own speed, and you could do this across all the departments in this kind of fake store that's virtual. So I don't think this is going to be about a ton of virtual stores throughout the network. I think it's going to be about scale with a few locations that can provide some interesting use cases. 
Because truthfully, it's not just about the customer use cases where they might find the virtual store where they're doing digital shopping. It also could be about employee use cases, where I might be in the car installation area and may not have the expertise, but I could zoom right into one of our installation, our Autotech experts who could help you in the moment even as an employee, it gives you a lot of confidence there, too. 
So I think what we want to find out right now is what are the use cases? How often is it being used? And then ultimately, what does that customer experience look like? But like we said in the prepared remarks, we'd like what we're seeing early. And we'll see just how far you can stretch this kind of one asset that we have right now. 
In terms of flexible labor, absolutely, it is helpful for us in this environment, and it's helpful on a couple of levels. One, the customer shopping behaviors have changed and they continue to change and they can change week-to-week depending on how important something like speed is as an example. Like the week before Christmas, in-store pickup curbside will become very important assets. And with a more flexible model, I can move employees and employees can being moved to different areas in the store. That means they can pick up more hours or potentially more flexible hours. 
The other thing that hasn't been brought to light as much as there still are many people calling in sick, which we want. If they're not feeling well, we want them to stay home. A model like this allows you to much more flexibly cover for those call offs. So it's not just about hiring and retention. It's actually about how can I move the labor around the store in the most flexible way. 
And then the last thing I would say is we have more employees than ever in the history of the company that are skilled in multiple areas in the store. And that isn't just about us flexibly leveraging that labor. That is about them opting into potentially schedules and even in some cases, pay grades that meets whatever they want to try to accomplish in their lives. And that's really for the employee the more positive side of the flexible arrangement and ultimately adding to more confidence in their capabilities and their interactions with customers. That's why we tend to see higher NPS correlate very highly with multiple skill sets."

Today, we are reporting record Q3 financial results of $11.9 billion in sales and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.08, which is up 1% over last year and up 84% compared to 2 years ago.  
Against a still of all the backdrop, our leaders continue to drive new ways of operating, and our employees continue to do amazing things to support our customers' technology needs in knowledgeable, fast and convenient ways. Our omnichannel capabilities and our ability to inspire and support across all of technology in a way no one else can means we are uniquely positioned to seize the opportunity in this environment and in the future.  
We continue to capitalize on strong customer demand as more people sustainably work, entertain, cook and connect at home. And Domestic comparable sales growth was up 2% on top of 23% last year. From a merchandising perspective, the biggest contributors to our comparable sales growth in the quarter were appliances, home theater and mobile phones.  
Product availability continued to improve throughout the quarter. We have pockets of constraints in areas like appliances, gaming and mobile phones. Similar to last quarter, however, we do not believe this materially limited our overall sales growth. While we have faced and continue to face supply chain challenges, including delays and higher costs, we are proactively navigating a situation that we have been dealing with for several quarters as our industry has been facing disruptions and supply constraints since early in the pandemic.  
Our merchant demand planning and supply chain teams made strategic sourcing and inventory decisions early in the year to set us up well heading into holiday. And we are resourcefully adapting to the constantly evolving environment with actions like pulling up product flow, adjusting store assortment based on availability and acquiring additional alternative transportation. We have deep, long-standing relationships with our transportation and logistics vendors, and they have been incredibly supportive as we navigate.  
In addition, through our close partnerships with our product vendors, we have a great deal of visibility into and can influence the status of product in the supply chain process. We have varying degrees of inventory and supply chain challenges every holiday season, and this year will be no different, but we entered Q4 with 15% more inventory year-over-year and feel confident in our ability to serve our customers throughout the holiday.  
As expected, we did experience a more promotional environment for many of our products when compared to last year. When compared to 2 years ago, we still saw a less promotional environment during Q3. From a sales channel perspective, results were similar to last quarter. Customers are returning to stores and they are also choosing to interact with us digitally and via phone and chat at much higher rates than pre-pandemic.  
Online sales were 31% of Domestic revenue compared to 16% in Q3 of fiscal '20, growing by more than $2 billion during that time. Our app saw 19% increase in unique visitors versus last year, and phone and chat sales continued to climb versus last year and 2 years ago.  
We continue to be an industry leader in fast and convenient product fulfillment for our customers. During the third quarter, we reached our fastest small product delivery times ever. Compared to last year, same-day delivery was up 400% and we nearly doubled the percent of products delivered within 1 day. Based on a third-party analysis of competitor websites, we are the leader in 1 day or less published shipping time across a sample of higher-volume ZIP codes and higher demand items.  
In addition to partnering with a diversified set of delivery partners, we also thoughtfully used our employee delivery capability as we now have more than 400 stores doing employee deliveries, with almost 60% of our customers living within 10 miles of an employee delivery location. We also have an industry-leading in-store pickup experience. We have, by far, the broadest assortment of CE products available for pickup, and the process is incredibly fast.  
In Q3, more than 90% of online orders that were available for product pickup were ready in less than 30 minutes of the order being placed. Customers clearly find value in coming to our stores to pick up their products as the percent of online sales picked up at our stores remained high at 42%, even with our fast home delivery options, with 1/3 of our store pickup customers choosing our convenient curbside option. And our customer NPS for order pickup in Q3 was up versus last year and 2 years ago. In fact, in the last year, 31% of all our purchasing customers bought online and picked up in store at least once.  
These strong Q3 results and our market-leading omnichannel capabilities are due to our amazing associates across the company and the investment decisions we have made in the last several years in supply chain, store operations, our people, and technology. Clearly, our business has changed dramatically in the last 2 years, with digital sales more than double pre-pandemic levels and phone, chat, and in-home sales growing. Customers are starting their research and shopping online and then branching out from there to all forms of digital and physical shopping depending on their specific needs.  
Stores are crucial to our customer experience, and they need to be even more efficient and must keep pace with greater customer expectations. For example, we know customers sometimes seek out in-person help to answer questions, and other times, they would rather use digital tools to learn about products or pick up their orders in our stores.  
We have made the right investment decisions to position us as a leader in omnichannel retailing. While we are proud of our progress, there are even more opportunities ahead of us, and it is more important than ever to build on our position of strength and truly become a customer-obsessed company. This means we put the customer at the heart of all we do by anticipating their needs, listening, learning and applying those insights to create long-term relationships and seamless experiences. That led us to launch Best Buy Totaltech last month.  
Totaltech is a bold new membership program, leveraging our strengths across merchandising, fulfillment, installation, tech support, and product repair, unique capabilities that customers value and no one else can match. Our membership program offers product discounts and periodic access to hard-to-get inventory, free delivery and installation, free technical support, free product protection and many other benefits.  
Let me provide a tangible example of how the offer can come to life. A Totaltech member purchases a 65-inch TV and gets a $150 member discount. She gets the TV delivered and mounted on the wall in her living room. The next month, she buys a new iPhone for her daughter. As long as she keeps up her membership, she gets 2 years of product protection on the TV she bought and 2 years of AppleCare+ protection for the phone.  
A few weeks later, she can't get her laptop to connect to her printer. So she hops on the dedicated chat line with Geek Squad who fixes the problem by remoting into her computer, so she can get on with a productive day of working from home. As a member, she received all those benefits for $199 per year. As you can see, not only do members receive significant savings, they can also be confident that whatever their technology needs are, we will be there to help.  
The goal is to create an experience that makes it inconceivable for members to purchase their tech from anyone else, driving a larger share of consumer electronic spend to Best Buy. We successfully rolled out the program nationally and online and converted more than 3 million former tech support members. It is very early as we just launched last month. But so far, we continue to see behaviors that we intend to drive and that we saw in the pilot, including more frequent interaction and higher incremental spend than nonmembers.  
Given the breadth of the offer, it is resonating well across all customer demographics and our new members are skewing younger than our former Total Tech Support membership program. NPS numbers across all channels are higher than for nonmembers as well. And importantly, our employees believe in and love articulating the value of membership to our customers.  
As we discussed in previous calls, we are in the midst of multiple store pilots and tests. Of course, we are always piloting concepts. But right now, we are very focused on piloting and testing to build a framework that will move us from a retailer that is focused foremost on its stores to a true omnichannel one that provides equal focus on all the ways customers shop with us.  
I will provide a few updates on our progress. We launched Phase 1 of our virtual store pilot last month. For this, we built out a physical store in one of our distribution centers with merchandising and products that is staffed with dedicated associates, including vendor-provided expert labor. It has no physical customers. Instead, customers interact with our experts via chat, audio, video and screen sharing depending on their preference and are able to see live demos, displays and physical products.  
It is early, and we have not rolled out all the product categories yet, but initial results are showing much higher conversion rates as well as higher average order value than we see with historical chat interactions.  
In Charlotte, we have made significant progress rolling out the market pilot designed to leverage all our assets in a portfolio strategy across stores, fulfillment services and outlet lockers, our digital app and both in-store and in-home consultation labor. We launched our new outlet featuring all product categories in addition to a new services hub model and remodeled 8 stores. And in Houston, we are continuing to see strong results from our experiential store pilot and plan to roll out aspects of this more broadly in stores across the country as we enter next year.  
These are not the only pilots happening, and thus, they aren't the only pilots that will influence where we go as a company. From Northern California to Houston to The Bronx, we are assessing new formats and learning our way to the right physical model. At the same time, we are piloting and evolving our labor models in other markets to meet our customers' changing shopping behaviors. That means leveraging technology in stores that don't have as much labor and developing a much more flexible workforce.  
This is a workforce that can not only provide expert help across product categories, both in-store and virtually, but also flex into other activities like curbside fulfillment, and it empowers employees to flexibly pick up shifts at other stores or at our distribution centers.  
I also want to highlight our unique ability to both inspire and support our customers through our consultation and our Geek Squad services. We have almost 3,000 consultants and designers to provide free consultations across customers' homes, in stores and virtually. These consultations represent one of our highest NPS experiences consistently over 80. Importantly, they also lead to longer-term and stickier customer relationships as more than 85% of customers who use the program stated they intend to continue shopping with their consultants.  
Turning to the product support we provide, as many of you likely know, when something goes wrong with your products or delivery or installation, it is a highly unplanned and often emotional event. Not surprisingly, our customer research tells us that customers value quick response times and demand transparency, fast repair times, and quality repairs from a trusted provider. Our Geek Squad has an industry-leading set of capabilities that garner market-leading NPS and also drive additional revenue for Best Buy in the moment and over time.
Around 20% of our phone and computer repair customers purchase additional products the day they receive the repair. Additionally, our data shows that customers who have phone or computer repairs are far more likely to make a purchase in the following 12 months. Over time, we have also been evolving our partnerships with our vendors in response to changing customer shopping behavior.  
Our in-store vendor experiences are crucial to our customer experience and remain a significant source of competitive advantage. We have extended many of these in-store experiences to digital experiences. Our vendors partner with us to provide expert training and tools for our consultants and designers. And importantly, our vendors are increasingly sending sales leads from their own websites to our consultants and designers.  
We are also leveraging our unique Geek Squad capabilities to strengthen and expand our partnerships with our vendors. We are already the nation's largest physical destination for Apple authorized repair services, including same-day iPhone repairs, attracting new customers as 1/3 of these Apple repair customers are new or reengaged customers for Best Buy.  
In October, we launched Samsung authorized phone repair service nationally. Roughly 30% of our stores will offer same-day in-store repairs completed by Samsung certified Geek Squad agents, using Samsung parts, diagnostics and tools. Phone repair is a universal need for customers, and this expansion gives Best Buy the capability to repair the overwhelming majority of phones in the marketplace.  
In addition, we are also starting to leverage our industry-leading and convenient buy online, pick up in store experience in partnerships with our vendors. Customers purchasing select items on samsung.com now have the option to pick up their products at their local Best Buy store and shoppers purchasing Insignia, Toshiba and Pioneer Fire TVs on amazon.com can pick up their TVs at their local Best Buy stores.  
For many of our vendors, we use our considerable supply chain expertise to transport their product often from the country of origin to our distribution centers. In addition to helping our vendors, it allows us to increase our level of visibility into incoming inventory and to garner greater scale.  
And finally, we have been investing in our long-standing advertising business, building new capabilities to help vendors effectively reach our customers. Best Buy's relevance, customer relationship, and first-party data have grown along with customers' technology needs and our ability to meet those needs. These are all great examples of value we can provide to our vendor partners that many other retailers cannot.  
In addition to focusing our performance on our core CE and appliance categories, we are continuing to expand our assortment in newer categories where we can leverage our ability to commercialize new technology. For example, we created a robust online experience and assortment for electric transportation. And during Q3, our sales in the category more than doubled. As a result, we are expanding our online assortment of electric bikes by 4x and also plan to assort them in physical stores early next year.  
And because customers are looking to us to complete their solutions, we have been expanding our assortment in categories like outdoor living, as more and more consumers look to make over or upgrade their outdoor living spaces. This includes products like patio furniture, grills, fire pits, and electric mowers, just to name a few. In fact, earlier this month, we acquired Yardbird, a leading direct-to-consumer company that specializes in premium sustainable outdoor furniture, including dining sets, lounge seating, fire tables and accessories. We are excited about the opportunity to use our expertise in merchandising and supply chain to scale this business both online and in physical locations across the nation.  
We also made an exciting acquisition recently in the health space. Let me take a second to reiterate our overall health strategy and how the acquisition fits. Our Best Buy Health strategy focuses on 3 areas that start with our strength in retail and build to connecting patients to physicians. The first focus area is the consumer health category for customers who want to be healthier, sleep better, or need to monitor a chronic condition like diabetes or heart disease, for example. You can see this built out in a robust way on our website.  
The second area is active aging, which includes device-based emergency response and other services for Generation A, who wish to live independently in their homes. This opportunity shows up prominently in our physical stores. The third focus area is virtual care. Best Buy's role in virtual care is to enable people in their homes to connect seamlessly with their health care providers. The trend to this type of care is increasing, accelerated in large measure by the pandemic.  
To more fully meet that growing customer demand and accelerate our work with new and innovative services, we acquired a company called Current Health. Current Health developed a market-leading remote patient monitoring platform that allows physicians to monitor and connect with patients in their home. Their platform includes an FDA-cleared wearable medical device that monitors vital signs, a home hub, which integrates to hundreds of other monitoring devices, and integration to the patient's electronic health record.  
With their remote monitoring platform, combined with the scale, expertise and connection to the home that Best Buy has, we will be able to create a holistic care ecosystem that shows up for customers across all their health care needs. To be clear, even though the health care industry is evolving quickly, in many ways as a result of the pandemic impacts, it adopts new ways of doing things at a much slower pace than other industries like retail. Virtual care is a truly nascent space with significant opportunity, but it will take time and investment to develop our offerings and scale.  
As you can see, technology developments are driving our initiatives across the company. We need technology tools and capabilities to help us as we transform and evolve the way we operate and serve our customers. That is why we continue to devote significant resources to technology investments. For example, we are leveraging our investments in electronic sign labels to very nimbly highlight Best Buy Totaltech member pricing for customers shopping in our stores. We also just launched the ability for our electronic sign labels to provide important messaging regarding product availability, so that customers will easily be able to see if the product is in stock in that store or at another store nearby or when it could be delivered and installed.  
Technology was instrumental in recently launching the first of many new communication enhancements to improve our award-winning appliance customer experience. Metro delivery customers, that utilize the appointment tracker page on the day of their delivery, can now see how many stops away their driver is at any given time. It may seem like a small enhancement, but already, we can see significant customer engagement with the page. Another step toward our goal to make customers feel confident and in control throughout the research, purchase, fulfillment and use of their large product.  
Technology was also crucial in our recent launching of next-day delivery of appliances and large TVs, which we are piloting first for in-store and online customers in our Minneapolis and Baltimore markets. Next month, we are launching a new capability, leveraging QR codes for high-velocity products that are locked up, particularly in areas of high shrink. Instead of waiting for an associate to unlock the product, the customer can scan the QR code and then proceed to check out to pay and pick up the product. And we recently implemented enhancements to our digital platform, improving flexibility across our workforce by seamlessly giving employees the ability to pick up open shifts at nearby locations in addition to their home location.  
These examples are a small token of the work our digital and technology teams are doing to improve the customer and employee experience. And of course, we are also continuing to make significant investments in fundamental technology capabilities like data and analytics, and broader cloud migration in order to drive scale, efficiency and effectiveness.  
I would like to take a moment to extend my gratitude to our people. Over the past 21 months, they have flexibly dealt with rapidly changing store operations as we responded to impacts of the pandemic. They created safe environments for customers and worked tirelessly to provide excellent service, even in situations where customers resisted following safety guidelines and in some cases were disrespectful.  
In addition, we have increased the level of pilots and tests in the field as we evolve our operating model. This has introduced a great deal of change. We know that change is exciting, but we acknowledge it can also be challenging. I am truly grateful for and impressed by our associates' dedication, resourcefulness and flat-out determination. And I'm thrilled to say that our in-store NPS in Q3 increased versus last year and versus 2 years ago before the pandemic despite all of these disruptions.  
Now I would like to briefly touch on our ESG efforts and how we are working across the company to have a positive impact on our planet. Earlier this month, we announced that we are a founding member of the Race to Zero initiative that aims to accelerate climate action within the retail industry. Best Buy's participation builds on our existing efforts to reduce our carbon footprint. We are proud of our progress in reducing emissions 61% since 2009, and we have pledged to be carbon neutral by 2040.  
We have also taken on a more specific focus on the circular economy within our operations and with our customers. In Q3, we collected and responsibly recycled more than 48 million pounds of consumer electronics, keeping products and commodities out of landfills. To help our customers live more sustainably, last quarter, we sold more than 5 million ENERGY STAR certified products, helping our customers reduce their carbon footprint and save on utility bills.  
We also kept more than 600,000 devices in use longer and out of landfills by leveraging our customer trade-in program, Geek squad repair services and Best Buy outlets. These are initiatives our customers and vendors value and capabilities no one else has at our scale and breadth.  
In summary, we have delivered remarkable year-to-date results, and I am so proud of the execution of all our teams. We are looking forward to a strong holiday season and believe we are extremely well positioned with both the tech customers wants and fast and convenient ways to get it. We launched some of our Black Friday deals in mid-October that included a price guarantee for all customers. And this past Friday, started Black Friday early by making almost all of our Black Friday deals available.  
Throughout the holiday season, we are promising free next-day delivery on thousands of items. And of course, store pickup, whether in-store or curbside, will be a great and convenient option for our customers to get their products. 
Building on that, as we think about next year and beyond, we are mindful of just how much the consumer has changed and how enduring that change will be. Terms like home nesting and virtual care have been invented to describe what all of us know so well, that where we work, entertain, receive health care, and connect has changed, and our homes are now central to our lives more than ever before. The penetration of technology associated with this way of living has been and continues to be sizable. And we are already seeing shorter upgrade cycles as technology evolves and we constantly optimize our homes.  
The demand for convenience and experience on the customers' terms has exponentially driven change. Our hypothesis has consistently been that true omnichannel retailing would create differentiated experiences that allow us to seamlessly and conveniently engage and retain customers. As such, we have continuously invested in these experiences and notably, we never defined omnichannel as being stores and online. Instead, we included our unique and powerful service, virtual and in-home capabilities.  
We are certain that technology will continue to play a more dominant role in consumers' lives. Given our omnichannel capabilities, the ones we have today and the ones we are building for the future, we are fully confident that we will capitalize on a much larger, more broadly defined consumer electronics category and be able to better serve a customer who will be using and upgrading much of that CE more frequently.  
We plan to hold an investor event next March to share more detail on our initiatives, provide our thoughts on our financial model going forward and introduce longer-term financial targets. I will now turn the call over to Matt for more color on our financial results."

We are once again reporting strong financial results that continue to support our belief that technology plays an even more important role in everyone's lives, and we are uniquely positioned to serve them.  
Despite lapping the extraordinary 23% comparable sales growth from last year, we were once again able to generate positive comparable sales growth in each fiscal month of the third quarter.  
Compared to our guidance, Enterprise revenue of $11.9 billion exceeded the high end of our revenue outlook of $11.6 billion, driven by the better-than-expected comparable sales growth of 1.6% Our non-GAAP gross profit rate and SG&A expense were essentially in line with our expectations.  
Compared to last year, Enterprise revenue grew $57 million, and our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.08 increased $0.02. A lower share count resulted in a $0.12 per share benefit on a year-over-year basis. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 5.8% decreased 30 basis points as we invested in the launch of our new Totaltech membership.  
When comparing our results against 2 years ago for the third quarter of our fiscal '20, total revenue grew more than 20%. Additionally, our Domestic store channel revenue was approximately flat versus 2 years ago, while online revenue grew almost 150% in that time frame. As a result of the higher revenue and our ability to adjust to a new customer shopping behavior, our enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate was 160 basis points higher this quarter than the comparable quarter from 2 years ago.  
Let me now share more details specific to our third quarter. In our Domestic segment, revenue increased 1.2% to almost $11 billion. This increase was driven by a comparable sales increase of 2%, which was partially offset by the loss of revenue from store closures in the past year. As Corie shared, the biggest contributors to the comp sales growth in the quarter were appliances, home theater and mobile phones.  
After delivering significant growth for the past several quarters and lapping a 46% comp in the third quarter of last year, computing comparable sales were down slightly on a year-over-year basis, but still up nearly $1 billion from 2 years ago. In addition, our services comparable sales declined 5.6% this quarter. This was primarily the result of our new Totaltech membership, which includes benefits that were previously stand-alone revenue-generating services such as warranty and installation.  
In our International segment, revenue decreased 7.8% to $925 million. This decrease was driven by the loss of approximately $90 million in revenue from exiting Mexico and a comparable sales decline of 3% in Canada. Partially offsetting these items was the benefit of approximately 450 basis points from foreign currency.  
Turning now to gross profit. The domestic gross profit rate decreased 60 basis points to 23.4%. As expected, the decrease was due to, one, lower profit margin rates, which were primarily driven by lapping lower levels of promotions, product damages and returns compared to last year as well as higher inventory shrink; and, two, lower services margin rates, which included rate pressure from Totaltech. The previous items were partially offset by higher profit sharing revenue from the company's private label and co-branded credit card arrangement.  
The gross profit rate pressure from our new membership offering primarily relates to the incremental customer benefits and associated costs compared to our previous Total Tech Support offer. As Corie mentioned, like many others, we saw increased transportation costs within our supply chain. However, this pressure was offset by reduced parcel expense since our mix of online sales was lower than last year.  
The International non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 240 basis points to 25%. The higher gross profit rate was driven by improved product margin rates in Canada and a loss of lower-margin sales from the Mexico exit.  
Moving next to SG&A. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A increased $9 million and improved 20 basis points versus last year as a percentage of revenue. As expected, higher advertising expense and increased technology investments were partially offset by last year's $40 million donation to the Best Buy Foundation and lower incentive compensation.  
When comparing to 2 years ago, Domestic non-GAAP SG&A increased $155 million and decreased 230 basis points as a percentage of revenue. The largest drivers of the increase versus fiscal '20 were higher incentive compensation, increased technology and advertising investments and additional variable costs due to the higher sales volume. Partially offsetting these items was lower store payroll expense.  
Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $3.5 billion in cash. At the end of Q3, our inventory balance was 15% higher than last year's comparable period and was 13% higher than our Q3 ending inventory balance from 2 years ago. The increased inventory represents our plans to support the current demand for technology as well as last year's unusually low inventory balance.  
Earlier this month, we completed our acquisitions of Current Health and Yardbird, which will be reflected on our cash flow statement in Q4. The combined purchase price of the 2 transactions was approximately $485 million and they were funded with cash. The Current Health acquisition was a larger cash outlay at approximately $400 million and is expected to have a slightly negative impact on our Q4 non-GAAP operating income. We are not expecting either acquisition to have a material impact on our revenue performance this year.  
During the quarter, we returned a total of $577 million to shareholders through share repurchases of $405 million and dividends of $172 million. With a year-to-date share buyback spend of $1.7 billion, we still expect to spend more than $2.5 billion in share repurchases this year.  
Let me next share more color on our guidance for the fourth quarter, which remains very similar to the implied guidance we provided last quarter. We expect comparable sales growth to be in the range of down 2% to up 1% to last year, which is on top of our 12.6% comparable sales growth in the fourth quarter of last year. Like other companies, we continue to monitor the evolving impacts of the pandemic and supply chain pressures driven by global demand. We are confident in our ability to navigate the ever-changing environment. From a profit rate perspective, we are planning for a non-GAAP rate that is approximately 30 basis points below last year's rate due to the estimated impact of our new Totaltech offer, which we expect to be partially offset by a more favorable product mix.  
From a non-GAAP SG&A standpoint, we are planning dollars to increase approximately 8% compared to last year. The largest drivers of SG&A increase are expected to be technology investments, increased advertising, health investments, and higher compensation, in addition, incentive compensation. In addition, we are planning on increased spend compared to our previous outlook for store labor and call center support this holiday season to better support the customer experience.  
Turning to our full year outlook. We expect the following: Enterprise revenue in the range of $51.8 billion to $52.3 billion compared to our previous guide of $51 billion to $52 billion. Comparable sales growth of 10.5% to 11.5% compared to our previous guide of 9% to 11%, and a non-GAAP gross profit rate slightly higher than last year. For SG&A, we expect growth of approximately 9.5%, which compares to our prior outlook of 9%. We expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 20%, and we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $800 million to $850 million.

We are doing a number of things to protect our people and our customers.

The guidance range we actually gave is slightly up from the implied guidance range from last quarter. As a reminder, in August, we materially raised our sales guidance for the back half of the year from the expectations we had that we started the year. We still feel really confident about our inventory levels and our positioning for the holiday. And so I'd say, Q4 is a little more unique of a period of time, a place where our category is leveraged by many retailers over the holiday gifting season. 
I would also say that some sales probably got pulled into October similar to last year as a lot of the narrative in the media in supply chain constraints worried our consumers. So during the first 3 weeks of last year as well, the gaming consoles released, which provided a bit of a lift. And we're also very mindful of lapping the stimulus dollars that came in January. As we talked about last year, we saw strong results in October, the sales moderated, and they started to pick back up in January. 
The last thing I'd say about Q4 is Super Bowl. Actually, majority of the business is shifting into Q1 of next year. We're starting the November about flattish sales. So we're still encouraged by the holiday demand that the consumer is very strong still. And so we're excited and think we're well positioned."

Total Tech Support a bit more was recognized in the first couple of months. Totaltech is more spread out across the entire year, so more of that pressure is coming from that. 
But I'd also note that the goal of Totaltech is to actually drive more sales and drive more product sales and that will take a little bit of time as we start to ramp up the program. So that will help offset some of the pressure you see from the cannibalization of the services business."

We have been really focused on this idea that tech could be instrumental in helping people age more comfortably in their homes for quite a while. It started with our purchase of a GreatCall a few years ago. And part of the reason that we brought GreatCall on board is they had massive experience in dealing with an aging population. And specifically to your question, targeting the right messages to the right people, which is not just targeting the aging population, it's also targeting caregivers who may be looking for some of this product. 
And so you've seen us over time, we established a relationship with AARP back in March of 2020 as one of our venues. We have a lot of actually, in this space, direct mail and direct targeting because for the populations that we're looking at here, those are some of the most effective means that we have. And then over time, I think you're going to see some of our more broad-based Best Buy messaging, really pointing to the fact that we have a variety of solutions that can help people age in their homes. It's not always just the devices and the care wrappers. Sometimes it's things like a Facebook portal where you can connect with someone on the other side really simply and easily, or a device, a camera and a security system, where I can easily lock my door without having to get up or I can keep an eye on that aging loved one. 
And I think already, you've seen and will continue to see us run the gamut of both these very targeted messages to the population that we really want to inform all the way to these kind of more broad-based solution-driven messages about what we could help you do to care for a loved one."

In terms of the KPIs that we look at, it's really across Totaltech. We're looking for things like increased frequency of interactions. And that may be everything from browsing on the website all the way to coming in the store and making an actual purchase. We're looking for stickiness of that consumer, meaning they're more willing to come back Best Buy, bigger share of wallet, more purchase behavior with Best Buy over the longer term. And that will be true whether we're talking about aging in place or whether we're talking about the other aspects of Totaltech.

At this point, promotionality, we don't necessarily see it as a good guy or a bad guy in Q4. As you would imagine, Q4 is very promotional and competitive every year. So last year, we were very focused on that as well. This year, we will continue to look at it. But we don't expect it on a yearly basis to be necessarily more or less promotional. 
Now against 2 years ago, certainly, we would expect it to be a little less promotional than we saw 2 years ago. Where it heads is something that we're going to have to monitor. That's one of the kind of still things that we're evaluating for next year. Clearly, as inventory becomes more free, you can imagine that promotionality is going to start to increase in categories more one at a time as we get into next year. And so likely starting the year with a little bit more promotionality. But we're not really guiding next year, but I would expect that to start to turn over the next number of quarters."

I think generally, as you look at our ASPs, the inflation or cost of those goods going up is still a smaller part of what we would see as ASP increases right now. Still the bigger part of the ASP increases would be just premium mix of our business right now versus the inflation estimate.

And there's just a lot more volume coming through generally compared to a couple of years ago. So as you look at a year-over-year difference, we're still seeing continued investments in technology and health being a driver of that SG&A increase. 
Our advertising is also an area where it's up year-over-year. And that is included and that is the Totaltech launch that we've talked about. We're actually also increasing our store and call center labor to better support the customer experience. Last year, in Q4, it was probably -- we would say probably running to the light from where we wanted to be. So we've made the decision to invest a little bit more from a customer experience standpoint. 
And while incentive compensation was flat on a year-over-year basis in the back half of this year,  it's going to be flat. The pressure in Q4 is actually a pressure in Q4 versus slight of a good eye in Q3. So those are what's driving the SG&A on a year-over-year basis.

So it's hard for me to say whether or not there's more than one. The nice part is, you should be able to get very good scale from one location in a model like this, right? Because you can flexibly queue people and you can move them through at your own speed, and you could do this across all the departments in this kind of fake store that's virtual. So I don't think this is going to be about a ton of virtual stores throughout the network. I think it's going to be about scale with few locations that can provide some interesting use cases. 
Because truthfully, it's not just about the customer use cases, where they might find the virtual store where they're doing digital shopping. It also could be about employee use cases, where I might be in the car installation area and may not have the expertise, but I could zoom right into one of our installation, our Autotech experts, who could help you in the moment even as an employee. It gives you a lot of confidence there, too. 
So I think what we want to find out right now is what are the use cases? How often is it being used? And then ultimately, what does that customer experience look like? But like we said in the prepared remarks, we'd like what we're seeing early. And we'll see just how far you can stretch this kind of one asset that we have right now. 
In terms of flexible labor, absolutely, it is helpful for us in this environment, and it's helpful on a couple of levels. One, the customer shopping behaviors have changed and they continue to change and they can change week-to-week depending on how important something like speed is, as an example. Like the week before Christmas, in-store pickup, curbside will become very important assets. And with a more flexible model, I can move employees and employees can opt into being moved to different areas in the store. That means they can pick up more hours or potentially more flexible hours. 
The other thing that hasn't been brought to light as much is there still are many people calling in sick, which we want. If they're not feeling well, we want them to stay home. A model like this allows you to much more flexibly cover for those call offs. So it's not just about hiring and retention. It's actually about how can I move the labor around the store in the most flexible way. 
And then the last thing I would say is, we have more employees than ever in the history of the company that are skilled in multiple areas in the store. And that isn't just about us flexibly leveraging that labor. That is about them opting into potentially schedules and even in some cases, pay grades that meets whatever they want to try to accomplish in their lives. And that's really for the employee, the more positive side of the flexible arrangement and ultimately adding to more confidence in their capabilities and their interactions with customers. That's why we tend to see higher NPS correlate very highly with multiple skill sets."

I think, certainly, it's something we're evaluating over what the market is going to look like over the next few years. We're certainly not in a position to guide next year from a sales perspective either. You're right, comping, there's going to be some big quarters next year. We grew 27% in the first half of last year. So we very much could see some bumpiness quarter-to-quarter. But again, fundamentally, we believe that our customers' need for technology has only grown and that we have a very unique way to serve those customers, and there's still a lot of long-term opportunities. 
We're excited about our Totaltech membership program. We're excited about investing more in our business around technology and our operating model changing in our store portfolio. So there's a lot of room for optimism in addition to understanding that Totaltech is just that much more important. We'll have to see where the industry goes."

And just to underscore, I think you'll continue to see product innovation at an accelerated pace. And you will see CE proliferate into other areas like you're seeing it proliferate into health care or even into outdoor spaces. And so I think that makes it even harder for us to answer the question because it's not even just about how you define the market today, it's about how the market, in essence, expands over time because it taps into new areas. And that's the part that really has us excited for the future even if, to Matt's point, there might be a bumpy quarter here or there. It's really the sustainability of CE as an ever-evolving space from here on out. 
And with that, I want to thank all of you so much for joining us today, and I know it's a very busy earnings season, so we appreciate it. And happy holidays to all of you, and we look forward to seeing you in March."
