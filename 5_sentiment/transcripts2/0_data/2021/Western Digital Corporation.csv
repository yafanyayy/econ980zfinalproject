To start, our second quarter results were at or above the upper end of guidance ranges we provided in October. We reported revenue of $3.9 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.69. These r",1181,"Thanks, Peter, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. To start, our second quarter results were at or above the upper end of guidance ranges we provided in October. We reported revenue of $3.9 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.69. These results reflect continued growth in retail in what was a seasonally strong quarter. In addition, stronger demand for our client SSD products as well as our notebook and desktop hard drives contributed to upside in revenue. 
We continue to work hard delivering for our shareholders, customers, partners and communities. We adapted to changes in our business and continue to manage the ongoing challenges presented by the pandemic. Our results reflect the benefits of having such a diverse and deep product portfolio, fantastic franchises, a vast customer base and now, an optimized organizational structure. As a result, we have a solid foundation to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities in front of us. I'm excited about the progress we've made over the last few months in the recently established Flash and HDD business units. Both franchises are led by exceptional leaders who are highly focused on executing their respective strategies by establishing their teams, evaluating technology and product development, engaging with customers and analyzing and effectively capturing target end markets. 
As we've highlighted in previous earnings calls, we are committed to delivering on our product road map, including advancing our product transitions. Notably, we are making great headway with the product transitions of our energy-assisted hard drives and enterprise SSDs. As you all know, these transitions are multi-quarter journeys but I'm pleased with our progress, which I'll detail shortly. Although our progress to date is showing tangible results, there's still work to be done. We remain extremely focused on enhancing our ability to drive continued innovation and sustainable long-term shareholder value. 
Let me now provide a recap of our Flash and HDD businesses. Within Flash, we remain well positioned to address the digital transformation driven by businesses, schools and consumers that continue to leverage technology as a daily necessity for work, learning and a much needed form of entertainment. The pandemic has not only accelerated this transformation by the way we all use the cloud, but it has spurred technological innovation by driving the ability to access the cloud using very powerful and advanced end devices. The increasingly pervasive ability to access, store and share data from anywhere on any device has resulted in robust storage demand, particularly in smaller form factors, such as notebook, tablet and Chromebook. 
The attach rate of client SSDs into notebooks now exceeds 80%, while desktop penetration of client SSDs is around 40%. Furthermore, tablets and Chromebooks, which are all-flash based, represent a growing percentage of total PC demand. Our leading position in client NVMe-based SSDs and our strong relationships with the major PC OEMs drove our client SSD business to a record level of exabyte shipments. Retail continued to perform well in a seasonally strong quarter, and we achieved a 2-year high in revenue, supported by the strength of our brand and the breadth of our portfolio. We continue to make progress with our second-generation enterprise SSD products, completing nearly 150 qualifications. Importantly, we completed the qualification process at One CloudTitan, which was an objective we committed to last quarter. 
We are shipping to this CloudTitan in the fiscal third quarter. The second-generation enterprise SSD qualification process is well underway with additional Cloud Titans and large OEMs. 
From a technology perspective, we began shipping our 112 layer BiCS5 technology and client SSD products in the December quarter. BiCS5 remains the most capital-efficient technology node in the recent history of NAND going back to the 2D era, and we are preparing for a significant ramp of this node through 2021. Ultimately, customers want the best product that offers a blend of cost, performance and power, and Western Digital provides that. Our focus on technological and architectural innovations, coupled with the benefits of size and scale that we have with our joint venture with Kioxia, has enabled us to deliver the industry's highest bit density per layer at the lowest cost per bit. As the result of our inherent advantages with the joint venture, particularly our scale and consistent track record of technological innovation, we are able to deliver the required bit growth and performance with the lowest capital intensity in the industry. We are highly confident in our ability to continue this momentum as we ramp BiCS5 through calendar year 2021 and and begin BiCS6 productization. 
On the HDD side of the business, upside demand in PC, notebook and smart video more than offset weakness in capacity enterprise. The persisting work-from-home and distance learning trends I touched upon earlier, drove higher demand for both desktop and notebook PC hard drives and propelled retail hard drive revenue to a 3-year high. The smart video business continued to recover, growing 30% sequentially. 
The biggest HD update is our solid progress against the initiatives we outlined last quarter, completing the qualification process at the CloudTitans with our mass market energy-assisted hard drives. I'm pleased to share that we have now completed qualifications at 3 of the 4 U.S. CloudTitans. While one now completed CloudTitan qualification slipped beyond our anticipated time line in the fiscal second quarter, another CloudTitan qualification scheduled to complete in the fiscal third quarter was completed in the second quarter. With these significant milestones now behind us, we have staged products in anticipation of the ramp of these drives as we continue through 2021. 
With cloud digestion abating and the stabilization of OEM demand, we believe the demand in capacity enterprise bottomed in the fiscal second quarter and are anticipating a rebound in the fiscal third quarter. 18-terabyte is expected to be our leading capacity point as we head into the second half of the calendar year, which should propel nice growth in this segment going forward. As the volume of these drives continues to ramp through the calendar year, we expect our revenue and gross margin to recover. 
Before I turn it over to Bob, I'll quickly summarize our perspective on what's to come. We continue to deal with the far-reaching effects of the pandemic and no one can be certain of what the new normal will look like. However, there is no question the accelerated digital transformation has only increased the reliance on data and technology in both our professional and our personal lives, which we are confident will have a lasting impact for years to come. To this point, some industry analysts are raising the possibility that in certain portions of the market, such as the cloud, the storage industry will not be able to meet the extraordinary demand for both flash and hard drive solutions over the course of the next 10 years. Western Digital's unique ability to provide flash and hard drive storage solutions for customers spanning individual consumers to CloudTitans, highlights the value and importance of our broad portfolio and strong competitive position. I'll now turn the call over to Bob to share details on our financial results."

As Dave mentioned, overall results for the fiscal second quarter were at or above the upper end of the guidance ranges we provided in October. Revenue was $3.9 billion, up slightly sequentially and down 7% year-",967,"Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, overall results for the fiscal second quarter were at or above the upper end of the guidance ranges we provided in October. Revenue was $3.9 billion, up slightly sequentially and down 7% year-over-year. Growth in Client Devices and Client Solutions was mostly offset by a decline in our Data Center Devices and Solutions end market. 
Looking at our end markets. Client Devices revenue was $2.1 billion, up 10% sequentially and 19% year-over-year. Work, school and game from home trends continue to drive demand for both our flash and hard drive solutions for notebook and desktop applications. 
In notebook and desktop, our Flash and Hard Drive revenue each grew over 20% sequentially, highlighting the power and value of our portfolio for our leading OEM customers. Demand for our smart video hard drive was much stronger than expected, growing 30% sequentially as demand continued to recover from the bottom set in fiscal fourth quarter of 2020 during the height of the COVID-related lockdowns. 
And lastly, Mobile revenue was down sequentially, with growth in recently introduced 5G phones offset by dynamics within China. 
Moving on to Data Center Devices and Solutions. Revenue was $807 million, down 29% sequentially and 46% from 1 year ago. Revenue from both capacity enterprise hard drives and enterprise SSDs were down sequentially. As Dave mentioned, we had an unexpected delay in a qualification at a CloudTitan. As a result, during the quarter, our capacity enterprise drive shipments were negatively impacted and inventory grew. We have since completed this qualification. And as Dave noted, given that a separate CloudTitan qualification was completed ahead of schedule, we now have 3 of the 4 CloudTitans qualified on our new energy-assisted drives. In addition, we are beginning to ramp our second-generation enterprise SSD products through calendar year 2021. 
Next, Client Solutions revenue was above expectations at $1 billion, up 19% sequentially and 6% from 1 year ago. The work, school and gaming from home trend benefited both hard drive and flash-based products, again, highlighting the powerful go-to-market synergies of this channel. 
Turning to revenue by technology. Flash revenue was $2 billion, down 2% sequentially and up 11% year-over-year. Flash ASPs were down 9% sequentially on a blended basis and down 6% on a like-for-like basis. Bit shipments were up 7% sequentially. 
Hard drive revenue was $1.9 billion, up 4% sequentially and down 20% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, total exabyte shipments were up 2%, and while the average price per hard drive decreased 8% to $73. 
As we move into cost and expenses, please note that all of my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the second quarter was 26.4%, up slightly sequentially and above the upper end of the guidance range provided in October. Our Flash gross margin was up 0.7 points from the last quarter to 27.1% as the mix shifted toward our client SSDs and we experienced a strong seasonal quarter in client solutions. We continued to achieve solid cost reductions. Our hard drive gross margin was 25.6%, down 0.6 points sequentially. The mix shift towards notebook and desktop hard drives and the early ramp of our energy-assisted drives pressured our gross margin. This includes COVID-related impact of approximately $32 million. 
Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.69, above our guidance range. Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $425 million, and free cash flow was $149 million. Capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment, and activity related to flash joint ventures on our cash flow statement with a cash outflow of $276 million. 
In the fiscal second quarter, we paid off $248 million in debt, including an optional debt paydown of $150 million and $35 million of the remaining SanDisk convertible notes. Our liquidity position continues to be strong. At the end of the quarter, we had $3 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and our gross debt outstanding was $9.3 billion. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.9x in the second quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA, as defined in our credit agreement, was $3.5 billion, flat sequentially, resulting in a leverage ratio of 2.7x. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes $1 billion in depreciation add-back associated with the joint ventures. This is not reflected in our cash flow statement. Please refer to the earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details. 
Moving on to our outlook. Our fiscal third quarter guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $3.85 to $4.05 billion, and we expect both HDD and Flash revenue to be in a similar range in the third quarter as they were in the second. This range is better-than-expected when you consider normal seasonality, which would have implied a 7% decrease sequentially in the third quarter. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be between 25.5% and 27.5%. We expect flash gross margin to improve sequentially as we anticipate flash price declines will improve from the fiscal second quarter and cost reductions will continue. Hard drive gross margin is expected to be down sequentially, primarily due to higher volumes of our 16-terabyte drive and a planned reduction in production volume. We expect the 18-terabyte drive to be the leading capacity point as we head into the second half of the calendar year, which should propel growth in this segment going forward. We expect operating expenses to be between $705 million and $725 million. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $70 million. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 23% in the third quarter, and we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.55 and $0.75 in the third quarter, assuming approximately 310 million fully diluted shares. Now I'll turn it back over to Dave."

Gaming is still -- I think it's not as significant as it was last quarter, given last quarter, there was a lot of buy in anticipation of the initial builds. So I would say it's down a little bit sequentially, but it's still a great market for us because we can play the console side of it and the retail with WD Black, which has been very, very well received in the retail channels. It is part of the reason the retail business is doing well, and the margins are good as we're investing in brand in addition to just the product.

So but it is, to your point, it's very dynamic given the COVID situation and the lockdown. So we'll see above seasonality performance. Q1 is a seasonally weak quarter for retail, but we're planning to do a little bit better than that."

So we feel pretty confident on the demand side. And we think the supply side appears to be pretty rational. And I think if that's the case, we should see margins improve from here.

And as I've highlighted a couple of times in the prepared remarks and what I said earlier, with our partner, Kioxia, we're the largest provider of flash memory in the industry. We jointly develop our technology road map. So we're heavily invested in that. We believe we've got tremendous technology that allows us to deliver the power performance bits we need. You see our technology is lower layer count than others. That means it's more efficient process. So we feel good about that, that sets us up to continue to drive the 15% year-over-year cost declines.

But then they're going to start working on, okay, I'm going to start looking at the road map of our products and make sure I've got the right fit. I'm investing in the right places. To me, your technology road map is kind of like an articulation of the future value of your company. What markets are you going to be in? Where are you going to invest? And the time line for those payouts are different -- there's different time horizons to that. So if you come into a technology franchise and you own it and you're in the middle of a big engagement with a customer, for example, you now have another person that can get involved in that process and understands immediately how to engage in that in a very senior way, how to communicate information, how to guide their teams, and so I think you'll see an immediate benefit. There's other parts of it where we're making decisions on what products are going to come to market in 2 years from now or 3 years from now. And so their job is to really integrate over all of those time horizons and get the best results, given the investment we put in the business. So we've seen benefits already. But there will be more to come. And I think you will see crisper execution, and you'll see that the portfolio is optimized to give us the best return for the investment we're making."

To start, our second quarter results were at or above the upper end of guidance ranges we provided in October. We reported revenue of $3.9 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.69. These r",1188,"Thanks, Peter, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. To start, our second quarter results were at or above the upper end of guidance ranges we provided in October. We reported revenue of $3.9 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.69. These results reflect continued growth in retail in what was a seasonally strong quarter. In addition, stronger demand for our client SSD products as well as our notebook and desktop hard drives contributed to upside in revenue.  
We continue to work hard delivering for our shareholders, customers, partners and communities. We adapted to changes in our business and continue to manage the ongoing challenges presented by the pandemic. Our results reflect the benefits of having such a diverse and deep product portfolio, fantastic franchises, a vast customer base and now an optimized organizational structure. As a result, we have a solid foundation to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities in front of us. I'm excited about the progress we've made over the last few months in the recently established Flash and HDD business units. Both franchises are led by exceptional leaders who are highly focused on executing their respective strategies by establishing their teams, evaluating technology and product development, engaging with customers and analyzing and effectively capturing target end markets.  
As we've highlighted in previous earnings calls, we are committed to delivering on our product road map, including advancing our product transitions. Notably, we are making great headway with the product transitions of our energy-assisted hard drives and enterprise SSDs. As you all know, these transitions are multi-quarter journeys, but I'm pleased with our progress, which I'll detail shortly. Although our progress to date is showing tangible results, there's still work to be done. We remain extremely focused on enhancing our ability to drive continued innovation and sustainable long-term shareholder value.  
Let me now provide a recap of our Flash and HDD businesses. Within Flash, we remain well positioned to address the digital transformation driven by businesses, schools and consumers that continue to leverage technology as a daily necessity for work, learning and a much needed form of entertainment. The pandemic has not only accelerated this transformation by the way we all use the cloud, but it has spurred technological innovation by driving the ability to access the cloud using very powerful and advanced end devices. The increasingly pervasive ability to access, store and share data from anywhere on any device has resulted in robust storage demand, particularly in smaller form factors, such as notebook, tablet and Chromebook.  
The attach rate of client SSDs into notebooks now exceeds 80%, while desktop penetration of client SSDs is around 40%. Furthermore, tablets and Chromebooks, which are all-flash based, represent a growing percentage of total PC demand. Our leading position in client NVMe-based SSDs and our strong relationships with the major PC OEMs drove our  our client SSD business to a record level of exabyte shipments. 
Retail continued to perform well in a seasonally strong quarter, and we achieved a 2-year high in revenue, supported by the strength of our brand and the breadth of our portfolio. We continue to make progress with our second-generation enterprise SSD products, completing nearly 150 qualifications. Importantly, we completed the qualification process at one cloud titan, which was an objective we committed to last quarter. We are shipping to this cloud titan in the fiscal third quarter. The second-generation enterprise SSD qualification process is well underway with additional cloud titans and large OEMs.  
From a technology perspective, we began shipping our 112 layer BiCS5 technology and client SSD products in the December quarter. BiCS5 remains the most capital-efficient technology node in the recent history of NAND going back to the 2D era, and we are preparing for a significant ramp of this node through 2021. 
Ultimately, customers want the best product that offers a blend of cost, performance and power, and Western Digital provides that. Our focus on technological and architectural innovations, coupled with the benefits of size and scale that we have with our joint venture with Kioxia, has enabled us to deliver the industry's highest bit density per layer at the lowest cost per bit. As the result of our inherent advantages with the joint venture, particularly our scale and consistent track record of technological innovation, we are able to deliver the required bit growth and performance with the lowest capital intensity in the industry. We are highly confident in our ability to continue this momentum as we ramp BiCS5 through calendar year 2021 and begin BiCS6 productization.  
On the HDD side of the business, upside demand in PC, notebook and smart video more than offset weakness in capacity enterprise. The persisting work-from-home and distance learning trends I touched upon earlier drove higher demand for both desktop and notebook PC hard drives and propelled retail hard drive revenue to a 3-year high. The smart video business continued to recover, growing 30% sequentially.  
The biggest HD update is our solid progress against the initiatives we outlined last quarter, completing the qualification process at the cloud titans with our mass market energy-assisted hard drives. I'm pleased to share that we have now completed qualifications at 3 of the 4 U.S. cloud titans. While one now completed cloud titan qualification slipped beyond our anticipated time line in the fiscal second quarter, another cloud titan qualification scheduled to complete in the fiscal third quarter was completed in the second quarter. With these significant milestones now behind us, we have staged products in anticipation of the ramp of these drives as we continue through 2021.  
With cloud digestion abating and the stabilization of OEM demand, we believe the demand in capacity enterprise bottomed in the fiscal second quarter and are anticipating a rebound in the fiscal third quarter. 18-terabyte is expected to be our leading capacity point as we head into the second half of the calendar year, which should propel nice growth in this segment going forward. As the volume of these drives continues to ramp through the calendar year, we expect our revenue and gross margin to recover.  
Before I turn it over to Bob, I'll quickly summarize our perspective on what's to come. We continue to deal with the far-reaching effects of the pandemic, and no one can be certain of what the new normal will look like. However, there is no question the accelerated digital transformation has only increased the reliance on data and technology in both our professional and our personal lives, which we are confident will have a lasting impact for years to come. To this point, some industry analysts are raising the possibility that in certain portions of the market, such as the cloud, the storage industry will not be able to meet the extraordinary demand for both flash and hard drive solutions over the course of the next 10 years. Western Digital's unique ability to provide flash and hard drive storage solutions for customers spanning individual consumers to cloud titans highlights the value and importance of our broad portfolio and strong competitive position. 
I'll now turn the call over to Bob to share details on our financial results."

Looking at our end markets. Client Devices revenue was $2.1 billion, up 10% sequentially and 19% year-over-year. Work, school and game from home trends continue to drive demand for both our flash and hard drive solutions for notebook and desktop applications.  
In notebook and desktop, our Flash and Hard Drive revenue each grew over 20% sequentially, highlighting the power and value of our portfolio for our leading OEM customers. Demand for our smart video hard drive was much stronger than expected, growing 30% sequentially as demand continued to recover from the bottom set in fiscal fourth quarter of 2020 during the height of the COVID-related lockdowns. And lastly, Mobile revenue was down sequentially with growth in recently introduced 5G phones, offset by dynamics within China.  
Moving on to Data Center Devices and Solutions. Revenue was $807 million, down 29% sequentially and 46% from a year ago. Revenue from both capacity enterprise hard drives and enterprise SSDs were down sequentially. As Dave mentioned, we had an unexpected delay in a qualification at a cloud titan. As a result, during the quarter, our capacity enterprise drive shipments were negatively impacted and inventory grew. We have since completed this qualification. And as Dave noted, given that a separate cloud titan qualification was completed ahead of schedule, we now have 3 of the 4 cloud titans qualified on our new energy-assisted drives. In addition, we are beginning to ramp our second-generation enterprise SSD products through calendar year 2021.  
Next, Client Solutions revenue was above expectations at $1 billion, up 19% sequentially and 6% from a year ago. The work, school and gaming from home trend benefited both hard drive and flash-based products, again, highlighting the powerful go-to-market synergies of this channel.  
Turning to revenue by technology. Flash revenue was $2 billion, down 2% sequentially and up 11% year-over-year. Flash ASPs were down 9% sequentially on a blended basis and down 6% on a like-for-like basis. Bit shipments were up 7% sequentially. Hard drive revenue was $1.9 billion, up 4% sequentially and down 20% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, total exabyte shipments were up 2%, while the average price per hard drive decreased 8% to $73.  
As we move into cost and expenses, please note that all of my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the second quarter was 26.4%, up slightly sequentially and above the upper end of the guidance range provided in October. Our Flash gross margin was up 0.7 points from the last quarter to 27.1% as the mix shifted toward our client SSDs and we experienced a strong seasonal quarter in client solutions. We continued to achieve solid cost reductions. Our hard drive gross margin was 25.6%, down 0.6 points sequentially. The mix shift towards notebook and desktop hard drives and the early ramp of our energy-assisted drives pressured our gross margin. This includes COVID-related impact of approximately $32 million.  
Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.69, above our guidance range. Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $425 million, and free cash flow was $149 million. Capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment, and activity related to flash joint ventures on our cash flow statement with a cash outflow of $276 million.  
In the fiscal second quarter, we paid off $248 million in debt, including an optional debt paydown of $150 million and $35 million of the remaining SanDisk convertible notes. Our liquidity position continues to be strong. At the end of the quarter, we had $3 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and our gross debt outstanding was $9.3 billion. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.9x in the second quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA, as defined in our credit agreement, was $3.5 billion, flat sequentially, resulting in a leverage ratio of 2.7x. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes $1 billion in depreciation add-back associated with the joint ventures. This is not reflected in our cash flow statement. Please refer to the earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details.  
Moving on to our outlook. Our fiscal third quarter guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $3.85 billion to $4.05 billion, and we expect both HDD and Flash revenue to be in a similar range in the third quarter as they were in the second. This range is better than expected when you consider normal seasonality, which would have implied a 7% decrease sequentially in the third quarter. 
We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be between 25.5% and 27.5%. We expect flash gross margin to improve sequentially as we anticipate flash price declines will improve from the fiscal second quarter and cost reductions will continue. Hard drive gross margin is expected to be down sequentially, primarily due to higher volumes of our 16-terabyte drive and a planned reduction in production volume. We expect the 18-terabyte drive to be the leading capacity point as we head into the second half of the calendar year, which should propel growth in this segment going forward. 
We expect operating expenses to be between $705 million and $725 million. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $70 million. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 23% in the third quarter, and we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.55 and $0.75 in the third quarter, assuming approximately 310 million fully diluted shares. 
Now I'll turn it back over to Dave."

We're still -- client SSD is obviously a strength for the company and has been for a while. We talked about gaming last quarter. And then mobile, we still have a healthy mix into mobile. I think we're under-indexed to the market, but we're still in that market because it's very, very important to be in that market. So I expect a balanced mix across that. And then you mix in some IoT and automotive, and you get most of the portfolio."

I think we've made a lot of progress on the -- what -- just what you said, really understanding where the synergies of this portfolio are, which are on the go-to-market side, the fact that we bring a broader solution to our customers. And I think we understand our customers' requirements well given that we can play in both the drive market and the flash market, but that they're very different products and driving the road maps up. I mean the technology is extremely important and to separate those in the BU. And I think we're -- it's still pretty early, but the impact of having 2 very accomplished leaders join an already strong team, it just has an immediate impact on clarifying the road map, understanding where we're investing our R&D dollars, engaging with customers in a way that can drive the portfolio. So I think we've made really good progress there, but I think it'll continue to get better as we go when these leaders get -- and the groups get more established. 
And then the other thing I'll say, which is not really something that I expect to get better, I think it's something that I just always want to reinforce is the value of the partnership with Kioxia.

To me, your technology road map is kind of like an articulation of the future value of your company. What markets are you going to be in? Where are you going to invest? And the time line for those payouts are different -- there's different time horizons to that. 
So if you come into a technology franchise and you own it and you're in the middle of a big engagement with a customer, for example, you now have another person that can get involved in that process and understands immediately how to engage in that in a very senior way, how to communicate information, how to guide their teams, and so I think you'll see an immediate benefit. There's other parts of it where we're making decisions on what products are going to come to market in 2 years from now or 3 years from now. And so their job is to really integrate over all of those time horizons and get the best results, given the investment we put in the business.

As far as how the architecture of the cloud plays out, I mean, clearly, as we have more devices that are enabled at the edge, I think you're going to see more points of compute and storage that get closer to that. I agree with you, this could be -- it could be getting closer. It's been talked about for a while. But I think this is something that's so exciting about our business.

I think the architectures to support that are going to continue to evolve, and I think we have the portfolio that's well positioned no matter how that plays out. We can play on the edge all the way to the device. And clearly, we play at the foundation of the cloud as well. So it's a fun place to be."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call today. We reported solid third quarter results above the guidance range provided in January with revenue of $4.1 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 27.7% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.02. The Sequential revenue growth was driven by increasing momentum of our high-capacity energy-assisted drives and our second-generation NVMe enterprise SSDs, improving NAND flash pricing trends, along with the continued accelerated digital transformation across end markets. 
As we continue to manage the impact of the pandemic, we know that the world is not only more technology-enabled, but also more technology-dependent than ever before. From the intelligent edge to the cloud, data storage is a fundamental component underpinning the global technology architecture. Western Digital strengths in technology and cost leadership, expansive product portfolio and broad routes to market are providing a foundation upon which we are solidifying our position as an essential building block of the digital economy. These strengths, combined with our increased operational and strategic focus enabled by our new business unit structure are driving results. As we continue to face a dynamic environment, we are seeing the benefits of the synergistic value in the breadth of Western Digital's portfolio and our unique ability to deliver both hard drives and flash solutions to our diverse end markets and customer base. 
Let me now provide a recap of our flash and HDD businesses. Within flash, the depth and breadth of our product line, distribution channels, cost leadership and customer base are significant differentiators. Our ability to act swiftly and shift bits to meet customer demand in various end markets ranging from data centers to retail enabled us to grow both revenue and gross margin in the third quarter. Within data center, devices and solutions, we experienced significant growth in the quarter with our second-generation NVMe enterprise SSD at a cloud Titan. In addition, we are seeing many cloud customers also utilize NAND flash for their consumer product lines. This creates many opportunities for us as a strategic partner as we continue to diversify and balance the end markets we serve. 
We are already achieving significant progress in VR headsets, game consoles and other at-home entertainment devices where we have experienced over 10x bid growth last calendar year and expect to double again this calendar year. In Client Devices, continued strength in PC demand, along with the new game console ramps drove sequential revenue growth above typical seasonal trends. Retail remained a high-performing end market as our brand recognition, broad product portfolio and extensive distribution channels continue to distinguish Western Digital from our competitors. In particular, it was a solid quarter for gaming with our WD Black product line having maintained strong levels of interest as gamers have gravitated towards more customized solutions by delivering reliable performance, expansive storage capabilities and a hyperrealistic gaming experience, our industry-leading WD Black portfolio is trusted by gamers to perform their best. 
We are also excited about the future as Western Digital's technology road map and cost leadership will continue to drive our ability to meet customers' needs. BIC 5 is in the midst of a significant ramp, exceeding customers' expectations and delivering the reliability and performance our customers depend upon. Moreover, the technology advancements we made with BiCS5 have allowed us to achieve the scale, efficiency and bit growth needed while using a lower number of layers, resulting in lower costs and lower capital intensity. We continue to expect BIC 5 bid crossover later in 2021. Finally, in February, we revealed BIC 6, our next-generation flash device based on 162 layer and CUA technology, developed in partnership with Kioxia as part of our long-standing successful joint venture BIC 6 features numerous architectural advancements, including improved lateral scaling, which allows us to deliver this high-performing product at an optimal cost. This marks another major milestone in our 20-year relationship with Kioxia. And together, we will continue to drive innovation to meet the needs of our respective customers in their diverse applications. In HDD, revenue growth was led by capacity enterprise drives, a trend that tilts the overall HDD market to growth as demand for capacity enterprise drives will more than offset the decline in client drives. 
Meanwhile, retail HDD demand was better than expected, supported by continued work-from-home, distance learning and at home entertainment trends. We continue to see enterprise demand stabilizing and expect to pick up as employees return to work. We have completed qualifications for our energy-assisted drives with nearly all our cloud and enterprise customers, including all the cloud titans and expect an aggressive ramp of our 18-terabyte hard drives. 
Building on this success, we've entered into long-term agreements with a number of our cloud titans for 18-terabyte drives. These commitments underscore our product leadership and the importance of capacity enterprise drives to our data center customers. As we continue to navigate challenges brought on by COVID-19, we know that the world is not only more technology enabled, but also more technology dependent. We believe this is a fundamental and sustainable trend, highlighting the importance of Western Digital's broad portfolio of storage solutions, and we're encouraged by what's ahead. In flash, improving pricing trends in the retail and transactional portions of the market are translating to better pricing in the negotiated portions of the market. And we expect this trend to continue in the fiscal fourth quarter. Our unique ability to provide high volumes of flash and hard drive solutions through extensive distribution channels and to diversified end markets provides us with broad demand visibility, enabling our team to optimize product mix and profitability. 
In the cloud, we remain uniquely positioned to benefit from the strong growth in this sector, where NAND flash and hard drives are complementary solutions. We expect the strength to build as we progress through the calendar year, led by the ramp of our 18-terabyte hard drives as well as broad-based growth in flash. And while we are excited about these drivers, we are also keeping close watch on some headwinds. To date, we have been able to largely mitigate the impact of the industry-wide semiconductor component shortages through proactive supply chain management. We are, however, experiencing tightness in controllers as well as flash, which could limit potential upside in the future. We also recognize that while the pandemic effects are lessening in some regions, others are unfortunately experiencing another wave of cases. We are actively managing through this environment, which continues to have ongoing impacts to our business. I'll now turn the call over to Bob to share details on our financial results."

As Dave mentioned, overall results for the third fiscal quarter were above the upper end of the guidance ranges provided in January. Flash revenue and gross margin improvement were the primary contributors to the upside versus guidance. Total revenue was $4.1 billion, up 5% sequentially and down 1% year-over-year. Looking at our end markets, client devices revenue was $2 billion, down 6% sequentially and up 10% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, client SSD revenue was flat and notebook and desktop PC hard drive revenue was down, though it decreased less than what we're used to seeing based on typical seasonality. 
Gaming revenue grew while mobile revenue was down on a sequential basis. 
Moving on to data center devices and solutions. Revenue was $1.2 billion, up 53% sequentially, but down 19% from a year ago. Revenue from both capacity enterprise hard drives and enterprise SSDs grew sequentially.. We were encouraged to see the sequential growth driven by our new energy-assisted hard drives at the 16- and 18-terabyte capacity points and our second-generation NVMe enterprise SSD products, both targeted for the cloud and large-scale enterprise OEMs. 
Lastly, Client Solutions revenue was $888 million, down 12% sequentially and up 8% from a year ago. 
Turning to revenue by technology. Flash revenue was $2.2 billion, up 7% sequentially and up 6% year-over-year. Flash ASPs were down 2% sequentially on a blended basis and flat on a like-for-like basis. Flash bit shipments increased 8% sequentially. Hard drive revenue was $2 billion, up 3% sequentially and down 7% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, total hard drive shipments increased by 7%, while the average price per hard drive increased 14% to $82. As we move to costs and expenses, please note that my comments will be related to non-GAAP results, unless stated otherwise. 
Gross margin for the third quarter was 27.7%, up 1.3 percentage points sequentially. This was above the upper end of the guidance range provided in January. Continued success in driving down costs, coupled with an improving pricing environment, and our ability to shift bits to more attractive end markets drove our flash gross margin up 2.9 percentage points sequentially to 30.0%. Our hard drive gross margin was 25%, down 0.5 percentage points sequentially. As noted last quarter, production ramp costs of our new energy-assisted drives and a planned reduction in overall unit shipped pressured gross margin. This also includes COVID-19 related impact of $31 million or approximately 1.6 percentage points. 
Operating expenses of $732 million were higher than guidance due to a larger-than-expected variable compensation accrual tied to our improved profitability. With our improving profitability, our tax rate in the fiscal third quarter was 8%, which was well below our prior expectations. And directly resulted in a $0.17 benefit to our earnings per share. We now expect our tax rate to be 17% for fiscal year 2021. Earnings per share was $1.02. Excluding the tax benefit, earnings per share was still well above guidance. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $116 million and free cash flow was negative $11 million. Capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to flash joint ventures on our cash flow statement was a cash outflow of $127 million. 
In the fiscal third quarter, we paid off $212 million in debt, including an optional debt paydown of $150 million. We'll also be making an additional optional debt payment of $150 million this Friday. Highlighting the confidence we have in our cash flow generation for the fourth quarter. Our liquidity position continues to be strong. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and our gross debt outstanding was $9 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA, as defined in our credit agreement was $3.5 billion, resulting in a gross leverage of 2.6x. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes a $1 billion add-back of depreciation associated with the joint ventures. This is not reflected in our cash flow statement. Please refer to the earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details. 
Moving on to our outlook. Our fiscal fourth quarter non-GAAP guidance is as follows: We expect revenues to be in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion, and we expect both hard drive and flash revenue to be up sequentially. We expect gross margin to be between 30% and 32%. We expect both flash and hard drive gross margin to improve sequentially as well. We expect operating expenses to be between $760 million and $790 million. Interest and other expense is expected to be between $68 million and $73 million. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 17% in the fourth quarter and the fiscal year. We expect earnings per share to be between $1.30 and $1.60 in the fourth quarter, assuming approximately 317 million fully diluted shares outstanding. 
Now I'll turn it back over to Dave."

And then getting to scale on the capacity points where we can continue to drive the costs down. And we can't control the pricing in the market, but continuing to deliver a strong to proposition for our customers. And that's what we're continuing to do. We believe we have a long road map of continued density and aerial density improvements on HDDS. They're the foundational storage element in the cloud, which I think is a very good place to be.

I mean, I think it's what -- I think you're starting to see the better execution. And on the flash side, build out the portfolio across a number of end markets, which I think that enterprise SSD was a big piece of getting that established with the cloud titans. We clearly have a very strong client SSD portfolio. We have, I think, a very strong retail portfolio. Mobility we've talked about. We stay qualified with all the top vendors. We're very much participate in that market, maybe -- definitely less than some others. And then we have a lot of new products coming around gaming and smart home devices, where because of our strong relationships with those big cloud customers that also drive that portfolio gives us kind of a front-row seat as those are developed. So I think it's built out the portfolio and then use our routes to market to deliver the best return we can, given the pricing environment in the market. And I think we're able to do that in flash this quarter and balance the portfolio across all the markets and put the agility in the system to make sure that we're doing that. 
And I would say from a year ago to where we are now and the way we executed the last quarter, there's just much more agility in the system and to be able to react and get the best outcome we can. In the hard drive side, it's drive -- continue to drive aerial density and leadership, return to a leadership position as we did with 18 and then continue that forward. It's a good market. I think we've had a long-standing position there. And then I think there's -- we've seen the synergy between the 2 portfolios in the client space on we have a great client SSD portfolio where these technologies were substitutes for each other. We had long-standing relationships with those customers where we can manage that transition.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call today. We reported solid third quarter results above the guidance range provided in January, with revenue of $4.1 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 27.7% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.02.
Sequential revenue growth was driven by increasing momentum of our high capacity energy-assisted drives and our second-generation NVMe enterprise SSDs, improving NAND flash pricing trends, along with the continued accelerated digital transformation across end markets. As we continue to manage the impact of the pandemic, we know that the world is not only more technology-enabled, but also more technology dependent than ever before.
From the intelligent edge to the cloud, data storage is a fundamental component underpinning the global technology architecture.
Western Digital's strengths in technology and cost leadership, expansive product portfolio and broad routes to market are providing a foundation upon which we are solidifying our position as an essential building block of the digital economy. These strengths, combined with our increased operational and strategic focus enabled by our new business unit structure, are driving results. As we continue to face a dynamic environment, we are seeing the benefits of the synergistic value in the breadth of Western Digital's portfolio, and our unique ability to deliver both hard drives and flash solutions to our diverse end markets and customer base.
Let me now provide a recap of our Flash and HDD businesses. Within Flash, the depth and breadth of our product line, distribution channels, cost leadership and customer base are significant differentiators. Our ability to act swiftly and shift bits to meet customer demand in various end markets, ranging from data centers to retail, enabled us to grow both revenue and gross margin in the third quarter.
Within Data Center Devices and Solutions, we experienced significant growth in the quarter with our second-generation NVMe enterprise SSD in a cloud titan. In addition, we are seeing many cloud customers also utilize NAND flash for their consumer product lines. This creates many opportunities for us as a strategic partner as we continue to diversify and balance the end markets we serve. We are already achieving significant progress in VR headsets, game consoles and other at-home entertainment devices where we have experienced over 10x bit growth last calendar year and expect to double again this calendar year.
In Client Devices, continued strength in PC demand, along with the new game console ramps drove sequential revenue growth above typical seasonal trends. Retail remained a high-performing end market as our brand recognition, broad product portfolio and extensive distribution channels continue to distinguish Western Digital from our competitors. In particular, it was a solid quarter for gaming with our WD Black product line having maintained strong levels of interest as gamers have gravitated towards more customized solutions. By delivering reliable performance, expansive storage capabilities and a hyperrealistic gaming experience, our industry-leading WD Black portfolio is trusted by gamers to perform their best.
We are also excited about the future as Western Digital's technology road map and cost leadership will continue to drive our ability to meet customers' needs. BiCS5 is in the midst of a significant ramp, exceeding customers' expectations and delivering the reliability and performance our customers depend upon. Moreover, the technology advancements we made with BiCS5 have allowed us to achieve the scale, efficiency and bit growth needed while using a lower number of layers resulting in lower costs and lower capital intensity. We continue to expect BiCS5 bit crossover later in 2021.
Finally, in February, we revealed BiCS6, our next-generation flash device, based on 162 layer and CuA technology, developed in partnership with Kioxia as part of our long-standing successful joint venture, BiCS6 features numerous architectural advancements, including improved lateral scaling, which allows us to deliver this high-performing product at an optimal cost. This marks another major milestone in our 20-year relationship with Kioxia. And together, we will continue to drive innovation to meet the needs of our respective customers in their diverse applications.
In HDD, revenue growth was led by capacity enterprise drives, a trend that tilts the overall HDD market to growth as demand for capacity enterprise drives will more than offset the decline in client drives. Meanwhile, retail HDD demand was better than expected, supported by continued work from home, distance learning and at-home entertainment trends. We continue to see enterprise demand stabilizing and expect to pick up as employees return to work.
We have completed qualifications for our energy-assisted drives with nearly all our cloud and enterprise customers, including all the cloud titans and expect an aggressive ramp of our 18-terabyte hard drives. Building on this success, we've entered into long-term agreements with a number of our cloud titans for 18-terabyte drives. These commitments underscore our product leadership and the importance of capacity enterprise drives to our data center customers.
As we continue to navigate challenges brought on by COVID-19, we know that the world is not only more technology-enabled, but also more technology dependent. We believe this is a fundamental and sustainable trend, highlighting the importance of Western Digital's broad portfolio of storage solutions, and we're encouraged by what's ahead.
In flash, improving pricing trends in the retail and transactional portions of the market are translating to better pricing in a negotiated portions of the market, and we expect this trend to continue in the fiscal fourth quarter. Our unique ability to provide high volumes of flash and hard drive solutions through extensive distribution channels and to diversified end markets provides us with broad demand visibility, enabling our team to optimize product mix and profitability.
In the cloud, we remain uniquely positioned to benefit from the strong growth in this sector, where NAND flash and hard drives are complementary solutions. We expect the strength to build as we progress through the calendar year, led by the ramp of our 18-terabyte hard drives as well as broad-based growth in flash. And while we are excited about these drivers, we are also keeping close watch on some headwinds.
To date, we have been able to largely mitigate the impact of the industry-wide semiconductor component shortages through proactive supply chain management. We are, however, experiencing tightness in controllers as well as flash, which could limit potential upside in the future. We also recognize that while the pandemic effects are lessening in some regions, others are unfortunately experiencing another wave of cases. We are actively managing through this environment, which continues to have ongoing impacts to our business.
I'll now turn the call over to Bob to share details on our financial results."

As Dave mentioned, overall results for the third fiscal quarter were above the upper end of the guidance ranges provided in January. Flash revenue and gross margin improvement were the primary contributors to the upside versus guidance. Total revenue was $4.1 billion, up 5% sequentially and down 1% year-over-year.
Looking at our end markets, client Devices revenue was $2 billion, down 6% sequentially and up 10% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, client SSD revenue was flat and notebook and desktop PC hard drive revenue was down, though it decreased less than what we're used to seeing based on typical seasonality. Gaming revenue grew, while mobile revenue was down on a sequential basis.
Moving on to Data Center Devices and Solutions. Revenue was $1.2 billion, up 53% sequentially, but down 19% from a year ago. Revenue from both capacity enterprise hard drives and enterprise SSDs grew sequentially. We were encouraged to see the sequential growth driven by our new energy-assisted hard drives at the 16- and 18-terabyte capacity points and our second-generation NVMe enterprise SSD products, both targeted for the cloud and large-scale enterprise OEMs.
Lastly, Client Solutions revenue was $888 million, down 12% sequentially and up 8% from a year ago.
Turning to revenue by technology. Flash revenue was $2.2 billion, up 7% sequentially and up 6% year-over-year. Flash ASPs were down 2% sequentially on a blended basis and flat on a like-for-like basis. Flash bit shipments increased 8% sequentially.
Hard drive revenue was $2 billion, up 3% sequentially and down 7% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, total hard drive exabyte shipments increased by 7%, while the average price per hard drive increased 14% to $82.
As we move to costs and expenses, please note that my comments will be related to non-GAAP results, unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the third quarter was 27.7%, up 1.3 percentage points sequentially. This was above the upper end of the guidance range provided in January. Continued success in driving down costs, coupled with an improving pricing environment and our ability to shift bits to more attractive end markets, drove our flash gross margin up 2.9 percentage points sequentially to 30.0%.
Our hard drive gross margin was 25%, down 0.5 percentage points sequentially. As noted last quarter, production ramp costs of our new energy-assisted drives and a planned reduction in overall units shipped pressured gross margin. This also includes COVID-19-related impact of $31 million or approximately 1.6 percentage points.
Operating expenses of $732 million were higher than guidance due to a larger-than-expected variable compensation accrual tied to our improved profitability. With our improving profitability, our tax rate in the fiscal third quarter was 8%, which was well below our prior expectations and directly resulted in a $0.17 benefit to our earnings per share. We now expect our tax rate to be 17% for fiscal year 2021.
Earnings per share was $1.02. Excluding the tax benefit, earnings per share was still well above guidance. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $116 million and free cash flow was negative $11 million. Capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to flash joint ventures on our cash flow statement was a cash outflow of $127 million.
In the fiscal third quarter, we paid off $212 million in debt, including an optional debt paydown of $150 million. We'll also be making an additional optional debt payment of $150 million this Friday, highlighting the confidence we have in our cash flow generation for the fourth quarter. Our liquidity position continues to be strong. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and our gross debt outstanding was $9 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA, as defined in our credit agreement, was $3.5 billion, resulting in a gross leverage of 2.6x. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes a $1 billion add-back of depreciation associated with the joint ventures. This is not reflected in our cash flow statement. Please refer to the earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details.
Moving on to our outlook. Our fiscal fourth quarter non-GAAP guidance is as follows. We expect revenues to be in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion, and we expect both hard drive and flash revenue to be up sequentially. We expect gross margin to be between 30% and 32%. We expect both flash and hard drive gross margin to improve sequentially as well.
We expect operating expenses to be between $760 million and $790 million. Interest and other expense is expected to be between $68 million and $73 million. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 17% in the fourth quarter and the fiscal year. We expect earnings per share to be between $1.30 and $1.60 in the fourth quarter, assuming approximately 317 million fully diluted shares outstanding.
Now I'll turn it back over to Dave."

So there are multi-quarter agreements, as you would imagine. And we talk about the amount of demand they are going to have, and we set a price for that period.

And then getting to scale on the capacity points where we can continue to drive the costs down. And -- we can't control the pricing in the market, but continuing to deliver a strong TCO proposition for our customers. And that's what we're continuing to do.

So we're working on -- I mean, obviously, we're working to get as much supply as we can. I mean this past quarter, we did see shortages in controllers, let's say, in places like Chromebooks, where we probably couldn't get as many controllers as we would have liked and could have shipped a little more into that.
But in general, what we're able to do is with the supply we have is shift the portfolio around where we get the biggest return for that, whether it's moving those controllers to products in the channel or in retail -- from retail into the channel and vice versa, where we're going to get the highest return. So the agility, I think, that the team is implementing on all of our different go-to-market routes has been very beneficial over the last couple of quarters, and I expect it to be going forward as well.
So we're able to mitigate it a little bit. We're not able to completely escape it, but we're going to continue working to get all the supply we can. And we definitely know what the forecast. It's matched to the supply we have. So we don't expect any surprises from that regard."

I mean, I think it's what -- I think you're starting to see the better execution. And on the flash side, build out the portfolio across a number of end markets, which I think that enterprise SSD was a big piece of getting that established with the cloud titans. We clearly have a very strong client SSD portfolio. We have, I think, a very strong retail portfolio. Mobility, we've talked about. We stay qualified with all the top vendors. We very much participate in that market, maybe less than -- definitely less than some others.
And then we have a lot of new products coming around gaming and smart home devices, where because of our strong relationships with those big cloud customers that also drive that portfolio gives us kind of a front-row seat as those are developed. So I think it's built out the portfolio and then use our routes to market to deliver the best return we can, given the pricing environment in the market. And I think we're able to do that in flash this quarter and balance the portfolio across all the markets and put the agility in the system to make sure that we're doing that. And I would say from a year ago to where we are now and the way we executed the last quarter, there's just much more agility in the system and to be able to react and get the best outcome we can.
In the hard drive side, it's drive -- continue to drive aerial density and leadership, return to a leadership position as we did with 18 and then continue that forward. It's a good market. I think we've had a long-standing position there. And then I think there's -- we've seen the synergy between the 2 portfolios in the client space. We have a great client SSD portfolio where these technologies were substitutes for each other. We had long-standing relationships with those customers where we can manage that transition. And in the data center, they're more complementary technologies, and I think the ability to execute that synergy is in front of us."

I mean, I think everybody is trying to figure out what's the long-term demand for technology coming out of pandemic. It's kind of a unique situation, so -- but we're staying very close to it. And our view is that industry has been pretty balanced on the whole topic."

And then you mentioned longer-term relationships and contracts with cloud titans and hyperscalers. Do they allow for flexibility and pricing? The reason why I ask is recent NAND pricing came out and it was quite positive. And we just want to make sure that you're not missing the opportunity for better economics from pricing. And so I was just kind of wondering without any specific some of your relationships of quantity and volumes and pricing, are there some abilities to adjust it?

So yes. I mean, I think the market was good for us. And as I said, the go-to-market teams and the BU teams were very agile as far as shifting our supply around on where we could get the best return for it in the quarter. As far as going forward, I mean, we're guiding for sequential improvement in flash gross margin. We're seeing that. We saw the pricing strength that we -- or firmness that we saw in the transactional markets translate into the negotiated markets.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 results. We reported solid fourth quarter results with revenue of $4.9 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 33% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.16, all above the guidance ranges we provided in April. The upside was primarily driven by record demand for our capacity enterprise hard drives. Fiscal year 2021 revenue totaled $16.9 billion, and we reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.55. 
Last March, I joined Western Digital with a strong conviction in the digital transformation that is reshaping every industry, every company and every person's day-to-day life. At that time, we were in the early stages of the pandemic. Today, the accelerated digital transformation that has occurred during this period has created a world that is more technology-enabled and technology-dependent than ever before. The increasing value and importance of data is undeniable, and Western Digital will continue to capitalize on this opportunity as the only provider of both flash and hard drive solutions. Our ability to provide this diverse range of technologies enables us to drive innovation from endpoints, to the edge, to the cloud. And combined with our commitment to delivering the highest quality products is ultimately what sets us apart and allows us to deliver strong results. 
As we reflect on this fiscal year, I'm very proud of what Western Digital has accomplished, particularly in light of the fact that the pandemic impacted various aspects of our company and the supply chain. As a team, we made the changes throughout the year necessary to improve our focus, sharpen execution and lay out the right strategic goals to place Western Digital in a position of greater strength. To achieve these goals, we created separate business units for our flash and HDD technologies led by 2 widely respected technology leaders. As a result of this renewed focus, we accelerated our innovation road map, built momentum in our energy-assisted hard drives and continue to successfully ramp our second-generation NVMe enterprise SSDs while working hard to complete additional customer qualifications. We were also able to successfully navigate through the pandemic, capitalize on opportunities and continue providing dependable, industry-leading products that are the cornerstones of the data economy. 
We continue to believe that we have the right foundation for success, the right market-leading products, the right customer base and the unique ability to address 2 large and growing markets. That foundation continues to underspend the strength of our results and is propelling the business forward today, even as we manage through some of the lingering impacts from COVID. And while we saw incremental demand due to the emergence of Chia, our standout performance this quarter was primarily attributable to increasing demand from our cloud customers and the beginning of a recovery in enterprise demand, the breadth and quality of our product line and our many routes to market. We feel we are well positioned to capitalize on the large and growing opportunities in front of us. 
With that, I'll now provide a recap of our flash and HDD businesses as it relates to our fourth quarter results. In the fourth quarter, demand for our flash products was greater than we could supply in a number of end markets. In the face of both component and NAND shortages, we continue to strategically shift bits to meet customer needs while driving growth in both revenue and gross margin. Within Data Center Devices and Solutions, demand for our NVMe enterprise SSDs came in above our expectations, achieving strong quarter-over-quarter revenue growth. We are pleased with our progress in enterprise SSDs as we completed a qualification at another cloud titan and are ramping the product more broadly. 
Within client SSD, we experienced revenue growth as demand remains strong for notebooks and Chromebooks. This remains a large, growing and important end market for Western Digital across our OEM, channel and retail routes to market. Within gaming, demand from the latest generation of game consoles and our WD Black product line was robust as gamers continue to prefer our expanding lineup of customized solutions. Within Embedded Flash, we also experienced growth in smart home devices, VR, automotive and industrial. As the BiCS5 ramp picks up and we achieved bit crossover late this year, we expect to see increased bit growth. To date, BiCS5 is our most capital-efficient node in the 3D era, and the ramp across our product lines will contribute to profitable growth. 
We have had incredible success with BiCS4 from across cost and bit growth perspective and look forward to experience those same benefits with BiCS5, highlighting once again the successful and important partnership we have with Kioxia. In HDD, we had our highest organic sequential revenue growth in the last decade, driven by the successful ramp of our 18 terabyte energy-assisted hard drive, growing cloud demand, a recovery in enterprise spending and, to a lesser extent, cryptocurrency driven by Chia. This impressive performance is a reflection of our data center customers confidence in our innovation engine for capacity enterprise hard drives. 
Shipments for our 18-terabyte hard drive nearly tripled sequentially, highlighting our leadership in the latest capacity point and the leading-edge energy assist technology underpinning it. These drives are fully commercialized, and we expect the 18-terabyte hard drive to be the workhorse for the fiscal year. I'm excited to announce a record shipment of over 104 exabytes in capacity enterprise hard drives, a 49% increase sequentially. This is a significant achievement for the business as we have all of our largest customers qualified and are well into ramping our energy-assisted hard drives. In addition, client demand for desktop and smart video has been strong throughout the quarter due to improving OEM demand. While we are actively managing supply constraints, we expect strength in OEM to continue in the fiscal first quarter. 
Within retail, HDD demand was above expectations as we saw consumer interest grow for both at-home HDD storage and for smart video applications. There was also increased demand for hard drives due to proof of space cryptocurrencies such as Chia, which emerged as a new vertical market at the beginning of the quarter. We believe proof of space cryptocurrency presents a great opportunity for us in the industry, but we are closely monitoring the sustainability of demand. Looking ahead, we strongly believe the fundamental technology shift that I referenced earlier is a sustainable trend. At the center of this innovation, our ever-increasing intelligent devices, which are fueling exponential industry-wide growth in demand, all powered by the cloud, the ability to harness the data in both the device and in the data center is critical highlighting the importance of our full range of storage solutions. Moreover, we believe we have the right portfolio to enable us to capture these opportunities. In particular, and as Dr. Siva Sivaram, President of Technology and Strategy, discussed in a webcast on July 15, Western Digital's unique ability to deliver both HDD and flash solutions drives meaningful synergies across the business in 4 key areas: market, manufacturing, technology and customer. And our new operating structure gives us the focus we need to capture our full potential.
While we remain optimistic, there are several factors we are closely monitoring. Most importantly, we are actively managing the continued impact of the pandemic. The disruptions to the supply chain have presented a challenge across the industry, and we continue to see shortages of certain components. Additionally, logistics remain a challenge as different geographies are in various stages of reopening. This has been a major contributor to increased lead times and may pose challenges in the future. As a result of the supply disruptions, logistics challenges and increased lead times, we continue to face additional cost pressures. Despite these obstacles, we are working diligent to continue delivering to our customers while maintaining a disciplined approach to pricing. I'll now turn the call over to Bob to share details on our financial results."

Mobile revenue was essentially flat on a sequential basis. 
Moving on to Data Center Devices and Solutions. Revenue was $1.8 billion, up 44% sequentially and up 6% from a year ago. New product ramps in this end market drove more than double the revenue growth from just 2 quarters ago. Revenue generated from our latest generation energy-assisted hard drives and enterprise SSDs contributed to the growth. Our capacity enterprise hard drives grew 49% sequentially and our enterprise SSDs grew 39% sequentially. Demand for our 18-terabyte energy-assisted hard drives was particularly strong, comprising nearly half of our capacity enterprise exabyte shipments. 
Finally, Client Solutions revenue was $977 million, up 10% sequentially and up 42% from a year ago. Once again, revenue growth was broad-based across both HDD and flash and all major product categories. 
Turning to revenue by technology. Flash revenue was $2.4 billion, up 11% sequentially and up 8% year-over-year. Flash ASPs were up 7% sequentially on a blended basis and up 4% on a like-for-like basis. Flash bit shipments increased 4% sequentially. Hard drive revenue was $2.5 billion, up 28% sequentially and up 22% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, total hard drive exabyte shipments increased 34% while the average price per hard drive increased 18% to $97. As we move to costs and expenses, please note that my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 32.9%, up 5.2 percentage points sequentially. This was above the upper end of the guidance range provided in April. Our broad routes to market and ability to proactively shift bits to the most attractive end markets enabled us to expand our gross margin by 5.5 percentage points sequentially to 35.5%. 
Our hard drive gross margin was 30.3%, up 5.3 percentage points sequentially. This also includes a COVID-related impact of $32 million or approximately 1.3 percentage points. Operating expenses were $790 million within our guidance range. Operating income was $828 million, representing a 101% increase from the prior quarter and a 57% increase year-over-year. With our improving profitability, our tax rate in the fiscal fourth quarter was 9.2% and the tax rate was 13.4% for fiscal year 2021. Earnings per share was $2.16. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $994 million, and free cash flow was $792 million. Capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to our flash joint ventures on our cash flow statement, was an outflow of $202 million. We expect gross CapEx for the next fiscal year to be approximately $3 billion and cash CapEx to be around $2 billion. 
In the fiscal fourth quarter, we paid off $212 million in debt, including a discretionary debt payment of $150 million. For the full fiscal year, we paid down a total of $886 million. Our gross debt outstanding was $8.8 billion at the end of the fiscal quarter. Additionally, we have already made a discretionary debt payment of $150 million in the fiscal first quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA, as defined in our credit agreement, was $3.6 billion, resulting in a gross leverage ratio of 2.4x compared to 2.8% a year ago. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes $1 billion in depreciation add-back associated with the joint ventures. This is not reflected in our cash flow statement. Please refer to the earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details. 
Our liquidity position continues to be strong. At the end of the quarter, we had $3.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents. In addition, we have unused revolver capacity of $2.25 billion. 
Moving on to our outlook. Our fiscal first quarter non-GAAP guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 33% and 35%. We expect hard drive gross margin to be relatively flat, and we expect flash gross margin to improve sequentially. We expect operating expenses to be between $755 million and $785 million. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $70 million. The tax rate is expected to be between 11% and 12% in the fiscal first quarter and the fiscal year. We expect earnings per share to be between $2.25 and $2.55 in the first quarter, assuming approximately 317 million fully diluted shares outstanding. I'll now turn the call back over to Dave."

We've got 2 growing businesses and they are going to require capital going forward. On the hard drive side, we're at the point where we can no longer transition assets the client side of the business to the capacity enterprise business.

On the drive side, we saw a big step up this quarter, driven by a number of things. We've been talking about the 18-terabyte capacity point is much better for us for a number of quarters now, and we saw that play out. We obviously got some benefit from Chia as well. But predominantly innovation-led story from my perspective. But we believe this business inside our company needs to be more profitable. We've talked about it several times on this call. We're now looking at this transition from client capacity to capacity enterprise, nearline or enterprise drives that is -- that era is coming to an end. It's been a long one. It's been -- it's taken a decade to go through that transition. 
But when we look at the exabyte growth going forward, that's going to take investment, and we want that investment to be fully justified. So -- and again, it's no surprise to me that now we're talking about these more longer-term agreements. And again, we're early days in those, but those are the conversations with customers. I remember when I came in this business, whatever 5 quarters ago, everything was transacted on a quarterly or even within the quarter basis. And now we're moving to, in parts of the business, multiquarter basis. And I think that will continue because we need more visibility into demand to make sure we can continue to fuel the growth of the cloud. I think the cloud is an incredible technology, the seminal technology of our era, as I like to say, and continuing to fuel the growth of that is very important. And 35% exabyte growth is going to take investment, and I think that's going to take -- we're going to want to see the internals of our business, be able to support that. 
So on the flash side, we're going to -- just 1 final comment on that. We're also continuing to innovate in hard drives and drive costs down as well. I think we think about cost downs more in the flash business, but we also continue to drive them in the drive business. So we have that dynamic working as well. And on flash, we all know about how dynamic the pricing environment is. We feel very good about our technology road map. We've talked about that. We're at the  transition point to BiCS5. We feel good about that node as we transition to that over the next couple of quarters, we'll see our bit growth accelerate and that foundational investment with Kioxia, I think, puts us in a very good position to have the technology road map to structurally support margins in the business. 
Clearly, a better pricing environment as we're seeing helps margins in that business. We expect it to be better next quarter. That's the way we're guiding. And as we look even beyond the second half and we look into next year, we continue to see a strong demand environment that's getting out there pretty far. But from what our customers are telling us on what they think the demand is going to be for their products, like I said, we're all more technology-dependent than ever. We continue to hear good things about what they're going to be asking for next year. So structurally, we think with the technology with the innovation we're driving in both portfolios, that puts us in a good position to continue to drive profitability in these businesses."

I mean, as we -- I think as we've talked about, we're in this period in the hard drive business, where it's been transitioning for a long time from a business that was client dominated to a business that is cloud-dominated is, I guess, 1 way to think",403,"Yes. I mean, as we -- I think as we've talked about, we're in this period in the hard drive business, where it's been transitioning for a long time from a business that was client dominated to a business that is cloud-dominated is, I guess, 1 way to think about it. And if we look at the utilization of our factories, you can see that very clearly year-over-year, the percentage of drives that were headed for the the cloud versus the ones that are headed for clients has been steadily shifting over a decade. And now we're at the point where we're looking at investments in both in heads and also when you build a bigger drive, it takes longer to test all those kinds of things, testing capacity in the factory. So yes, as we go through those conversations, it's really important to understand from our customers what their growth is going to be. 
We see 30% to 35% exabyte growth in the cloud for the foreseeable future. We want to make sure that they see that same amount. And as we as we align on that growth, and we invest in our business to support it, I think that's where this idea of long-term agreements come in place and to help drive the profitability for the business. We think the innovation is delivering. I mean it starts with delivering a product that is very -- solves our customers' problem, and we're delivering a very strong TCO model with every generation of this product that we build. We're driving a lot of innovation. We talked about it here with energy assist, which is something that we've been working on for quite some time. And quite frankly, it's a good accomplishment for the team, a great accomplishment. It feels good to take something that was an idea many, many years ago and now turn it into something where the largest customers in the world are betting their business and their data center on that innovation. 
And so to continue to fuel that innovation engine, we've got many, many innovations lined up to continue to drive the portfolio and making sure we can invest in that and meet the growth of our customers. Getting the economics of that right is very important. 
All right, everybody. Thanks for your time today. We really appreciate it. We'll be seeing you throughout the quarter. Thanks very much."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 results.
We reported solid fourth quarter results with revenue of $4.9 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 33% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.16, all above the guidance ranges we provided in April. The upside was primarily driven by record demand for our capacity enterprise hard drives. Fiscal year 2021 revenue totaled $16.9 billion, and we reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.55.
Last March, I joined Western Digital with a strong conviction in the digital transformation that is reshaping every industry, every company and every person's day-to-day life. At that time, we were in the early stages of the pandemic. Today, the accelerated digital transformation that has occurred during this period has created a world that is more technology-enabled and technology-dependent than ever before. The increasing value and importance of data is undeniable, and Western Digital will continue to capitalize on this opportunity as the only provider of both flash and hard drive solutions.
Our ability to provide this diverse range of technologies enables us to drive innovation from endpoints, to the edge, to the cloud, and combined with our commitment to delivering the highest quality products, is ultimately what sets us apart and allows us to deliver strong results. As we reflect on this fiscal year, I'm very proud of what Western Digital has accomplished, particularly in light of the fact that the pandemic impacted various aspects of our company and the supply chain.
As a team, we made the changes throughout the year necessary to improve our focus, sharpen execution and lay out the right strategic goals to place Western Digital in a position of greater strength. To achieve these goals, we created separate business units for our flash and HDD technologies, led by 2 widely respected technology leaders.
As a result of this renewed focus, we accelerated our innovation road map, built momentum in our energy-assisted hard drives and continue to successfully ramp our second-generation NVMe enterprise SSDs while working hard to complete additional customer qualifications. We were also able to successfully navigate through the pandemic, capitalize on opportunities and continue providing dependable, industry-leading products that are the cornerstones of the data economy.
We continue to believe that we have the right foundation for success, the right market-leading products, the right customer base and the unique ability to address 2 large and growing markets. That foundation continues to underspin the strength of our results and is propelling the business forward today, even as we manage through some of the lingering impacts from COVID.
And while we saw incremental demand due to the emergence of Chia, our standout performance this quarter was primarily attributable to increasing demand from our cloud customers and the beginning of a recovery in enterprise demand, the breadth and quality of our product line and our many routes to market. We feel we are well positioned to capitalize on the large and growing opportunities in front of us.
With that, I'll now provide a recap of our flash and HDD businesses as it relates to our fourth quarter results. In the fourth quarter, demand for our flash products was greater than we could supply in a number of end markets. In the face of both component and NAND shortages, we continue to strategically shift bits to meet customer needs while driving growth in both revenue and gross margin.
Within Data Center Devices and Solutions, demand for our NVMe enterprise SSDs came in above our expectations, achieving strong quarter-over-quarter revenue growth. We are pleased with our progress in enterprise SSDs as we completed a qualification at another cloud titan and are ramping the product more broadly.
Within client SSD, we experienced revenue growth as demand remained strong for notebooks and Chromebooks. This remains a large, growing and important end market for Western Digital across our OEM, channel and retail routes to market. Within gaming, demand from the latest generation of game consoles, and our WD_BLACK product line was robust as gamers continue to prefer our expanding lineup of customized solutions.
Within embedded flash, we also experienced growth in smart home devices, VR, automotive and industrial. As the BiCS5 ramp picks up and we achieve bit crossover late this year, we expect to see increased bit growth. To date, BiCS5 is our most capital-efficient node in the 3D era, and the ramp across our product lines will contribute to profitable growth. We have had incredible success with BiCS4 from across cost and bit growth perspective and look forward to experience those same benefits with BiCS5, highlighting once again the successful and important partnership we have with Kioxia.
In HDD, we had our highest organic sequential revenue growth in the last decade, driven by the successful ramp of our 18-terabyte energy-assisted hard drive, growing cloud demand, a recovery in enterprise spending and, to a lesser extent, cryptocurrency driven by Chia. This impressive performance is a reflection of our data center customers' confidence in our innovation engine for capacity enterprise hard drives.
Shipments for our 18-terabyte hard drive nearly tripled sequentially, highlighting our leadership in the latest capacity point and the leading-edge energy-assist technology underpinning it. These drives are fully commercialized, and we expect the 18-terabyte hard drive to be the workhorse for the fiscal year. I'm excited to announce a record shipment of over 104 exabytes in capacity enterprise hard drives, a 49% increase sequentially. This is a significant achievement for the business, as we have all of our largest customers qualified and are well into ramping our energy-assisted hard drives.
In addition, client demand for desktop and smart video has been strong throughout the quarter due to improving OEM demand. While we are actively managing supply constraints, we expect strength in OEM to continue in the fiscal first quarter. Within retail, HDD demand was above expectations, as we saw consumer interest grow for both at-home HDD storage and for smart video applications.
There was also increased demand for hard drives due to proof-of-space cryptocurrencies such as Chia, which emerged as a new vertical market at the beginning of the quarter. We believe proof-of-space cryptocurrency presents a great opportunity for us in the industry, but we are closely monitoring the sustainability of demand.
Looking ahead, we strongly believe the fundamental technology shift that I referenced earlier is a sustainable trend. At the center of this innovation, our ever-increasing intelligent devices, which are fueling exponential industry-wide growth in demand, all powered by the cloud, the ability to harness the data in both the device and in the data center is critical, highlighting the importance of our full range of storage solutions.
Moreover, we believe we have the right portfolio to enable us to capture these opportunities. In particular and as Dr. Siva Sivaram, President of Technology and Strategy, discussed in a webcast on July 15, Western Digital's unique ability to deliver both HDD and flash solutions drives meaningful synergies across the business in 4 key areas: market, manufacturing, technology and customer. And our new operating structure gives us the focus we need to capture our full potential.
While we remain optimistic, there are several factors we are closely monitoring. Most importantly, we are actively managing the continued impact of the pandemic. The disruptions to the supply chain have presented a challenge across the industry, and we continue to see shortages of certain components. Additionally, logistics remain a challenge as different geographies are in various stages of reopening. This has been a major contributor to increased lead times and may pose challenges in the future.
As a result of the supply disruptions, logistics challenges and increased lead times, we continue to face additional cost pressures. Despite these obstacles, we are working diligent to continue delivering to our customers while maintaining a disciplined approach to pricing.
I'll now turn the call over to Bob to share details on our financial results."

As Dave mentioned, overall results for the fiscal fourth quarter were above the upper end of the guidance ranges provided in April.
Total revenue for the quarter was $4.9 billion, up 19% sequentially and up 15% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.16. For the full fiscal year, revenue was $16.9 billion, up 1% from fiscal 2020. And non-GAAP EPS was $4.55, up 50% from last year.
Looking at our end markets. Client Devices revenue was $2.2 billion, up 8% sequentially and up 13% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, we experienced revenue growth in both hard drives and flash and across every major product category: client HDDs, client SSDs, automotive, gaming, smart video and industrial. Mobile revenue was essentially flat on a sequential basis.
Moving on to Data Center Devices and Solutions. Revenue was $1.8 billion, up 44% sequentially and up 6% from a year ago. New product ramps in this end market drove more than double the revenue growth from just 2 quarters ago. Revenue generated from our latest generation energy-assisted hard drives and enterprise SSDs contributed to the growth. Our capacity enterprise hard drives grew 49% sequentially, and our enterprise SSDs grew 39% sequentially. Demand for our 18-terabyte energy-assisted hard drives was particularly strong, comprising nearly half of our capacity enterprise exabyte shipments.
Finally, Client Solutions revenue was $977 million, up 10% sequentially and up 42% from a year ago. Once again, revenue growth was broad-based across both HDD and flash and all major product categories.
Turning to revenue by technology. Flash revenue was $2.4 billion, up 11% sequentially and up 8% year-over-year. Flash ASPs were up 7% sequentially on a blended basis and up 4% on a like-for-like basis. Flash bit shipments increased 4% sequentially. Hard drive revenue was $2.5 billion, up 28% sequentially and up 22% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, total hard drive exabyte shipments increased 34%, while the average price per hard drive increased 18% to $97.
As we move to costs and expenses, please note that my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 32.9%, up 5.2 percentage points sequentially. This was above the upper end of the guidance range provided in April. Our broad routes to market and ability to proactively shift bits to the most attractive end markets enabled us to expand our gross margin by 5.5 percentage points sequentially to 35.5%. Our hard drive gross margin was 30.3%, up 5.3 percentage points sequentially. This also includes a COVID-related impact of $32 million or approximately 1.3 percentage points.
Operating expenses were $790 million, within our guidance range. Operating income was $828 million, representing a 101% increase from the prior quarter and a 57% increase year-over-year. With our improving profitability, our tax rate in the fiscal fourth quarter was 9.2%, and the tax rate was 13.4% for fiscal year 2021. Earnings per share was $2.16.
Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $994 million, and free cash flow was $792 million. Capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to our flash joint ventures on our cash flow statement, was an outflow of $202 million. We expect gross CapEx for the next fiscal year to be approximately $3 billion and cash CapEx to be around $2 billion.
In the fiscal fourth quarter, we paid off $212 million in debt, including a discretionary debt payment of $150 million. For the full fiscal year, we paid down a total of $886 million. Our gross debt outstanding was $8.8 billion at the end of the fiscal quarter. Additionally, we have already made a discretionary debt payment of $150 million in the fiscal first quarter.
Our adjusted EBITDA, as defined in our credit agreement, was $3.6 billion, resulting in a gross leverage ratio of 2.4x compared to 2.8 a year ago. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes $1 billion in depreciation, add-back associated with the joint ventures. This is not reflected in our cash flow statement. Please refer to the earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details.
Our liquidity position continues to be strong. At the end of the quarter, we had $3.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents. In addition, we have unused revolver capacity of $2.25 billion.
Moving on to our outlook. Our fiscal first quarter non-GAAP guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 33% and 35%. We expect hard drive gross margin to be relatively flat. And we expect flash gross margin to improve sequentially.
We expect operating expenses to be between $755 million and $785 million. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $70 million. The tax rate is expected to be between 11% and 12% in the fiscal first quarter and the fiscal year. We expect earnings per share to be between $2.25 and $2.55 in the first quarter, assuming approximately 317 million fully diluted shares outstanding.

We brought energy-assist to market. We've been talking about it for many quarters now. We've been giving a lot of visibility into the qualification process because it is new technology that's been worked on for a very, very long time.

We're clearly trying to shift as much as we can into the higher-margin markets. But every quarter, the mix is going to be a little bit different. And depending on what our commitments are, we have commitments to customers as to how much we're going to supply in any given quarter.

Capacity point is",606,"So I think the answer to that is -- I don't think -- the answer to that is yes. Let's go through each business. On the drive side, we saw a big step up this quarter, driven by a number of things. We've been talking about the 18-terabyte. Capacity point is much better for us for a number of quarters now, and we saw that play out. We obviously got some benefit from Chia as well, but predominantly innovation-led story from my perspective.
But we believe this business inside our company needs to be more profitable. We've talked about it several times on this call. We're now looking at this transition from client capacity to capacity enterprise, nearline or enterprise drives that is -- that era is coming to an end. It's been a long one. It's been -- it's taken a decade to go through that transition. But when we look at the exabyte growth going forward, that's going to take investment, and we want that investment to be fully justified.
So -- and again, it's no surprise to me that now we're talking about these more longer-term agreements. And again, we're early days in those, but those are the conversations with customers. I remember when I came in this business, whatever, 5 quarters ago, everything was transacted on a quarterly or even within the quarter basis. And now we're moving to, in parts of the business, multi-quarter basis. And I think that will continue because we need more visibility into demand to make sure we can continue to fuel the growth of the cloud.
I think the cloud is an incredible technology, the seminal technology of our era, as I like to say, and continuing to fuel the growth of that is very important. And 35% exabyte growth is going to take investment, and I think that's going to take -- we're going to want to see the internals of our business to be able to support that.
So on the flash side, we're going to -- just one final comment on that. We're also continuing to innovate in hard drives and drive costs down as well. I think -- we think about cost downs more in the flash business, but we also continue to drive them in the drive business. So we have that dynamic working as well.
And on flash, we all know about how dynamic the pricing environment is. We feel very good about our technology road map. We've talked about that. We're at the transition point to BiCS5. We feel good about that node. As we transition to that over the next couple of quarters, we'll see our bit growth accelerate. And that foundational investment with Kioxia, I think, puts us in a very good position to have the technology road map to structurally support margins in the business.
Clearly, a better pricing environment, as we're seeing, helps margins in that business. We expect it to be better next quarter. That's the way we're guiding. And as we look even beyond the second half and we look into next year, we continue to see a strong demand environment that's getting out there pretty far.
But from what our customers are telling us on what they think the demand is going to be for their products, like I said, we're all more technology-dependent than ever, we continue to hear good things about what they're going to be asking for next year. So structurally, we think with the technology, with the innovation we're driving in both portfolios, that puts us in a good position to continue to drive profitability in these businesses."

I mean, as we -- I think as we've talked about, we're in this period in the hard drive business, where it's been transitioning for a long time from a business that was client-dominated to a business that is cloud-dominated is, I guess, one way to think about it. And if we look at the utilization of our factories, you can see that very clearly, year-over-year, the percentage of drives that were headed for the cloud versus the ones that are headed for clients has been steadily shifting over a decade.
And now we're at the point where we're looking at investments in -- both in heads and also when you build the bigger drive, it takes longer to test, all those kinds of things, testing capacity in the factory. So yes, as we go through those conversations, it's really important to understand from our customers what their growth is going to be. We see 30% to 35% exabyte growth in the cloud for the foreseeable future. We want to make sure that they see that same amount.
And as we align on that growth and we invest in our business to support it, I think that's where this idea of long-term agreements come in place and to help drive the profitability for the business. We think the innovation is delivering. I mean it starts with delivering a product that is very -- solves our customers' problem. And we're delivering a very strong TCO model with every generation of this product that we build. We're driving a lot of innovation. We talked about it here with energy-assist, which is something that we've been working on for quite some time.
And quite frankly, it's a good accomplishment for the team, a great accomplishment. It feels good to take something that was an idea many, many years ago and now turn it into something where the largest customers in the world are betting their business and their data center on that innovation. And so to continue to fuel that innovation engine, and we've got many, many innovations lined up to continue to drive the portfolio and making sure we can invest in that and meet the growth of our customers. Getting the economics of that right is very important.
All right, everybody. Thanks for your time today. We really appreciate it. We'll be seeing you throughout the quarter. Thanks very much."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call to discuss our first quarter of fiscal year 2022 results. We reported revenue of $5.1 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 33.9% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.49, all within the guidance ranges we provided in August. This marks the sixth quarter in a row of meeting or exceeding guidance, a point that we are particularly proud of as we continue to navigate uncertainty and volatility in the market. 
Strong demand across diverse end markets, particularly for our cloud products, combined with Western Digital's strong innovation, broad routes to market and sharpened execution enabled us to deliver results within our guidance range despite significant COVID impacts and supply chain disruptions. While these disruptions are transitory, the long-term opportunities for Western Digital remain unchanged as the world's digital transformation continues to accelerate. During the quarter, we shipped a record level of exabytes, while also improving non-GAAP gross margins across both flash and HDD and generating profitable growth. 
We saw strong demand for our latest generation hard drives and flash products in the cloud end market as well as strong consumer demand for new 5G-based mobile phones incorporating our latest BiCS5 flash solutions. The strong demand for these products were partially offset by pressure in the commercial channel within the client end market and certain portions of the consumer end markets, particularly retail. This was attributable to component issues impacting our customers' ability to ship products, greater component sourcing constraints within our own operations and uneven geographic demand due to COVID lockdowns. 
Our continued focus on innovation and a more agile business unit structure enabled us to quickly adapt to these dynamics. When combined with an industry-leading portfolio and a strong go-to-market operation, I'm confident in Western Digital's ability to continue to generate improved operational performance for all of our stakeholders. Before I get into the business trends, I want to highlight a few changes we made to our end market breakdown, which, we believe, will help you understand why Western Digital is well positioned to capitalize on the opportunity presented by the increasing value and importance of data. 
We now split our end markets into cloud, client and consumer. The cloud represents an incredibly large and growing end market for Western Digital, and we are uniquely positioned to address customer storage needs as the only provider of both hard drive and flash products. During the first quarter, cloud represented a record 44% of total revenue, led by record capacity enterprise hard drive revenue and nearly 30% sequential growth in enterprise SSD revenue. 
We believe the accelerated digital transformation will continue to drive growth in this end market and continue to shift our business mix towards the cloud. As we ramp our new innovative products and continue leveraging the benefits of the organization structure we put into place last September, I am confident we will capture opportunities to achieve a more stable and profitable growth profile over the long term. The client end market represented 37% of revenue in the first quarter. Here, we are providing a broad array of high-performance flash and hard drive solutions to our OEM and channel customers across PC, mobile, gaming, automotive, VR headsets, at-home entertainment devices and industrial spaces. 
Lastly, the consumer end market accounted for 19% of revenue in the first quarter. The highlight of this end market is the strength of our SanDisk brand of retail products and the WD_BLACK brand of storage products for gaming enthusiasts, which is strong and growing. The brand recognition and infinity, combined with our unmatched reach with nearly 400,000 points of presence across the world is a great setup for Western Digital as we enter a seasonally stronger part of the year. 
With that, I'll now provide a recap of our HDD and flash businesses as it relates to our first quarter results. In HDD, continued strong demand for our latest generation energy-assisted drives among our cloud and enterprise customers drove record revenue and exabyte shipments in our cloud end market. In addition, we experienced strong revenue growth in our smart video product line, and we're unable to meet demand. 
During the quarter, we announced OptiNAND, a revolutionary technology that utilizes flash in the HDD control plane to further increase aerial density. With this leading architecture, we achieved 20-terabyte capacity using our field-proven 9-disk mechanical platform and ePMR technology. Next month will commence volume shipments of our 20-terabyte CMR hard drives based on OptiNAND technology. In flash, revenue grew in the quarter due to continued strong demand within the cloud and client end markets for our latest generation of our enterprise SSD products and the ramp of new 5G phones incorporating our latest BiCS5 node. 
Within enterprise SSD, we experienced continued success in the cloud with another successful quarter of qualifications. We are now qualified at 3 cloud titans and have made excellent progress working our way through the qualification process in the enterprise and distribution channels. We expect these qualifications to start to drive accelerated revenue growth in 2022 as our customers begin to deploy these products into their networks. 
The ramp of next-generation 5G phones incorporating our latest generation of BiCS5 products accelerated in the quarter, with revenue growing over 20% sequentially. We expect this migration to 5G, combined with a continued increase in the amount of storage per phone to drive another strong quarter of revenue growth in the fiscal second quarter. Gaming was strong in the quarter with a solid lineup of products for game consoles along with a growing brand recognition of WD_BLACK based products in the channel and retail. 
Heading into the second fiscal quarter, we are well positioned to take advantage of seasonal strength and grow in a wide variety of gaming channels. As I noted earlier, the client PC OEMs, distribution channel and retail were impacted by our customers' ability to ship product greater component sourcing constraints within our own operations and uneven geographic demand due to COVID lockdowns. Demand was solid, but the transitory issues impacted our ability to realize this demand in our results. In total, bid growth accelerated to 30% year-over-year in the first quarter as we ramp BiCS5 to 17% of Flash revenue. This quarter, we expect year-over-year bid growth to further accelerate to the mid-30s range with BiCS5 crossover to happen later in the quarter. 
Our long-term goal is to grow in line with the market, taking advantage of our product and end market breadth to shift our to optimize profitability. As we look into calendar year 2022, we are optimistic as our customers continue to indicate strong end demand across cloud, client and consumer end markets. We have industry-leading technology, the right product portfolio and investments and the organizational agility to fundamentally drive improved profitability regardless of market condition. 
We have a great position in 2 large and growing markets in flash and HDD, and we have proven our ability to drive innovation throughout our portfolio and deliver industry-leading products to a broad and loyal customer base. We believe that the migration to the cloud and demand for storage solutions throughout the client and consumer markets will drive a huge opportunity for Western Digital and our customers. I'll now turn the call over to Bob to share details on our financial results."

As Dave mentioned, overall results for the fiscal first quarter were within the guidance ranges provided in August, marking the sixth quarter in a row that we've met or exceeded guidance. Total revenue for the q",1031,"Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, overall results for the fiscal first quarter were within the guidance ranges provided in August, marking the sixth quarter in a row that we've met or exceeded guidance. Total revenue for the quarter was $5.1 billion, up 3% sequentially and up 29% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.49. Please note that EPS included $56 million in total COVID-related costs, which was higher than we anticipated entering the quarter. I'll provide more details on these costs in a minute, but we are pleased to deliver such good results in the face of this unanticipated headwind and other supply chain issues. 
From a disclosure perspective, in addition to the change in our end market breakdown that Dave discussed, this quarter, we moved to segment reporting for our flash and hard drive businesses. For more details, please refer to our earnings deck. Looking at our end markets, cloud represented 44% of revenue at $2.2 billion, up 12% sequentially and up 72% from a year ago. This represented the second quarter in a row of record revenue. What is encouraging about this cloud revenue growth is the strength and breadth of our revenue streams across product areas. 
There was growth on a sequential basis in both the flash and hard drive business units as well as across every product category within the cloud, including capacity enterprise drives, enterprise SSDs, smart video and platforms. As the cloud continues to grow as a percentage of our revenue, we see an opportunity to reduce volatility in revenue and profitability. Over the last 3 quarters, we have successfully ramped our 18-terabyte energy-assisted drive to our highest volume mainstream product within the cloud end market. 
Overall, cloud HDD exabyte shipments grew 9% sequentially and over 70% year-over-year and comprised over 80% of total HDD exabyte shipments. Client represented 37% of revenue at $1.9 billion, down 2% sequentially and up 6% year-over-year. A highlight within the client end market was growth within our flash business unit, specifically in mobile, gaming, automotive, IoT and industrial applications. Our strength here was more than offset by pressure in desktop and notebook hard drives due to supply disruptions at our customers and within our own operations. 
Finally, consumer represented 19% of revenue at $973 million, down 6% sequentially, but up 10% year-over-year. Both our flash and hard drive business units declined on a sequential basis due to similar supply disruptions in addition to uneven geographic demand due to COVID lockdowns. Turning now to revenue by segment. We reported flash revenue of $2.5 billion, up 3% sequentially and up 20% year-over-year. On a blended basis, flash ASPs were down 3% sequentially, primarily due to mix and pricing within our transactional markets. On a like-for-like basis, flash ASPs were flat. 
Flash bit shipments increased 8% sequentially and 30% year-over-year. Hard drive revenue was $2.6 billion, up 2% sequentially and up 39% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, total hard drive exabyte shipments increased 4%, while the average price per hard drive increased 5% to $102. As we look at costs and expenses, please note that my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the first quarter was 33.9%, up 1 percentage point sequentially. As noted earlier, this included $56 million in COVID-related costs or a 1.1 percentage point impact. These were the highest COVID-related costs in over a year. 
Our broad routes to market and ability to proactively shift bits to the most attractive end markets enabled us to expand our flash gross margin by 1.5 percentage points sequentially to 37%. Our hard drive gross margin was 30.9%, up 60 basis points sequentially. This included COVID-related impact of $51 million or approximately 2 percentage points. Operating expenses were $761 million, within our guidance range. Operating income was $952 million, representing a 15% increase from the prior quarter and tripling year-over-year, highlighting our profitable growth. 
With our improving profitability, our tax rate in the fiscal first quarter was 11%. Earnings per share was $2.49, toward the top of our guidance range. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $521 million, and free cash flow was $224 million. Capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to our flash joint ventures on our cash flow statement, was a cash outflow of $297 million. We continue to expect gross CapEx for this fiscal year to be approximately $3 billion and cash CapEx to be around $2 billion. 
In the fiscal first quarter, we paid off $213 million in debt, including a discretionary debt repayment of $150 million. Our gross debt outstanding was $8.6 billion at the end of the fiscal quarter. In addition, as a result of our strong financial results and free cash flow generation, last week, we repaid the remaining balance of our term loan B in the amount of $943 million, bringing total gross debt outstanding to $7.7 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA at the end of the first quarter, as defined in our credit agreement, was $4.2 billion, resulting in a gross leverage ratio of 2.0x, down from 2.7 a year ago and was the lowest in 3 years. 
As a reminder, our credit agreement includes $1 billion in depreciation add-back associated with the flash ventures. This is not reflected in our cash flow statement. Please refer to the earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details. Moving on to our outlook. Our fiscal second quarter non-GAAP guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion and we expect flash revenue to increase sequentially and hard drive revenue to decline sequentially. 
We expect gross margin to be between 32% and 34%. we expect operating expenses to be between $760 million and $780 million. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $70 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 11% in the second quarter and for the fiscal year. We expect earnings per share to be between $1.95 and $2.25 in the second quarter, assuming approximately 316 million fully diluted shares outstanding. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Dave."

I want to conclude by thanking the Western Digital team for their hard work and commitment to our customers throughout a challenging quarter.

With our deep roots in a broad range of end markets and a sharp focus on execution, I'm confident in Western Digital's ability to capture this massive opportunity, and I'm looking forward to the rest of the fiscal year.

We talked about that even in this past quarter in the video market, which is strong and there's some unmet demand there.

We're talking to those customers now about 2022 plans and what they plan to do and how much supply they're going to need and share conversations with each of them and those conversations are going well. The smartphone market, again, we continue to see this past quarter and the quarter in, we're seeing really good strength in that market. So I think this is -- there's a larger point here about the flash market is that the number of end markets is just more diverse now, especially with enterprise SSD growing and getting to be such a big market that there's a much better mix of demand that we play across in the market. And so we see strength in PC. We see strength in smartphones. We see strength in data center. Like we said, the more transactional markets this past quarter is more nodal transitions going on. There was more bits available in those markets, and we definitely saw that. But again, we're heading into a seasonally strong quarter on retail.

I think what I said earlier is we're actually in December to be a little more challenging than what we saw in September and the September quarter not easy.

And we've done a really excellent job in terms of working with local governments to try and get as many employees vaccinated as possible and to really do the best we can to assure supply in terms of our own factories. Now as we mentioned, like everyone else, we have challenges in terms of getting components as well, particularly, obviously, the controllers on both the hard drive and the flash side, and that has an impact on the business. I don't know quarter-to-quarter, which quarter is worse, but it's a challenge in both of them. And it's a challenge that's not going to go away soon in terms of the semiconductor availability. I mean we're getting some lead times of 50 weeks right now. So it's definitely a very real issue in terms of getting components in. And then we've already talked a fair amount about the customer challenges. And I would say it feels to me and Dave can comment like there are more customers impacted by the supply chain in the December quarter than there were in the September quarter.

I think when we talk to our sales teams and we talk to our customers, I mean it's -- I think just over the last month or so, the number of places where we're hearing, they are not able to meet their own true demand or they can't pull the demand from us if they're building their own infrastructure because the supply chain components has definitely broadened. And it's -- I think it started in some of the PC makers. I think that's where we heard the most about it, if you go back a couple of quarters. And now, like I said, we're hearing more about it in other segments, including the big data center providers. So it's definitely an impact of the business, and we just navigate through it. I mean, I think when you talk to our customers and we talk to our own own sales teams and we look at what everybody is telling us, the end demand continues to be very, very strong. And everybody is just trying to figure out how to meet that and how to get enough components and get the right components to build the right kit, whether it's for something they're going to sell or it's building their own infrastructure to build what they need. And as Bob said, we see that ourselves. And our ability to get components and our ability to make sure our factories continue to run. And I will say I'll be a little bit selfish here and complement our own teams. But the Delta variant in Asia was a very big impact. And this quarter was probably one of the most difficult since COVID started. There were points where we had thousands of employees in quarantine and still kept everything going. So when you see what's happening on the ground and what the impact has been, it's not hard to understand how all the discussions around supply chain impacts. I think the good news is that we're working very, very hard, as Bob said, with governments to get vaccines distributed and get things back on track. And as we exit the quarter, and we sit here today, things were in a much, much better shape than they were a couple of months ago. So it makes us optimistic as we go through 2022, that this will get worked out and that will all be able to meet the true demand that's out there."

I think nearly 50% or more, 60% on what they were last quarter, where we had been steady state for probably 3, 4 quarters in a row, and now we've bumped up significantly. So a lot of that is cost going into managing our own infrastructure and work that's going on with our own teams. Of course, a lot of it is logistics as well. That's always a big component of it. So those costs are going up. Our own supply is mainly around controllers. I think it's fair to say. And as Bob said, we're planning a year out on lead times and working with our own suppliers on how we, number one, make sure we get everything we need to meet our demand, which has been challenging and then get it in a time frame that we need. But we're working through it. And like I said, I think that there's no doubt, if you go back a couple of quarters, we've been talking about this about how we were not able to meet all the demand that we saw out there. I think the thing that we see different walking into this quarter is there's -- we're seeing even a greater impact across all of our customer base, and it's spreading to places where we hadn't seen it before. And that's both raising the uncertainty and also just depressing the demand because customers can't get all the pieces they need, so they don't need everything from us. So we're starting to see some hints in some markets, starting to clear up a little bit, super early days. But again, if you look at what's going on in the ground in Asia, things are getting better, at least from our perspective, our narrow perspective, although we have 40,000, 50,000 people there. Things are getting better on the ground and that gives us optimism that the situation will improve from here as we go through '22."

We just have different customers in different states of their own ability to build what they need to build or want to build and that's constantly shifting. And when you add it all up in any particular quarter, you're going to get a result and that's what we got, and that's what we'll manage to.

If they can't do it this quarter, they'll get the components in the next quarter. So again, we see very good demand environment. And I think that as our customers are able to get all the components they need, they will continue to come back to us and adjust their demand to us. That's what we see. We have very close relationships with them. And so I don't expect that the demand from our customers' point of view is not like kind of a 1-quarter thing. It's like -- it's just -- it's a demand curve that goes on, and I don't see it as being perishable demand. I see it as everybody is trying to figure out how they can get as many components as they can to build complete kits for what they need to do. And as they do that, they come back to us and change their demand signal. And we've seen that. Maybe a good example is on some of the PC manufacturers, where 1 quarter, they'll drop their demand significantly. In the next quarter, they'll come back and raise it significantly when they've got their own supply chain issues worked out. So as I said, we've seen this in other parts of the market, and we've dealt with it, and we know how to deal with it. Now we're just seeing it across the broader cross-section of our business. And quite frankly, some really big customers across that are in that mix now. And we'll -- we've been working through this now for the last several quarters, and we'll work through it this quarter."

So we certainly have conversations with our customers when our costs increase, but it's not as simple as just passing it along. It's got to persist for a while before we would have that conversation. And quite frankly, we participate in a market. It's -- and so it's more about the market price. I think the overwhelming issue with pricing is around innovation, and making sure we continue to drive innovation across our portfolio. And as I look back on last quarter, the 2 things that -- 2 really big things that stand out to me from last quarter is, one, is just the execution of the team in a really, really difficult environment, especially the -- as I've talked a lot about the factories in Asia; and two is the innovation road map and the fact we're transitioning aggressively to BiCS5. We introduced OptiNAND. Those are the things we introduced a 20-terabyte drive and are going to be shipping that in volume now here in the next month. That's with our energy assist technology 9-platter, 9 disk drive, 2.2 terabytes per platter. So that's the primary issue where it's going to drive an innovation-led discussion with our customers about pricing. In the cost side of it, of course, as if they're going to be very long term, we're going to have those conversations. But I would say they're long and substantial relationships, and we manage through the quarter-to-quarter stuff with them really in both directions. But really, the focus is on that driving innovation. If you drive innovation, you're going to get a better return for it. And quite frankly, I think we've seen that over the last 3 or 4 quarters as we brought energy assist and our 18-terabyte drive, the 30.9%  gross margin this quarter in HDD is a multiyear high. So we feel very good about that."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call to discuss our first quarter of fiscal year 2022 results.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call to discuss our first quarter of fiscal year 2022 results. We reported revenue of $5.1 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 33.9% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.49, all within the guidance ranges we provided in August. This marks the sixth quarter in a row of meeting or exceeding guidance, a point that we are particularly proud of as we continue to navigate uncertainty and volatility in the market.
Strong demand across diverse end markets, particularly for our cloud products, combined with Western Digital's strong innovation, broad routes to market and sharpened execution enabled us to deliver results within our guidance range despite significant COVID impacts and supply chain disruptions. While these disruptions are transitory, the long-term opportunities for Western Digital remain unchanged as the world's digital transformation continues to accelerate.
During the quarter, we shipped a record level of exabytes, while also improving non-GAAP gross margins across both flash and HDD and generating profitable growth. We saw strong demand for our latest generation hard drives and flash products in the cloud end market as well as strong consumer demand for new 5G-based mobile phones incorporating our latest BiCS5 flash solutions. The strong demand for these products were partially offset by pressure in the commercial channel within the client end market and certain portions of the consumer end market, particularly retail. This was attributable to component issues impacting our customers' ability to ship products, greater component sourcing constraints within our own operations and uneven geographic demand due to COVID lockdowns.
Our continued focus on innovation and a more agile business unit structure enabled us to quickly adapt to these dynamics. When combined with an industry-leading portfolio and a strong go-to-market operation, I'm confident in Western Digital's ability to continue to generate improved operational performance for all of our stakeholders. Before I get into the business trends, I want to highlight a few changes we made to our end market breakdown, which, we believe, will help you understand why Western Digital is well positioned to capitalize on the opportunity presented by the increasing value and importance of data.
We now split our end markets into cloud, client and consumer. The cloud represents an incredibly large and growing end market for Western Digital, and we are uniquely positioned to address customer storage needs as the only provider of both hard drive and flash products. During the first quarter, cloud represented a record 44% of total revenue, led by record capacity enterprise hard drive revenue and nearly 30% sequential growth in enterprise SSD revenue.
We believe the accelerated digital transformation will continue to drive growth in this end market and continue to shift our business mix towards the cloud. As we ramp our new innovative products and continue leveraging the benefits of the organization structure we put into place last September, I am confident we will capture opportunities to achieve a more stable and profitable growth profile over the long term.
The client end market represented 37% of revenue in the first quarter. Here, we are providing a broad array of high-performance flash and hard drive solutions to our OEM and channel customers across PC, mobile, gaming, automotive, VR headsets, at-home entertainment devices and industrial spaces.
Lastly, the consumer end market accounted for 19% of revenue in the first quarter. The highlight of this end market is the strength of our SanDisk brand of retail products and the WD_BLACK brand of storage products for gaming enthusiasts, which is strong and growing. The brand recognition and infinity, combined with our unmatched reach with nearly 400,000 points of presence across the world is a great setup for Western Digital as we enter a seasonally stronger part of the year.
With that, I'll now provide a recap of our HDD and flash businesses as it relates to our first quarter results. In HDD, continued strong demand for our latest generation energy-assisted drives among our cloud and enterprise customers drove record revenue and exabyte shipments in our cloud end market. In addition, we experienced strong revenue growth in our smart video product line, and we're unable to meet demand.
During the quarter, we announced OptiNAND, a revolutionary technology that utilizes flash in the HDD control plane to further increase aerial density. With this leading architecture, we achieved 20-terabyte capacity using our field-proven 9-disk mechanical platform and ePMR technology. Next month will commence volume shipments of our 20-terabyte CMR hard drives based on OptiNAND technology. In flash, revenue grew in the quarter due to continued strong demand within the cloud and client end markets for our latest generation of our enterprise SSD products and the ramp of new 5G phones incorporating our latest BiCS5 node.
Within enterprise SSD, we experienced continued success in the cloud with another successful quarter of qualifications. We are now qualified at 3 cloud titans and have made excellent progress working our way through the qualification process in the enterprise and distribution channels. We expect these qualifications to start to drive accelerated revenue growth in 2022 as our customers begin to deploy these products into their networks.
The ramp of next-generation 5G phones incorporating our latest generation of BiCS5 products accelerated in the quarter, with revenue growing over 20% sequentially. We expect this migration to 5G, combined with a continued increase in the amount of storage per phone to drive another strong quarter of revenue growth in the fiscal second quarter. Gaming was strong in the quarter with a solid lineup of products for game consoles along with a growing brand recognition of WD_BLACK based products in the channel and retail.
Heading into the second fiscal quarter, we are well positioned to take advantage of seasonal strength and grow in a wide variety of gaming channels. As I noted earlier, the client PC OEMs' distribution channel and retail were impacted by our customers' ability to ship product, greater component sourcing constraints within our own operations and uneven geographic demand due to COVID lockdowns. Demand was solid, but these transitory issues impacted our ability to realize this demand in our results.
In total, bit growth accelerated to 30% year-over-year in the first quarter as we ramp BiCS5 to 17% of flash revenue. This quarter, we expect year-over-year bit growth to further accelerate to the mid-30s range with BiCS5 bit crossover to happen later in the quarter.
Our long-term goal is to grow bits in line with the market, taking advantage of our product and end market breadth to shift our bits to optimize profitability. As we look into calendar year 2022, we are optimistic as our customers continue to indicate strong end demand across cloud, client and consumer end markets. We have industry-leading technology, the right product portfolio and investments and the organizational agility to fundamentally drive improved profitability regardless of market condition.
We have a great position in 2 large and growing markets in flash and HDD, and we have proven our ability to drive innovation throughout our portfolio and deliver industry-leading products to a broad and loyal customer base. We believe that the migration to the cloud and demand for storage solutions throughout the client and consumer markets will drive a huge opportunity for Western Digital and our customers.
I'll now turn the call over to Bob to share details on our financial results."

As Dave mentioned, overall results for the fiscal first quarter were within the guidance ranges provided in August, marking the sixth quarter in a row that we've met or exceeded guidance.Total revenue for the",1030,"Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, overall results for the fiscal first quarter were within the guidance ranges provided in August, marking the sixth quarter in a row that we've met or exceeded guidance.
Total revenue for the quarter was $5.1 billion, up 3% sequentially and up 29% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.49. Please note that EPS included $56 million in total COVID-related costs, which was higher than we anticipated entering the quarter. I'll provide more details on these costs in a minute, but we are pleased to deliver such good results in the face of this unanticipated headwind and other supply chain issues.
From a disclosure perspective, in addition to the change in our end market breakdown that Dave discussed, this quarter, we moved to segment reporting for our flash and hard drive businesses. For more details, please refer to our earnings deck.
Looking at our end markets, cloud represented 44% of revenue at $2.2 billion, up 12% sequentially and up 72% from a year ago. This represented the second quarter in a row of record revenue. What is encouraging about this cloud revenue growth is the strength and breadth of our revenue streams across product areas. There was growth on a sequential basis in both the flash and hard drive business units as well as across every product category within the cloud, including capacity enterprise drives, enterprise SSDs, smart video and platforms. As the cloud continues to grow as a percentage of our revenue, we see an opportunity to reduce volatility in revenue and profitability. Over the last 3 quarters, we have successfully ramped our 18-terabyte energy-assisted drive to our highest volume mainstream product within the cloud end market.
Overall, cloud HDD exabyte shipments grew 9% sequentially and over 70% year-over-year and comprised over 80% of total HDD exabyte shipments. Client represented 37% of revenue at $1.9 billion, down 2% sequentially and up 6% year-over-year. A highlight within the client end market was growth within our flash business unit, specifically in mobile, gaming, automotive, IoT and industrial applications. Our strength here was more than offset by pressure in desktop and notebook hard drives due to supply disruptions at our customers and within our own operations.
Finally, consumer represented 19% of revenue at $973 million, down 6% sequentially, but up 10% year-over-year. Both our flash and hard drive business units declined on a sequential basis due to similar supply disruptions in addition to uneven geographic demand due to COVID lockdowns.
Turning now to revenue by segment. We reported flash revenue of $2.5 billion, up 3% sequentially and up 20% year-over-year. On a blended basis, flash ASPs were down 3% sequentially, primarily due to mix and pricing within our transactional markets. On a like-for-like basis, flash ASPs were flat. Flash bit shipments increased 8% sequentially and 30% year-over-year. Hard drive revenue was $2.6 billion, up 2% sequentially and up 39% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, total hard drive exabyte shipments increased 4%, while the average price per hard drive increased 5% to $102.
As we move to costs and expenses, please note that my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the first quarter was 33.9%, up 1 percentage point sequentially. As noted earlier, this included $56 million in COVID-related costs or a 1.1 percentage point impact. These were highest COVID-related costs in over a year.
Our broad routes to market and ability to proactively shift bits to the most attractive end markets enabled us to expand our flash gross margin by 1.5 percentage points sequentially to 37%. Our hard drive gross margin was 30.9%, up 60 basis points sequentially. This included COVID-related impact of $51 million or approximately 2 percentage points.
Operating expenses were $761 million, within our guidance range. Operating income was $952 million, representing a 15% increase from the prior quarter and tripling year-over-year, highlighting our profitable growth. With our improving profitability, our tax rate in the fiscal first quarter was 11%.
Earnings per share was $2.49, toward the top of our guidance range. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $521 million, and free cash flow was $224 million. Capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to our flash joint ventures on our cash flow statement, was a cash outflow of $297 million. We continue to expect gross CapEx for this fiscal year to be approximately $3 billion and cash CapEx to be around $2 billion.
In the fiscal first quarter, we paid off $213 million in debt, including a discretionary debt repayment of $150 million. Our gross debt outstanding was $8.6 billion at the end of the fiscal quarter. In addition, as a result of our strong financial results and free cash flow generation, last week, we repaid the remaining balance of our term Loan B in the amount of $943 million, bringing total gross debt outstanding to $7.7 billion.
Our adjusted EBITDA at the end of the first quarter, as defined in our credit agreement, was $4.2 billion, resulting in a gross leverage ratio of 2.0x, down from 2.7 a year ago and was the lowest in 3 years. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes $1 billion in depreciation add-back associated with the flash ventures. This is not reflected in our cash flow statement. Please refer to the earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details.
Moving on to our outlook. Our fiscal second quarter non-GAAP guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion and we expect flash revenue to increase sequentially and hard drive revenue to decline sequentially. We expect gross margin to be between 32% and 34%. We expect operating expenses to be between $760 million and $780 million. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $70 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 11% in the second quarter and for the fiscal year. We expect earnings per share to be between $1.95 and $2.25 in the second quarter, assuming approximately 316 million fully diluted shares outstanding.
I'll now turn the call back over to Dave."

And it was based on the mix we were anticipating. The mix came in essentially the way we had expected. And it was -- I don't want to get into every little detail of the mix. But one of the things we said at the beginning of the quarter was we expected more mobile volume in the September quarter, and that is what we saw. We actually think we'll see even more mobile as a percentage of the total in the December quarter. So mix is definitely a bit of a headwind for us. But really, ASPs are not going down that much. And we're really pleased with the cost reductions we've been able to achieve both in the quarter we just finished as well as what we're expecting to do this quarter."

There are supply chain challenges with some PC OEMs. We also mentioned that there seems to be a fair amount of inventory in China right now. So there's -- there definitely are some short-term challenges with respect to the hard drive business. But again, long term, the underlying growth is really good there."

So definitely been -- we're going to come off this year a little bit. But we're -- we see basically the baseline has been reset, pre-COVID by a significant amount. So we feel good about that. We're hearing that from our customers. We're talking to those customers now about 2022 plans and what they plan to do and how much supply they're going to need and share conversations with each of them and those conversations are going well.
The smartphone market, again, we continue to see this past quarter and the quarter in, we're seeing really good strength in that market. So I think this is -- there's a larger point here about the flash market is that the number of end markets is just more diverse now, especially with enterprise SSD growing and getting to be such a big market that there's a much better mix of demand that we play across in the market. And so we see strength in PC. We see strength in smartphones. We see strength in data center.
Like we said, the more transactional markets this past quarter is more nodal transitions going on. There was more bits available in those markets, and we definitely saw that. But again, we're heading into a seasonally strong quarter on retail. So as we go through the quarter, we'll get a very strong idea about how retail is going to play out as well as we go through the holiday season."

I think what I said earlier is we're actually expecting December to be a little more challenging than what we saw in September and the September quarter was not easy. And starting with our own teams, I think we did a really good job given what was going on with COVID in Southeast Asia. We did mention our COVID costs were up to $56 million this quarter. And we've done a really excellent job in terms of working with local governments to try and get as many employees vaccinated as possible and to really do the best we can to assure supply in terms of our own factories.
Now as we mentioned, like everyone else, we have challenges in terms of getting components as well, particularly, obviously, the controllers on both the hard drive and the flash side, and that has an impact on the business. I don't know quarter-to-quarter, which quarter is worse, but it's a challenge in both of them. And it's a challenge that's not going to go away soon in terms of the semiconductor availability. I mean we're getting some lead times of 50 weeks right now. So it's definitely a very real issue in terms of getting components in.
And then we've already talked a fair amount about the customer challenges. And I would say it feels to me and Dave can comment like there are more customers impacted by the supply chain in the December quarter than there were in the September quarter. It seems a little more broad-based."

I think when we talk to our sales teams and we talk to our customers, I mean it's -- I think just over the last month or so, the number of places where we're hearing, they are not able to meet their own true demand or they can't pull the demand from us if they're building their own infrastructure because the supply chain components has definitely broadened. And it's -- I think it started in some of the PC makers. I think that's where we heard the most about it, if you go back a couple of quarters. And now, like I said, we're hearing more about it in other segments, including the big data center providers. So it's definitely an impact of the business, and we just navigate through it.
I mean, I think when you talk to our customers and we talk to our own sales teams and we look at what everybody is telling us, the end demand continues to be very, very strong. And everybody is just trying to figure out how to meet that and how to get enough components and get the right components to build the right kit, whether it's for something they're going to sell or it's building their own infrastructure to build what they need. And as Bob said, we see that ourselves. And our ability to get components and our ability to make sure our factories continue to run. And I will say I'll be a little bit selfish here and complement our own teams. But the Delta variant in Asia was a very big impact. And this quarter was probably one of the most difficult since COVID started. There were points where we had thousands of employees in quarantine and still kept everything going. So when you see what's happening on the ground and what the impact has been, it's not hard to understand how all the discussions around supply chain impacts.
I think the good news is that we're working very, very hard, as Bob said, with governments to get vaccines distributed and get things back on track. And as we exit the quarter, and we sit here today, things were in a much, much better shape than they were a couple of months ago. So it makes us optimistic as we go through 2022 that this will get worked out and that will all be able to meet the true demand that's out there."

I think nearly 50% or more, 60% on what they were last quarter. We had been steady state for probably 3, 4 quarters in a row, and now we've bumped up significantly. So a lot of that is cost going into managing our own infrastructure and work that's going on with our own teams. Of course, a lot of it is logistics as well. That's always a big component of it. So those costs are going up.
Our own supply is mainly around controllers. I think it's fair to say. And as Bob said, we're planning a year out on lead times and working with our own suppliers on how we, number one, make sure we get everything we need to meet our demand, which has been challenging and then get it in a time frame that we need. But we're working through it. And like I said, I think that there's no doubt, if you go back a couple of quarters, we've been talking about this about how we were not able to meet all the demand that we saw out there. I think the thing that we see different walking into this quarter is there's -- we're seeing even a greater impact across all of our customer base, and it's spreading to places where we hadn't seen it before. And that's both raising the uncertainty and also just depressing the demand because customers can't get all the pieces they need, so they don't need everything from us.
So we're starting to see some hints in some markets, starting to clear up a little bit, super early days. But again, if you look at what's going on in the ground in Asia, things are getting better, at least from our perspective, our narrow perspective, although we have 40,000, 50,000 people there. Things are getting better on the ground and that gives us optimism that the situation will improve from here as we go through '22."

Another big step forward this quarter with OptiNAND.

And to the people that were managing the situation on the ground there, they did a tremendous job, they had an enormous amount of work just to keep everything running.
So I think that just leads to a very unique environment, Jim, that we're navigating through. Like I said, when we look at demand and we look at what our customers are telling us about demand in the market, we hear very good things. We -- they're very positive and very bullish. We just have -- you just have different customers in different states of their own ability to build what they need to build or want to build and that's constantly shifting. And when you add it all up in any particular quarter, you're going to get a result and that's what we got, and that's what we'll manage to. But we think that as the supply chain issues get worked out, the demand trends in the business are very, very strong, and we're on the right side of where the world is going from a technology point of view.
Now I thought it was significant this quarter to 44%, record percent of our quarter was in the cloud. And hopefully, you guys react positively to our simpler decomposition of our revenue across cloud, client and consumer, but we expect to see more growth in cloud, 72% year-over-year growth in that part of the business, and we continue to have the portfolio pivoting in that direction and expect it to be -- expect to participate in that growth as it goes forward."

If they can't do it this quarter, they'll get the components in the next quarter. So again, we see very good demand environment. And I think that as our customers are able to get all the components they need, they will continue to come back to us and adjust their demand to us. That's what we see. We have very close relationships with them. And so I don't expect that the demand from our customers' point of view is not like kind of a 1-quarter thing. It's like -- it's just -- it's a demand curve that goes on, and I don't see it as being perishable demand. I see it as everybody is trying to figure out how they can get as many components as they can to build complete kits for what they need to do. And as they do that, they come back to us and change their demand signal. And we've seen that.
Maybe a good example is on some of the PC manufacturers, where 1 quarter, they'll drop their demand significantly. In the next quarter, they'll come back and raise it significantly when they've got their own supply chain issues worked out. So as I said, we've seen this in other parts of the market, and we've dealt with it, and we know how to deal with it. Now we're just seeing it across -- the broader cross-section of our business.

And quite frankly, we participate in a market. It's -- and so it's more about the market price. I think the overwhelming issue with pricing is around innovation, and making sure we continue to drive innovation across our portfolio.
And as I look back on last quarter, the 2 things that -- 2 really big things that stand out to me from last quarter is, one, is just the execution of the team in a really, really difficult environment, especially the -- as I've talked a lot about the factories in Asia; and two is the innovation road map and the fact we're transitioning aggressively to BiCS5. We introduced OptiNAND. Those are the things. We introduced a 20-terabyte drive and are going to be shipping that in volume now here in the next month. That's with our energy assist technology 9-platter, 9 disk drive, 2.2 terabytes per platter. So that's the primary issue where it's going to drive an innovation-led discussion with our customers about pricing.
In the cost side of it, of course, as if they're going to be very long term, we're going to have those conversations. But I would say they're long and substantial relationships, and we manage through the quarter-to-quarter stuff with them really in both directions. But really, the focus is on that -- on driving innovation. If you drive innovation, you're going to get a better return for it. And quite frankly, I think we've seen that over the last 3 or 4 quarters as we brought energy assist in our 18-terabyte drive, the 30.9% gross margin this quarter in HDD is a multiyear high. So we feel very good about that."
