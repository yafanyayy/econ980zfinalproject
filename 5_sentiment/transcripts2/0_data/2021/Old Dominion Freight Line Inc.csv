With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions.

After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. Old Dominion had a strong fourth quarter that included an increase in revenue and improvement in our operating ratio to 76.3%, which was a new fourth quarter company record. This combination led to the 34.2% increase in our earnings per diluted share. 
For the year, we also produced a company record operating ratio of 77.4% as well as an 11.4% increase in earnings per diluted share. While I am really proud of these financial results, I am more proud of the OD family of employees who work through tough conditions in 2020 to generate this success. Despite the operating challenges created by the pandemic and rapid changes in volumes, our team established a new record for our cargo claims ratio at 0.1%, while on-time service continued at 99%. 
These factors contributed to us winning the Mastio Quality Award for the 11th straight year. Our team is committed to delivering superior service at a fair price regardless of the circumstances, which is why we have often stated that the investment in our OD family is the most important investment we can make. This includes many things such as strong pay and benefits packages as well as training programs and advancement opportunities. In addition to our nonexecutive employees, their contributions during the pandemic, we made special bonus payments in March and December 2020, together total approximately $20 million. 
These factors as well as a strong family culture have allowed us to consistently attract and retain talented employees to support our growth initiatives. This is important as we intend to add to our OD family in 2021 by hiring additional employees to further increase the capacity of our workforce. With the demand improvement environment improving, we also intend to add to the capacity of both our service network and our fleet in 2021. 
After opening 8 new facilities in 2020 and 1 more in January of this year, we are currently operating 245 service centers and have approximately 30% of excess capacity within the network to support additional growth. We plan to open 2 to 3 additional locations in the first quarter, with several more during the remainder of the year. We believe these additional service centers as well as the expansion of some existing facilities will increase the overall average capacity within our network to ensure that it is not a limiting factor to growth over the next few years. 
While we acknowledge that certain uncertainties with the domestic economy may continue, we believe that Old Dominion is uniquely positioned to win additional market share in 2021. We also believe we can drive our operating ratio even lower than the 77.4% record that we established in 2020. We have long maintained the key components for long-term improvement in our operating ratio are improvements in both density and yield, both of which generally require a favorable macro environment. 
Our current trends indicate that we can improve on both of these measures in 2021 by remaining fully committed to the core business strategies that put us in our strong competitive position. Disciplined execution of our long-term strategic plan over the course of many years has differentiated us from our competition while also creating long-term record of profitable growth. We are encouraged by our recent revenue trend and believe that we can take advantage of the momentum in our business to increase our earnings and shareholder value in 2021. 
Thanks for joining us this morning, and now Adam will discuss our fourth quarter financial results in greater detail."

Old Dominion's revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $1.1 billion, which was a 6.4% increase from the prior year. Our operating ratio improved 500 basis points to 76.3% and earnings per diluted share increased to $1",657,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $1.1 billion, which was a 6.4% increase from the prior year. Our operating ratio improved 500 basis points to 76.3% and earnings per diluted share increased to $1.61. These results include $9.6 million of expense related to the special bonus paid to non-executive employees in December. We were pleased to see the improvement in our revenue growth, which included increases in both volumes and yield. 
The increase in revenue included a 4.9% increase in LTL tonnage and a 1.1% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight. Excluding fuel surcharges, our LTL revenue per hundredweight increased by 4.2%. The  growth in this metric was slightly more consistent with our longer-term average than recent quarters as our business mix continued to normalize, while underlying pricing trends remained relatively consistent. 
On a sequential basis, revenue per day for the fourth quarter increased 4.7% as compared to the third quarter of 2020, while LTL shipments per day increased 1.7%. These are both above our normal sequential trends and reflect the continued recovery from the initial drop in revenue in April that was related to the pandemic. For January, our revenue per day increased 14.6% as compared to January of 2020. This reflects an 11.9% increase in LTL tons per day and a 2.2% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight. 
Our fourth quarter operating ratio improved to 76.3% and once again included improvements in both our direct operating cost and overhead cost as a percent of revenue. When compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, we generally improved the efficiency of our operations with increases in our laden load average and P&D shipments per hour. We did, however, lose a little productivity with our platform shipments per hour that was mainly due to the number of new employees hired in the fourth quarter. 
As our volume trends continue to improve, we intend to add drivers and platform employees during the first quarter. We also expect to continue to use purchase transportation to supplement our workforce until the capacity of our team can fully support our anticipated growth. We improved our overhead cost as a percent of revenue during the fourth quarter by successfully leveraging our revenue growth and maintaining our discipline with discretionary spending. We will continue to control discretionary spending in 2021, as we always do, but we anticipate that certain costs that were reduced in 2020, either directly or indirectly due to the pandemic, will eventually be restored. 
Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $246.6 million and $933 million for the fourth quarter and 2020, respectively, while capital expenditures were $58.6 million and $225.1 million for the same periods. Based on anticipated growth and the execution of our equipment replacement cycle, our capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $605 million in 2021. This total includes $275 million to expand the capacity of our service center network, although we would increase this amount further if we identify additional priorities that fit into our long-term strategic plan. 
We returned $74.8 million of capital to shareholders during the fourth quarter and $435.1 million for the year. For 2020, this total included $364.1 million of share repurchases and $71 million in cash dividends. We were pleased that our Board of Directors approved a 33.3% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.20 per share in the first quarter of 2021. Since we began this program in 2017 and after giving effect to the company's 3 for 2 stock split in March of 2020, we have increased our dividend in excess of 30% each year. 
Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 25.1% as compared to 24% in the fourth quarter of 2019. We currently expect our effective tax rate to be 26.0% for 2021. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time."

Once we took that initial drop, business has just been accelerating since, generally speaking. And I think it with customers reopening their businesses in different regions around the country getting healthier, and it just sort of accelerated from that point forward. And that acceleration continued through the fourth quarter for us and into January as well. 
I think there's a lot of macro trends that are favorable for our industry. And certainly, we're in an enviable position, I think, to take advantage of these changing trends. This is the type of environment, I think, when our model usually shines the brightest. We're in a great spot with respect to the capacity of our service center network. Our fleet is in good shape, and we've talked about the fact that we're going to continue to hire new employees, and we've continued to be successful in that endeavor In January as well. 
And we're also able to use a little purchase transportation to supplement as needed. But our customers are getting healthier. Business trends in general are improving. And and you're seeing the advantage of our business model, just coming through for us, and we're able to take advantage of all of those improving trends and show a little growth, which it's been a long time since we've been able to see growth like this. But certainly, when we start growing, we want to make sure it's profitable growth. And I think that we're in a good spot right now and look forward to seeing this continue to play out in 2021."

And certainly, in a short-term period, they're not always in balance, but that is something that we've seen over the long term. Right now and really, again, kind of going back to the middle part of last year when we made resource adjustments, we pretty much have been trying to play catch up, if you will, and our team has been working incredibly hard in operations to keep up and to continue to service and produce essentially record service metrics for us. 
So we've been really proud of that. But the team has been working incredibly hard. We have been using increased purchase transportation. If you noticed that increased 3.1% in the fourth quarter. And typically, for us, it's around 2.2% because we like to have 100% of our linehaul network in-sourced and using our people and our equipment. But we have had to supplement a little bit until we can really completely staff up to where we want to be. 
Typically, headcount in the first quarter is kind of flattish on average with the fourth quarter based on what we've been able to achieve thus far in January. I think that the maximum sequential change we've ever seen was in 1Q of '18, where we had about a 3% increase over 4Q. I think we can be in that range and probably even higher. But effectively, we've just got a to catch back up, so we can continue to serve our customers and be able to first reduce our reliance on purchase transportation and then just try to get ahead of the curve if you will, to face whatever volumes come our way for both 2021 as well as 2022."

When you think about tonnage in January being better than normal seasonality, again, it's early in the quarter. How are you thinking about the potential, given your headcount comments there to Todd's question, the ability to sort of leverage that tonnage with sequential OR relative to normal seasonal patterns, which I think is typically 100 to 150 basis point degradation from the fourth quarter to the first quarter? So if you think about that base number of 75 4, given those headcount comments and some of the other items down the P&L, how are you thinking about sequential change given what's happening on the tonnage front?"

The first quarter is typically 100 to 150 basis points of degradation from the fourth quarter. The special bonus that was in the fourth quarter, that's certainly something that I know you all will probably be adjusting. But that's not the only thing. That's one big thing that was called out. But you can see some other items like our insurance and claims, for example, that was a little bit lower than what the normal trend is. So we anticipate that, that will increase back of where we normally see it, which is around 1% to 1.2% of revenue. 
And like many other carriers, we're going to be facing some increased inflationary cost with our insurance premiums and so forth this year, just like we faced the last couple of years. So there's going to be some puts and takes to it. General supplies and expenses is another one that I think will be stepping up. We referenced in our prepared remarks that, certainly, there's going to be some costs that will be restored this year. And some of those will be some of our marketing and advertising programs. We're not at the point to where our sales team can get out and and travel around, do some things. 
So we still anticipate for the foreseeable future with some savings related to travel and customer entertainment, but certainly intend to restore some of those expenditures. So while they may not go back to where that cost had been between 3%, 3.5%, certainly anticipate them being higher than where we were in the fourth quarter. So there's going to be some puts and takes. And we don't give guidance on the operating ratio, but we always use that normal sequential trend as a benchmark to measure ourselves against. 
And I think on the salary, wages and benefits line, when we talked about on the last quarter call going from third quarter to fourth quarter, we want to try to keep the change in those costs, and we felt like we could keep them in line with what our long-term trends are based on productivity and the fact that we felt like revenue was improving. Well, having nice revenue growth on a sequential basis certainly gives you a lot of cover on some of those other more fixed-type expense elements. And I think we saw that leverage on us being able to take advantage of that strong revenue performance in the fourth quarter to do just that. 
We created leverage from it. We kept the change in salaries, wages and benefits in line there. And so I think, certainly, that will give us leverage when we go from 4Q into 1Q as well to be able to keep those -- the salary costs, if you will, in line, even though we will be bringing on and adding new people. So there'll be puts and takes in different line items, but that sort of 100 basis point mark, I think, will be a good benchmark, and we'll just see how we perform from there."

The fact that all the Amazons of the world and many others have opened so many e-distribution facilities all across the country and have actually gotten closer to customers. So you hope that some of the suppliers then are shipping to all these different type facilities and that lends itself to LTL versus truckload when you're talking about smaller quantities getting in customers' hands quicker. 
So I think that's a positive trend from an e-commerce standpoint, certainly. I think that just the broader macro economy will be the tail How does it do? I don't think we've really had a huge boom and certainly not in the last couple of years, maybe back to '18, but not the last 2. So I think the macro certainly will drive our market as well as truckload and some of the small packages.

That's a lot of feedback that we are getting from customers right now, and that's just across the transportation space. 
And then I think that some of the other LTL carriers that utilize some truckload carriers for their linehaul services certainly are facing maybe more cost inflation than we are. And typically, in that type of environment, rates are rising faster as well to offset that cost inflation for those other carriers' businesses. So I think there's a lot of factors that would point to industry pricing being very favorable for this year and certainly should be supportive of our pricing initiatives."

But it's certainly something that we're expecting the cost to be higher, if you will, than maybe what we've just seen in the past couple of quarters. 
That's really since we started making some changes in trying to address all of our costs initially in the second quarter of 2020. A lot of those items that were directly or indirectly affected by the pandemic, some temporary and some may be permanent, we're in that general supplies and expenses line. And generally speaking, in the second quarter, third quarter, those costs are more between 2.5% to 3%. I would expect it to kind of go back up where, in the past, they've been 3% to 3.5%. Somewhere not maybe to the full extent of that 3.5% because we'll be continuing to see some of those savings, like I mentioned earlier, related to travel and so forth, but certainly kind of coming back maybe more to that range, but hopefully at the low end of it."

Not looking for a specific number this time around, but when you think about '21 relative to '18, at least from a cost perspective, is there anything that we should be thinking about? Is labor tighter? Or is it cost generally a little bit more inflationary now and maybe the timing of sort of volume growth versus resource additions potentially more challenging?

And while certain top-line comps might be easier, if you will, we were pretty proud to produce a lot of growth and profits in 2020 despite the fact that our revenues were down. At the end of the day, we generated almost $90 million of the increase in operating income, despite our revenues being down about $95 million. So certainly, in some respects, we'll have some tough comps. But I think that just sort of pulling back and looking at our cost inflation anticipate that we'll probably see cost per shipment inflation around 4% this year. 
And yes, it's a little bit higher than our longer term average, but I think we've got some factors that will be coming back to us. I mentioned some of the general supplies and expense type inflation we might see would anticipate a little bit higher health care inflation this year. So we're going to see some inflationary pressures in some of the other categories. We always have kind of a 3% to 3.5% inflationary cost in our salaries, wages and benefits as we continue to improve that program for our employees. 
And so all those factors will kind of go into that metric, and that will be our target. And then that kind of becomes the target for which our long-term philosophy trying to get 75 to 100 basis points of rate increase above the cost inflation. And then we just sort of work through from there. But I think that we've talked about the key ingredients for long-term operating ratio improvement or the improvement in density and yield. 
And I think, certainly, the macro setup would lead you to believe that we should be able to produce nice improvements in both. And we've gone through 2 years of being flat. And each year, I thought that we would have had some growth and I certainly didn't expect the industrial slowdown in '19. And I don't know that could predict what we saw last year, but but we worked our way through it. And I think we're in a good spot as we enter the year, and we're just going to continue to work a plan to try to drive the operating ratio lower. 
We've talked about kind of having a goal per se not necessarily incremental margins because the reality is we're managing the business to put as much profit to the bottom line as we can in last year the success that we saw sort of proves that out. But we certainly should be in a position to create some strong incrementals this year, and we'll keep working towards the long-term goal that we've talked about of driving the operating ratio to 75%. So we'll just keep making progress there month-by-month and quarter-by-quarter as we work through '21."

And I think that continuing our CapEx programs through '19 and '20 continuing to build out the service center network certainly is going to pay dividends for us this year with the increase in volumes that we're seeing now and would expect and probably for '22 as well. 
So we maintained our CapEx spending on real estate. And really, last year was more just cutting back on the equipment, and that was a plan we had in effect when we started the year and before seeing the pandemic effect on our business. But we were fortunate that, that was part of the plan and certainly helped, and we didn't see the type of inflation and depreciation cost that we normally would see. And that was a big benefit there. 
But I think we're in a good spot. We're going to continue to look for opportunities. We've got a good plan on the real estate side, the $275 million is a good starting point. But we maintain our long-term plan and trying to look multiple years out and still sort of have a target list of 30 to 40 properties.

Then on the weight per shipment, it was 1,625 pounds in January, which was a 4.6% increase there. So continuing to see strong weight per shipments. Our business is still leaning a little heavier, if you will, on our larger national accounts that have a higher weight per shipment on average.

And our percentages stayed pretty consistent in '20 with '19. We're still 55% to 60% of our revenues industrial related and close to 30% -- 25% to 30%  [Technical Difficulty] related. And over the balance of the year, they came in about the same that they were the year prior. And fourth quarter revenue performance was pretty consistent with our industrial customers and retail-related customers as well. They were both in about the same range. 
So we'd look to certainly see the improvement in the industrial economy, though, create freight opportunities for us. And then, as Greg mentioned earlier, I think that there's going to be ongoing opportunity on the retail side and kind of leading up to 2020. We've probably seen a little bit more growth in that retail area than on the industrial side. And I don't expect that we'd see a little bit stronger performance there. But I think with respect to margins, we talked a lot about this throughout 2020 in our calls that our operating philosophy is we want each customer to stand on its own. We measure the profitability of each customer, and we look at each customer's operating ratio. And whether it's a large national account or a smaller account or retail or industrial, they all should contribute in their own ways, and that's how we try to manage the business and then look at each individual customer and try to drive continuous improvement with their operating ratio by keeping the business intact and just continuing to make improvements year in and year out with them. 
So the balance and the mix shift from one category to the next in that industrial versus retail categories or the national shipper versus the smaller one, I think we kind of proved out last year with our operating performance that we're true to our word in that regard and that each do kind of operate close to one another. So either way, we get the growth going into '21 certainly would expect that it can continue to drive and help us drive improvement in the operating ratio."

I wish it was a little bit faster. We could respond a little bit quicker, but it is what it is, but I think we're getting there. Sometimes your growth numbers changes your challenges, if you know what I mean. It's one thing if it's some moderate-type growth. If the growth really starts to accelerate, then the challenge becomes a little bit greater. So I think in a controlled-type growth environment, we're in great perfect shape.

The growth rate was pretty consistent with the fourth quarter. So just over 4% if you will. And we'll continue to see until about April, really, I think that, that delta and some pressure on the fuel surcharge revenue and showing on those metrics. I think that fuel was pretty consistently higher until about April of last year and then fuel trends hold current. That will start becoming a little bit of a tailwind finally for us on a top line basis. 
But I think that certainly, when you look through last year and kind of how that yield number, excluding fuel, is up 4.2% in the fourth quarter, there's not a perfect analysis, if you will, that there's not a linear way, purely linear way to evaluate the change in weight per shipment and length of haul, but we had more pressure from the increase in weight per shipment in the middle part of the year in the second and third quarters. 
So certainly, that 2.5% increase on weight per shipment has got a negative effect, but then you got a 1.3% increase in the length of haul. So I mean, there's somewhat offsetting. And I think that just underlying performance, we'd review the -- our growth in renewals and so forth, consistent with our long-term average. We've been around whether you look over the past 10, 15 years, we've been able to average about 4.5% increase in our revenue per shipment. 
And I think that we're pretty much in that category, somewhere around that ballpark for last year. And certainly, like I mentioned earlier, the strategy is always to try to target 75 to 100 basis points above our cost. And I think that, that's been a good, consistent approach. We're not trying to necessarily always follow the market with more of a rollercoaster-type approach. We like it to be consistent. Customers generally appreciate that, and it's easier conversation to have when you're just talking about pure cost or customers' operating ratio to talk about the need for an increase. 
But we'll continue to sort of target that type of range and certainly expect next year to be supportive of our ability to do so."

But the excess capital that we've been generating in the business, we've been increasingly returning to our shareholders. And we stepped up the pace of our buybacks last year and spent a little over $360 million on the buyback program in '20. 
So that was a nice step up. And we'll just continue to look at stepping those dollars up, most likely because it's certainly not something that we want to continue to have a significant balance of cash hanging around on the balance sheet. But we also want to be mindful of the fact that there may continue to be some opportunities out there from a real estate standpoint. And some of those in areas like on the West Coast and in the Northeast got some really expensive price tags. So we'll continue to look for some opportunities there and would rather spend our dollars on something that's more strategic like a long-term investment in the service center.

But I think that given the strength of the performance that we had in both November and December is why that January number is a little bit lower than the 10-year average, given the outperformance of those 2 months prior. 
So it's been really strong performance, like we've said, really just throughout the year. We took a little bit of a breather in October, if you will. And as we were continuing to play catch up, and we're starting to get a lot of heavy shipments into the mix. And -- but that was just really very temporary.

So it looks like December was double better than seasonality or half of the seasonal decline may explain a little bit of the January lag relative to seasonality.

And what I want to just be clear on is that you guys are clearly gaining market share. You're clearly in the best position to drive spillover from truckload. 
I just -- what I'm trying not to -- I'm trying to understand like the January strength on a year-over-year basis, is that more indicative of OD specific factors? Or is a read-through to the overall industrial economy because U.S. industrial production is still negative on a year-over-year basis? Everybody expects it to inflect as we move through this year, and we're right up there as well is expecting that, but I'm just trying to understand like decipher between those 3 attributions in terms of the strong strength in volumes."

But we're starting to see this capacity advantage play out for us as well, and we're getting feedback from customers that support that. And then you've got other factors. 
The industrial economy is improving. There was a lot of uncertainty, and there always is an election year. And now that's behind everyone. So you kind of have a better feel for what the regulatory environment and so forth is going to be. And  so hopefully, that's going to continue to support an improving economy as well as just the country sort of reopening throughout. And so all those factors, the demand improvement, inventories being low and the need for restocking, it's all just a matter of those are all favorable trends, but I think that we're uniquely positioned to take advantage of that with market share wins for customers that we strengthen relationships throughout last year as we work with them, and we're flexible. 
And I think that we've got improvements there that should pay dividends for the long run. And those customers are going to increasingly give us business, we think. And some that has historically had been more price-sensitive now have seen. Our ability to respond with them and give them capacity in a challenged time and to give them service and maybe it's proved to many customers that you may pay a little bit more upfront, but the total cost of transportation service when selecting Old Dominion can save a company money in the long run. So there's multiple factors. 
But at the end of the day, it goes back to the fact that we have a service advantage and a capacity advantage, and those 2 factors are unique and have been the basis for why we've been able to grow market share more than anyone else in our industry over the past 10 years."

With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO.

With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions.
Old Dominion had a strong fourth quarter that included an increase in revenue and improvement in our operating ratio to 76.3%, which was a new fourth quarter company record. This combination led to the 34.2% increase in our earnings per diluted share.
For the year, we also produced a company record operating ratio of 77.4% as well as an 11.4% increase in earnings per diluted share. While I am really proud of these financial results, I am more proud of the OD family of employees who worked through tough conditions in 2020 to generate this success. Despite the operating challenges created by the pandemic and rapid changes in volumes, our team established a new record for our cargo claims ratio at 0.1%, while on-time service continued at 99%.
These factors contributed to us winning the MASTIO Quality Award for the 11th straight year. Our team is committed to delivering superior service at a fair price regardless of the circumstances, which is why we have often stated that the investment in our OD family is the most important investment we can make. This includes many things such as strong pay and benefits packages as well as training programs and advancement opportunities. In addition to our nonexecutive employees, their contributions during the pandemic, we made special bonus payments in March and December 2020. That together totaled approximately $20 million.
These factors as well as a strong family culture have allowed us to consistently attract and retain talented employees to support our growth initiatives. This is important as we intend to add to our OD family in 2021 by hiring additional employees to further increase the capacity of our workforce. With the demand improvement environment improving, we also intend to add to the capacity of both our service center network and our fleet in 2021.
After opening 8 new facilities in 2020 and one more in January of this year, we are currently operating 245 service centers and have approximately 30% of excess capacity within the network to support additional growth. We plan to open 2 to 3 additional locations in the first quarter, with several more during the remainder of the year. We believe these additional service centers as well as the expansion of some existing facilities will increase the overall average capacity within our network to ensure that it is not a limiting factor to growth over the next few years.
While we acknowledge that certain uncertainties with the domestic economy may continue, we believe that Old Dominion is uniquely positioned to win additional market share in 2021. We also believe we can drive our operating ratio even lower than the 77.4% record that we established in 2020. We have long maintained that the key components for long-term improvement in our operating ratio are improvements in both density and yield, both of which generally require a favorable macro environment.
Our current trends indicate that we can improve on both of these measures in 2021 by remaining fully committed to the core business strategies that put us in our strong competitive position. Disciplined execution of our long-term strategic plan over the course of many years has differentiated us from our competition while also creating long-term record of profitable growth. We are encouraged by our recent revenue trend and believe that we can take advantage of the momentum in our business to increase our earnings and shareholder value in 2021.
Thanks for joining us this morning, and now Adam will discuss our fourth quarter financial results in greater detail."

Old Dominion's revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $1.1 billion, which was a 6.4% increase from the prior year. Our operating ratio improved 500 basis points to 76.3% and earnings per diluted share increased to $1",657,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $1.1 billion, which was a 6.4% increase from the prior year. Our operating ratio improved 500 basis points to 76.3% and earnings per diluted share increased to $1.61. These results include $9.6 million of expense related to the special bonus paid to non-executive employees in December. We were pleased to see the improvement in our revenue growth, which included increases in both volumes and yield.
The increase in revenue included a 4.9% increase in LTL tonnage and a 1.1% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight. Excluding fuel surcharges, our LTL revenue per hundredweight increased by 4.2%. The growth in this metric was slightly more consistent with our longer-term average than recent quarters as our business mix continued to normalize, while underlying pricing trends have remained relatively consistent.
On a sequential basis, revenue per day for the fourth quarter increased 4.7% as compared to the third quarter of 2020, while LTL shipments per day increased 1.7%. These are both above our normal sequential trends and reflect the continued recovery from the initial drop in revenue in April that was related to the pandemic. For January, our revenue per day increased 14.6% as compared to January of 2020. This reflects an 11.9% increase in LTL tons per day and a 2.2% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight.
Our fourth quarter operating ratio improved to 76.3%, and once again, included improvements in both our direct operating cost and overhead cost as a percent of revenue. When compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, we generally improved the efficiency of our operations with increases in our laden-load average and P&D shipments per hour. We did, however, lose a little productivity with our platform shipments per hour, that was mainly due to the number of new employees hired in the fourth quarter.
As our volume trends continue to improve, we intend to add drivers and platform employees during the fourth -- first quarter. We also expect to continue to use purchase transportation to supplement our workforce until the capacity of our team can fully support our anticipated growth.
We improved our overhead cost as a percent of revenue during the fourth quarter by successfully leveraging our revenue growth and maintaining our discipline with discretionary spending. We will continue to control discretionary spending in 2021 as we always do, but we anticipate that certain costs that were reduced in 2020, either directly or indirectly due to the pandemic, will eventually be restored.
Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $246.6 million and $933 million for the fourth quarter and 2020, respectively, while capital expenditures were $58.6 million and $225.1 million for the same periods. Based on anticipated growth and the execution of our equipment replacement cycle, our capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $605 million in 2021. This total includes $275 million to expand the capacity of our service center network, although we would increase this amount further if we identify additional properties that fit into our long-term strategic plan.
We returned $74.8 million of capital to shareholders during the fourth quarter and $435.1 million for the year. For 2020, this total included $364.1 million of share repurchases and $71 million in cash dividends. We were pleased that our Board of Directors approved a 33.3% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.20 per share in the first quarter of 2021. Since we began this program in 2017 and after given effect to the company's 3-for-2 stock split in March of 2020, we have increased our dividend in excess of 30% each year.
Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 25.1% as compared to 24% in the fourth quarter of 2019. We currently expect our effective tax rate to be 26.0% for 2021.
This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time."

Once we took that initial drop, business has just been accelerating since, generally speaking. And I think it began with customers reopening their businesses in different regions around the country getting healthier, and it just sort of accelerated from that point forward. And that acceleration continued through the fourth quarter for us and into January as well.
I think there's a lot of macro trends that are favorable for our industry. And certainly, we're in an enviable position, I think, to take advantage of these changing trends. This is the type of environment, I think, when our model usually shines the brightest. We're in a great spot with respect to the capacity of our service center network. Our fleet is in good shape, and we've talked about the fact that we're going to continue to hire new employees, and we've continued to be successful in that endeavor in January as well.
And we're also able to use a little purchase transportation to supplement as needed. But our customers are getting healthier. Business trends in general are improving. And you're seeing the advantage of our business model just coming through for us, and we're able to take advantage of all of those improving trends and show a little growth, which it's been a long time since we've been able to see growth like this. But certainly, when we start growing, we want to make sure it's profitable growth. And I think that we're in a good spot right now and look forward to seeing this continue to play out in 2021."

And certainly, in a short-term period, they're not always in balance, but that is something that we've seen over the long term.
Right now and really, again, kind of going back to the middle part of last year when we made resource adjustments, we pretty much have been trying to play catch-up, if you will, and our team has been working incredibly hard in operations to keep up and to continue to service and produce essentially record service metrics for us.
So we've been really proud of that. But the team has been working incredibly hard. We have been using increased purchase transportation. If you noticed, that increased 3.1% in the fourth quarter. And it typically, for us, is around 2.2% because we like to have 100% of our line-haul network in-sourced and using our people and our equipment. But we had -- have had to supplement a little bit until we can really completely staff up to where we want to be.
Typically, headcount in the first quarter is kind of flattish on average with the fourth quarter based on what we've been able to achieve, thus far, in January. I think that the maximum sequential change we've ever seen was in 1Q of '18, where we had about a 3% increase over 4Q. I think we can be in that range, and probably, even higher. But effectively, we've just got to catch back up, so we can continue to serve our customers and be able to first reduce our reliance on purchase transportation and then just try to get ahead of the curve, if you will, to face whatever volumes come our way for both 2021 as well as 2022."

When you think about tonnage in January being better than normal seasonality, again, it's early in the quarter. How are you thinking about the potential, given your headcount comments there to Todd's question, the ability to sort of leverage that tonnage with sequential OR relative to normal seasonal patterns, which I think is typically 100 to 150 basis-point degradation from the fourth quarter to the first quarter?
So if you think about that base number of 75.4%, given those headcount comments and some of the other items down the P&L, how are you thinking about sequential change given what's happening on the tonnage front?"

The first quarter is typically 100 to 150 basis points of degradation from the fourth quarter. The special bonus that was in the fourth quarter, that's certainly something that I know you all will probably be adjusting. But that's not the only thing. That's one big thing that was called out. But you can see some other items like our insurance and claims, for example, that was a little bit lower than what the normal trend is. So we anticipate that, that will increase back to where we normally see it, which is around 1% to 1.2% of revenue.
And like many other carriers, we're going to be facing some increased inflationary cost in that -- with our insurance premiums and so forth this year, just like we faced the last couple of years. So yes, there's going to be some sort of puts and takes to it. General supplies and expenses is another one that I think will be stepping up. We referenced in our prepared remarks that, certainly, there's going to be some costs that will be restored this year. And some of those will be some of our marketing and advertising programs. We're not at the point where our sales team can get out and travel around and do some things. So we still anticipate for the foreseeable future with some savings related to travel and customer entertainment, but certainly, intend to restore some of those expenditures. 
So while they may not go back to where that cost had been between 3%, 3.5%, certainly anticipate them being higher than where we were in the fourth quarter. So there's going to be some puts and takes. And we don't give guidance on the operating ratio, but we always use that normal sequential trend as a benchmark to measure ourselves against.
And I think on the salary, wages and benefits line, when we talked about on the last quarter call going from third quarter to fourth quarter, we wanted to try to keep the change in those costs, and we felt like we could keep them in line with what our long-term trends are based on productivity and the fact that we felt like revenue was improving. Well, having nice revenue growth on a sequential basis certainly gives you a lot of cover on some of those other more fixed-type expense elements. And I think we saw that leverage and us being able to take advantage of that strong revenue performance in the fourth quarter to do just that.
We created leverage from it. We kept the change in salaries, wages and benefits in line there. And so I think, certainly, that will give us leverage when we go from 4Q into 1Q as well to be able to keep those -- the salary costs, if you will, in line, even though we will be bringing on and adding new people. So there'll be puts and takes in different line items, but that sort of 100 basis point mark, I think, will be a good benchmark, and we'll just see how we'll perform from there."

I think some of the e-commerce trends and whatnot that we've seen are somewhat positive for LTL. The fact that all the Amazons of the world and many others have opened so many distribution facilities all across the country and have actually gotten closer to customers. So you hope that some of the suppliers then are shipping to all of these different type facilities and that lends itself to LTL versus truckload when you're talking about smaller quantities getting in customers' hands quicker. So I think that's a positive trend from an e-commerce standpoint, certainly.
I think that just the broader macro economy will be the telltale. How does it do? I don't think we've really had a huge boom, and certainly, not in the last couple of years, maybe back to '18, but not in the last 2. So I think the macro, certainly, will drive our market as well as truckload and some of the small packages.

Certainly, that's been supportive of our own pricing initiatives, which we maybe have philosophies that are slightly different from the industry generally. But certainly, we would expect a very favorable pricing environment in 2021. There's a lot of factors that would go into that. Certainly, demand is incredibly strong. Capacity is generally limited. That's a lot of feedback that we are getting from customers right now, and that's just across the transportation space.
And then I think that some of the other LTL carriers that utilize some truckload carriers for their line-haul services certainly are facing maybe more cost inflation than we are. And typically, in that type of environment, rates are rising faster as well to offset that cost inflation for those other carriers' businesses. So I think there's a lot of factors that would point to industry pricing being very favorable for this year, and certainly, should be supportive of our pricing initiatives."

But it's certainly something that we're expecting the costs to be higher, if you will, than maybe what we've just seen in the past couple of quarters.
That's really since we started making some changes in trying to address all of our costs initially in the second quarter of 2020. A lot of those items that were directly or indirectly affected by the pandemic, some temporary and some may be permanent, we're in that general supplies and expenses line. And generally speaking, in the second quarter, third quarter, those costs are more between 2.5% to 3%. We'd expect it to kind of go back up where, in the past, they've been 3% to 3.5%.

And while certain top line comps might be easier, if you will, I mean, we were pretty proud to produce a lot of growth and profits in 2020 despite the fact that our revenues were down. At the end of the day, we generated almost $90 million of the increase in operating income, despite our revenues being down about $95 million. So certainly, in some respects, we'll have some tough comps. But I think that this sort of pulling back and looking at our cost inflation anticipate that we'll probably see cost per shipment inflation around 4% this year.
And yes, it's a little bit higher than our longer-term average, but I think we've got some factors that will be coming back to us. I mentioned some of the general supplies and expense-type inflation we might see. We'd anticipate a little bit higher health care inflation this year. So we're going to see some inflationary pressures in some of the other categories. We always have kind of a 3% to 3.5% inflationary cost in our salaries, wages and benefits as we continue to improve that program for our employees.
And so all those factors will kind of go into that metric, and that will be our target. And then that kind of becomes the target for which our long-term philosophy of trying to get 75 to 100 basis points of rate increase above the cost inflation, and then we just sort of work through from there.
But I think that we've talked about the key ingredients for long-term operating ratio improvement or the improvement in density and yield. And I think, certainly, the macro setup would lead you to believe that we should be able to produce nice improvements in both. And we've gone through 2 years of being flat. And each year, I thought that we would have had some growth, and I, certainly, didn't expect the industrial slowdown in '19. And I don't know that Nostradamus could predict what we saw last year, but we worked our way through it. And I think we're in a good spot as we enter the year, and we're just going to continue to work a plan to try to drive the operating ratio lower.
We've talked about kind of having a goal per se not necessarily incremental margins because the reality is we're managing the business to put as much profit to the bottom line as we can. And last year, the success that we saw sort of proves that out. But we certainly should be in a position to create some strong incrementals this year, and we'll keep working towards the long-term goal that we've talked about of driving the operating ratio to 75%. So we'll just keep making progress there month-by-month and quarter-by-quarter as we work through '21."

And I think that continuing our CapEx programs through '19 and '20, continuing to build out the service center network certainly is going to pay dividends for us this year with the increase in volumes that we're seeing now and would expect, and probably, for '22 as well.
So we maintained our CapEx spending on real estate. And really, last year was more just cutting back on the equipment, and that was a plan we had in effect when we started the year and before seeing the pandemic effect on our business. But we were fortunate that, that was part of the plan, and certainly, helped. And we didn't see the type of inflation and depreciation cost that we normally would see. And that was a big benefit there.
But I think we're in a good spot. We're going to continue to look for opportunities. We've got a good plan on the real estate side, the $275 million is a good starting point. But we maintain our long-term plan and trying to look multiple years out and still sort of have a target list of 30 to 40 properties.

So I don't know if you have a thought on whether they have good quality freight or not.

So what does that mean from the UPS or TransForce acquisition? Who knows. We'll just have to wait and see.

And over the balance of the year, they came in about the same that they were the year prior. And fourth quarter revenue performance was pretty consistent with our industrial customers and retail-related customers as well. They were both in about the same range.
So we'd look to certainly see the improvement in the industrial economy, though, to create freight opportunities for us. And then, as Greg mentioned earlier, I think that there's going to be ongoing opportunity on the retail side, and kind of leading up to 2020, we've probably seen a little bit more growth in that retail area than on the industrial side. And I would expect that we'd see a little bit stronger performance there.
But I think with respect to margins, we talked a lot about this throughout 2020 in our calls that our operating philosophy is we want each customer to stand on its own. We measure the profitability of each customer, and we look at each customer's operating ratio. And whether it's a large national account or a smaller account or retail or industrial, they all should contribute in their own ways, and that's how we try to manage the business and then look at each individual customer and try to drive continuous improvement with their operating ratio by keeping the business intact and just continuing to make improvements year in and year out with them.
So the balance in the mix shift from one category to the next in that industrial versus retail categories or the national shipper versus the smaller one, I think we kind of proved out last year with our operating performance that we're true to our word in that regard and that each do kind of operate close to one another.
So either way, we get the growth going into '21. Certainly, we'd expect that it can continue to drive and help us drive improvement in the operating ratio."

The growth rate was pretty consistent with the fourth quarter. So just over 4%, if you will. And we'll continue to see until about April, really, I think that, that delta and some pressure on the fuel surcharge revenue and showing up on those metrics. I think that fuel was pretty consistently higher until about April of last year and then fuel trends hold current. That will start becoming a little bit of a tailwind finally for us on a top line basis.
But I think that certainly, when you look through last year and kind of how that yield number, excluding fuel, is up 4.2% in the fourth quarter, there's not a perfect analysis, if you will, that there's not a linear way, purely linear way to evaluate the change in weight per shipment and length of haul, but we had more pressure from the increase in weight per shipment in the middle part of the year, in the second and the third quarters.
So certainly, that 2.5% increase on weight per shipment has got a negative effect, but then you got a 1.3% increase in the length of haul. So I mean, there's somewhat offsetting. And I think that just underlying performance, we'd review the -- our growth in renewals and so forth, consistent with our long-term average. We've been around whether you look over the past 10, 15 years, we've been able to average about a 4.5% increase in our revenue per shipment. And I think that we're pretty much in that category, somewhere around that ballpark for last year.
And certainly, like I mentioned earlier, the strategy is always to try to target 75 to 100 basis points above our cost. And I think that, that's been a good, consistent approach. We're not trying to necessarily always follow the market with more of a rollercoaster-type approach. We like it to be consistent. Customers generally appreciate that, and it's easier conversation to have when you're just talking about pure cost or customers' operating ratio to talk about the need for an increase.
But we'll continue to sort of target that type of range, and certainly, expect next year to be supportive of our ability to do so."

But the excess capital that we've been generating in the business, we've been increasingly returning to our shareholders. And we stepped up the pace of our buybacks last year and spent a little over $360 million on the buyback program in '20. So that was a nice step-up.
And we'll just continue to look at stepping those dollars up, most likely because it's certainly not something that we want to continue to have a significant balance of cash hanging around on the balance sheet. But we also want to be mindful of the fact that there may continue to be some opportunities out there from a real estate standpoint. And some of those -- in areas like on the West Coast and in the Northeast have got some really expensive price tags.

But I think that given the strength of the performance that we had in both November and December is why that January number is a little bit lower than the 10-year average, given the outperformance of those 2 months prior.
So it's been really a strong performance, like we've said, really just throughout the year. We took a little bit of a breather in October, if you will, and as we were continuing to play catch-up, and we're starting to get a lot of heavy shipments into the mix.

And what I want to just be clear on is that you guys are clearly gaining market share. You're clearly in the best position to drive spillover from truckload.
I just -- what I'm trying not to -- I'm trying to understand like the January strength on a year-over-year basis, is that more indicative of OD-specific factors? Or is it a read-through to the overall industrial economy because U.S. industrial production is still negative on a year-over-year basis.

And so all those factors, the demand improvement, inventories being low and the need for restocking, it's all just a matter of -- those are all favorable trends, but I think that we're uniquely positioned to take advantage of that with market share wins for customers that we strengthened relationships throughout last year as we worked with them, and we're flexible.
And I think that we've got improvements there that should pay dividends for the long run. And those customers are going to increasingly give us business, we think, and some of them that historically had been more price-sensitive, now have seen our ability to respond with them and give them capacity in a challenged time and to give them service and maybe it's proved to many customers that you may pay a little bit more upfront, but the total cost of transportation service when selecting Old Dominion can save a company money in the long run.

So I think it can stay in this 1,600 or maybe 1,650 kind of range as we progress through the year, and certainly, we'd see some ups and downs.
But I think that -- like I mentioned, we're continuing to see good performance with our smaller customers, and they're naturally going to have a little bit lower weight per shipment. So that will bring it down, but just the overall demand environment, I think, is keeping all shipments a little bit stronger from a weight perspective.
I don't think we're really getting flooded, if you will, with spillover-type freight. When I look through it, the business we have with third-party logistics companies, a lot of time when they're capacity constraint in the market, they're able to go out and find and help their customers, who are also our customers, find capacity. And certainly, we've seen a little bit higher weight per shipment growth with business that's controlled by the 3PLs than the rest of our book of business, if you will.
So I would expect it to stay in that sort of elevated range, just given all the favorable economic backdrop numbers and then just the fact that we still believe capacity is generally constrained in the industry."

And welcome to our first quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. We are pleased to report a great start to 2021 for Old Dominion. Our",619,"Good morning. And welcome to our first quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. We are pleased to report a great start to 2021 for Old Dominion. Our financial results were highlighted by new first quarter records for revenue, operating ratio and earnings per diluted share. 
The operating momentum that began in the second half of 2020 continued through the quarter, and we also benefited from an improving domestic economy. Our revenue increased to $1.1 billion as a result, which is the highest level of quarterly revenue we have ever achieved. 
The 14.1% revenue growth rate was also our highest since the fourth quarter of 2018 after essentially going through 2 flattish years in '19 and '20, while our revenue was relatively flat over the past 2 years, and that was an unusually long period for us to go without growth. 
We maintained our commitment to our long-term strategic plan and invested during those times for our future. Our first quarter financial results validate the benefits of this long-term strategy. While our strategic plan has worked throughout many economic cycles, we generally see our largest increases in market share when the domestic economy is strong and industry capacity is generally limited. 
This is the environment in which we are now operating. We have also recently received encouraging feedback from many of our customers regarding the ongoing recovery of this business of -- these business levels and their increased demand for our services. 
As a result, we expect to see a continued acceleration in our market share trends as we progress through this year. Our focus is never to simply increase market share and revenues. Our objective is to win market share in a way that can produce profitable revenue growth. We achieved this goal in the first quarter as our ability to deliver best-in-class service at a fair price contributed to the increase in our volumes. 
The resulting improvement in density as well as an increase in yield that exceeded cost inflation led to the 76.1% operating ratio for the quarter and 53% increase in earnings per diluted share. With a favorable operating environment and improving trends, we intend to invest significantly in all elements of capacity this year to support our revenue growth initiatives. This starts with our OD family of employees, which already grew by over 1,000 new full-time employees during the first quarter. 
We intend to hire additional employees this year to further increase the capacity of our workforce. In addition, we will support our team's ability to deliver superior service by investing approximately $605 million in capital expenditures during 2021. This total includes new tractors and trailers as well as an expansion of our service center network that could include an additional 4 to 6 service centers. 
We will also continue to invest in new technologies that are designed to improve customer service and increase the efficiency of our operations. The OD team will be diligent in managing productivity, cost and capacity this year to maximize our ability to produce profitable growth in 2021. 
This diligence, however, will not affect our focus on the long-term opportunities for our business. We believe we are the best-positioned company in the LTL industry to win market share in both the current environment and over the long term. This provides us with confidence that the continued execution of our strategic plan, combined with our financial strength and available network capacity can produce additional growth in earnings and increased shareholder value. Thank you for joining us this morning, and now Adam will discuss our first quarter financial results in greater detail."

Old Dominion's revenue for the first quarter of 2021 was $1.1 billion, which was a 14.1% increase from the prior year despite having 1 less workday. Our operating ratio improved 530 basis points to 76.1%, and earnings per diluted share increased to $1.70. 
Our per day revenue growth of 15.9% included a nice mix of increases in both our LTL tons and yield. LTL tons per day increased 10%, while our LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 5.6%. We are winning market share as demand for our industry-leading service has increased while the domestic economy is improving. 
In addition to our service advantage that includes 99% on-time performance and a cargo claims ratio of 0.1%, our proven strategy of investing in service center capacity ahead of anticipated growth has also provided us with a capacity advantage in the marketplace. This strategy is different from many of our competitors as we believe the average number of service centers operated by the other large LTL carriers has decreased over the past 10 years. 
We currently have approximately 25% excess capacity within our service center network, which is in line with our long-term targets, and we plan to further expand our network this year to stay ahead of our growth. Our plan is to ensure that our network is never a limiting factor to growth. 
On a sequential basis, revenue per day for the first quarter increased 3.3% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, with LTL tons per day increasing 0.7% and LTL shipments per day increasing 1.5%. These were all above our normal sequential trends, which typically decline from the fourth quarter. 
The monthly sequential changes in LTL tons per day during the first quarter were as follows: January increased 0.3% as compared with December, February decreased 4.4% versus January and March increased 10.7% as compared to February. 
10-year average change for the respective months are an increase of 1.2% in January, an increase of 2.2% in February and an increase of 5.1% in March. While there are still many workdays that remain in April, our revenue performance has remained strong, our month-to-date revenue per day has increased by approximately 45% to 50% when compared to April 2020. 
As a reminder, our revenue decreased 19.3% in April 2020 due to the significant impact of the COVID-related shutdowns. We will provide the actual revenue related details for April in our first quarter Form 10-Q. 
Our first quarter operating ratio improved to 76.1% with improvements in both our direct operating cost and overhead cost as a percent of revenue. 
We have said many times before that the long-term improvement in our operating ratio requires an improvement in density and yield, both of which are generally supported by a favorable macroeconomic environment. The strength of our first quarter results reflect how important these factors are to our success. 
Our direct cost benefited from an improvement in our linehaul latent load average and pickup delivery shipments per hour during the quarter. We lost a little productivity on the dock, but that is common when business levels accelerate and we add a significant number of new employees. 
While we would like to see our platform productivity improve, we believe it is more important for these employees to properly load our trailers to maximize employee safety and linehaul efficiency while also protecting freight from damage. As Greg mentioned, we will continue to add drivers and platform employees during the second quarter as our volume trends continue to accelerate. We will also continue to use purchase transportation to supplement our workforce until the capacity of our team can support our anticipated growth. We improved our overhead cost as a percent of revenue during the first quarter, primarily by successfully leveraging our revenue growth. As expected and mentioned on our fourth quarter call, certain costs that were reduced in 2020 because the pandemic have started to increase. 
While many of these costs, such as travel and customer entertainment are not completely back to pre pandemic levels, we expect that there will be sequential increases in aggregate overhead costs this year. We will maintain our disciplined approach to controlling discretionary spending, however, and make every effort to minimize cost inflation in other areas. 
Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $310.3 million for the first quarter, and capital expenditures were $51 million. We currently anticipate our capital expenditures to be approximately $605 million this year, which includes $275 million for service center expansion projects. 
We utilized $309 million for our share repurchase program and paid $23.2 million in dividends during the first quarter. The total share repurchase amount includes $275 million attributable to an accelerated share repurchase agreement that was executed during the first quarter. 
Our first quarter shares outstanding reflects the initial delivery of shares under this agreement and a final calculation of total shares repurchased will occur no later than the end of August of this year. 
Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of '21 was 26.0% as compared to 26.3% in the first quarter of 2020 and we currently expect our annual effective tax rate to be 26.0% for the second quarter of '21. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time."

So -- and I know you want to hold off on the specific comments until the the 10-Q comes out. But Adam, would it be possible to maybe kind of talk bigger picture around what you're seeing sequentially in April relative to March, the comparisons both year-over-year and sequentially are just abnormal this year because of what was happening last year and obviously how strong March was.

We've been seeing some lighter shipments earlier in the month, and then it just strengthens throughout and then gets heavy at the end. 
But nevertheless, our overall revenue obviously, at 45% to 50% on a comparison basis, with April suggests that we are seeing continued strength and acceleration in our business. 
We had incredibly strong performance in March at tonnage per day that was up 10.7% versus the normal 5.1% increase. That was the 10-year average. And then that followed the weakness that we saw in February. So probably a little bit of recovery there that help support that number and then just the way the math work. 
But I think that we're continuing to see revenue performed pretty much in line with what we'd expect from a sequential standpoint. As you mentioned, the year-over-year weights and shipments are going to look a little unusual. Whereas last year, we had such an increase in late March and through April in the weight per shipment. So that certainly will throw things off a bit. 
But we look to see continued strong revenue performance and whether that's coming through in tonnage, shipments and yield, I think it's really all of the above. They're all performing well and contributing to excellent revenue quality and obviously, in the first quarter, that's contributing to really strong profitable growth for us."

We're hearing from a number of LTLs, both public and private, that they're highly capacity constrained given what's happening in the broader market, and they're taking steps to actually limit the volume that they're taking in from their customers. And I would think that given the latent capacity that you guys have in your network, you mentioned 25% in your prepared comments, that's going to give you a chance to really demonstrate your value proposition, potentially to new customers. 
So I guess, how are you thinking about balancing the approach between making sure you're handling the needs of your existing customer base that are seeing surging volumes, but also perhaps using this opportunity in a capacity-constrained environment to expand your customer base. How do you balance those 2 factors?"

So I think we're in a very unique and a very positive position when the market turns as positive as it is today. 
From a standpoint of constricting volumes or limiting volumes, whatever you want to call it, we have not had to do that. We have limited some truckload-type shipments that were coming our way more -- much stronger back in March than today. But we have had to limit some of those type shipments and keep them out of the truck line. 
But otherwise, we're not capacity constrained. It's full steam ahead. We're trying to hire and add to our workforce to meet those capacity demands and so far, we're having success. I wish it was -- sometimes it would happen a little bit quicker than it does. But we're in a good position moving forward. And all things go."

And the reason I just asked this question is I'm trying to understand when OpEx per shipment has to inflect more meaningfully, getting back to closer to that 4% to 5% level because it's actually been declining over the last couple of quarters, partly, I assume, because of the attribution to growth from yield and pricing.

So we're going to see if things continue a pretty meaningful drop and that's similar to what we experienced in March as well. 
So you can -- with a big decrease in the weight per shipment obviously that has a favorable impact on revenue per hundredweight. And so we've got a big inflection there, not to mention that last year in April was when the fuel dropped so significantly. So we're going to have a bigger contribution from the fuel surcharge as well might be looking at. And certainly, we saw double-digit type increase in revenue per hundredweight. And that doesn't tell the story necessarily from a pure yield and revenue per shipment standpoint. 
We saw a nice improvement in the first quarter on revenue per shipment, and that benefited from both higher weight per shipment and a higher length of haul as well. And all those metrics go into our yield management process. 
We've got a process that's focused on individual account profitability and one that focuses on continuous improvement as well. And I think that our sales team, our pricing teams, they worked really hard over the last couple of years to make sure that we're seeing continuous improvement in each of our customers' operating ratios, and that's certainly bearing fruit when you look at our numbers and how that may transition into the second quarter as well. 
So it's probably going to be more of a -- just looking at that pure number. Look in comparison on a sequential basis from first quarter revenue per hundredweight that I know drive everyone's models, that normal sequential transition from 1Q to 2Q. 
And if you look at it, excluding the fuel, we were right at $21 on a revenue per hundred weight basis in 1Q. And typically, we see on average about a 1.5% increase from 1Q to 2Q, if mix has held constant. So that would suggest another $0.25 to $0.30 sort of sequential increase, if you will, in that revenue per hundredweight metric, excluding the fuel. 
But we're going to continue on with our focus. And you asked about OpEx as well. The long-term plan has always been to balance our revenue per shipment versus the cost per shipment performance and having a positive delta there to support the ongoing investments in capacity that essentially we're making on behalf of our customers as well as investments in technology tools and so forth that can help us keep our cost structure lower. 
So that we can improve profit per shipment without having a ROI completely on pricing initiatives. But if we can continue to keep cost in check through productivity. 
And certainly, right now, we're benefiting from the strong top line growth and just the increase in shipment is creating operating leverage that's benefiting our cost structure there. And as you mentioned, we did see a decrease in cost per shipment in the first quarter. 
But we were expecting, like we mentioned at the beginning of this year, core inflation of kind of 4% to 4.5%, we're just benefiting right now significantly from the leverage and productivity and yield performance in our business."

It's the quarter where we typically see the largest sequential increase in revenue performance as well. Typically, revenue per day is up 10% in the second quarter versus the first.

So we've -- on any given year, we've increased or improved the operating ratio in a range of 360 to 420 basis points. And certainly, we would expect to get some improvement this year. We've done a good job over the last 3 quarters and have had nice sequential changes that have beat kind of what our normal progression is. 
But now we're starting to look at the cost that I mentioned that we expect to have some increases in our aggregate overhead cost. We performed very well in the first quarter and had some costs in categories that kind of went well for us that we'll see if all the stars stay aligned as we transition into second quarter. But certainly, our focus is always to produce as much profitable growth as we can. And we will continue to look at leveraging the improvement in our revenue and trying to continue with our productivity initiatives. Some of that like we saw in the first quarter, where we lost a little productivity on the dock as we continue to hire new employees and put them into the operation. Certainly, you can start seeing a little bit of a headwind on productivity there. But our operation is running extremely smooth right now, and we're going to keep focused on making sure that we're focused mainly on keeping our service metrics, best-in-class secondary focus on productivity. 
But at the end of the day, we're trying to produce as much profitable growth as we can."

The big picture change is that we feel like length of haul will probably shorten and that we'll continue to see improvement in our regional business, but we still have a very high-quality long-haul and medium-haul business. 
And I would say over the past 12 months really since the COVID impact on the mix of our business that we've probably just seen a little bit more market share in with our contractual business and certainly saw more growth for many periods out of the west. 
Right now, our growth is very balanced across all of our regions. But a lot of times, the freight coming out of the West will have a longer length of haul associated with it. So we've seen tremendous growth there and that's probably been causing a little uptick. 
But long term, when we think about that continued shift and tailwind that we believe exists with e-commerce freight, we'd expect to see that. Market share in those regional lanes continue to increase and probably pull the length of haul back down with it."

So certainly, the strong demand when you've got a yield management process that focuses on individual account profitability, in a demand environment like this, we've got to think about opportunity costs with how we allocate capacity. And certainly, when you've got accounts that may not be the best performing from an operating ratio standpoint, then we try to work through those as those accounts may be asking for more capacity from us. 
And so certainly, would try to get a little more in an environment like this when we may not be able to get as much in environments that are a little bit weaker. But core increases are going well. We're seeing good increases as the contracts are coming up, but that's what we shoot for year in and year out. 
We, I think, have a differentiated approach where we try to be consistent year in and year out with our customers and talk about the cost inflation that we're experiencing and the increases that we need to offset that inflation.

I think you heard our numbers, we're talking about the $300 million real estate capital expenditure budget this year. And a lot of that is because of the inflation that we've seen related to real estate. So it's not -- certainly, if we were doing this year, what we did maybe 10, 15 years ago, the number wouldn't be anywhere near that.

And then our contractual accounts, which performed well for us all last year continuing to perform strongly as well. And so they actually are are picking up a little bit more as well. And we're just seeing the higher balance in both of those categories versus that decrease in the mix from the spot quote. So it's good to see across the board that when we look at our accounts and think through the increase in weight per shipment kind of goes hand-in-hand with the feedback that we're getting from our sales team that our customers' businesses are improving and there's just increased demand for widgets out there that's creating freight opportunities for us. 
And certainly, we're taking advantage of that opportunity with our market share improvements."

Do you care to share kind of any expectations around headcount growth either sequentially into the second quarter or kind of what your thought process would be for the full year. I know you shared some expectations in the first quarter. 
I mean it obviously sounds like you're trying to catch up and ramp up on the headcount side. So if you have any kind of overall numbers, that would be great. And then also thoughts around productivity. I think that historically, maybe it's been 6 to 9 months to get new employees up to a level of efficiency of more experienced hires. 
Is that kind of the right way we should think about this cycle? Or are there any things that would impact that?"

On the average headcount side, in the first quarter, sequentially, we were up 4.3% versus fourth quarter and typically, our headcount is pretty flat. So there was a big increase in shift there, reflecting the success in the programs that Greg mention",331,"Yes. On the average headcount side, in the first quarter, sequentially, we were up 4.3% versus fourth quarter and typically, our headcount is pretty flat. So there was a big increase in shift there, reflecting the success in the programs that Greg mentioned, our HR team has done a really great job of continuing to bring people on board and get them ready for the acceleration in freight that we typically see through the second and third quarters. 
On average, second quarter headcount is normally up a little over 2% for us. The biggest year we ever had was in '14. Again, another strong period. Headcount was up 5% that year in the second quarter. And I think we're going to see probably a number more like that. 
We're still trying to catch the curve, if you will, with the growth that we're seeing and still having to make uses in purchase transportation, as mentioned. So I would expect to see that we're on the high end of that scale and possibly even exceeding on that 5% metric in terms of the sequential change from first quarter to second quarter. 
And the productivity that you mentioned, like we mentioned in our prepared remarks, especially on the dock, it's pretty typical to see a loss of productivity. 
But it's certainly more important to make sure that the team, as they come in new, they're learning. They learn our ways for claims prevention. They're following our safety protocols and so forth. 
And we're trying to maximize the loads that we're moving, our linehaul costs are the biggest cost settlement that we pay. So we've got to make sure that we're properly loading these trailers to maximize the overall efficiency of the operation. 
And so certainly, that's something that we'll continue to experience is we're increasing headcount. But when we've got the top line revenue growth, that gives us a little cover to offset maybe some of this higher cost inflation that we're seeing."

It was the best quarter as a percent of revenue that it's been in a number of years as far as I can tell. 
And I know last year, you had some special bonus payments that it sounds like probably won't be recurring this year. And if I look at average salaries and benefits expense per employee, it took a step down sequentially. 
And I assume that's related to some new hiring, which presumably is coming in at slightly lower wages. 
So I guess my question is, when I think about comp per employee, can it stay in this range sequentially? Or does it take a little bit of a step-up given some of the wage inflation pressures that we're seeing and some of the challenges that other LTL carriers have spoken about with regard to hiring?"

Again, we gave the wage increase last year of 13% to 3.5%. I think that when you start looking at things on a year-over-year basis, all of the comparisons in the second quarter are going to be pretty unusual. But we're going to have higher costs related to group health and dental benefits. 
I think that we'll see our benefit cost per employee, some acceleration there as we progress. We had a pretty good performance. So those fringe benefit cost as a percent of normal salaries and wages in the first quarter were 33% -- 33.2%. 
And so that was good performance when we were anticipating somewhere more like 34% for this year -- 34% to 34.5% was kind of my initial forecast. And so we saw good performance there. I think that it's possible that we'll continue to see some inflation there. 
The other factor is we're certainly seeing inflation when it comes to the performance-based compensation that we have. 
With our improving financial results, we're going to see increases there as well. And that's something that really gets back to when we talk about our focus for hiring people. It all starts with our company culture and the family spirit that we have. That certainly has made it easier to both attract and retain employees. But the connection to the financial performance and that direct length of the engagement of employees with connecting the company's financial success to their personal success through improved wages and benefits and contributions into our 401(k) retirement program, those are all things that help keep driving the performance of the company. 
So those will continue to increase as the financial performance, both revenue and income are increasing as well. But I think we're in a great spot and to keep getting some leverage if we see that salary wages and benefits line, there should be some natural inflation there, too, as we in-source and reduce our reliance on purchase transportation. So there should be some corresponding decreases once we kind of catch back up to the curve there. So multiple factors that's going to be driving that number for us."

And as I think about the step-up in CapEx that's expected, kind of maybe if you can help contextualize what that 25% available capacity means in terms of your ability to grow sequentially from these levels. 
I think a lot of transport companies spoke about first quarter being a little bit challenging given weather-related obstacles to moving freight. As we think about -- forget the year-over-year comparisons, but just sequentially from here, how much room is there to kind of outgrow what the normal sequential pattern has been?"

In an LTL network, it's the doors that is required to process freight and it's obviously very critical in a long-term investment in a long time to expand capacity, as we've discussed earlier on the call. So that's something that we always have to stay focused on. And we feel like far ahead of our growth curve to make sure the network is never a limiting factor to us. So but that's 1 of 3 key elements of capacity within LTL. Next would be on the fleet side. And I feel like we're in a really good spot based on where our fleet is and the ability to handle the freight that we have today as well as the ongoing increases that we would be anticipating this year in coordination with the $290 million CapEx spend that we have planned for equipment this year. 
So I feel like our fleet is in a really good spot. And obviously, you don't want to carry that much excess capacity like we do on the service center network side in your fleet, there's higher depreciation per unit cost there. 
You want to have enough to be able to handle the peaks at the end of the month and end of quarters and to be able to accommodate growth, but you don't maintain that same excessive level. And then finally and most importantly is the people capacity. 
And certainly, that's something that we manage more in relation with revenue and volume trends. And it's something that we're constantly balancing here and the lever we pull, like we're pulling right now, when we're a little short as we make use of purchase transportation, and we'll continue to do that until we complete the additions to the team that just sort of catch-up with the freight volumes that we're currently experiencing. So we're in a good spot across the board. And I think we've got a good plan, a very detailed plan, and it's different by service center and by region for how we're continuing to add drivers and platform employees to the team to continue to handle the accelerating volumes that we're seeing."

So that will be a good thing from a top line standpoint for us. From a bottom line standpoint, much like we talked about last year, we try to have our fuel scales, both for our own internal scale as well as the scales that many of our larger contractual accounts have within their contracts to be somewhat neutral, whether fuel is going up or down. And we stress test those but we didn't really talk too much about it last year. 
We felt when it was decreasing, we felt like we would minimize the effect on the bottom line based on the lower end of the fuel scales.

And we're doing that because of the market share opportunities that we continue to believe that are out there. And certainly, we're positioned better than anyone with the service levels that we offer, the total value proposition. 
And we feel like that in this environment, more shippers are focusing on value. That's certainly what we sell. And there is a value to Old Dominion services as well as the capacity. Our customers right now are certainly benefiting from the fact that we've made all of these capacity investments, and they've got contracts in place with us, and we certainly can continue to handle increased levels of business with them. 
And we're getting the feedback from customers that many of our competitors are not able to handle some of the acceleration that they're seeing in their business. So that, too, is we have seen it in the first quarter, and that's continuing where that capacity advantage is certainly driving freight our way.

And welcome to our first quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. We are pleased to report a great start to 2021 for Old Dominion. Ou",619,"Good morning. And welcome to our first quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. 
We are pleased to report a great start to 2021 for Old Dominion. Our financial results were highlighted by new first quarter records for revenue, operating ratio and earnings per diluted share. The operating momentum that began in the second half of 2020 continued through the quarter, and we also benefited from an improving domestic economy. Our revenue increased to $1.1 billion as a result, which is the highest level of quarterly revenue we have ever achieved. The 14.1% revenue growth rate was also our highest since the fourth quarter of 2018 after essentially going through 2 flattish years in '19 and '20, while our revenue was relatively flat over the past 2 years, and that was an unusually long period for us to go without growth. 
We maintained our commitment to our long-term strategic plan and invested during those times for our future. Our first quarter financial results validate the benefits of this long-term strategy. While our strategic plan has worked throughout many economic cycles, we generally see our largest increases in market share when the domestic economy is strong and industry capacity is generally limited. This is the environment in which we are now operating.
We have also recently received encouraging feedback from many of our customers regarding the ongoing recovery of this business -- of these business levels and their increased demand for our services. As a result, we expect to see a continued acceleration in our market share trends as we progress through this year.
Our focus is never to simply increase market share and revenues. Our objective is to win market share in a way that can produce profitable revenue growth. We achieved this goal in the first quarter as our ability to deliver best-in-class service at a fair price contributed to the increase in our volumes. The resulting improvement in density as well as an increase in yield that exceeded cost inflation led to the 76.1% operating ratio for the quarter and 53% increase in earnings per diluted share.
With a favorable operating environment and improving trends, we intend to invest significantly in all elements of capacity this year to support our revenue growth initiatives. This starts with our OD family of employees, which already grew by over 1,000 new full-time employees during the first quarter. We intend to hire additional employees this year to further increase the capacity of our workforce. In addition, we will support our team's ability to deliver superior service by investing approximately $605 million in capital expenditures during 2021. This total includes new tractors and trailers as well as an expansion of our service center network that could include an additional 4 to 6 service centers. We will also continue to invest in new technologies that are designed to improve customer service and increase the efficiency of our operations.
The OD team will be diligent in managing productivity, cost and capacity this year to maximize our ability to produce profitable growth in 2021. This diligence, however, will not affect our focus on the long-term opportunities for our business. We believe we are the best-positioned company in the LTL industry to win market share in both the current environment and over the long term. This provides us with confidence that the continued execution of our strategic plan, combined with our financial strength and available network capacity, can produce additional growth in earnings and increased shareholder value. Thank you for joining us this morning, and now Adam will discuss our first quarter financial results in greater detail."

Old Dominion's revenue for the first quarter of 2021 was $1.1 billion, which was a 14.1% increase from the prior year despite having one less workday. Our operating ratio improved 530 basis points to 76.1%, and earnings per diluted share increased to $1.70. 
Our per day revenue growth of 15.9% included a nice mix of increases in both our LTL tons and yield. LTL tons per day increased 10%, while our LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 5.6%. We are winning market share as demand for our industry-leading service has increased while the domestic economy is improving. 
In addition to our service advantage that includes 99% on-time performance and a cargo claims ratio of 0.1%, our proven strategy of investing in service center capacity ahead of anticipated growth has also provided us with a capacity advantage in the marketplace. This strategy is different from many of our competitors as we believe the average number of service centers operated by the other large LTL carriers has decreased over the past 10 years. 
We currently have approximately 25% excess capacity within our service center network, which is in line with our long-term targets, and we plan to further expand our network this year to stay ahead of our growth. Our plan is to ensure that our network is never a limiting factor to growth. 
On a sequential basis, revenue per day for the first quarter increased 3.3% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, with LTL tons per day increasing 0.7% and LTL shipments per day increasing 1.5%. These were all above our normal sequential trends, which typically decline from the fourth quarter. 
The monthly sequential changes in LTL tons per day during the first quarter were as follows: January increased 0.3% as compared with December; February decreased 4.4% versus January; and March increased 10.7% as compared to February. The 10-year average change for the respective months are an increase of 1.2% in January, an increase of 2.2% in February, and an increase of 5.1% in March.
While there are still many workdays that remain in April, our revenue performance has remained strong. Our month-to-date revenue per day has increased by approximately 45% to 50% when compared to April 2020. As a reminder, our revenue decreased 19.3% in April 2020 due to the significant impact of the COVID-related shutdowns. We will provide the actual revenue-related details for April in our first quarter Form 10-Q. 
Our first quarter operating ratio improved to 76.1% with improvements in both our direct operating cost and overhead cost as a percent of revenue. We have said many times before that the long-term improvement in our operating ratio requires an improvement in density and yield, both of which are generally supported by a favorable macroeconomic environment. The strength of our first quarter results reflect how important these factors are to our success. Our direct cost benefited from an improvement in our line haul latent load average and pickup delivery shipments per hour during the quarter. We lost a little productivity on the dock, but that is common when business levels accelerate and we add a significant number of new employees. 
While we would like to see our platform productivity improve, we believe it is more important for these employees to properly load our trailers to maximize employee safety and line haul efficiency while also protecting freight from damage. As Greg mentioned, we will continue to add drivers and platform employees during the second quarter as our volume trends continue to accelerate. We will also continue to use purchase transportation to supplement our workforce until the capacity of our team can support our anticipated growth.
We improved our overhead cost as a percent of revenue during the first quarter, primarily by successfully leveraging our revenue growth. As expected and mentioned on our fourth quarter call, certain costs that were reduced in 2020 because of the pandemic have started to increase. While many of these costs, such as travel and customer entertainment, are not completely back to pre-pandemic levels, we expect that there will be sequential increases in aggregate overhead costs this year. We will maintain our disciplined approach to controlling discretionary spending, however, and make every effort to minimize cost inflation in other areas. 
Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $310.3 million for the first quarter, and capital expenditures were $51 million. We currently anticipate our capital expenditures to be approximately $605 million this year, which includes $275 million for service center expansion projects.
We utilized $309 million for our share repurchase program and paid $23.2 million in dividends during the first quarter. The total share repurchase amount includes $275 million attributable to an accelerated share repurchase agreement that was executed during the first quarter. Our first quarter shares outstanding reflects the initial delivery of shares under this agreement, and a final calculation of total shares repurchased will occur no later than the end of August of this year. 
Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of '21 was 26.0% as compared to 26.3% in the first quarter of 2020, and we currently expect our annual effective tax rate to be 26.0% for the second quarter of '21.
This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time."

So -- and I know you want to hold off on the specific comments until the 10-Q comes out. But Adam, would it be possible to maybe kind of talk bigger picture around what you're seeing sequentially in April relative to March? The comparisons both year-over-year and sequentially are just abnormal this year because of what was happening last year and obviously how strong March was. Could you maybe talk about what you're seeing April versus March from a tonnage and shipment perspective relative to normal seasonality?"
319404,709176799,2255785,"Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2021",2021-04-22,"Earnings Calls","Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.","Executives","It's hard to get into the details of that on tonnage and shipments basis because the trends have been a little unusual, if you will, and not following the same types of patterns in the sense of the way our weight per shipment has been trending intra month",277,"It's hard to get into the details of that on tonnage and shipments basis because the trends have been a little unusual, if you will, and not following the same types of patterns in the sense of the way our weight per shipment has been trending intra month and so forth. We've been seeing some lighter shipments earlier in the month, and then it just strengthens throughout and then gets heavy at the end. 
But nevertheless, our overall revenue, obviously, at 45% to 50% on a comparison basis with April, suggests that we are seeing continued strength and acceleration in our business. We had incredibly strong performance in March at tonnage per day that was up 10.7% versus the normal 5.1% increase. That was the 10-year average. And then that followed the weakness that we saw in February. So probably a little bit of recovery there that helped support that number and then just the way the math worked. 
But I think that we're continuing to see revenue perform pretty much in line with what we'd expect from a sequential standpoint. As you mentioned, the year-over-year weights and shipments are going to look a little unusual, whereas last year, we had such an increase in late March and through April in the weight per shipment. So that certainly will throw things off a bit. 
But we look to see continued strong revenue performance, and whether that's coming through in tonnage, shipments and yield, I think it's really all of the above. They're all performing well and contributing to excellent revenue quality and obviously, in the first quarter, that's contributing to really strong profitable growth for us."

And then, I guess maybe a bigger picture question to follow up. We're hearing from a number of LTLs, both public and private, that they're highly capacity constrained given what's happening in the broader market, and they're taking steps to actually limit the volume that they're taking in from their customers. And I would think that given the latent capacity that you guys have in your network, you mentioned 25% in your prepared comments, that's going to give you a chance to really demonstrate your value proposition, potentially to new customers. 
So I guess how are you thinking about balancing the approach between making sure you're handling the needs of your existing customer base that are seeing surging volumes, but also perhaps using this opportunity in a capacity-constrained environment to expand your customer base? How do you balance those 2 factors?"

So I think we're definitely seeing the evidence of that. We're not capacity constrained.

So I think we're in a very unique and a very positive position when the market turns as positive as it is today. 
From a standpoint of constricting volumes or limiting volumes, whatever you want to call it, we have not had to do that. We have limited some truckload-type shipments that were coming our way more so -- much stronger back in March than today. But we have had to limit some of those type shipments and keep them out of the truck line. 
But otherwise, we're not capacity constrained. It's full steam ahead. We're trying to hire and add to our workforce to meet those capacity demands and so far, we're having success. I wish it was -- sometimes it would happen a little bit quicker than it does. But we're in a good position moving forward. And all things go."

And the reason I just asked this question is I'm trying to understand when OpEx per shipment has to inflect more meaningfully, getting back to closer to that 4% to 5% level, because it's actually been declining over the last couple of quarters, partly, I assume, because of the attribution to growth from yield and pricing. So just talk about yields, where yields are moving prospectively from here. And when you think OpEx per shipment needs to get back higher as shipment growth moves up."

The yield numbers, similar to conversation we just had about volumes, they're going to look a little unusual as well. Last year, in April, our average weight per shipment was 1,677 pounds. And we've been trending now around the 1,600 pound range. So",570,"Yes. The yield numbers, similar to conversation we just had about volumes, they're going to look a little unusual as well. Last year, in April, our average weight per shipment was 1,677 pounds. And we've been trending now around the 1,600 pound range. So we're going to see if things continue a pretty meaningful drop, and that's similar to what we experienced in March as well. 
So you can -- with a big decrease in the weight per shipment, obviously that has a favorable impact on revenue per hundredweight. And so we've got a big inflection there, not to mention that last year in April was when the fuel dropped so significantly. So we're going to have a bigger contribution from the fuel surcharge as well, might be looking at. And certainly, we saw a double-digit type increase in revenue per hundredweight. And that doesn't tell the story necessarily from a pure yield and revenue per shipment standpoint. We saw a nice improvement in the first quarter on revenue per shipment, and that benefited from both a higher weight per shipment and a higher length of haul as well. And all those metrics go into our yield management process. 
We've got a process that's focused on individual account profitability and one that focuses on continuous improvement as well. And I think that our sales team, our pricing teams, they worked really hard over the last couple of years to make sure that we're seeing continuous improvement in each of our customers' operating ratios, and that's certainly bearing fruit when you look at our numbers and how that may transition into the second quarter as well. 
So it's probably going to be more of a -- just looking at that pure number, look in comparison on a sequential basis from first quarter revenue per hundredweight that I know drive everyone's models, that normal sequential transition from 1Q to 2Q. And if you look at it, excluding the fuel, we were right at $21 on a revenue per hundred weight basis in 1Q. And typically, we see on average about a 1.5% increase from 1Q to 2Q, if mix has held constant. So that would suggest another $0.25 to $0.30 sort of sequential increase, if you will, in that revenue per hundredweight metric, excluding the fuel. 
But we're going to continue on with our focus. And you asked about OpEx as well. The long-term plan has always been to balance our revenue per shipment versus the cost per shipment performance and having a positive delta there to support the ongoing investments in capacity that essentially we're making on behalf of our customers as well as investments in technology tools and so forth that can help us keep our cost structure lower, so that we can improve profit per shipment without having them rely completely on pricing initiatives.
But if we can continue to keep cost in check through productivity, and certainly, right now, we're benefiting from the strong top line growth and just the increase in shipment is creating operating leverage that's benefiting our cost structure there. And as you mentioned, we did see a decrease in cost per shipment in the first quarter. But we were expecting, like we mentioned at the beginning of this year, core inflation of kind of 4% to 4.5%. We're just benefiting right now significantly from the leverage and productivity and yield performance in our business."

It's the quarter where we typically see the largest sequential increase in revenue performance as well. Typically, revenue per day is up 10% in the second quarter versus the first. And so that leverage on existing cost base and so forth creates that opportunity for us. 
So we've -- on any given year, we've increased or improved the operating ratio in a range of 360 to 420 basis points. And certainly, we would expect to get some improvement this year. We've done a good job over the last 3 quarters and have had nice sequential changes that have beat kind of what our normal progression is. But now we're starting to look at the cost that -- I mentioned that we expect to have some increases in our aggregate overhead cost. I mean we performed very well in the first quarter and had some costs in categories that kind of went well for us that we'll see if all the stars stay aligned as we transition into second quarter.
But certainly, our focus is always to produce as much profitable growth as we can. And we will continue to look at leveraging the improvement in our revenue and trying to continue with our productivity initiatives. Some of that like we saw in the first quarter, where we lost a little productivity on the dock as we continue to hire new employees and put them into the operation. Certainly, you can start seeing a little bit of a headwind on productivity there. But our operation is running extremely smooth right now, and we're going to keep focused on making sure that we're focused mainly on keeping our service metrics best-in-class, secondary focus on productivity. But at the end of the day, we're trying to produce as much profitable growth as we can."

The big picture change is that we feel like length of haul will probably shorten and that we'll continue to see improvement in our regional business, but we still have a very high-quality long-haul and medium-haul business.  And I would say over the past 12 months, really since the COVID impact on the mix of our business, that we've probably just seen a little bit more market share in with our contractual business and certainly saw more growth for many periods out of the West. Right now, our growth is very balanced across all of our regions. But a lot of times, the freight coming out of the West will have a longer length of haul associated with it. So we've seen tremendous growth there and that's probably been causing a little uptick. 
But long term, when we think about that continued shift and tailwind that we believe exists with e-commerce freight, we'd expect to see that market share in those regional lanes continue to increase and probably pull the length of haul back down with it."

So we'll keep using it to supplement the workforce until really, we're in position to be able to handle anticipated growth with our complete team and everything in-sourced where we would like it to be.

And we've averaged an increase in our revenue per shipment of about 4.5%. And that is a target over our cost inflation of 75 to 100 basis points. 
So certainly, the strong demand is, when you've got a yield management process that focuses on individual account profitability, in a demand environment like this, we've got to think about opportunity costs with how we allocate capacity. And certainly, when you've got accounts that may not be the best performing from an operating ratio standpoint, then we try to work through those as those accounts may be asking for more capacity from us. 
And so certainly, we would try to get a little more in an environment like this when we may not be able to get as much in environments that are a little bit weaker. But core increases are going well. We're seeing good increases as the contracts are coming up, but that's what we shoot for year in and year out. 
We, I think, have a differentiated approach where we try to be consistent year in and year out with our customers and talk about the cost inflation that we're experiencing and the increases that we need to offset that inflation. But again, also supporting the continuous investment in capacity that we're making on behalf of our customers.

So again, I think we're having the success that we need, be it more difficult, and it's -- obviously, it's more expensive. 
I think you've heard our numbers, we're talking about the $300 million real estate capital expenditure budget this year. And a lot of that is because of the inflation that we've seen related to real estate. So it's not -- certainly, if we were doing this year what we did maybe 10, 15 years ago, the number wouldn't be anywhere near that. So there's definitely some inflation there.

Typically, an increase in weight per shipment goes hand-in-hand with an improving economy. And to think about what I just mentioned with the decrease",276,"So I think that the 1,600-pound range where we are, I think really reflects the strength of the economy. Typically, an increase in weight per shipment goes hand-in-hand with an improving economy. And to think about what I just mentioned with the decrease in the number of spot quote shipments, oftentimes, those spot quote shipments are averaging 8,000 to 10,000 pounds.  So when you've got that mix of business that has now shifted into our percentage of business rather than shifted into our 559 tariff-based customers and our larger contractual customers, I think it just reflects the underlying strength in demand for our customers' businesses. 
But we've seen really good performance with our smaller accounts in recent months. Our tariff-based business has continued to improve as a result, and actually is trending slightly ahead as a percent of overall revenue than where we were pre pandemic. And then our contractual accounts, which performed well for us all of last year, are continuing to perform strongly as well. And so they actually are picking up a little bit more as well. And we're just seeing a higher balance in both of those categories versus that decrease in the mix from the spot quote.
So it's good to see across the board that when we look at our accounts and think through the increase in weight per shipment, it kind of goes hand-in-hand with the feedback that we're getting from our sales team that our customers' businesses are improving and there's just increased demand for widgets out there that's creating freight opportunities for us. And certainly, we're taking advantage of that opportunity with our market share improvements."

I know you shared some expectations in the first quarter. I mean it obviously sounds like you're trying to catch up and ramp up on the headcount side. So if you have any kind of overall numbers, that would be great.
And then also thoughts around productivity. I think that historically, maybe it's been 6 to 9 months to get new employees up to a level of efficiency of more experienced hires. Is that kind of the right way we should think about this cycle? Or are there any things that would impact that?"

On the average headcount side, in the first quarter, sequentially, we were up 4.3% versus fourth quarter and typically, our headcount is pretty flat. So there was a big increase in shift there. Reflecting the success in the programs that Greg mention",333,"Yes. On the average headcount side, in the first quarter, sequentially, we were up 4.3% versus fourth quarter and typically, our headcount is pretty flat. So there was a big increase in shift there. Reflecting the success in the programs that Greg mentioned, our HR team has done a really great job of continuing to bring people on board and get them ready for the acceleration in freight that we typically see through the second and third quarters. On average, second quarter headcount is normally up a little over 2% for us. The biggest year we ever had was in '14, again, another strong period. Headcount was up 5% that year in the second quarter. And I think we're going to see probably a number more like that. 
We're still trying to catch the curve, if you will, with the growth that we're seeing and still having to make use of some purchased transportation, as mentioned. So I would expect to see that we're on the high end of that scale and possibly even exceeding on that 5% metric in terms of the sequential change from first quarter to second quarter. 
And the productivity that you mentioned, like we mentioned in our prepared remarks, especially on the dock, it's pretty typical to see a loss of productivity. But it's certainly more important to make sure that the team, as they come in new, they're learning. They learn our ways for claims prevention. They're following our safety protocols and so forth. And we're trying to maximize the loads that we're moving. Our line haul costs are the biggest cost settlement that we pay. So we've got to make sure that we're properly loading these trailers to maximize the overall efficiency of the operation. 
And so certainly, that's something that we'll continue to experience as we're increasing headcount. But when we've got the top line revenue growth, that gives us a little cover to offset maybe some of this higher cost inflation that we're seeing."

It was the best quarter as a percent of revenue that it's been in a number of years, as far as I can tell. And I know last year, you had some special bonus payments that it sounds like probably won't be recurring this year. And if I look at average salaries and benefits expense per employee, it took a step down sequentially. And I assume that's related to some new hiring, which presumably is coming in at slightly lower wages. 
So I guess my question is, when I think about comp per employee, can it stay in this range sequentially? Or does it take a little bit of a step-up given some of the wage inflation pressures that we're seeing and some of the challenges that other LTL carriers have spoken about with regard to hiring?"

Again, we gave the wage increase last year of between 3% to 3.5%. I think that when you start looking at things on a year-over-year basis, all of the comparisons in the second quarter are going to be pretty unusual. But we're going to have higher costs related to group health and dental benefits. 
I think that we'll see our benefit cost per employee, some acceleration there as we progress. We had a pretty good performance. So those fringe benefit costs as a percent of normal salaries and wages in the first quarter were 33% -- 33.2%. And so that was good performance when we were anticipating somewhere more like 34% for this year -- 34% to 34.5% was kind of my initial forecast. And so we saw good performance there. I think that it's possible that we'll continue to see some inflation there. 
The other factor is we're certainly seeing inflation when it comes to the performance-based compensation that we have.  With our improving financial results, we're going to see increases there as well. And that's something that really gets back to, when we talk about our focus for hiring people, it all starts with our company culture and the family spirit that we have. That certainly has made it easier to both attract and retain employees. But the connection to the financial performance and that direct length of the engagement of employees with connecting the company's financial success to their personal success through improved wages and benefits and contributions into our 401(k) retirement program, those are all things that help keep driving the performance of the company. 
So those will continue to increase as the financial performance, both revenue and income, are increasing as well. But I think we're in a great spot and -- to keep getting some leverage. If we see that salary wages and benefits line, there should be some natural inflation there too, as we in-source and reduce our reliance on purchase transportation. So there should be some corresponding decreases once we kind of catch back up to the curve there. So multiple factors that's going to be driving that number for us."

And as I think about the step-up in CapEx that's expected, kind of maybe if you can help contextualize what that 25% available capacity means in terms of your ability to grow sequentially from these levels. I think a lot of transport companies spoke about first quarter being a little bit challenging given weather-related obstacles to moving freight. As we think about -- forget the year-over-year comparisons, but just sequentially from here, how much room is there to kind of outgrow what the normal sequential pattern has been?"

In an LTL network, it's the doors that is required to process freight, and it's obviously very critical in a long-term investment and a long time to expand capacity, as we've discussed earlier on the call. So that's something that we always have to stay focused on. And we feel like far ahead of our growth curve to make sure the network is never a limiting factor to us.
So -- but that's 1 of 3 key elements of capacity within LTL. Next would be on the fleet side. And I feel like we're in a really good spot based on where our fleet is and the ability to handle the freight that we have today as well as the ongoing increases that we would be anticipating this year in coordination with the $290 million CapEx spend that we have planned for equipment this year. So I feel like our fleet is in a really good spot. And obviously, you don't want to carry that much excess capacity like we do on the service center network side. In your fleet, there's higher depreciation per unit cost there. You want to have enough to be able to handle the peaks at the end of the month and end of quarters and to be able to accommodate growth, but you don't maintain that same excessive level.
And then finally and most importantly is the people capacity. And certainly, that's something that we manage more in relation with revenue and volume trends. And it's something that we're constantly balancing here. And the lever we pull, like we're pulling right now when we're a little short is we make use of purchased transportation, and we'll continue to do that until we complete the additions to the team that just sort of catch up with the freight volumes that we're currently experiencing.
So we're in a good spot across the board. And I think we've got a good plan, a very detailed plan, and it's different by service center and by region for how we're continuing to add drivers and platform employees to the team to continue to handle the accelerating volumes that we're seeing."

From a bottom line standpoint, much like we talked about last year, we try to have our fuel scales, both for our own internal scale as well as the scales that many of our larger contractual accounts have within their contracts, to be somewhat neutral, whether fuel is going up or down. And we stress test those but we didn't really talk too much about it last year. We felt when it was decreasing, we felt like we would minimize the effect on the bottom line based on the lower end of the fuel scales.

And we're doing that because of the market share opportunities that we continue to believe that are out there.
And certainly, we're positioned better than anyone with the service levels that we offer, the total value proposition.  And we feel like that in this environment, more shippers are focusing on value. That's certainly what we sell. And there is a value to Old Dominion services as well as the capacity. Our customers right now are certainly benefiting from the fact that we've made all of these capacity investments, and they've got contracts in place with us, and we certainly can continue to handle increased levels of business with them. 
And we're getting the feedback from customers that many of our competitors are not able to handle some of the acceleration that they're seeing in their business. So that, too, is we have seen it in the first quarter, and that's continuing where that capacity advantage is certainly driving freight our way. 
So anecdotally, feedback that we're getting from customers as well as just what we see in terms of total service centers in operation, on average, they are down, and we are benefiting from that at a time when we think the industry continues to have tailwinds.

After some brief remarks, we'll be glad to take your questions. The OD team produced another record-breaking quarter and established new company records for quarterly revenue, operating ratio and earnings per diluted share. While the comparison of our numbers with the second quarter of 2020 is somewhat skewed due to the impact of the pandemic-related shutdowns last year, our second quarter business momentum this year helped drive the improvement in our revenue and profitability. 
Our revenue grew 47.2% to $1.3 billion, and our operating ratio improved 550 basis points to 72.3%. As a result, our earnings per diluted share grew 84.8% to $2.31. We achieved these results by continuing to execute on our long-term strategic plan. This plan has guided us through many economic cycles, and it is currently driving impressive growth in this strong market. Two key elements of this plan are delivering superior service at a fair price and consistently investing in capacity to help ensure that our network is never a limiting factor to our growth. We often discuss our unwavering commitment to providing our customers with superior service. This quarter, I would like to offer a deeper dive into how we think about capacity, given its relevance to the current environment. 
There are 3 major elements of capacity with an LTO: Doors at our service centers, our equipment and our people. Doors can be the most limiting form of capacity in the short term, which is why we try to stay several years ahead of our anticipated growth curve. We have invested $1.7 billion in our service center network over the past 10 years, which has allowed us to expand our door count by over 50%. Our current capital expenditure plan includes $275 million to further expand the capacity of our service center network, but we are willing to spend even more if we identify properties that are included in our long-term plan. Our commitment to the ongoing expansion of our service center network is important regardless of the macroeconomic environment due to the strong returns on capital for our business. We have consistently invested in Old Dominion's expansion even in years when our market share trends have been flattish due to the confidence we have in our long-term market share potential. Although expanding the capacity of service centers takes a significant amount of time, demand trends can change very quickly in our industry, which is why we have historically been proactive with respect to our expansion efforts. 
This unique strategy has created a large capacity advantage for us in the marketplace, which becomes most apparent to shippers and tight environments like this year. We estimate that we currently have 15% to 20% excess capacity within our service center network, and we expect to open several new facilities during the second half of this year. As a result, the capacity of our overall service center network is in good shape, although we continue to focus on the needs of certain locations to help ensure we are keeping up with increased opportunities for growth. We are prepared to address these needs as well as any other elements of capacity that need to be expanded as it appears that current demand trends will continue into 2022. We believe the domestic economy is strengthening for both our industrial and retail-related customers, and we expect additional growth in volumes based on current economic forecast as well as customer feedback. We also continue to see accelerating trends with our revenue. We have exceeded our normal sequential trends for each quarter since the cliff event that affected the second quarter of 2020. 
This outperformance has continued with our month-to-date revenue for July 2021 as well. While we feel good about our service center network, we have faced challenges with the other elements of capacity this year. There have been some delays with equipment deliveries that have caused us to continue to operate older units that were intended to be replaced. We are fortunate to have this as an option due to the fact where we have one of the youngest fleets in our industry. While our suppliers are somewhat behind schedule, we do believe that we will receive each unit that we have ordered this year. These new units will supplement our current pool of equipment and are expected to satisfy our equipment needs through the second half of this year. 
The capacity of our people continues to be our biggest need to support ongoing growth. We were successful during the second quarter with our hiring efforts and actually exceeded our goal for the period. We added over 1,100 full-time employees between March and June, and we expect to add another 1,000 full-time employees during the third quarter of this year. We will continue to use third-party purchase transportation to supplement the capacity of our people and our fleet until those 2 elements of capacity catch up with the growth in our volume. Regardless of whether it is our employees and equipment or a third party moving the freight, we remain focused on providing best-in-class service to our customers. As I previously said, providing superior service at a fair price and having capacity to stay ahead of our growth curve are 2 key pillars to our long-term strategic plan. The centerpiece of our plan remains our people. Our OD family of employees is committed to servicing our customers while also growing our business. As a result, we believe we are better positioned than any other carrier to take advantage of the opportunity for further profitable growth and increase shareholder value over the long term. 
Thank you for joining us this morning, and now Adam will discuss our second quarter financial results in greater detail."

Old Dominion's revenue growth of 47.2% in the second quarter included a 28.1% increase in LTL tons and a 14.9% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight. Excluding fuel surcharges, LTL revenue per hundredweight increased",765,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue growth of 47.2% in the second quarter included a 28.1% increase in LTL tons and a 14.9% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight. Excluding fuel surcharges, LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 10.3%, reflecting the success of our yield improvement initiatives as well as changes in the mix of our freight. While the growth in our revenue and volumes reflects an easier comparison with the second quarter of 2020, the sequential acceleration in our revenue during the second quarter was once again well above normal sequential trends. On a sequential basis, second quarter LTL shipments per day increased 12.1% over the first quarter of 2021 as compared to a 10-year average sequential increase of 7.6%. LTL tons per day increased 9.7% as compared to a 10-year average sequential increase of 7.9%. These 10-year average trends exclude our 2020 metrics for more normalized comparison. While both our shipments and tons outperformed our long-term averages, the discrepancy between our shipment and tonnage trends is a result of the decrease in our LTL weight per shipment. 
We have made operational changes over the past few quarters, mainly through pricing actions to limit the number of heavy weighted and larger, harder-to-handle types of shipments in our network that are typically more transactional in nature. We increased these efforts during the second quarter, given the ongoing tightness in our industry to preserve capacity for our customers' traditional LTL shipments. At this point in July, with only a few days remaining in the month, our revenue per day is trending higher by approximately 35% when compared to July 2020. The year-over-year revenue comparison gets tougher for us in the third quarter as our revenue per day turned positive in August 2020 and increased overall for the third quarter of 2020. We will provide actual revenue-related details for July in our second quarter Form 10-Q. 
The operating ratio for the second quarter improved 550 basis points to a company record 72.3%, with improvement in both our direct operating cost and overhead expenses as a percent of revenue. This improvement was essentially in line with the target we discussed on our first quarter earnings call. Overhead-related cost as a percent of revenue improved 490 basis points due primarily to the operating leverage created by the quality of our revenue growth. Much of the overall improvement in overhead as a percent of revenue related to our depreciation and wage and benefit costs for our sales and administrative employees. Within our direct operating cost, the wage and benefit cost for our drivers, platform employees and fleet technicians improved due primarily to an improvement in the overall efficiency of our operations. This improvement more than offset the increases in operating supplies and expenses, which reflects the rising cost of diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products as well as the increased utilization of purchased transportation to supplement our workforce. While we will continue to add employees during the second half of this year to support our anticipated growth, we believe we can effectively balance our direct operating costs with revenue as we continue to focus on productivity and ultimately, reduce our reliance on purchased transportation. 
Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $198 million and $508.3 million for the second quarter and first half of 2021, respectively, while capital expenditures were $155.1 million and $206.1 million for the same periods. We returned $63.2 million of capital to shareholders during the second quarter and utilized $395.4 million of cash through the first half of this year for both our dividend and share repurchase programs. This year-to-date total for share repurchases includes 68.8 million that is deferred until the third quarter when the final settlement occurs on our current accelerated share repurchase agreement. We announced this morning that our Board has approved a new share repurchase program that provides us with the authorization to repurchase up to $2 billion of our outstanding stock. We intend to fund this program with cash flows from operations and existing cash to continue our focus of returning excess capital to our shareholders. Our first priority for capital spending, however, will continue to be strategic investments in capital expenditures to support the long-term profitable growth of our business. Our annual effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2021 was 26% as compared to 25.7% in the second quarter of 2020, and we currently anticipate our effective tax rate to be 26.0% for the third quarter. 
This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time."

And then when we think about the operating ratio, given we're seeing inflationary cost pressures across the supply chain, you guys are talking about hiring an additional 1,000 folks in the third quarter. How should we think about operating ratio trends in the third quarter versus the 2Q relative to normal seasonality, which I think calls for some very modest degradation, if I'm thinking about that right."

Revenue per day basis, obviously, we've still got a few important days to close out the month, but we're trending very favorably at this point for the month of July. Our revenue per day at this point is a little bit stronger than what our normal sequential trends would indicate, and it really just follows the pattern that we've seen over the last 4 quarters that we referenced. We've exceeded normal sequential trends on a quarterly basis and really see no reason at this point why that would change as we go into the third quarter. The market continues to be really tight. The feedback that we're getting from customers, we just continue to see the service advantage and capacity advantage that we have in the marketplace and is winning share for us. And so  we're trying to do all the things, as we referenced in our prepared remarks, to continue to prepare for further growth and to provide best-in-class service to our customers. So we'll continue to do all those elements to get prepared. And as we get through the balance of this year and really continue to try to position the company for 2022. 
With respect to the margin question, we typically see about a 50 basis point increase in the operating ratio from the second to the third quarter. And I think that we'll see somewhere in that same ballpark 50 to 70 basis points maybe. So kind of flattish as we go from the second quarter. I consider that flattish, but just a slight increase, we typically see and have our wage increase is effective the 1st of September. We're a little behind schedule on some of our equipment deliveries, as Greg mentioned as well. So that means that we'll have a little bit more depreciation hitting us in the third quarter than typically where it would have been loaded into the first half of the year. So a few factors like that, that may come on board, but certainly, continuing to see strength as we work our way into the third quarter."

And obviously, you guys are expecting the current strength in the market to continue well into 2022, if I'm quoting you correctly. But the investments you're making in your business should position you to take market share. And I think when you look at the market more broadly,  how are you thinking about secular growth within LTL, given its leverage -- increasing leverage to e-commerce and the importance of e-commerce -- middle mile e-commerce demand to overall LTL growth over the next several years. Could you maybe talk about that for a moment, Greg? Because it seems like that's something that could really lift tonnage in the broader LTL industry and you guys are in a great position to capitalize on that."

Obviously, when the pricing environment is strong, like it is right now, that provides a lift to everyone and supports our own pricing initiatives. But I think we have a differentiated approach to pricing, and we've seen that, and it's really been the foundation for why we produce such long-term profitable growth. We have a strategy of looking at our cost inflation, and then we try to target increases in our revenue per shipment to give us a cost plus pricing. And that formulates the approach every year goes into our generate increase when we push that out, it goes into what we try to achieve from a contract renewal standpoint as well. With that said, each account must stand on its own from an individual profitability standpoint. And so we look at each account on an individual basis and what the cost inputs are for that particular account and what our pricing needs to look like to provide an appropriate return for us. And I think we've got really good consistency across our book of business. I think we saw that last year and the disruption in particular in the second quarter when a large percentage of our business shifted to larger national accounts. I think there was a concern by some on the street about what that would do to margins. And we went through the second quarter last year with a 15% decrease in revenue, a change in the mix of our business, but we were able to still improve our operating ratio with the pricing actions and the cost control measures that we had in place as well. 
So we're going to stick to our long-term consistent approach and continue to push for cost plus pricing because it's important for us to continue to expand our capacity. We're one of the few carriers that really has invested over the long term. As Greg mentioned this morning, we've invested and expanded our door count over the last 10 years by over 50%, and that supported about a 50% improvement in shipments per day over that same time frame. So we're uniquely positioned to continue to gain share in a market that continues to somewhat at least from the reports we get on the public carriers. The number of service centers over that 10-year period has stayed about the same or reduce slightly. So it's a good spot for us to be able to continue to take advantage of opportunities. Certainly, we're going to do it with price, but we should see the volumes come through and improve density as well. And as you know, that density and yield formula produces long-term improvement in our operating ratio, and so we got further room to improve from where we are today."

If you've got every other carrier that's going out and trying to raise rates. So we'll see if there are any other transactions. Certainly, the market is very consolidated, as you know, and we don't expect any new entrants in terms of just new carrier. It's -- any changes have been new players by way of acquisitions. So we'll continue to watch and see how some of the new owners manage those other businesses. And in the meantime, if that creates great opportunity for us, that's typically what we see as there becomes a little freight churn. And we either get freight directly or in some cases, just indirectly as the turn within the industry happens. But we will continue to work with our customers. And if we're a common carrier with a customer that has got one of these other entities,  our sales team is always in there trying to identify freight opportunities for us. And so in some cases, that's what creates some market share opportunity for us, but we've got multiple sources of how we win share. And we certainly believe that we've got a long runway for growth ahead of us, and we'll continue to execute on that front. 
And in regards to service center availability, we haven't necessarily seen anything at this point in terms of reducing the number of service centers for many of the other big public carriers. And certainly, we're -- we've got our eyes out and would be willing to look at any opportunities because obviously, in our long-term plans,  we continue to have a pretty long list of areas that we want to expand to. So we're at 248 service centers today and think that we've got a list of sort of 35 or 40 locations on our long-term plan that we want to continue to add to the network and support additional market share opportunities for us.

And we've got a truckload brokerage operation that some of our existing customers moving the LTL shipments that have these larger opportunities for us. We can put through our truckload brokerage and provide a solution for them, but we want to make sure that we're paying more attention to our traditional LTL shippers that we're protecting our service and capacity for them as we continue to get feedback that they need capacity. Industry capacity is tight. We're hearing that more and more. It started probably a little bit sooner this year than I expected. We thought that we would hear that feedback, given what the sequential trends have looked like for us, but it certainly come to us maybe a little bit sooner at least the panic, if you will. And so we want to make sure that we're protecting our customers and giving them what they need, but there's no reason for us to tie up capacity with these transactional type loads that are here today and gone tomorrow. We want to make sure that we're doing the right thing and protecting the market share that we have, that will be with us for the long term."

Just looking at the average salary, wages and benefits number that we publish and dividing that by the average number of employees can somewhat be skewed, if you will. And I think that that's driving some of that quarter-over-quarter increase, thinking about the actions that we had to take last year and then the actions that we're taking now. But to try to give you a little bit more color, I can say that when we started this year, we talked about our core inflation being somewhere around 4% on a per shipment basis, excluding fuel.  And that included the normal 3% to 3.5% increase that we give. That's what we did last September, and certainly, we will be giving an increase. We haven't announced that to employees yet. And so I want to hold back on sharing any color before it goes out. But as Greg mentioned, we connect the success of the company with our employees', personal financial success and certainly, feel that they will be rewarded for their efforts and for how well the company is performing. 
Looking into the second quarter in particular, though, and we kind of expected this, we did have an increase in some of our fringe benefit cost over the period. That rate -- that fringe rate was quite a bit higher than where it was in the second quarter of last year and quite a bit higher, frankly, than where we were in the first quarter. And that's some of the anomaly that comes along with the growth in employees. Our employees have been working very hard, working more hours. And as you add to your employee count, if you've got 4 employees that were working 50 hours a week and now you got 5 that are working 40, that changes the dynamics. The same amount of hours are there to be worked and the wage looks the same, but you got the benefit cost for that fifth employee that increases there. So that's something that we've seen historically when we're growing headcount that you get a little bit of a lag effect with those benefits, and some of that will continue into the third quarter as well. I'd expect that we might have a little bit higher fringe percentage rate than coming into the year I targeted and believe we'd be somewhere around 34%. That is our fringe benefit as a percentage of salaries and wages. We were a little north of that during the second quarter, and I expect us to be a little bit north of that as well as we transition into the third. But we're offsetting those were obviously costs that we overcame in 2Q, given the strong topline revenue performance and the leverage that creates on other costs. And then we've got the base, a larger base of employees to thereby grow from. So  it's all good, and it's all included. Our expectations will be included as we transition in 3Q and some of the comments that I made earlier about where we think that operating ratio might trend to. But we will start to see as we get into the back half of this year that core inflation start looking more on a per shipment basis. Like what we had expected through the first half of the year, it looked a little different. We've actually, in the second quarter, our cost per shipment excluding fuel was down slightly, certainly seeing a big increase in fuel cost right now, but that will normalize a little bit more as we get into the back half of the year."

I certainly believe that we continue to show the best-in-class service metrics. Our cargo claims ratio continued at 0.1% during the quarter. And that's really what we strive to do. It's the value proposition that we offer our customers, and it's something that we've got to pay very close attention to. But when you have the control, if you will, over managing the employees and the freight and having the equipment, it's certainly a lot easier to continue to have each of our employees bought into the overall success of the company. They understand over the years as we've improved our service metrics, what that's done in terms of the profitable growth that we produced and are totally bought in into delivering the very best service to our customers.

And we've got a pretty nominal dividend and just will continue to use the flexibility of the buyback program as we have in the past to return that excess capital back and maybe work down some of the cash balance that's on the balance sheet as well."

After some brief remarks, we'll be glad to take your questions. The OD team produced another record-breaking quarter and established new company records for quarterly revenue, operating ratio and earnings per diluted share. While the comparison of our numbers with the second quarter of 2020 is somewhat skewed due to the impact of the pandemic-related shutdowns last year, our second quarter business momentum this year helped drive the improvement in our revenue and profitability. 
Our revenue grew 47.2% to $1.3 billion, and our operating ratio improved 550 basis points to 72.3%. As a result, our earnings per diluted share grew 84.8% to $2.31. We achieved these results by continuing to execute on our long-term strategic plan. This plan has guided us through many economic cycles, and it is currently driving impressive growth in this strong market. Two key elements of this plan are delivering superior service at a fair price and consistently investing in capacity to help ensure that our network is never a limiting factor to our growth. We often discuss our unwavering commitment to providing our customers with superior service. This quarter, I would like to offer a deeper dive into how we think about capacity, given its relevance to the current environment. 
There are 3 major elements of capacity with an LTL: Doors at our service centers, our equipment and our people. Doors can be the most limiting form of capacity in the short term, which is why we try to stay several years ahead of our anticipated growth curve. We have invested $1.7 billion in our service center network over the past 10 years, which has allowed us to expand our door count by over 50%. Our current capital expenditure plan includes $275 million to further expand the capacity of our service center network, but we are willing to spend even more if we identify properties that are included in our long-term plan. 
Our commitment to the ongoing expansion of our service center network is important regardless of the macroeconomic environment due to the strong returns on capital for our business. We have consistently invested in Old Dominion's expansion, even in years when our market share trends have been flattish due to the confidence we have in our long-term market share potential. Although expanding the capacity of service centers takes a significant amount of time, demand trends can change very quickly in our industry, which is why we have historically been proactive with respect to our expansion efforts. 
This unique strategy has created a large capacity advantage for us in the marketplace, which becomes most apparent to shippers and tight environments like this year. We estimate that we currently have 15% to 20% excess capacity within our service center network, and we expect to open several new facilities during the second half of this year. As a result, the capacity of our overall service center network is in good shape, although we continue to focus on the needs of certain locations to help ensure we are keeping up with increased opportunities for growth. We are prepared to address these needs as well as any other elements of capacity that need to be expanded, as it appears that current demand trends will continue into 2022. We believe the domestic economy is strengthening for both our industrial and retail-related customers, and we expect additional growth in volumes based on current economic forecast as well as customer feedback. We also continue to see accelerating trends with our revenue. We have exceeded our normal sequential trends for each quarter since the cliff event that affected the second quarter of 2020. 
This outperformance has continued with our month-to-date revenue for July 2021 as well. While we feel good about our service center network, we have faced challenges with the other elements of capacity this year. There have been some delays with equipment deliveries that have caused us to continue to operate older units that were intended to be replaced. We are fortunate to have this as an option due to the fact where we have one of the youngest fleets in our industry. While our suppliers are somewhat behind schedule, we do believe that we will receive each unit that we have ordered this year. These new units will supplement our current pool of equipment and are expected to satisfy our equipment needs through the second half of this year. 
The capacity of our people continues to be our biggest need to support ongoing growth. We were successful during the second quarter with our hiring efforts and actually exceeded our goal for the period. We added over 1,100 full-time employees between March and June, and we expect to add another 1,000 full-time employees during the third quarter of this year. We will continue to use third-party purchase transportation to supplement the capacity of our people and our fleet until those 2 elements of capacity catch up with the growth in our volume. Regardless of whether it is our employees and equipment or a third party moving the freight, we remained focused on providing best-in-class service to our customers. 
As I previously said, providing superior service at a fair price and having capacity to stay ahead of our growth curve are 2 key pillars to our long-term strategic plan. The centerpiece of our plan though remains our people. Our OD family of employees is committed to servicing our customers while also growing our business. As a result, we believe we are better positioned than any other carrier to take advantage of the opportunity for further profitable growth and increase shareholder value over the long term. 
Thank you for joining us this morning, and now Adam will discuss our second quarter financial results in greater detail."

Old Dominion's revenue growth of 47.2% in the second quarter included a 28.1% increase in LTL tons and a 14.9% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight. Excluding fuel surcharges, LTL revenue per hundredweight increased",765,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue growth of 47.2% in the second quarter included a 28.1% increase in LTL tons and a 14.9% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight. Excluding fuel surcharges, LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 10.3%, reflecting the success of our yield improvement initiatives as well as changes in the mix of our freight. While the growth in our revenue and volumes reflects an easier comparison with the second quarter of 2020, the sequential acceleration in our revenue during the second quarter was once again well above normal sequential trends. On a sequential basis, second quarter LTL shipments per day increased 12.1% over the first quarter of 2021 as compared to a 10-year average sequential increase of 7.6%. LTL tons per day increased 9.7% as compared to a 10-year average sequential increase of 7.9%. These 10-year average trends excluded our 2020 metrics for more normalized comparison. While both our shipments and tons outperformed our long-term averages, the discrepancy between our shipment and tonnage trends is a result of the decrease in our LTL weight per shipment. 
We have made operational changes over the past few quarters, mainly through pricing actions to limit the number of heavy weighted and larger, harder-to-handle types of shipments in our network that are typically more transactional in nature. We increased these efforts during the second quarter, given the ongoing tightness in our industry to preserve capacity for our customers' traditional LTL shipments. At this point in July, with only a few days remaining in the month, our revenue per day is trending higher by approximately 35% when compared to July 2020. The year-over-year revenue comparison gets tougher for us in the third quarter as our revenue per day turned positive in August 2020 and increased overall for the third quarter of 2020. We will provide actual revenue-related details for July in our second quarter Form 10-Q. 
The operating ratio for the second quarter improved 550 basis points to a company record 72.3%, with improvement in both our direct operating cost and overhead expenses as a percent of revenue. This improvement was essentially in line with the target we discussed on our first quarter earnings call. Overhead-related cost as a percent of revenue improved 490 basis points due primarily to the operating leverage created by the quality of our revenue growth. Much of the overall improvement in overhead as a percent of revenue related to our depreciation and wage and benefit costs for our sales and administrative employees. 
Within our direct operating cost, the wage and benefit cost for our drivers, platform employees and fleet technicians improved due primarily to an improvement in the overall efficiency of our operations. This improvement more than offset the increases in operating supplies and expenses, which reflects the rising cost of diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products as well as the increased utilization of purchased transportation to supplement our workforce. While we will continue to add employees during the second half of this year to support our anticipated growth, we believe we can effectively balance our direct operating costs with revenue as we continue to focus on productivity and ultimately, reduce our reliance on purchased transportation. 
Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $198 million and $508.3 million for the second quarter and first half of 2021, respectively, while capital expenditures were $155.1 million and $206.1 million for the same periods. We returned $63.2 million of capital to shareholders during the second quarter and utilized $395.4 million of cash through the first half of this year for both our dividend and share repurchase programs. 
This year-to-date total for share repurchases includes 68.8 million that is deferred until the third quarter when the final settlement occurs on our current accelerated share repurchase agreement. We announced this morning that our Board has approved a new share repurchase program that provides us with the authorization to repurchase up to $2 billion of our outstanding stock. We intend to fund this program with cash flows from operations and existing cash to continue our focus of returning excess capital to our shareholders. Our first priority for capital spending, however, will continue to be strategic investments in capital expenditures to support the long-term profitable growth of our business. Our annual effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2021 was 26% as compared to 25.7% in the second quarter of 2020, and we currently anticipate our effective tax rate to be 26.0% for the third quarter. 
This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time."

Adam, could you talk about -- you referenced the July revenue per day being up 35%. How does that compare relative to normal seasonality?

And then when we think about the operating ratio, given we're seeing inflationary cost pressures across the supply chain, you guys are talking about hiring an additional 1,000 folks in the third quarter. How should we think about operating ratio trends in the third quarter versus the 2Q relative to normal seasonality, which I think calls for some very modest degradation, if I'm thinking about that right?"

Revenue per day basis, obviously, we've still got a few important days to close out the month, but we're trending very favorably at this point for the month of July. Our revenue per day at this point is a little bit stronger than what our normal sequential trends would indicate, and it really just follows the pattern that we've seen over the last 4 quarters that we referenced. We've exceeded normal sequential trends on a quarterly basis and really see no reason at this point why that would change as we go into the third quarter. 
The market continues to be really tight. The feedback that we're getting from customers, we just continue to see the service advantage and capacity advantage that we have in the marketplaces is winning share for us. And so we're trying to do all the things, as we referenced in our prepared remarks, to continue to prepare for further growth and to provide best-in-class service to our customers. So we'll continue to do all those elements to get prepared. And as we get through the balance of this year and really continue to try to position the company for 2022. 
With respect to the margin question, we typically see about a 50 basis point increase in the operating ratio from the second to the third quarter. And I think that we'll see somewhere in that same ballpark 50 to 70 basis points maybe. So kind of flattish as we go from the second quarter. I consider that flattish, but just a slight increase, we typically see and have our wage increase is effective the 1st of September. We're a little behind schedule on some of our equipment deliveries, as Greg mentioned as well. So that means that we'll have a little bit more depreciation hitting us in the third quarter than typically where it would have been loaded into the first half of the year. So a few factors like that, that may come on board, but certainly, continuing to see strength as we work our way into the third quarter."

And obviously, you guys are expecting the current strength in the market to continue well into 2022, if I'm quoting you correctly. But the investments you're making in your business should position you to take market share. 
And I think when you look at the market more broadly,  how are you thinking about secular growth within LTL, given its leverage -- increasing leverage to e-commerce and the importance of e-commerce, middle mile e-commerce demand to overall LTL growth over the next several years. Could you maybe talk about that for a moment, Greg? Because it seems like that's something that could really lift tonnage in the broader LTL industry and you guys are in a great position to capitalize on that?"

But I will say this, we've got some 9 -- if I looked at it correctly, we've got 9 facilities that we're trying to open in the back half of this year. I'm not sure we'll get all 9 of them open, but we will get several of them between now and the end of the year. And the others should come early in '22. And we have some 1 dozen or 12 service centers, where we're adding doors capacity. So we're working on continuing to grow our capacity just as quickly as we can. And besides that, those are just the projects that are underway. That's not counting all the things that we're trying to accomplish with land purchases and those kind of things.

We actually use quite a bit more in the month of June as we work through the end of the quarter. The strength that we typically see there, we actually had to step up our utilization of it somewhat, and we expect it to be actually probably a little bit higher in the third quarter than the 3.3% that we used in 2Q. But I think that as we continue to be successful with bringing people on board that we'll be in the position to hopefully through the fourth quarter and as we transition into 1Q of next year to be able to increasingly use our people and our equipment and reduce that reliance. But because of the strength of the topline, we just had to continue to pull that lever of using the purchase transportation to continue to serve our customers. 
And so that's certainly something that we can continue to do through the third quarter, and -- but ultimately, as you know, our strategy is to try to have everything in source from a domestic line haul standpoint, and that's where we ultimately want to get back to. So it's just because of the strength of the topline. We've had to use it a little bit longer through the year than we had originally intended."

Obviously, when the pricing environment is strong, like it is right now, that provides a lift to everyone and supports our own pricing initiatives. But I think we have a differentiated approach to pricing, and we've seen that, and it's really been the foundation for why we produce such long-term profitable growth. We have a strategy of looking at our cost inflation, and then we try to target increases in our revenue per shipment to give us a cost plus pricing. And that formulates the approach every year goes into our generate increase when we push that out, it goes into what we try to achieve from a contract renewal standpoint as well. 
With that said, each account must stand on its own from an individual profitability standpoint. And so we look at each account on an individual basis and what the cost inputs are for that particular account and what our pricing needs to look like to provide an appropriate return for us. And I think we've got really good consistency across our book of business. I think we saw that last year and the disruption in particular in the second quarter when a large percentage of our business shifted to larger national accounts. I think there was a concern by some on the street about what that would do to margins. And we went through the second quarter last year with a 15% decrease in revenue, a change in the mix of our business, but we were able to still improve our operating ratio with the pricing actions and the cost control measures that we had in place as well. 
So we're going to stick to our long-term consistent approach and continue to push for cost plus pricing because it's important for us to continue to expand our capacity. We're one of the few carriers that really has invested over the long term. As Greg mentioned this morning, we've invested and expanded our door count over the last 10 years by over 50%, and that supported about a 50% improvement in shipments per day over that same time frame. 
So we're uniquely positioned to continue to gain share in a market that continues to somewhat at least from the reports we get on the public carriers. The number of service centers over that 10-year period has stayed about the same or reduce slightly. So it's a good spot for us to be able to continue to take advantage of opportunities. Certainly, we're going to do it with price, but we should see the volumes come through and improve density as well. And as you know, that density and yield formula produces long-term improvement in our operating ratio, and so we got further room to improve from where we are today."

Each one have talked about increasing pricing to improve margins. So again, that's something that will certainly help with our pricing initiatives. If you've got every other carrier that's going out and trying to raise rates. So we'll see if there are any other transactions, certainly the market is very consolidated, as you know, and we don't expect any new entrants in terms of just new carrier. It's -- any changes have been new players by way of acquisitions. So we'll continue to watch and see how some of the new owners manage those other businesses. And in the meantime, if that creates great opportunity for us, that's typically what we see as there becomes a little freight churn. And we either get freight directly or in some cases, just indirectly as the turn within the industry happens.
But we will continue to work with our customers. And if we're a common carrier with a customer that has got one of these other entities, our sales team is always in there trying to identify freight opportunities for us. And so in some cases, that's what creates some market share opportunity for us, but we've got multiple sources of how we win share. And we certainly believe that we've got a long runway for growth ahead of us, and we'll continue to execute on that front. 
And in regard to service center availability, we haven't necessarily seen anything at this point in terms of reducing the number of service centers for many of the other big public carriers. And certainly, we're -- we've got our eyes out and would be willing to look at any opportunities because obviously, in our long-term plans, we continue to have a pretty long list of areas that we want to expand to. So we're at 248 service centers today and think that we've got a list of sort of 35 or 40 locations on our long-term plan that we want to continue to add to the network and support additional market share opportunities for us.

Or how do you think about that inflation impact on your business? Or perhaps, just the jobs and quality of culture you have are a real differentiator that help you. But maybe if you could offer some thoughts on tight labor market? And is there an impact or a coming impact?"

There are folks out there. It is more difficult than it's been. And I think I've mentioned that on our last call or two, it's a little harder to acquire people than it used to be, but we're having success. We're working extremely hard at it. And I think I mentioned that before, they're there. You just have to work harder to get them, and that's what we're doing, and that's why we have had some success. But as far as the dollars go, surely, we have to respond based on the market. We give a wage increase every year. As Adam mentioned before, we give it in September, and we certainly plan to do that this year. And it may possibly be better than it's been in the past. So yes, you have to respond, but you have to work at what your needs are. You have to work to fix them. So that's what we've been trying to accomplish, but it's an ongoing effort for sure."

Just looking at the average salary, wages and benefits number that we publish and dividing that by the average number of employees can somewhat being skewed, if you will.

Just looking at the average salary, wages and benefits number that we publish and dividing that by the average number of employees can somewhat being skewed, if you will. And I think that's driving some of that quarter-over-quarter increase, thinking about the actions that we had to take last year and then the actions that we're taking now. But to try to give you a little bit more color, I can say that when we started this year, we talked about our core inflation being somewhere around 4% on a per shipment basis, excluding fuel.  And that included the normal 3% to 3.5% increase that we give. That's what we did last September, and certainly, we will be giving an increase. We haven't announced that to employees yet. And so I want to hold back on sharing any color before it goes out. But as Greg mentioned, we connect the success of the company with our employees personal financial success and certainly, feel that they will be rewarded for their efforts and for how well the company is performing. 
Looking into the second quarter in particular, though, and we kind of expected this, we did have an increase in some of our fringe benefit cost over the period. That rate -- that fringe rate was quite a bit higher than where it was in the second quarter of last year and quite a bit higher, frankly, than where we were in the first quarter. And that's some of the anomaly that comes along with the growth in employees. 
Our employees have been working very hard, working more hours. And as you add to your employee count, if you've got 4 employees that were working 50 hours a week and now you got 5 that are working 40, that changes the dynamics. The same amount of hours are there to be worked and the wage looks the same, but you got the benefit cost for that fifth employee that increases there. So that's something that we've seen historically when we're growing headcount that you get a little bit of a lag effect with those benefits, and some of that will continue into the third quarter as well. I'd expect that we might have a little bit higher fringe percentage rate than coming into the year I targeted and believe we'd be somewhere around 34%. That is our fringe benefit as a percentage of salaries and wages. We were a little north of that during the second quarter, and I expect us to be a little bit north of that as well as we transition into the third. 
But we're offsetting those were obviously costs that we overcame in 2Q, given the strong topline revenue performance and the leverage that creates on other costs. And then we've got the base, a larger base of employees to thereby grow from. So  it's all good, and it's all included. Our expectations will be included as we transition in 3Q and some of the comments that I made earlier about where we think that operating ratio might trend to. But we will start to see as we get into the back half of this year that core inflation start looking more on a per shipment basis. Like what we had expected through the first half of the year, it looked a little different. We've actually, in the second quarter, our cost per shipment excluding fuel was down slightly, certainly seeing a big increase in fuel cost right now, but that will normalize a little bit more as we get into the back half of the year."

I certainly believe that we continue to show the best-in-class service metrics. Our cargo claims ratio continued at 0.1% during the quarter. And that's really what we strive to do. It's the value proposition that we offer our customers, and it's something that we've got to pay very close attention to. But when you have the control, if you will, over managing the employees and the freight and having the equipment, it's certainly a lot easier to continue to have each of our employees bought into the overall success of the company. They understand over the years as we've improved our service metrics, what that's done in terms of the profitable growth that we produced and are totally bought in into delivering the very best service to our customers. So we want to continue to keep on that promise, if you will. And I think every employee is continuing to be motivated by delivering the very best service to our customers."

A lot of our top 50 customers, we've got a pretty healthy mix of big 3PL accounts that are in there. And we've seen growth last year, especially during the pandemic, as they were helping their customers out. We were continuing to get a good amount of freight coming out of those 3PL customers. So we've got very good relationships. Most are strategic in nature. We don't have as many relationships with the 3PLs that are more transactionally minded and now trying to sell cheap rates because that's just not us and doesn't necessarily fit with our profile. But I think when they're out selling value to their customers, I think they can help in regard to independently proven our value equation and looking at our on-time performance and our claims ratio in regard to inventory management and so forth, and how may be paying for a little bit more upfront for Old Dominion service can deliver cost savings, if you think about things on a total cost of transportation standpoint for their customers. 
So it's been a good independent source coming in to support revenue growth, and we'd expect that we continue to see some growth with them as well into the future."

After some brief remarks, we'll be glad to take your questions. During the third quarter, the Old Dominion team produced strong profitable growth that included new company records for quarterly revenue and profitability. The third quarter of 2021 was our third straight quarter with double-digit revenue growth and the fifth straight quarter of double-digit growth in earnings per diluted share. While our revenue results reflect the unprecedented demand for our best-in-class service, our ability to grow at these impressive rates is the result of our long-term commitment to consistently invest in capacity. We continue to have available network capacity as well as best-in-class service, both of which are qualities that differentiate us within our industry and provide a distinct competitive advantage for Old Dominion. These qualities have also supported our ability to win market share and produce profitable growth over the long term.
With continuing strength in the macroeconomic environment and limited industry capacity, we believe demand for transportation services will continue through the fourth quarter of this year and into 2022. As a result, we expect that our business level momentum that began in the third quarter of 2020 will also continue. To take advantage of these opportunities and produce further profitable growth, we believe that it will be important for us to continue to execute on the long-term strategic plan that we have operated under for many years. This strategy focuses on delivering a value proposition of superior service at a fair price to our customers, which generally creates the capital for us to further invest and the capacity and technology to support our customers' supply chain needs.
Our most important investment, however, will continue to be in the OD family of employees. Our people are critical to our success as they work tirelessly each day to provide service, value to our customers. We added over 1,000 new full-time employees between June and September of this year. These additions resulted in a 20.9% increase in our average full-time headcount as compared to the third quarter of 2020. While we have grown the OD family this year, the capacity of our people continues to be our biggest need to support future growth. As a result, we expect that we will continue to add new full-time employees to our team during the fourth quarter and next year. We believe further additions will be necessary to prepare for anticipated growth and to also reduce the use of third-party purchase transportation. We expect to use third-party purchase transportation during the fourth quarter at levels similar to the third quarter. While we would like to reduce this level of utilization, we must continue to supplement the capacity of our people and our fleet in support of our top line revenue performance.
We hold the third parties that we work with the same standards of excellence and our team remains fully committed to providing best-in-class service to our customers. Our customers' expectation for excellence do not change regardless of how we move their freight. And given the supply chain challenges that many of them are currently facing, we want them to have complete confidence in our ability to deliver. Old Dominion sets the standard in our industry with our ability to provide superior service and service center capacity to support our customers' growth. As a result, we believe we are in a better position than any other carrier to win additional market share and further increase shareholder value over the long term. Thank you for joining us this morning, and now Adam will discuss our third quarter financial results in greater detail."

Old Dominion's revenue grew 32.3% in the third quarter to $1.4 billion, and our operating ratio improved to 72.6%.

Old Dominion's revenue grew 32.3% in the third quarter to $1.4 billion, and our operating ratio improved to 72.6%. The combination of these changes led to a 44.4% increase in earnings per diluted share to $2.47 for the quarter. Our revenue growth was balanced between LTL volumes and yield, both of which were supported by the strong domestic economy and capacity issues within the industry.
Our LTL tons increased 13.7% and LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 15.7%, which also reflects the impact on our fuel surcharge program from the increase in diesel fuel prices. Excluding fuel surcharges, LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 10.1% as a result of the continued success with our yield improvement initiatives as well as changes in the mix of our freight. On a sequential basis, third quarter LTL shipments per day increased 3.2% over the second quarter of 2021 as compared to a 10-year average sequential increase of 2.9%. LTL tons per day increased 1.0% as compared to a 10-year average sequential increase of 1.9%. These 10-year average trends exclude our 2020 metrics for a more normalized comparison. At this point in October, with only a few work days remaining in the month, our revenue per day has increased by approximately 33% to 35% when compared to October of 2020. We will provide the actual revenue related details for October in our third quarter Form 10-Q.  The operating ratio for the third quarter improved 190 basis points to 72.6% as a result of the operating leverage created by our revenue growth as well as our continued focus on operating efficiencies. Many of our cost categories improved as a percent of revenue during the quarter, although our operating supplies and expenses increased 200 basis points due primarily to the rising cost of diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products.
As a percent of revenue, salaries, wages and benefits improved 320 basis points between the periods compared. Our productive labor cost within this expense category improved 200 basis points which more than offset the 130 basis point increase in purchase transportation. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $364.3 million and $872.6 million for the third quarter and first 9 months of 2021, respectively, while capital expenditures were $178.6 million and $384.7 million for the same periods. We noted in our release this morning that our capital expenditures are now estimated to be $565 million for this year. The $40 million decrease from our prior estimate is mainly due to the timing of large real estate projects that will be pushed into next year. We will provide further details about our 2022 capital expenditure plan with our fourth quarter earnings release. But at this time, we expect to increase our expenditures to support our ongoing market share initiatives and to reduce the average age of our fleet. We continue to return capital to shareholders during the third quarter through our dividend and share repurchase programs, including the $250 million accelerated share repurchase agreement that will expire no later than March of 2022.
For the first 9 months of this year, the cash utilized for share return programs included $599 million for share repurchases and $69.4 million of cash dividends. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2021 was 25.2% as compared to 24.8% in the third quarter of 2020. We currently anticipate our effective tax rate to be 25.8% for the fourth quarter. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time."

One of the things driving the change in shipments versus tonnage as well to point out first is the fact that we continue to have a little bit lower -- or weight per shipment rather that's a change that we've talked about in recent quarters as we've",372,"Sure. One of the things driving the change in shipments versus tonnage as well to point out first is the fact that we continue to have a little bit lower -- or weight per shipment rather that's a change that we've talked about in recent quarters as we've continued to focus on more traditional LTL shipments and try to work out some of these larger, harder-to-handle type of shipments that are more transactional in nature generally within our system. So that had a little bit of an impact overall and that discrepancy, if you will, between the tons and the shipments.
When we look at shipments, they were on a sequential basis, just above what the 10-year trend would have been at 3.2% versus the 2.9%. So a little discrepancy there. But back to the point of your question, when we looked at really the volumes in general, but tonnage and shipments, as we work through the quarter, we were right in line with normal sequential trends in July versus June but then had a pretty big step back in August. Our tons per day in August decreased 1.6% from July. The 10-year average change is a 0.5% increase there. And a big reason for that was the fact that we started seeing across the country, the rise in COVID cases and just the ongoing labor issues that are affecting many customers and warehouses throughout the country. That certainly had an effect on our business directly and indirectly really. So that was an issue that caused us, in some cases, to not be able to pick up right when we couldn't be able to deliver. And so there was certainly a ripple effect, I think, throughout the economy, and reflected in our business results as well. But as cases started to improve and some of that pickup back in the labor participation rates, we saw a significant recovery. Really, it began towards the end of August, but really accelerated through the month of September such that our tons per day in September were up 5.2% over August versus the 10-year average change of 3.7%. So certainly made up for that and then some as we accelerated through the end of the quarter."

But as the follow-up kind of wanted to get a sense of with the context of tonnage and obviously with very strong pricing environment, but obviously, you're hiring at a rapid clip, and I would imagine there's some inflation on that side.

Well, as Greg mentioned in our prepared remarks, we will continue to focus on bringing on new employees as we go through the fourth quarter, and it's something that, frankly, we've been doing all year. If you look at kind of the change in our volumes and change in people exceeded what our normal sequential trends have been, I think, for 5 straight quarters. So that's something that we think will continue given the strength of the demand environment that we certainly feel very confident that, that will extend into 2022. So it's important for us to continue to really build up all the elements of capacity that we need in our business, and that's people, fleet and the service center side to be able to accommodate our customers' expectations for growth and be able to continue to deliver best-in-class service to them.
With that said, I still feel good about the performance in the third quarter. We were pretty much right in line with sequential operating ratio performance was right in line with normal trends. And that factored in a lot of costs that were coming on board. We'll still face some of those cost challenges. But we would expect it to be right in line with what our normal sequential change is from 3Q to 4Q. And that's typically in a 200 to 250 basis point increase from the third quarter. I think that we should be able to be in that range while we'll have some costs continuing to come at us both in relation to the investment in new employees. We were still taking delivery on some equipment. So we've got some cost pressures there, but we've still got incredible top line revenue performance that's helping to offset those. And certainly, yield performance has continued to be strong. But as you alluded to with the change in the -- our volumes and overall revenue for October, we are performing well above what the normal sequential trend would otherwise be on the volume side and pricing strength and certainly continuing as well."

I mean it certainly takes people and trucks, but that's the longest term form of capacity and the hardest to put in place, and we've been certainly consistent with our investments over the years. And we'll continue on that front as we finish out this year and then transition into next year. But that's about at the same point that we were when we finished last quarter as well. So despite the strong sequential volume performance that we had in 3Q, we've been able to keep that excess capacity level at about the same spot. So we're going to keep after it and keep adding to those capacity levels. And certainly, as Greg mentioned, we've got to really continue to be focused in the short term on continuing to add people into the mix. And that's probably been our biggest need all year as we work through the balance of the year, but it really takes all 3 forms.
We came into this year. We don't really know exactly what our competitors' strategies are, but we came into this year believing that we had more capacity than anyone and that really goes back to our 10-year investment that we've made. We've expanded our door count by over 50% over the last 10 years. We've seen very little investment from some of the others and maybe a service center here and there, but nothing at any major scale. And so that's created an environment for us to be able to win more market share than anyone else. And certainly, we believe we've still got best-in-class service. So we've got a service advantage in the marketplace, and we've got more capacity than anyone else, and that gives us a capacity advantage in the marketplace.
And that usually produces pretty phenomenal results when we get into these strong demand periods like we've been in this year and what we expect to see for next year as well. So it gives us a lot of confidence to say we're the best positioned carrier to continue to produce profitable growth and increase shareholder value even from the levels from which we're currently operating."

We certainly start out. I mean we're covering all markets today. So when we open a new facility, it already starts with a good book of business, if you will, and is pretty much profitable immediately. And so that also frees up some capacity in the existing service center that we moved zip codes and freight out of into the new location. So that's been part of our expansion process over the years. And certainly, we've invested a lot of dollars in expanding our network and that 50% increase in door count that I talked about earlier. But that kind of all goes into it. And it's why when we talk about our yield management philosophy that we focus on getting an increase every year and our revenue per shipment to exceed what our cost per shipment inflation will be but also to support the continued investment in our service center network. And as supply teams become more sophisticated, customers are leveraging our network to their benefit as we're processing freight through our network of about 250 service centers today. So it's something that we're effectively purchasing real estate capacity on behalf of our customers, and we're one of the only that's really making the type of material investments that we have.
So it's important for us to continue to keep that within the context of yield management so that we can afford these service centers. They're becoming more and more expensive as we're competing with different parties to go out and find the real estate to continue to support our growth. But certainly, we've had great success in the past. We've got a good team that's out that's always trying to stay ahead of the growth curve. And at the levels where we are, we feel like we've got to probably stay a little bit further ahead of the curve than we have in years past. But we've got a good plan. We've got a list of about 35 to 40 service centers that we think we want to add to the network in due time and probably won't stop there. We feel like we've got a very long runway for growth ahead of us, given what our expectations for growth in the industry, given the consolidation in the industry and general lack of investment by other carriers. It's certainly a great spot for us to be and to continue to be in a good position to win market share."

We don't want to give any specific guidance per se, but the balance of the revenue growth in October is pretty consistent, pretty split evenly between yield and tonnage like it was in the third quarter. Those 2 numbers were pretty close. On the yield side, obviously, recently, fuel prices have continued to increase, so that overall revenue per hundredweight metric will continue to reflect that number. But again, we're still seeing considerable strength on the volume side as well. Certainly, as we go through the period and you think about the comparisons, the comparisons certainly get a little bit tougher each month as we work through the fourth quarter. It was -- last year, our volumes were accelerating month after month such that the third quarter was the really strong outperformance versus what our normal trends have been. Typically, we see strong performance in for 5 or 6 quarters like that and then kind of revert to normal sequential trends, which, by the way, reflect a whole lot of market share gains. Over the past 10 years, when you think about our shipments per day averaging about a 50% increase versus where we were 10 years ago. So there's a lot of market share gains that are in those numbers.
But overall, I think if you just were to say that we operated on normal sequential trends, that puts us with some pretty strong numbers on the volume side next year. And we don't want to say that's what the forecast is because right now, we haven't seen any let down with respect to demand. So it's hard to call that that we're going to see any slowdown and certainly based on customer conversations and everything that we see and read, we feel like this unprecedented level of demand that we've seen this year will continue into next year, especially if the other carriers are continuing to be capacity constrained. It certainly could continue to just push more and more volumes our way. And so we just got to be in position to continue to bring it on board and make sure we're focused on profitable growth, which is what our long-term focus has been and continue to take care of our customers and offering them solutions in various ways, be it handling all their LTL shipments using our truckload brokerage division to help them out with any truckload moves as best we can. And then the grades division that we have in our non-LTL as well, which is mainly focused in the Southeast is seeing a lot of strength there. So it all comes back to building the relationship with your customer and trying to continue to serve them as best you can, and we're going to continue with that focus as we transition into 2022, but not keeping our eye off the ball with respect to the fourth quarter as well. We still got a lot of work to do to finish out this year with strength."

So we're really proud of what we've achieved over the last few years, and we feel confident to say that we know we've got room for further improvement. I think we'll wait until we get to the fourth quarter to really start talking about kind of what our next target will be. But again, if you look over the long term, we've averaged 100 to 150 basis point improvement in the operating ratio each year, and that sort of gets back to that delta between our revenue and cost per shipment. So a lot go into each of those 2 numbers, us managing our cost and continuing to focus on productivity and offsetting all the costs that go along with expanding our model and that creates some short-term cost headwinds.
But when you look at the long-term performance for what we've done over the past 10 years, producing an average of 10% to 11% change in revenue each year and about a 25% average annual increase in our EPS, that's driven considerable share value over that 10-year period, and we want to continue to do that as we look out into the next 10-year horizon as well.

That's just the calculation of all the work that we do in sort of building out the balancing the revenue growth and margin improvement opportunities. We had used that long-term target of 25 really as an inverse to say we were working towards a 75 operating ratio goal. And that's really more of what we talk about within the company for where we think we can take the operating ratio. So I think we'll give a little bit more color on that when we get to our fourth quarter call.
Obviously, based on kind of what I mentioned earlier about the target for the fourth quarter, that puts us at an annual operating ratio somewhere around 74%. So we certainly looks like we will be able to beat that 75 OR target this year. And as it comes down to incremental margins, I think this will go down as our biggest incremental margin year in our history. And when we've talked about the cost structure with you before, we've laid out kind of the cost structure is balanced between our variable and fixed costs and how we can operate at a 35 to 40 incremental margin in a particular quarter in a short period of time. But we don't want to get overly fixated on incremental margins because, again, we're focusing on the investments that are required to drive long-term growth.
We don't measure the success of our business based on how strong and incremental can be. It's really some of those longer-term numbers that I referenced earlier. And we want to be able to repeat that because we think there's a lot of growth opportunity left within our business. And so that's going to be the focus. But it requires investment, and that can create some short-term headwinds. And if that's the only lens that you look at things through, you miss out on a ton of opportunity to drive shareholder value. And so we're going to keep that long-term focus, continue to make the necessary investments. And if that drives the incremental down a little bit, one, I'm pretty pleased with the 33. I don't think that's anything that needs that for the quarter and producing a very strong 72.6 operating ratio. But based on that cost structure breakdown, we feel confident in saying that we certainly can drive the operating ratio meaningfully lower. And we'll continue to -- whenever we get to whatever that next threshold might be, we'll continue to look at managing the business and how the algorithm works. And it's not to say that whatever the next stopping point will be the final stopping point. We think that there's a lot of opportunity left here. So we'll just -- we'll keep marching forward. The algorithm certainly has worked for us in the past, and we think can continue to work for us into the future."

So certainly, that type of environment is supportive of our pricing initiatives. For us, it's more of a long-term consistent approach and one that we think is fair but equitable. It's one that we can sit down with our customers and talk about what our cost inflation is and what our needs are in terms of reinvesting in the business to either improve customer service or investing in ways that ultimately are going to reduce cost.
So it's a win-win situation for both us and our customers. And so we try to target our cost inflation and then some, and we've been pretty successful with that. And so that will continue to be the focus. But with that said, we're always focusing on the individual account profitability. And so when you're in these types of environments, there are some accounts that their operating ratios are not as good as others. And those are the types of accounts that really over the last couple of years that we've had to address some issues and there's different ways to improve yield. It's not always through price. And so that's where you sit down and you build on your relationship together and work through different initiatives that ultimately can create the same results of yield improvement there. So certainly, given the expectation that the demand trends will remain very strong and given the lack of capacity that we believe is in the industry, and that's mainly grounded in the feedback that we're getting from customers, we certainly expect there to be a strong pricing environment for the industry next year, for which we will be able to benefit."

But typically, we see a little bit of softness, if you will, just about 0.5% to 1% drop in our revenue per day performance from 3Q to 4Q. And so based on the current performance, we're definitely outperforming October, if you will. So we'll see where where that puts us for the end of the quarter. But we're doing a lot of things with respect to managing costs. We talk a lot about the labor cost, and that's probably 65% of total cost in our salary wages and benefits line. And we've seen a lot of productivity this year, especially within our line haul and our pickup delivery operations.
We've lost some productivity on the dock. So I think that the fourth quarter and the first quarter, that will be some opportunity that we continue to focus on. It's not that we haven't been focused on it. But I think that, that's something that will help on the labor front if we can reduce the levels of purchase transportation and manage more freight with our people and our equipment. Certainly think that, that will be beneficial as well given the rates that we're having to pay. And we're using about the same level in October as we were in the third quarter. We hope that we'll be able to reduce that level of utilization a little bit. But at this point, the top line trends have dictated all year.
I think every quarterly call, we've had for the last 4 quarters, we've talked about wanting to be able to reduce that expense category. But the top line trends have really dictated that continued utilization. So we'll see where that balances out. But there's just a a lot of cost management that is here within the business and that we're focused on as well as continuing to see that strong top line performance that will help offset some of this inflation as we're bringing on new people. And we'll continue to see our benefit costs in the third quarter were higher and expect that, that will likely continue as we're continuing to balance out the number of hours worked by our employees. As we increase that workforce, there's certainly going to be more incremental benefit costs that will be incurred. But we feel good about all the other contributing factors to help offset some of that cost inflation."

And I don't want to get into too many details until we're really ready to roll out what the full CapEx plan will be.

The claims management is a big part of that. And we continue to have cargo claims ratio at 0.1% to 0.2%. So that's something that we're really proud of and more motivated that we make sure our employees understand that, that is a part of the value equation. That's part of the piece of our yield management success over the years and a big differentiating factor between us and many of our competitors. So there may be a 6-month learning curve in place for people to come on to make sure they're effectively preventing claims and also the other piece of it is maximizing our load factor to ensure that they're utilizing the entire cube. That's our biggest cost element is line haul.
And so we want to make sure that they're more focused on those key factors, if you will, versus just the number of shipments per hour that we might manage on the dock. But that gives you opportunity as those new people are now more seasoned. Certainly, that's why we're looking at seeing some of that productivity opportunity as we turn the page into '22. And certainly, I would love to see some improvement as we finish out the balance of the year, but I think that, that will be a pretty good opportunity for us to drive some further cost improvement into next year."

After some brief remarks, we'll be glad to take your questions. During the third quarter, the Old Dominion team produced strong profitable growth that included new company records for quarterly revenue and profitability. 
The third quarter of 2021 was our third straight quarter with double-digit revenue growth and the fifth straight quarter of double-digit growth in earnings per diluted share. While our revenue results reflect the unprecedented demand for our best-in-class service, our ability to grow at these impressive rates is the result of our long-term commitment to consistently invest in capacity. 
We continue to have available network capacity as well as best-in-class service, both of which are qualities that differentiate us within our industry and provide a distinct competitive advantage for Old Dominion. These qualities have also supported our ability to win market share and produce profitable growth over the long term. 
With continuing strength in the macroeconomic environment and limited industry capacity, we believe demand for transportation services will continue through the fourth quarter of this year and into 2022. As a result, we expect that our business level momentum that began in the third quarter of 2020 will also continue. To take advantage of these opportunities and produce further profitable growth, we believe that it will be important for us to continue to execute on the long-term strategic plan that we have operated under for many years. This strategy focuses on delivering a value proposition of superior service at a fair price to our customers, which generally creates the capital for us to further invest and the capacity and technology to support our customers' supply chain needs. 
Our most important investment, however, will continue to be in the OD family of employees. Our people are critical to our success as they work tirelessly each day to provide service, value to our customers. We added over 1,000 new full-time employees between June and September of this year. These additions resulted in a 20.9% increase in our average full-time headcount as compared to the third quarter of 2020. 
While we have grown the OD family this year, the capacity of our people continues to be our biggest need to support future growth. As a result, we expect that we will continue to add new full-time employees to our team during the fourth quarter and next year. We believe further additions will be necessary to prepare for anticipated growth and to also reduce the use of third-party purchase transportation. 
We expect to use third-party purchase transportation during the fourth quarter at levels similar to the third quarter. While we would like to reduce this level of utilization, we must continue to supplement the capacity of our people and our fleet in support of our top line revenue performance. 
We hold the third parties that we work with the same standards of excellence and our team remains fully committed to providing best-in-class service to our customers. Our customers' expectation for excellence do not change regardless of how we move their freight. And given the supply chain challenges that many of them are currently facing, we want them to have complete confidence in our ability to deliver. 
Old Dominion sets the standard in our industry with our ability to provide superior service and service center capacity to support our customers' growth. As a result, we believe we are in a better position than any other carrier to win additional market share and further increase shareholder value over the long term. 
Thank you for joining us this morning, and now Adam will discuss our third quarter financial results in greater detail."

Old Dominion's revenue grew 32.3% in the third quarter to $1.4 billion, and our operating ratio improved to 72.6%.

Old Dominion's revenue grew 32.3% in the third quarter to $1.4 billion, and our operating ratio improved to 72.6%. The combination of these changes led to a 44.4% increase in earnings per diluted share to $2.47 for the quarter. Our revenue growth was balanced between LTL volumes and yield, both of which were supported by the strong domestic economy and capacity issues within the industry. 
Our LTL tons increased 13.7% and LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 15.7%, which also reflects the impact on our fuel surcharge program from the increase in diesel fuel prices. Excluding fuel surcharges, LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 10.1% as a result of the continued success with our yield improvement initiatives as well as changes in the mix of our freight. 
On a sequential basis, third quarter LTL shipments per day increased 3.2% over the second quarter of 2021 as compared to a 10-year average sequential increase of 2.9%. LTL tons per day increased 1.0% as compared to a 10-year average sequential increase of 1.9%. These 10-year average trends exclude our 2020 metrics for a more normalized comparison. 
At this point in October, with only a few work days remaining in the month, our revenue per day has increased by approximately 33% to 35% when compared to October of 2020. We will provide the actual revenue related details for October in our third quarter Form 10-Q. 
The operating ratio for the third quarter improved 190 basis points to 72.6% as a result of the operating leverage created by our revenue growth as well as our continued focus on operating efficiencies. Many of our cost categories improved as a percent of revenue during the quarter, although our operating supplies and expenses increased 200 basis points due primarily to the rising cost of diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products. 
As a percent of revenue, salaries, wages and benefits improved 320 basis points between the periods compared. Our productive labor cost within this expense category improved 200 basis points which more than offset the 130 basis point increase in purchase transportation. 
Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $364.3 million and $872.6 million for the third quarter and first 9 months of 2021, respectively, while capital expenditures were $178.6 million and $384.7 million for the same periods. We noted in our release this morning that our capital expenditures are now estimated to be $565 million for this year. 
The $40 million decrease from our prior estimate is mainly due to the timing of large real estate projects that will be pushed into next year. We will provide further details about our 2022 capital expenditure plan with our fourth quarter earnings release. But at this time, we expect to increase our expenditures to support our ongoing market share initiatives and to reduce the average age of our fleet. We continue to return capital to shareholders during the third quarter through our dividend and share repurchase programs, including the $250 million accelerated share repurchase agreement that will expire no later than March of 2022. 
For the first 9 months of this year, the cash utilized for share return programs included $599 million for share repurchases and $69.4 million of cash dividends. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2021 was 25.2% as compared to 24.8% in the third quarter of 2020. We currently anticipate our effective tax rate to be 25.8% for the fourth quarter. 
This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time."

I think they were a little bit below sequentially what is normal. And clearly, we saw a little bit of a deceleration in August before it seems like September picked back up. So can you talk a little bit about sort of business conditions in the quarter and maybe what we saw intra-quarter and kind of how that's played out as we moved here into early October?"

One of the things driving the change in shipments versus tonnage as well to point out first is the fact that we continue to have a little bit lower -- or weight per shipment rather that's a change that we've talked about in recent quarters as we've",372,"Sure. One of the things driving the change in shipments versus tonnage as well to point out first is the fact that we continue to have a little bit lower -- or weight per shipment rather that's a change that we've talked about in recent quarters as we've continued to focus on more traditional LTL shipments and try to work out some of these larger, harder-to-handle type of shipments that are more transactional in nature generally within our system. So that had a little bit of an impact overall and that discrepancy, if you will, between the tons and the shipments.
When we look at shipments, they were on a sequential basis, just above what the 10-year trend would have been at 3.2% versus the 2.9%. So a little discrepancy there. But back to the point of your question, when we looked at really the volumes in general, but tonnage and shipments, as we work through the quarter, we were right in line with normal sequential trends in July versus June but then had a pretty big step back in August. 
Our tons per day in August decreased 1.6% from July. The 10-year average change is a 0.5% increase there. And a big reason for that was the fact that we started seeing across the country, the rise in COVID cases and just the ongoing labor issues that are affecting many customers and warehouses throughout the country. That certainly had an effect on our business directly and indirectly really. 
So that was an issue that caused us, in some cases, to not be able to pick up right when we couldn't be able to deliver. And so there was certainly a ripple effect, I think, throughout the economy, and reflected in our business results as well. But as cases started to improve and some of that pickup back in the labor participation rates, we saw a significant recovery. Really, it began towards the end of August, but really accelerated through the month of September such that our tons per day in September were up 5.2% over August versus the 10-year average change of 3.7%. So certainly made up for that and then some as we accelerated through the end of the quarter."

And it seems like revenue per day in October would suggest that maybe that trend has continued. So kind of curious about that. But as the follow-up kind of wanted to get a sense of with the context of tonnage and obviously with very strong pricing environment, but obviously, you're hiring at a rapid clip, and I would imagine there's some inflation on that side. How do we think about the normal sequential cadence of operating ratio as we look into the fourth quarter?"

Well, as Greg mentioned in our prepared remarks, we will continue to focus on bringing on new employees as we go through the fourth quarter, and it's something that, frankly, we've been doing all year. If you look at kind of the change in our volumes and change in people, we've exceeded what our normal sequential trends have been, I think, for 5 straight quarters. 
So that's something that we think will continue given the strength of the demand environment that we certainly feel very confident that, that will extend into 2022. So it's important for us to continue to really build up all the elements of capacity that we need in our business, and that's people, fleet and the service center side to be able to accommodate our customers' expectations for growth and be able to continue to deliver best-in-class service to them.
With that said, I still feel good about the performance in the third quarter. We were pretty much right in line with sequential operating ratio performance was right in line with normal trends. And that factored in a lot of costs that were coming on board. We'll still face some of those cost challenges. But we would expect it to be right in line with what our normal sequential change is from 3Q to 4Q. 
And that's typically in a 200 to 250 basis point increase from the third quarter. I think that we should be able to be in that range while we'll have some costs continuing to come at us both in relation to the investment in new employees. We were still taking delivery on some equipment. So we've got some cost pressures there, but we've still got incredible top line revenue performance that's helping to offset those. And certainly, yield performance has continued to be strong. 
But as you alluded to with the change in the -- our volumes and overall revenue for October, we are performing well above what the normal sequential trend would otherwise be on the volume side and pricing strength is certainly continuing as well."

I mean it certainly takes people and trucks, but that's the longest term form of capacity and the hardest to put in place and we've been certainly consistent with our investments over the years. And we'll continue on that front as we finish out this year and then transition into next year. 
But that's about at the same point that we were when we finished last quarter as well. So despite the strong sequential volume performance that we had in 3Q, we've been able to keep that excess capacity level at about the same spot. So we're going to keep after it and keep adding to those capacity levels. And certainly, as Greg mentioned, we've got to really continue to be focused in the short term on continuing to add people into the mix. And that's probably been our biggest need all year as we work through the balance of the year, but it really takes all 3 forms.
We came into this year. We don't really know exactly what our competitors' strategies are, but we came into this year believing that we had more capacity than anyone and that really goes back to our 10-year investment that we've made. We've expanded our door count by over 50% over the last 10 years. We've seen very little investment from some of the others and maybe a service center here and there, but nothing at any major scale. And so that's created an environment for us to be able to win more market share than anyone else. 
And certainly, we believe we've still got best-in-class service. So we've got a service advantage in the marketplace, and we've got more capacity than anyone else, and that gives us a capacity advantage in the marketplace. And that usually produces pretty phenomenal results when we get into these strong demand periods like we've been in this year and what we expect to see for next year as well. 
So it gives us a lot of confidence to say we're the best positioned carrier to continue to produce profitable growth and increase shareholder value even from the levels from which we're currently operating."

We certainly start out. I mean we're covering all markets today. So when we open a new facility, it already starts with a good book of business, if you will, and is pretty much profitable immediately. And so that also frees up some capacity in the existing service center that we moved zip codes and freight out of into the new location. So that's been part of our expansion process over the years. 
And certainly, we've invested a lot of dollars in expanding our network and that 50% increase in door count that I talked about earlier. But that kind of all goes into it. And it's why when we talk about our yield management philosophy that we focus on getting an increase every year and our revenue per shipment to exceed what our cost per shipment inflation will be but also to support the continued investment in our service center network. 
And as supply teams become more sophisticated, customers are leveraging our network to their benefit as we're processing freight through our network of about 250 service centers today. So it's something that we're effectively purchasing real estate capacity on behalf of our customers, and we're one of the only that's really making the type of material investments that we have.
So it's important for us to continue to keep that within the context of yield management so that we can afford these service centers. They're becoming more and more expensive as we're competing with different parties to go out and find the real estate to continue to support our growth. But certainly, we've had great success in the past. We've got a good team that's out that's always trying to stay ahead of the growth curve. And at the levels where we are, we feel like we've got to probably stay a little bit further ahead of the curve than we have in years past. 
But we've got a good plan. We've got a list of about 35 to 40 service centers that we think we want to add to the network in due time and probably won't stop there. We feel like we've got a very long runway for growth ahead of us, given what our expectations for growth in the industry, given the consolidation in the industry and general lack of investment by other carriers. It's certainly a great spot for us to be and to continue to be in a good position to win market share."

We don't want to give any specific guidance per se, but the balance of the revenue growth in October is pretty consistent, pretty split evenly between yield and tonnage like it was in the third quarter.

We don't want to give any specific guidance per se, but the balance of the revenue growth in October is pretty consistent, pretty split evenly between yield and tonnage like it was in the third quarter. Those 2 numbers were pretty close. On the yield side, obviously, recently, fuel prices have continued to increase, so that overall revenue per hundredweight metric will continue to reflect that number. But again, we're still seeing considerable strength on the volume side as well. 
Certainly, as we go through the period and you think about the comparisons, the comparisons certainly get a little bit tougher each month as we work through the fourth quarter. It was -- last year, our volumes were accelerating month after month such that the third quarter was the [ fifth ] really strong out-performance versus what our normal trends have been. 
Typically, we see strong performance in for 5 or 6 quarters like that and then kind of revert to normal sequential trends, which, by the way, reflect a whole lot of market share gains. Over the past 10 years, when you think about our shipments per day averaging about a 50% increase versus where we were 10 years ago. So there's a lot of market share gains that are in those numbers.
But overall, I think if you just were to say that we operated on normal sequential trends, that puts us with some pretty strong numbers on the volume side next year. And we don't want to say that's what the forecast is because right now, we haven't seen any let down with respect to demand. 
So it's hard to call that  we're going to see any slowdown and certainly based on customer conversations and everything that we see and read, we feel like this unprecedented level of demand that we've seen this year will continue into next year, especially if the other carriers are continuing to be capacity constrained. It certainly could continue to just push more and more volumes our way. 
And so we just got to be in position to continue to bring it on board and make sure we're focused on profitable growth, which is what our long-term focus has been and continue to take care of our customers and offering them solutions in various ways, be it handling all their LTL shipments using our truckload brokerage division to help them out with any truckload moves as best we can. And then the drayage division that we have in our non-LTL as well, which is mainly focused in the Southeast is seeing a lot of strength there. 
So it all comes back to building the relationship with your customer and trying to continue to serve them as best you can, and we're going to continue with that focus as we transition into 2022, but not keeping our eye off the ball with respect to the fourth quarter as well. We still got a lot of work to do to finish out this year with strength."

So we're really proud of what we've achieved over the last few years, and we feel confident to say that we know we've got room for further improvement. 
I think we'll wait until we get to the fourth quarter to really start talking about kind of what our next target will be. But again, if you look over the long term, we've averaged 100 to 150 basis point improvement in the operating ratio each year, and that sort of gets back to that delta between our revenue and cost per shipment. So a lot go into each of those 2 numbers, us managing our cost and continuing to focus on productivity and offsetting all the costs that go along with expanding our model and that creates some short-term cost headwinds.
But when you look at the long-term performance for what we've done over the past 10 years, producing an average of 10% to 11% change in revenue each year and about a 25% average annual increase in our EPS, that's driven considerable share value over that 10-year period, and we want to continue to do that as we look out into the next 10-year horizon as well.

I think the other thing is, fortunately, the numbers we're seeing are moving in the right direction. As far as COVID goes, they're really dropping. I saw something on the news this morning where we're down to a 4-something-percent positivity rate. Maybe that was just for the state of North Carolina, I'm not sure.

One, we've said this before, but we don't manage the company to the incremental margin. That's just the calculation of all the work that we do in sort of building out the balancing the revenue growth and margin improvement opportunities. We had used that long-term target of 25 really as an inverse to say we were working towards a 75 operating ratio goal. And that's really more of what we talk about within the company for where we think we can take the operating ratio. So I think we'll give a little bit more color on that when we get to our fourth quarter call.
Obviously, based on kind of what I mentioned earlier about the target for the fourth quarter, that puts us at an annual operating ratio somewhere around 74%. So we certainly looks like we will be able to beat that 75 OR target this year. And as it comes down to incremental margins, I think this will go down as our biggest incremental margin year in our history. 
And when we've talked about the cost structure with you before, we've laid out kind of the cost structure is balanced between our variable and fixed costs and how we can operate at a 35 to 40 incremental margin in a particular quarter in a short period of time. But we don't want to get overly fixated on incremental margins because, again, we're focusing on the investments that are required to drive long-term growth.
We don't measure the success of our business based on how strong an incremental can be. It's really some of those longer-term numbers that I referenced earlier. And we want to be able to repeat that because we think there's a lot of growth opportunity left within our business. And so that's going to be the focus. But it requires investment, and that can create some short-term headwinds. And if that's the only lens that you look at things through, you miss out on a ton of opportunity to drive shareholder value. And so we're going to keep that long-term focus, continue to make the necessary investments. 
And if that drives the incremental down a little bit, one, I'm pretty pleased with the 33, I don't think that's anything that needs that for the quarter and producing a very strong 72.6 operating ratio. But based on that cost structure breakdown, we feel confident in saying that we certainly can drive the operating ratio meaningfully lower. 
And we'll continue to -- whenever we get to whatever that next threshold might be, we'll continue to look at managing the business and how the algorithm works. And it's not to say that whatever the next stopping point will be the final stopping point. We think that there's a lot of opportunity left here. So we'll just -- we'll keep marching forward. The algorithm certainly has worked for us in the past, and we think can continue to work for us into the future."

But obviously, when you deconstruct tonnage, weight spend a decent drag to tonnage, when do you think that cycles through this obviously has implications for headcount relative to shipment growth.

So certainly, that type of environment is supportive of our pricing initiatives. 
For us, it's more of a long-term consistent approach and one that we think is fair but equitable. It's one that we can sit down with our customers and talk about what our cost inflation is and what our needs are in terms of reinvesting in the business to either improve customer service or investing in ways that ultimately are going to reduce cost.
So it's a win-win situation for both us and our customers. And so we try to target our cost inflation and then some, and we've been pretty successful with that. And so that will continue to be the focus. But with that said, we're always focusing on the individual account profitability. And so when you're in these types of environments, there are some accounts that their operating ratios are not as good as others. 
And those are the types of accounts that really over the last couple of years that we've had to address some issues and there's different ways to improve yield. It's not always through price. And so that's where you sit down and you build on your relationship together and work through different initiatives that ultimately can create the same results of yield improvement there. 
So certainly, given the expectation that the demand trends will remain very strong and given the lack of capacity that we believe is in the industry, and that's mainly grounded in the feedback that we're getting from customers, we certainly expect there to be a strong pricing environment for the industry next year, for which we will be able to benefit."

And we'll see how the rest of the quarter shapes up, if you will. But typically, we see a little bit of softness, if you will, just about 0.5% to 1% drop in our revenue per day performance from 3Q to 4Q. And so based on the current performance, we're definitely outperforming October, if you will. So we'll see where -- where that puts us for the end of the quarter. 
But we're doing a lot of things with respect to managing costs. We talk a lot about the labor cost, and that's probably 65% of total cost in our salary wages and benefits line. And we've seen a lot of productivity this year, especially within our line haul and our pickup delivery operations. 
We've lost some productivity on the dock. So I think that the fourth quarter and the first quarter, that will be some opportunity that we continue to focus on. It's not that we haven't been focused on it. But I think that, that's something that will help on the labor front if we can reduce the levels of purchase transportation and manage more freight with our people and our equipment. Certainly think that, that will be beneficial as well given the rates that we're having to pay. 
And we're using about the same level in October as we were in the third quarter. We hope that we'll be able to reduce that level of utilization a little bit. But at this point, the top line trends have dictated all year. I think every quarterly call, we've had for the last 4 quarters, we've talked about wanting to be able to reduce that expense category. But the top line trends have really dictated that continued utilization. 
So we'll see where that balances out. But there's just a  lot of cost management that is here within the business and that we're focused on as well as continuing to see that strong top line performance that will help offset some of this inflation as we're bringing on new people. And we'll continue to see our benefit costs in the third quarter were higher and expect that, that will likely continue as we're continuing to balance out the number of hours worked by our employees. 
As we increase that workforce, there's certainly going to be more incremental benefit costs that will be incurred. But we feel good about all the other contributing factors to help offset some of that cost inflation."

So, but that has resulted in some depreciation that's kind of coming in different periods that too will be something that we're only about 80% through September complete with the CapEx order on the equipment.

But typically, it's -- you look at kind of long-term trends, there's a pretty consistent factor of what our CapEx is and a percent of that, that kind of adds to the depreciation base. And I don't want to get into too many details until we're really ready to roll out what the full CapEx plan will be.

So pretty consistent balance with our linehaul drivers, our pickup and delivery drivers, especially as we've added new service centers, not only just the general growth that the business has had and then the platform employees as well, mainly the productive labor employees that are responsible for moving the freight and handling freight for our customers. 
So that's driving the majority of that growth in the headcount. And it's been something that to say your headcount is up 21% essentially is pretty meaningful, especially given all the conversations about labor shortages around the country. So we're certainly proud of how successful we've been, despite the fact that we said we'd love to continue to hire more, if you will, and it's just a balance on the productivity.
The biggest learning curve happens on the dock for us. You can't get too overly caught up in one particular metric versus another. The most important for us is to make sure that each new employee on the dock understands that their #1 priority is to use all the tools and techniques that we have in place to protect our customers' freight. And whether that's the dunnage, the airbags, utilizing the load bars that are in our linehaul, trailers, everything that really drives that overall value proposition. 
The claims management is a big part of that. And we continue to have cargo claims ratio at 0.1% to 0.2%. So that's something that we're really proud of and more motivated that we make sure our employees understand that, that is a part of the value equation. That's part of the piece of our yield management success over the years and a big differentiating factor between us and many of our competitors. So there may be a 6-month learning curve in place for people to come on to make sure they're effectively preventing claims and also the other piece of it is maximizing our load factor to ensure that they're utilizing the entire cube. That's our biggest cost element is line haul.
And so we want to make sure that they're more focused on those key factors, if you will, versus just the number of shipments per hour that we might manage on the dock. But that gives you opportunity as those new people are now more seasoned. Certainly, that's why we're looking at seeing some of that productivity opportunity as we turn the page into '22. 
And certainly, would love to see some improvement as we finish out the balance of the year, but I think that, that will be a pretty good opportunity for us to drive some further cost improvement into next year."
