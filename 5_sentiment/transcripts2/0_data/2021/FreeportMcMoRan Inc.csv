Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Fourth Quarter Conference Call.
Earlier this morning, we reported our fourth quarter and full year 2020 operating and financial results and a copy of today's press release and our slides are available on our website at fcx.com. Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website home page and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.
Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on this call will include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described on our SEC filings.
On the call today, Richard Adkerson. We also have a number of our senior team with us today: Mark Johnson is here, Josh Olmsted, Mike Kendrick, Rick Coleman and Steve Higgins. I'll start by briefly summarizing the results for the quarter, and then we'll turn the call over to Richard, who will be reviewing our outlook. After our prepared remarks, we'll be taking questions.
Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $708 million or $0.48 per share in the fourth quarter, and $599 million or $0.41 per share for the year ended 2020. We had a number of special items in the fourth quarter, which are detailed on Roman numeral VII of our press release, those total net credits of $142 million or $0.10 a share, mainly associated with the gain on the sale of assets and partly offset by charges for a litigation settlement and international tax matters.
Our adjusted net income attributable to common stock after these items totaled $566 million or $0.39 per share for the fourth quarter of 2020. Our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA for the fourth quarter approximated $1.9 billion and we generated $4.2 billion of adjusted EBITDA for the year 2020. A reconciliation of our EBITDA is available on Page 38 of the slide materials.
We had a very strong fourth quarter. Our sales volumes of copper of 866 million pounds were 3% above our October 2020 estimate. And our gold sales of 293,000 ounces were 9% higher than our October 2020 guidance. These primarily reflected higher copper sales from Cerro Verde and in Indonesia and higher gold ore grades in Indonesia. We benefited during the quarter from improved pricing for both copper and gold. The realized price of copper was $3.40 per pound in the fourth quarter, and that was 24% above the year ago quarterly average.
Fourth quarter gold realized price was $18.70 per ounce, and that was about 25% above the year ago average. Our unit net cash costs came in at an average of $1.28 per pound of copper, and that was lower than what we had guided to in October. Notably, in the fourth quarter, we generated very strong cash flows, which totaled $1.3 billion in the quarter. And that exceeded our capital spending of just under $400 million during the period. We were, together with our asset sale proceeds in the fourth quarter, we were successful in reducing our net debt by about $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter alone, and we ended the year with net debt approximating $6.1 billion. We had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility, consolidated cash of $3.7 billion, and we're in a strong position as we look forward to generating increasing cash flows as we go forward.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to our slide materials that you can reference on our website."

It's great to be able to talk to you today about our performance in 2020 and our positive outlook. It's been a head spinning year. When we think back to March and April and all of the challenges we were facing at that point and the world was facing to have -- be at this head spinning in many ways and remarkable, but it's been quite a year for Freeport. I really hope you and your families and colleagues are staying safe and well. We've all made personal sacrifices. It's been a tough year for us at Freeport, the progress our company has made has really been a guide in as we've all been working in ways that are so different than in the past.
We remain focused on working to protect our health and safety of our people. We're supporting the communities where we operate during this crisis by the scientific advances with therapeutics and now that vaccines are finally being distributed. But all we know all this is going to take time to widely placed, and we're all looking forward to returning to normal lives. But for the time being, calls. And these have really proven to be so effective for us in Freeport.
I'm immensely proud of our Freeport team for their response to the COVID challenge. Navigating through a pandemic like this and none of us have ever seen, and with this degree of duration has been difficult for everyone and all the communities around us. Our team has demonstrated real resilience, confidence and drive throughout all of this come together to address the situation proactively while we've maintained focus on continuing to protect and enhance our business, and that's worked for the benefit of all stakeholders.
On Slide 3, we show the highlights for 2020, a year of extraordinary accomplishment for Freeport. We laid a strong foundation for future growth and cash flows and profitabilities, which is exactly what we set out to do and had a strategy to do and to have been able to achieve what we did in the face of COVID is nothing short of remarkable.
Earlier in 2020, we announced in April, we moved quickly to develop new operating protocols to maintain our businesses continuity. We totally redesigned our operating plans from what we had announced this time a year ago, to safeguard our business, protect our liquidity and to be responsive to the really heightened uncertainty that we were facing and everyone's facing.
At Freeport, all hands were on deck to build an optimal plan, each of our operating teams around the globe, played an employment role in developing and then executing these aggressive plans. We just had a tremendous buy in by everyone, and that enabled us to execute the plans so well. Big positive from this process that our team's collaboration, which has always been a strength of our organization is now more strong than it's ever been or at a very high level. We effectively extent -- executed the revised plans, had a big focus on cost and capital management. And then significantly, we advanced the largest block caving operation in the world at our Grasberg mine in Indonesia. You'll see we met our key milestones for this massive multiyear, multibillion-dollar undertaking. At the same time, we also completed on time and on budget, the Lone Star project in Arizona, and this is a potential future keystone asset for our company. The progress we made this year set the foundation for strong cash flows literally for years to come.
We turned the corner during 2020 to begin generating sustainable and substantial free cash flow. Beginning in the third quarter of 2020 and now continuing in the fourth quarter and as we look forward, we've generated and are generating significant free cash flow and that enabled us to reduce our net debt by $2.4 billion in the second half of the year.
Slide 4 highlights key financial metrics by comparing our actual results for 2020 with the plan we presented to you last January prior to the onset of the pandemic. So this is not the revised April plan, but the one that we had before we knew what we were facing. In that comparison, our unit net cash cost for 2020 were 15% lower than the January 2020 guidance. EBITDA and operating cash flow improved by over 25%. Capital spending was reduced by 29%. We also generated approximately $550 million in after-tax proceeds from the sale of a noncash flow producing assets that we disposed of this year.
We ended the year with $2.7 billion lower debt than our original January plan. Think about that. Facing COVID, with all the uncertainties, having to make the changes and then coming back to do so much better than we set out to do before COVID was known about. This was accomplished at an average copper price realization of $2.95 for the year, 10% a pound higher than our plan, $0.10 per ounce, just $0.10 and well below the current price. The team did an outstanding job. We're strongly positioned for the future.
In addition to the strong operating and financial performance in 2020, we achieved new milestones in the ESG area. And that's shown on Slide 5. We committed to the Copper Mark. This is a new assurance framework developed by the International Copper Association and our Steve Higgins is now the President of ICA, to promote and demonstrate responsible production practices, focusing on meeting the United Nations Sustainability Development Goals. Big step forward. We established climate targets and added transparency with a new climate report, which is now available on our website.
We took a leading role with ICMM, International Council Metals and Mining, beginning over a year ago when it served as the industry representative and a multi-stakeholder initiatives to develop a new tailing standard for the mining industry following the disasters in Brazil. And then the subsequent development of implementation guidance for ICMM members. This was a major undertaking by the industry and by our company, which took a lead in the process, and it reflects the importance of managing Tal's storage facilities safely and responsibly. After serving 2 terms as Chairman of ICMM more than 10 years ago, I recently accepted a new term as Chairman. ICMM currently has 27 CEO counsel members from the largest global mining and metals companies, and I'm leading a strategic review of the organization to meet the increasing importance of the ESG issues facing our industry.
We advanced our inclusion and diversity initiatives, which is core to our values at Freeport. We invested in our communities and continue to expand organizational resources in this effort. Worker safety is our highest priority, and we showed that with what we did in response to COVID.
Our safety statistics in 2020, measured by accident rates -- in incidence rates met our targets. Fatality position continues to be a focus of our work. Safety management and credibly. We had 5 fatalities in our operations last year.
On Slide 6, you've heard me say for a long time that the copper price would benefit from its favorable fundamental outlooks. Prices rose significantly in late 2020 in recognition of copper's favorable demand trends and the limited ability of the industry to increase supply. The recent price move is significant, but note that prices are still lower than they were just over 10 years ago or almost 10 years ago. Hard to believe the fundamental outlook for copper today is better than it was 10 years ago. China is leading the recovery and global stimulus measures in countries around the world are also being positive for growth in copper demand. Freeport is the leading -- is a leading producer of copper, and this commodity is critical to the economy of the future. It's essential to support global growth and broad scale the economic activity, but it is also essentially strategic for technologies required for the transition to a global, cleaner energy future. That's on the front burner for everyone.
More and more, we are seeing adoption of policies to reduce carbon emissions around the globe. 70% of the world's copper supply is used to deliver electricity. As clean energy initiatives are implemented, the intensity of copper use will increase.
The chart on Slide 7 shows that copper utilization in electric vehicles and in the generation of renewable power is more than 4 times greater per unit than for traditional vehicles and power generation. CRU estimates that copper demand for electrification and renewables will increase significantly over the coming years. In a relatively short time frame, global demand just from these green initiatives could approximate the size of today's U.S. copper market. As demand accelerates, copper supply will continue to struggle to keep up. And this supports a favorable near-term and long-term fundamental outlook.
Its current situation echoes the early 2000s when I became CEO of Freeport at a time when Chinese demand appeared and accelerated in such a dramatic fashion without a supply response, which created the commodity super cycle and sharp increases in copper prices. Very similar to what we're facing today.
Turning to Indonesia on Slide 8. Our PT-FI team is delivering really impressive results. During 2020, we built the momentum for the ramp-up of our massive underground mines. And by the fourth quarter, we had reached nearly 70% of the targeted annual run rates for sales volumes. This is something we were looking forward to beginning in the mid-1990s when we designed the original pit, which is now completed and is something that we've been investing in over the past 15 years. And to see it coming together like it is, is truly gratifying. And Mark Johnson & his team have just done an exceptional job.
Continued growth during 2021 is expected to enable us to reach our full annualized targets by the end of this year. Considering the operating health challenges we faced in Papua, this is notable and striking. The team stayed on schedule, met our objectives. The project is massive and complex. And we did this by designing and maintaining effective COVID protocols in a very large workplace and a very challenging remote location. Our progress with ramp-up has reduced risk for PT-FI's underground mine significantly.
The major risk, as we started this was developing the infrastructure. The infrastructure is in place. There's always risk in mining. It's inherent in our business, but the major risk for this underground development are behind us. And we are confident and have a track record of managing the types of risk we'll be facing going forward. We can't make them go away, but we can manage them. And so we're really pleased with where we stand with that process.
We're also continuing discussions currently regarding the new smelter in Indonesia. In early 2020, we requested a delay in agreed time schedule for completing of a construction of the new smelter at a site in Eastern Java near Gresik, which is near the existing PT smelting facility. We haven't been able to progress work there because of COVID issues for the local workforce and international contracts. This is a greenfield smelter with a total cost of about $3 billion. That number continues to be refined and changed. And this project would be debt-financed by PT-FI, the Indonesian entity.
Over the last several months, PT-FI and our partner and majority shareholder in PT-FI, the Indonesian state-owned company MIND ID have been discussing with the government alternatives to this commitment to build a new smelter, which was reflected in our IUPK mining license granted in December 2018. During the fourth quarter, we advanced discussions with the majority owner of the existing PT smelting facility at Gresik for a 30% expansion to add smelting capacity in Indonesia and partially satisfy our commitment to the government. Commercial and financing discussions for these expansions are being advanced, engineering is in progress. Initial estimates indicate that this project could be done for $250 million and be done efficiently in the current TCRC environment and it would partially meet our obligation to the government.
Then separately, at the request of the government, at the request of the government, PT-FI is currently engaged in discussion with a third-party regarding the potential for the development of a new greenfield smelter at an alternate location away from Eastern Java. This project would be in lieu of PT-FI's constructing the new greenfield smelter that I mentioned above.
The third party -- a third-party would lead the development for this smelter range as financing. TFI would commit to be a supplier of concentrate for the project, and the partners and the government are working expeditiously to reach a decision on the path forward.
On Slide 10, we show our 2021 priorities for our ongoing efforts and creating values for our company. We are building on the progress of 2020 by focusing on execution of plans to grow production volumes, manage costs and capital spending efficiently. We're expanding our recent innovation efforts, applying technology and innovating innovative management processes in our operations around the world. And all of this, while we manage and are sensitive to our responsibilities to workers, communities, governments and other stakeholders.
We look forward to resuming cash returns to shareholders during 2021, and we'll be in a position to do that, and we will be in discussions with our Board on taking actions. We will be in a period now and far -- for the long-term of harvesting cash flows now that we are completing the major long-term investment program in Indonesia. We're discussing with the Board a financial policy that would allow and enable a near-term resumption of the dividend and then, over time, a performance-based shareholder return policy. Significantly, we have recommenced work we suspended early in 2020 to evaluate and advance future organic growth opportunities from our large portfolio of undeveloped reserves and mineral resources, and we look forward to doing that.
The efforts in 2020, we worked with our team over many years now has enabled us to increase margins and cash flow substantially for 2021 below and beyond. At $3.50 copper, we're on a path to nearly double EBITDA from 2020 levels. Copper sales for 2021 are projected to increase 20% over 2020. Gold volumes are projected to increase by over 50%. Our unit net cash costs of production will decline. And this is occurring at a time for improved pricing for copper. I recall in an earlier conference call like this, I said an ideal situation for Freeport would be able to be completing the Grasberg expansion at times of good copper prices. And here we are.
The significantly higher cash flows will enable us to maintain a strong balance sheet, build value in our business, return substantial cash flows to shareholders.
As shown on Slide 12, we have a long-lived portfolio of mineral reserves. Reserve life are proved and probable reserves of over 30 years. We have substantial options for the potential to expand our reserve base from our large inventory of metal resources beyond reported reserves. All of this is associated with brownfield expansions of our existing ore bodies. What this means is that for our company to have long-term success, we are not required to have success in exploration. We hope we do. We're not required to do deals. Strategic opportunities may come to us. But we've got this base already in our portfolio that provides for a sustainable long-term future for Freeport.
Slide 13 highlights the organic projects we are now assessing during 2020 to conserve cash. We paused work on our expansion projects. We're now reengaged, broad range of opportunities. During 2021, we will be developing a ranking of these projects to guide our thinking on sequencing and long term planning. We have no plans to increase substantially capital spending on projects in the near term. But in the long term, these growth opportunities will be approached in a measured and disciplined way.
I'll close with Slide 14, which I'm titled the Freeport Edge, which is the term we're using internally around our company. Our management team at Freeport has extensive experience in managing this business. Leadership teams across the company are seasoned, value-oriented and intensely engaged. We have a management structure that is collaborative. We've experienced in working together, and we're decisive. To make a decision, we execute. We recognize our responsibilities we undertake when we're granted hard earn license to operate. And we never cut corners on important issues.
Looking at our team at Freeport is a combination of managements with long tenure and experience. We also have a cadre of younger managers who bring new ideas, approaches and energies. We have strategic new hires who bring outside perspectives. We've had 3 senior executives who've retired at the end of their careers over the last 2 years. Internal replacements were promoted and performing effectively. And this just demonstrates the depth of talent in our organization.
Freeport is foremost in copper. Our portfolio of assets is large, high quality. We're an established industry leader, operate mines that are among the largest in the world. Our assets are long-lived and durable with embedded options, reserve, resource growth. We have strong operating franchises in the United States, South America and Indonesia. We're allowable supplier to the global copper industry, have industry-leading technical capabilities, supported by a strong track record of project execution and business management over many years. We've earned the trust and respect of our partners, our customers, suppliers, financial important markets and most importantly, our workers, communities and host countries where we operate.
Our block caving experience is among the most extensive and long-standing in the history of the global mining industry. We've been operating block caves in Indonesia since the early 1980s. We have an important molybdenum block caving operation in Colorado. And this is critically important as we transition Grasberg to become the largest block caving operation in the world.
I'll close before turning to your questions by thanking our people and recognizing their strength, resiliency and performance. I'm proud to be part of this team, and I look forward to continue to be part of the team and to participate in our future successes. We will build on our accomplishments as we -- as will be depicted on our 2020 annual report to shareholders. We are charging ahead responsibly, reliably and relentlessly.
Thank you for your attention. And operator, let's open the lines for questions."

I'll be brief.Continuing with the slide presentation on Slide 16. We provide some additional details on the quarter and our operating plans. We're continuing in the U.S.",748,"Richard, I'm just going to make a few comments, and then we can take the questions. I'll be brief.
Continuing with the slide presentation on Slide 16. We provide some additional details on the quarter and our operating plans. We're continuing in the U.S. to ramp up production from the new Lone Star mine. And in January of this year, we commenced a restart of the Chino mine, which we had previously announced. In South America, we're continuing to operate Cerro Verde at a reduced rate of roughly 360,000 tonnes per day. We did a little more than that in the fourth quarter. And our team is prepared to increase rates to a level of 400,000 tonnes, which is about where we were -- tonnes per day, which was about where we were pre-COVID after the COVID restrictions are lifted. At El Abra, we've incorporated in our latest plans, an increase in operating rates which will provide additional volumes beginning in 2022. And as we've talked about at Grasberg, we made excellent progress in the fourth quarter and are continuing to execute the ramp-up plan to achieve the targeted metal run rates by the end of this year.
Slide 17, we present the outlook for 2021. The guidance is largely in line with our previous estimates. We made some minor revisions to 2021 volumes. These were largely timing in nature to reflect the latest Grasberg mine plans. And we've updated our cost models to incorporate the current pricing for energy currencies programs. We expect to sell just over 3.8 billion pounds of copper in 2021 at an average unit net cash cost of $1.25 per pound. And at $3.50 copper, this would generate about $8 billion of EBITDA. And $5.5 billion in operating cash flows for the year 2021, which is nearly double the 2020 levels.
And as you'll see, we expect further growth in 2022 and 2023, which is shown on Slide '18, where we provide a 3-year outlook for volumes. After expecting growth of nearly 20% in copper, over 50% for gold in 2021 versus 2020, we're projecting further growth of 13% in copper volumes and over 20% in gold volumes for the year 2022. And these projects have been in development for some time. Most of the capital is behind us, which gives us a runway here of generating growth in cash flows and margins.
The buildup in volumes for 2021 is reflected on Slide 19.
And on Slide 20, we show the significance of the cash flow generation using these volumes and our cost estimates. And we show a range of prices from $3.50 to $4 copper, holding gold flat at $18.50 per ounce and molybdenum at $9 per pound. But you can see that the growth in volumes at very low incremental cost results in EBITDA ranging from over $10 billion per annum on average for the years 2022 and 2023 to over $12 billion per year at $4 copper and operating cash flows, which are net of our taxes and interest costs would range from $7 billion at $3.50 per pound of copper to over $8.5 billion at $4 copper. And as Richard was mentioning, the $4 copper is still well below historical periods of demand strength.
The cash flows generation are expected to be significantly above our planned capital spending, which will provide substantial free cash flows as we go forward.
On Slide 21, includes our projected capital of $2.3 billion in 2021. That excludes potential spending on the Indonesian smelter, which would be debt-financed and is still under evaluation. We're maintaining our basic capital plans. We're being very disciplined about capital spend. The 2021 capital is roughly, as you'll see, about $100 million higher than the previous forecast, and that incorporates an acceleration of some mining equipment investments to provide capacity assurance for our plans. We're in a strong financial position, as you see, we've entered a period of exceptional free cash flow generation, the long-lived asset base and ongoing cost and capital management will provide the ability to continue to strengthen our balance sheet, provide cash returns to shareholders and build additional values in our asset base.
Regarding financial policy. We're working with our Board on a shareholder return policy that would balance our priorities while providing increasing returns to shareholders based on this performance. It's a very exciting time for Freeport, and we're staying very focused on continuing our momentum.
And now, operator, we'd like to take questions."

But there's no need for further financial metrics with that when you look at our improved financial situation when we're paying the dividend before.
The issue with the growth project is one that's requires more work and requires some time in evaluating the market as we go forward. They range in size, but the projects are large ones. We have a significant expansion opportunity in El Abra in Chile with our partner, CODELCO, and it's on the order of the project we did at Cerro Verde several years ago. And we have a series of projects in the U.S. that initially aren't as large, although down the road, there are some very large ones available. The U.S. has some advantages. Tax rates are very favorable, and we have a very large loss carryforward. So we don't pay taxes in the U.S. for years to come. We own most of the lands in fees. So there's no royalties. And so when you cut out taxes and royalties in the U.S. versus foreign economics and with a favorable energy situation in the U.S. and community support for workers. There's just a lot of advantages there. So we had to suspend this work because of the uncertainties of COVID. We're now -- Rick Coleman and his team are digging back into it, and we're going to be doing trade-offs of these individual projects as we go forward in 2021. And we'll be able to report to you about our intentions. We -- we're constantly approached by others in the industry who would like to be our partners in these projects. And so there will be a lot of opportunities there. And it's to say today, we're just resuming the work that we were engaged in previously."

We have rights to operate under a shareholders agreement, we be in FCX. MIND ID owns 51%. So it's a separate entity. And it is the entity that would construct and finance the smelter. So it's no 50-50 sharing. I mean it is -- it'd be financed in that entity. It's a substantial entity with no external debt. From time to time, there's some borrowings from FCX, but to meet working capital needs. But it's a substantial entity that clearly can debt finance this entity on its own. So that's the way this thing would be approached and financed.
Now we do consolidate that entity because of our operating rights. It's a very positive thing that we do have the ability to do that under the accounting rules because that way we can report it as part of our global operations. So to the extent that alternative is followed and PT-FI takes the lead in constructing and financing the smelter, the debt that it incurs would be consolidated on our balance sheet, but there wouldn't be obligations of FCX to provide funding for it."

But to think about both those projects together and the precious metal facilities all being a $3 billion project for PT-FI. Now this new alternative would result in not having to build the greenfield smelter another party would come in and do that, arrange it and finance it. So the debt would not be incurred by PT-FI, okay? We're still in the process of negotiating TCRC rates for that. There will be some need for financial support because of the market. But there's an opportunity for us to end up in a much more favorable situation for PT-FI if we're successful in these negotiations. And the government considers it positive because it would be a step in their own government initiatives to develop industry in Indonesia. This would tie into some nickel operations and potentially some downstream battery operations and the like for Indonesia.
So strategically, the government of Indonesia sees it's positive. It could be positive for PT-FI. And so that's the basis for our deal. And now we're in the process of negotiating the terms of that deal."

I should mention that Jim Bob died recently. He and I met in my first year out of college as he was starting off McMoRan, and we were 2 different people, but we established a very good partnership.

Chris, Deep MLZ, as Richard mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we were ahead on all the development aspects, the -- where we were on target on drawbelling, undercutting and where we had some challenges with and just the material flow. And what I mean from there is taking the material from the extraction level, getting it through the rock breaker or getting it to the Grizzly's through the internal ore passes, the 60-meter long or passes and getting them into the trucks that take it to the crusher.
The problems that we had there was we deal from everything from very, very coarse blocking material to find sticky material. And we're coming up with methods that I'm confident we'll address that and allow us to take both the big stuff and the fine stuff and run them through these ore passes. It's something that we saw at the initial stages of DMLZ and we're working our way through that.
On the GBC, the Grasberg Block Cave, we had a very good year. We were on drawbelling, undercutting we were ahead on our tonnage rates for the fourth quarter, marginally ahead, and we're in a good position there. We build our second -- we'll complete the second crusher at GBC in April of this year, which will be a major milestone. We continue to develop the rail haulage, and there's a major milestone that we'll achieve in the second quarter to let these trains run in the loop rather than out and back. And that's going to increase our production from our overall mine system. So both mines are tracking well. And as Richard mentioned, we do have DOZ. It's a mature mine. But it hit targets Big Gossan in our stope mine was -- we had very good results this last year, last quarter, in particular, so it's -- we've had some pluses and minuses, but overall, we're in a very good position entering this year. And in -- particularly in the GBC, we've hit our peak in our drawbelling in 2020. And just associated with the mine plan and consistent with our long range plans, that starts to tail off. We don't need as many drawbells to continue to sustain the ramp-up in production. Deep MLZ, we pretty much stay steady for the next 3 years on drawbelling and undercutting. So the next 2 years is really just doing more of the same of growing these mines. There's no real rate increase in the amount of development. In fact, it's flatter or dropping off. And it's just a matter of continuing to be very consistent in how we've -- going forward as to what we've been able to demonstrate over the last couple of years and particularly in 2020."

We also have an undeveloped ore body that we've been doing some work on that could add value for the future, and that's an ore body called the Kucing Liar. It's a ore body with high-grade material has some pyrite in it. Mark and his team has come up with a revised plan to deal with that. It's about a $5 billion project spread over many years, a number of years in the future, but that's not near term, but it's something that within the time frame of our current IUPK will be something that will sustain add value for PT-FI."

There might have been some one's or two's that are different, but it's not anything that was significant in our forecast.
As Richard mentioned, it's more about this -- where we are in the ramping up of the tonnes, and it's more in line. Any changes in the tonnage is more a reflection of this material flow challenge that we're undertaking. But it's just marginally behind. And at the same time, the GBC is marginally ahead. And so the ramp-up rates are very consistent from one forecast to the other. Some slight changes in grades that are nothing significant. It's not drilling results. It's not any changes in reserves. It's simply where we're actually drawing. There's some -- at the end of every quarter, we reflect what we've done, and then we build that into what we're doing forward. So there's really no significant change in our underground plans, both at Deep MLZ and GBC.
The other 2 mines, DOZ and Big Gossan are both very consistent. In fact, in Big Gossan, we've changed our stope sequencing a bit. That's going to add some metal. So we'll continue to look for opportunities and to reflect our actual production and operational over the previous quarters."

But when you look at underground mines in the industry, those are substantial mines in and of themselves. This copper difference is just a rounding. I mean, it's less than 1%. I mean, so we're right on plan for copper. And the gold things, remember, we had higher goal now, we upgraded our goal for 2022. So every year, there's going to be those kinds of adjustments. We're going to try to produce more gold, which we're able to do in 2020. And then we adjust our plans for that. So we're -- there's nothing here other than we're right on our targets, and everything is going as planned.
The financial policy, I'll go back and say what I've said before. We have ongoing informal discussions with Board members. We have formal Board members coming up. My anticipation is that there will be a restoration of our dividend and then a financial policy that will give guidance to the market of how we will be dividing cash flows in the future for further debt reduction, although, quite frankly, we're -- if you look at our cash flows that we talked to you about today and a $3.50 copper price, we get down to about $3 million of net debt at the end of 2022. So we certainly can support higher level of debt than that. And that means there's plenty of cash to enhance cash returns to shareholders and then have availability of funds and depending on how we structure it for future organic growth projects when we decide to initiate those. So restoration of dividend, a financial policy that will provide for increasing cash returns to shareholder over the long term with funds available for organic growth investments."

If we were sitting, as we normally do around our conference desk in Phoenix, Kathleen would be kicking me out on the table because that question is just like giving a monkey a machine gun.

If we were sitting, as we normally do around our conference desk in Phoenix, Kathleen would be kicking me out on the table because that question is just like giving a monkey a machine gun. The 2003, we had gone through a real tough time in copper with the economic issues of the late 1990s, the global recession, the global slowdown. Copper prices had dropped at one point to below $0.70. And I recall, and it was at a Tim at Merrill Lynch conference in Ireland. That was my first conference as CEO, I was right before I'm a CEO. And the price of copper just dipped over $0.70, nobody in the industry thought it could go beyond $1 within the foreseeable future. And everybody was running the business. So what happened? China merged in a way nobody expected, created a whole new element of demand. Historically, whenever copper prices jumped up, the industry had projects primarily in Latin America to invest in. And the industry was widely divided and there'd be new investment. Supplies would come on, the business cycle would turn down and copper prices would drop. This time, China added in 2003, a permanent element of new demand that was beyond the traditional demand from copper that was tied into global industrial production. And there was widespread expectation that the industry would invest and add new supplies. I remember my partnership, Goodyear, got up at that conference and said in price copper, he hoped that the price wouldn't rise too much because it would create uneconomic investment. Well, what happened was the industry started looking for new projects then and geologically, they weren't there, and there were all these other barriers to investment. So we had higher prices without a supply response. That led us to do that Dodge deal in 2007, we're -- our market cap in 2003 was $6 billion. It was well at South State deal. We did a $38 billion business combination, the biggest in the industry, lift through the financial crisis and then emerged in 2011 as a company with a $60 billion market cap and no debt. So what do we like here? The reason that I feel this is an echo is that we still have a world that's being burdened by the economic slowdown with COVID. While there had been recoveries in pockets of the economy, there's been stimulus by governments, and China has recovered much faster than we heard about earlier, think about a world where we had a slowdown to the extent we did in 2020 and copper inventories are at levels that we hadn't seen since the mid-2000s. And so here we are, and we just talked about how there's not a huge rush to invest in new projects. All the major companies want to grow copper as part of their portfolios. That's been the case since the mid-2000s, and they've been challenged in doing that. Projects today around the world, geologically are more difficult, less quality than they were, underground, lower grades, you look at Cerro Verde, Cobre Panama. These are big, low-grade projects that require huge investments in infrastructure and equipment and mill processing. And then you have these barriers to production that keep some attractive projects around the world from going forward. You have political issues in countries that in Africa is challenged, Latin America is having political issues, Indonesia's been what it's been. So I do feel that if the world's global economy recovers in a reasonable way, not an extreme way. And we have this big move towards -- look at all the stats that are coming about for electric vehicles in the United States. I mean, and think about what General Motors is doing and what China is doing, you think about the change in the global perception about climate change in the United States, forest fires, hurricanes. I mean, this is something that's going to have to be addressed. And when it is addressed, it's going to require tremendous amounts of infrastructure spending, extraordinary amounts. And in all of those elements of spending, there's an element of copper of significance into it. So that's why I feel like we are echoing 2003 today."

I'm just curious kind of how you think about potentially growing the business from a capital-efficient basis going forward?

Then after Phel",453,"So again, yes. I look over the shoulder. If you look back at Freeport, when copper prices began rising in 2003, 2004, we returned tremendous amounts of cash to investors out of Grasberg. We were like a royalty trust or an MLP or something. Then after Phelps Dodge, we delevered very quickly, and we start returning paying dividends again. And we were well positioned in 2011 to continue to do that. The Board decided to invest in oil and gas and took it away. So here, we are coming back from the situation that we are now, we don't need a commodities boom to generate lots of cash to return to shareholders. At $3.50 copper, you see what the numbers are. I think copper could go much higher than $3.50. I can't guarantee it, but in my gut, and Timna, that's one of the reasons I want to keep working. I think it's going to be really a special time. And when that happens, we will be able to really return cash to shareholders in a substantial way. This question of investing, I mean, right now, money is so cheap, you wouldn't want to bring in a joint venture partner. That may not stay that way forever, but financing is incredibly cheap and available. And I wish Phelps Dodge hadn't given up the interest in Morenci or the interest in Cerro Verde. So if we got good projects, we'll look at the most efficient way to finance it. That could well be -- could be partners because lots of people want to be our partners. And then others may have projects that we have the opportunity to join in on. There could be opportunities in the M&A market. But all of that is part of this really bright future that I see for Freeport. The vision right now is focused on getting 2021 to be as successful as 2020 was. And when that happens, when that happens, and we got long-term run rates at Grasberg, Josh and his team has fine-tuned our business in the Americas. We got this Lone Star project, don't overlook that. That could be a new Morenci down the road. This is just a company that's really well situated to generate cash, not have to do anything to have a sustainable future, but having the world open to us to do lots of different things. It's really, really exciting. 
All right. Thank you all for participating. We look forward to reporting our progress in 2021 and take care of yourselves, your families, the people around you. We're not over the hump yet on COVID, but just hang in there, this life is going to get better. Thanks for participating."

Earlier this morning, we reported our fourth quarter and full year 2020 operating and financial results and a copy of today's press release and our sl",660,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Fourth Quarter Conference Call. 
Earlier this morning, we reported our fourth quarter and full year 2020 operating and financial results and a copy of today's press release and our slides are available on our website at fcx.com. Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website home page and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. 
Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on this call will include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described on our SEC filings. 
On the call today are Richard Adkerson. We also have a number of our senior team with us today: Mark Johnson is here, Josh Olmsted, Mike Kendrick, Rick Coleman and Steve Higgins. I'll start by briefly summarizing the results for the quarter, and then we'll turn the call over to Richard, who will be reviewing our outlook. After our prepared remarks, we'll be taking questions. 
Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $708 million or $0.48 per share in the fourth quarter, and $599 million or $0.41 per share for the year ended 2020. We had a number of special items in the fourth quarter, which are detailed on VII of our press release. Those total net credits of $142 million or $0.10 a share mainly associated with the gain on the sale of assets and partly offset by charges for a litigation settlement and international tax matters. 
Our adjusted net income attributable to common stock after these items totaled $566 million or $0.39 per share for the fourth quarter of 2020. Our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA for the fourth quarter approximated $1.9 billion, and we generated $4.2 billion of adjusted EBITDA for the year 2020. A reconciliation of our EBITDA is available on Page 38 of the slide materials. 
We had a very strong fourth quarter. Our sales volumes of copper of 866 million pounds were 3% above our October 2020 estimate. And our gold sales of 293,000 ounces were 9% higher than our October 2020 guidance. These primarily reflected higher copper sales from Cerro Verde and in Indonesia and higher gold ore grades in Indonesia. We benefited during the quarter from improved pricing for both copper and gold. The realized price of copper was $3.40 per pound in the fourth quarter, and that was 24% above the year ago quarterly average. 
Fourth quarter gold realized price was $18.70 per ounce, and that was about 25% above the year ago average. Our unit net cash costs came in at an average of $1.28 per pound of copper, and that was lower than what we had guided to in October. Notably, in the fourth quarter, we generated very strong cash flows, which totaled $1.3 billion in the quarter. And that exceeded our capital spending of just under $400 million during the period. We were -- together with our asset sale proceeds in the fourth quarter, we were successful in reducing our net debt by about $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter alone, and we ended the year with net debt approximating $6.1 billion. We had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility, consolidated cash of $3.7 billion, and we're in a strong position as we look forward to generating increasing cash flows as we go forward. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to our slide materials that you can reference on our website."

It's great to be able to talk to you today about our performance in 2020 and our positive outlook. It's been a head spinning year. When we think back to March and April and all of the challenges we were facing at that point and the world was facing, to have -- be at this point is really head spinning in many ways and remarkable, but it's been quite a year for Freeport. I really hope you and your families and colleagues are staying safe and well. We've all made personal sacrifices. It's been a tough year for us at Freeport. The progress our company has made has really been a God send as we've all been working in ways that are so different than in the past. 
We remain focused on working to protect our health and safety of our people. We're supporting the communities where we operate during this crisis. We're really encouraged by the scientific advances with therapeutics and now that vaccines are finally being distributed. But all -- we know all this is going to take time to have the distribution widely placed, and we're all looking forward to returning to normal lives. But for the time being, we're staying diligent with our protocols. And these have really proven to be so effective for us at Freeport. 
I'm immensely proud of our Freeport team for their response to the COVID challenge. Navigating through a pandemic like this that none of us have ever seen and with this degree of duration has been difficult for everyone and all the communities around us. Our team has demonstrated real resilience, confidence and drive throughout all of this, come together to address the situation proactively while we've maintained focus on continuing to protect and enhance our business, and that's worked for the benefit of all stakeholders. 
On Slide 3, we show the highlights for 2020, a year of extraordinary accomplishment for Freeport. We laid a strong foundation for future growth and cash flows and profitabilities, which is exactly what we set out to do and had a strategy to do. And to have been able to achieve what we did in the face of COVID is nothing short of remarkable. 
Earlier in 2020, we announced in April, we moved quickly to develop new operating protocols to maintain our business's continuity. We totally redesigned our operating plans from what we had announced this time a year ago to safeguard our business, protect our liquidity and to be responsive to the really heightened uncertainty that we were facing and everyone's facing. 
At Freeport, all hands were on deck to build an optimal plan. Each of our operating teams around the globe played an employment role in developing and then executing these aggressive plans. We just had a tremendous buy-in by everyone, and that enabled us to execute the plans so well. A big positive from this process that our team's collaboration, which has always been a strength of our organization, is now more strong than it's ever been. Employee engagement, commitment, energy and morale at a very high level. We effectively executed the revised plans, had a big focus on cost and capital management. And then significantly, we advanced the largest block caving operation in the world at our Grasberg mine in Indonesia. You'll see we met our key milestones for this massive multiyear, multibillion-dollar undertaking. At the same time, we also completed on time and on budget the Lone Star project in Arizona, and this is a potential future keystone asset for our company. The progress we made this year set the foundation for strong cash flows literally for years to come. 
We turned the corner during 2020 to begin generating sustainable and substantial free cash flow. Beginning in the third quarter of 2020 and now continuing in the fourth quarter and as we look forward, we've generated and are generating significant free cash flow and that enabled us to reduce our net debt by $2.4 billion in the second half of the year. 
Slide 4 highlights key financial metrics by comparing our actual results for 2020 with the plan we presented to you last January prior to the onset of the pandemic. So this is not the revised April plan but the one that we had before we knew what we were facing. In that comparison, our unit net cash cost for 2020 were 15% lower than the January 2020 guidance. EBITDA and operating cash flow improved by over 25%. Capital spending was reduced by 29%. We also generated approximately $550 million in after-tax proceeds from the sale of a noncash flow-producing assets that we disposed of this year. 
We ended the year with $2.7 billion lower debt than our original January plan. Think about that. Facing COVID, with all the uncertainties, having to make the changes and then coming back to do so much better than we set out to do before COVID was known about. This was accomplished at an average copper price realization of $2.95 for the year, 10% a pound higher than our plan, $0.10 per ounce, just $0.10 and well below the current price. The team did an outstanding job. We're strongly positioned for the future. 
In addition to the strong operating and financial performance in 2020, we achieved new milestones in the ESG area. And that's shown on Slide 5. We committed to the Copper Mark. This is a new assurance framework developed by the International Copper Association and our Steve Higgins is now the President of ICA to promote and demonstrate responsible production practices, focusing on meeting the United Nations Sustainability Development Goals. Big step forward. We established climate targets and added transparency with a new climate report, which is now available on our website. 
We took a leading role with ICMM, International Council of Metals and Mining, beginning over a year ago when it served as the industry representative in a multi-stakeholder initiative to develop a new tailing standard for the mining industry following the disasters in Brazil and then the subsequent development of implementation guidance for ICMM members. This was a major undertaking by the industry and by our company, which took a lead in the process, and it reflects the importance of managing tailings storage facilities safely and responsibly. After serving 2 terms as Chairman of ICMM more than 10 years ago, I recently accepted a new term as Chairman. ICMM currently has 27 CEO council members from the largest global mining and metals companies, and I'm leading a strategic review of the organization to meet the increasing importance of ESG issues facing our industry. 
We advanced our inclusion and diversity initiatives, which is core to our values at Freeport. We invested in our communities and continue to expand organizational resources in this effort. Worker safety is our highest priority, and we showed that with what we did in response to COVID. 
Our safety statistics in 2020, measured by interest rates -- in incidence rates met our targets. Fatality position continues to be a focus of our work safety management. Regrettably, we had 5 fatalities in our operations last year. 
On Slide 6, you've heard me say for a long time that the copper price would benefit from its favorable fundamental outlooks. Prices rose significantly in late 2020 in recognition of copper's favorable demand trends and the limited ability of the industry to increase supply. The recent price move is significant, but note that prices are still lower than they were just over 10 years ago -- or almost 10 years ago. Arguably, the fundamental outlook for copper today is better than it was 10 years ago. China is leading the recovery and global stimulus measures in countries around the world are also being positive for growth in copper demand. Freeport is the leading -- is a leading producer of copper, and this commodity is critical to the economy of the future. It's essential to support global growth and in broad scale the economic activity, but it is also essentially strategic for technologies required for the transition to a global, cleaner energy future. That's on the front burner for everyone. 
More and more, we are seeing adoption of policies to reduce carbon emissions around the globe. 70% of the world's copper supply is used to deliver electricity. As clean energy initiatives are implemented, the intensity of copper use will increase. 
The chart on Slide 7 shows that copper utilization in electric vehicles and in the generation of renewable power is more than 4 times greater per unit than for traditional vehicles and power generation. CRU estimates that copper demand for electrification and renewables will increase significantly over the coming years. In a relatively short time frame, global demand just from these green initiatives could approximate the size of today's U.S. copper market. As demand accelerates, copper supply will continue to struggle to keep up. And this supports a favorable near-term and long-term fundamental outlook. 
Its current situation echoes the early 2000s when I became CEO of Freeport at a time when Chinese demand appeared and accelerated in such a dramatic fashion without a supply response, which created the commodity super cycle and sharp increases in copper prices. Very similar to what we're facing today. 
Turning to Indonesia on Slide 8. Our PT-FI team is delivering really impressive results. During 2020, we built the momentum for the ramp-up of our massive underground mines. And by the fourth quarter, we have reached nearly 70% of the targeted annual run rates for sales volumes. This is something we were looking forward to beginning in the mid-1990s when we designed the original pit, which is now completed and is something that we've been investing in over the past 15 years. And to see it coming together like it is, is truly gratifying. And Mark Johnson and his team have just done an exceptional job. 
Continued growth during 2021 is expected to enable us to reach our full annualized targets by the end of this year. Considering the operating health challenges we faced in Papua, this is notable and striking. The team stayed on schedule, met our objectives. The project is massive and complex. And we did this by designing and maintaining effective COVID protocols in a very large workplace in a very challenging remote location. Our progress with ramp-up has reduced risk for PT-FI's underground mine significantly. 
The major risk as we started this was developing the infrastructure. The infrastructure is in place. There's always risk in mining. It's inherent in our business, but the major risk for this underground development are behind us. And we are confident and have a track record of managing the types of risk we'll be facing going forward. We can't make them go away, but we can manage them. And so we're really pleased with where we stand with that process. 
We're also continuing discussions currently regarding the new smelter in Indonesia. In early 2020, we requested a delay in agreed time schedule for completing of a construction of the new smelter at a site in Eastern Java near Gresik, which is near the existing PT smelting facility. We haven't been able to progress work there because of COVID issues for the local workforce and international contracts. This is a greenfield smelter with a total cost of about $3 billion. That number continues to be refined and changed. And this project would be debt-financed by PT-FI, the Indonesian entity. 
Over the last several months, PT-FI and our partner and majority shareholder in PT-FI, the Indonesian state-owned company MIND ID, have been discussing with the government alternatives to this commitment to build a new smelter, which was reflected in our IUPK mining license granted in December 2018. During the fourth quarter, we advanced discussions with the majority owner of the existing PT smelting facility at Gresik for a 30% expansion to add smelting capacity in Indonesia and partially satisfy our commitment to the government. Commercial and financing discussions for these expansions are being advanced. Engineering is in progress. Initial estimates indicate that this project could be done for $250 million and be done efficiently in the current TCRC environment and it would partially meet our obligation to the government. 
Then separately, at the request of the government, at the request of the government, PT-FI is currently engaged in discussion with a third party regarding the potential for the development of a new greenfield smelter at an alternate location away from Eastern Java. This project would be in lieu of PT-FI's constructing the new greenfield smelter that I mentioned above. 
The third party -- a third party would lead the development for this smelter and arrange its financing. PT-FI would commit to be a supplier of concentrate for the project, and the partners and the government are working expeditiously to reach a decision on the path forward. 
On Slide 10, we show our 2021 priorities for our ongoing efforts in creating values for our company. We built -- we were building on the progress of 2020 by focusing on the execution of plans to grow production volumes, manage costs and capital spending efficiently. We're expanding our recent innovation efforts, applying technology and innovating -- innovative management processes in our operations around the world. And all of this, while we manage and are sensitive to our responsibilities to workers, communities, governments and other stakeholders. 
We look forward to resuming cash returns to shareholders during 2021, and we'll be in a position to do that, and we will be in discussions with our Board on taking actions. We will be in a period now and far -- for the long term of harvesting cash flows now that we are completing the major long-term investment program in Indonesia. And we're discussing with the Board a financial policy that would allow and enable a near-term resumption of the dividend and then, over time, a performance-based shareholder return policy. Significantly, we have recommenced work we suspended early in 2020 to evaluate and advance future organic growth opportunities from our large portfolio of undeveloped reserves and mineral resources, and we look forward to doing that. 
The efforts of 2020, we worked with our team over many years now, has enabled us to increase margins and cash flow substantially for 2021 below and beyond. At $3.50 copper, we're on a path to nearly double EBITDA from 2020 levels. Copper sales for 2021 are projected to increase 20% over 2020. Gold volumes are projected to increase by over 50%. Our unit net cash costs of production will decline. And this is occurring at a time for improved pricing for copper. I recall in an earlier conference call like this, I said an ideal situation for Freeport would be able to be completing the Grasberg expansion at times of good copper prices. And here we are. 
The significantly higher cash flows will enable us to maintain a strong balance sheet, build value in our business, return substantial cash flows to shareholders. 
As shown on Slide 12, we have a long-lived portfolio of mineral reserves. Reserve life for our proved and probable reserves are over 30 years. We have substantial options for the potential to expand our reserve base from our large inventory of metal resources beyond reported reserves. All of this is associated with brownfield expansions of our existing ore bodies. What this means is that for our company to have long-term success, we are not required to have success in exploration. We hope we do. We're not required to do deals. Strategic opportunities may come to us. But we've got this base already in our portfolio that provides for a sustainable long-term future for Freeport. 
Slide 13 highlights the organic projects we are now assessing. During 2020, to conserve cash, we paused work on our expansion projects. We're now reengaged a broad range of opportunities. During 2021, we will be developing a ranking of these projects to guide our thinking on sequencing and long-term planning. We have no plans to increase substantially capital spending on projects in the near term. But in the long term, these growth opportunities will be approached in a measured and disciplined way. 
I'll close with Slide 14, which we -- which I have titled the Freeport Edge, which is the term we're using internally around our company. Our management team at Freeport has extensive experience in managing this business. Leadership teams across the company are seasoned, value-oriented and intensely engaged. We have a management structure that is collaborative. We're experienced in working together, and we're decisive. To make a decision, we execute. We recognize our responsibilities we undertake when we're granted hard earned license to operate. And we never cut corners on important issues. 
Looking at our team at Freeport, it is a combination of managements with long tenure and experience. We also have a cadre of younger managers who bring new ideas, approaches and energies. We have strategic new hires who bring outside perspectives. We've had 3 senior executives who've retired at the end of their careers over the last 2 years. Internal replacements were promoted and performing effectively. And this just demonstrates the depth of talent in our organization. 
Freeport is foremost in copper. Our portfolio of assets is large and high quality. We're an established industry leader, operate mines that are among the largest in the world. Our assets are long-lived and durable with embedded options, reserve, resource growth. We have strong operating franchises in the United States, South America and Indonesia. We're a reliable supplier to the global copper industry, have industry-leading technical capabilities, supported by a strong track record of project execution and business management over many years. We've earned the trust and respect of our partners, our customers, suppliers, financial important markets and most importantly, our workers, communities and host countries where we operate. 
Our block caving experience is among the most extensive and long-standing in the history of the global mining industry. We've been operating block caves in Indonesia since the early 1980s. We have an important molybdenum block caving operation in Colorado. And this is critically important as we transition Grasberg to become the largest block caving operation in the world. 
I'll close before turning to your questions by thanking our people and recognizing their strength, resiliency and performance. I'm proud to be part of this team, and I look forward to continue to be part of the team and to participate in our future successes. We will build on our accomplishments as we -- as will be depicted on our 2020 annual report to shareholders. We are charging ahead responsibly, reliably and relentlessly. 
Thank you for your attention. And operator, let's open the lines for questions."

I'll be brief. Continuing with the slide presentation on Slide 16. We provide some additional details on the quarter and our operating plans. We're continuing in the U.S",751,"Richard, I'm just going to make a few comments, and then we can take the questions. I'll be brief. 
Continuing with the slide presentation on Slide 16. We provide some additional details on the quarter and our operating plans. We're continuing in the U.S. to ramp up production from the new Lone Star mine. And in January of this year, we commenced a restart of the Chino mine, which we had previously announced. In South America, we're continuing to operate Cerro Verde at a reduced rate of roughly 360,000 tonnes per day. We did a little more than that in the fourth quarter. And our team is prepared to increase rates to a level of 400,000 tonnes, which is about where we were -- tonnes per day, which was about where we were pre-COVID after the COVID restrictions are lifted. At El Abra, we've incorporated in our latest plans an increase in operating rates, which will provide additional volumes beginning in 2022. And as we've talked about at Grasberg, we made excellent progress in the fourth quarter and are continuing to execute the ramp-up plan to achieve the targeted metal run rates by the end of this year. 
Slide 17, we present the outlook for 2021. The guidance is largely in line with our previous estimates. We made some minor revisions to 2021 volumes. These were largely timing in nature to reflect the latest Grasberg mine plans. And we've updated our cost models to incorporate the current pricing for energy currencies and ongoing maintenance programs. We expect to sell just over 3.8 billion pounds of copper in 2021 at an average unit net cash cost of $1.25 per pound. And at $3.50 copper, this would generate about $8 billion of EBITDA and $5.5 billion in operating cash flows for the year 2021, which is nearly double the 2020 levels. And as you'll see, we expect further growth in 2022 and 2023, which is shown on Slide 18, where we provide a 3-year outlook for volumes. After expecting growth of nearly 20% in copper, over 50% for gold in 2021 versus 2020, we're projecting further growth of 13% in copper volumes and over 20% in gold volumes for the year 2022. And these projects have been in development for some time. Most of the capital is behind us, which gives us a runway here of generating growth in cash flows and margins. 
The buildup in volumes for 2021 is reflected on Slide 19. 
And on Slide 20, we show the significance of the cash flow generation using these volumes and our cost estimates. And we show a range of prices from $3.50 to $4 copper, holding gold flat at $18.50 per ounce and molybdenum at $9 per pound. But you can see that the growth in volumes at very low incremental cost results in EBITDA ranging from over $10 billion per annum on average for the years 2022 and 2023 to over $12 billion per year at $4 copper. And operating cash flows, which are net of our taxes and interest costs, would range from $7 billion at $3.50 per pound of copper to over $8.5 billion at $4 copper. And as Richard was mentioning, the $4 copper is still well below historical periods of demand strength. 
The cash flows generation are expected to be significantly above our planned capital spending, which will provide substantial free cash flows as we go forward. 
On Slide 21 includes our projected capital of $2.3 billion in 2021. That excludes potential spending on the Indonesian smelter, which would be debt-financed and is still under evaluation. We're maintaining our basic capital plans. We're being very disciplined about capital spend. The 2021 capital is roughly, as you'll see, about $100 million higher than the previous forecast, and that incorporates an acceleration of some mining equipment investments to provide capacity assurance for our plans. We're in a strong financial position, as you see. We've entered a period of exceptional free cash flow generation. The long-lived asset base and ongoing cost and capital management will provide the ability to continue to strengthen our balance sheet, provide cash returns to shareholders and build additional values in our asset base. 
Regarding financial policy, we're working with our Board on a shareholder return policy that would balance our priorities while providing increasing returns to shareholders based on this performance. It's a very exciting time for Freeport, and we're staying very focused on continuing our momentum. 
And now, operator, we'd like to take questions."

And we'll be in a position to recommend to the Board to reinstate the dividend. But there's no need for further financial metrics with that when you look at our improved financial situation when we were paying the dividend before. 
The issue with the growth project is one that's requires more work and requires some time in evaluating the market as we go forward. They range in size, but the projects are large ones. We have a significant expansion opportunity in El Abra in Chile with our partner, CODELCO, and it's on the order of the project we did at Cerro Verde several years ago. And we have a series of projects in the U.S. that initially aren't as large, although down the road, there are some very large ones available. 
The U.S. has some advantages. Tax rates are very favorable, and we have a very large loss carryforward. So we don't pay taxes in the U.S. for years to come. We own most of the lands in fees, so there's no royalties. And so when you cut out taxes and royalties in the U.S. versus foreign economics and with a favorable energy situation in the U.S. and community support for workers, there's just a lot of advantages there. 
So we had to suspend this work because of the uncertainties of COVID. We're now -- Rick Coleman and his team are digging back into it, and we're going to be doing trade-offs of these individual projects as we go forward in 2021. And we'll be able to report to you about our intentions. We -- we're constantly approached by others in the industry who would like to be our partners in these projects. And so there will be a lot of opportunities there. And it's to say today, we're just resuming the work that we were engaged in previously."

We have rights to operate under a shareholders agreement, we being FCX. MIND ID owns 51%. So it's a separate entity. And it is the entity that would construct and finance the smelter. So it's no 50-50 sharing. I mean it is -- it'd be financed in that entity. It's a substantial entity with no external debt. From time to time, there's some borrowings from FCX, but  to meet working capital needs. But it's a substantial entity that clearly can debt finance this entity on its own. So that's the way this thing would be approached and financed. 
Now we do consolidate that entity because of our operating rights. It's a very positive thing that we do have the ability to do that under the accounting rules because that way, we can report it as part of our global operations. So to the extent that alternative is followed and PT-FI takes the lead in constructing and financing the smelter, the debt that it incurs would be consolidated on our balance sheet, but there wouldn't be obligations of FCX to provide funding for it."

So at this point, it's -- I think it's fair to still consider we may have ways of reducing the capital, and we're working towards those, but to think about both those projects together and the precious metal facilities all being a $3 billion project for PT-FI. Now this new alternative would result in not having to build the greenfield smelter. Another party would come in and do that, arrange it and finance it. So the debt would not be incurred by PT-FI, okay? We're still in the process of negotiating TCRC rates for that. There will be some need for financial support because of the market. But there's an opportunity for us to end up in a much more favorable situation for PT-FI if we're successful in these negotiations. And the government considers it positive because it would be a step in their own government initiatives to develop industry in Indonesia. This would tie into some nickel operations and potentially some downstream battery operations and the like for Indonesia. 
So strategically, the government of Indonesia sees it's positive. It could be positive for PT-FI. And so that's the basis for our deal. And now we're in the process of negotiating the terms of that deal."

I mean, there's no way to hide it over the oil and gas deal in 2011. He thought it was a really good deal for the company. I did not. The Board decided to do it, and it caused the significant problems when commodity prices fell.

The 2 major ones are the Grasberg Block Cave and the Deep MLZ. And each of those have separate headings. So this is not like a single mine or even 2 major mines, but a collection of mines with a common infrastructure. And as we've developed the access to the ore bodies and expanded those, that gives us a lot of flexibility to deal with operating issues that may come up with particular sections of the mine where we're mining. And there'll be things like that, that will come up, wet muck and so forth. We haven't had much of that yet. But here's where we are. We mentioned just how well Grasberg Block Cave is going, and we're ahead of schedule on that. Grasberg -- the Deep MLZ mine has had the challenges over time with having the seismicity events that are mining related, not natural. And we've implemented a program of using fracking technology to precondition the ore bodies so that we could leave the pressures that cause these. We still face them from time to time, but we've got great procedures for dealing with it. 
They're different ore bodies, different settings. The Grasberg Block Cave is ahead. The Deep MLZ is maybe a month or 2 behind. But Mark, talk to us a little bit about your perceptions on how we're dealing with the Deep MLZ."

Chris, Deep MLZ, as Richard mentioned in the fourth quarter, we were ahead on all the development aspects, the -- where we were on target on drawbelling, undercutting. And where we had some challenges was in the -- in just the material flow. And what",464,"Yes. Chris, Deep MLZ, as Richard mentioned in the fourth quarter, we were ahead on all the development aspects, the -- where we were on target on drawbelling, undercutting. And where we had some challenges was in the -- in just the material flow. And what I mean from there is taking the material from the extraction level, getting it through the rock breaker or getting it to the grizzlies through the internal ore passes, the 60-meter long ore passes and getting them into the trucks that take it to the crusher. 
The problems that we had there was we deal from everything from very, very coarse blocking material to fine sticky material. And we're coming up with methods that I'm confident will address that and allow us to take both the big stuff and the fine stuff and run them through these ore passes. It's something that we saw at the initial stages of DMLZ, and we're working our way through that. 
On the GBC, the Grasberg Block Cave, we had a very good year. We were on drawbelling, undercutting. We were ahead on our tonnage rates for the fourth quarter, marginally ahead, and we're in a good position there. We build our second -- we'll complete the second crusher at GBC in April of this year, which will be a major milestone. We continue to develop the rail haulage, and there's a major milestone that we'll achieve in the second quarter to let these trains run in a loop rather than out and back. 
And that's going to increase our production from our overall mine system. So both mines are tracking well. And as Richard mentioned, we do have the DOZ. It's a mature mine. But it hit targets -- Big Gossan, our stope mine, was -- we had very good results this last year, last quarter, in particular. So it's -- we've had some pluses and minuses, but overall, we're in a very good position entering this year. And in -- particularly in the GBC, we've hit our peak in our drawbelling in 2020. 
And just associated with the mine plan and consistent with our long-range plans, that starts to tail off. We don't need as many drawbells to continue to sustain the ramp-up in production. Deep MLZ, we pretty much stay steady for the next 3 years on drawbelling and undercutting. So the next 2 years is really just doing more of the same of growing these mines. There's no real rate increase in the amount of development. In fact, it's flatter or dropping off. And it's just a matter of continuing to be very consistent in how we've -- going forward as to what we've been able to demonstrate over the last couple of years and particularly in 2020."

There might have been some ones or twos that are different, but it's not anything that was significant in our forecast.
As Richard mentioned, it's more about this -- where we are in the ramping up of the tonnes, and it's more in line. Any changes in the tonnage is more a reflection of this material flow challenge that we're undertaking. But it's just marginally behind. And at the same time, the GBC is marginally ahead. And so the ramp-up rates are very consistent from one forecast to the other. Some slight changes in grades that are nothing significant. It's not drilling results. It's not any changes in reserves. It's simply where we're actually drawing. There's some -- at the end of every quarter, we reflect what we've done, and then we build that into what we're doing forward. So there's really no significant change in our underground plans, both at Deep MLZ and GBC.
The other 2 mines, DOZ and Big Gossan, are both very consistent. In fact, in Big Gossan, we've changed our stope sequencing a bit. That's going to add some metal. So we'll continue to look for opportunities and to reflect our actual production and operation over the previous quarters."

We're going to try to produce more gold, which we're able to do in 2020. And then we adjust our plans for that. So we're -- there's nothing here other than we're right on our targets, and everything is going as planned.
The financial policy, I'll go back and say what I've said before. We have ongoing and formal discussions with Board members. We have formal Board members coming up. My anticipation is that there will be a restoration of our dividend and then a financial policy that will give guidance to the market of how we will be dividing cash flows in the future for further debt reduction. Although, quite frankly, we're -- if you look at our cash flows that we talked to you about today and in a $3.50 copper price, we get down to about $3 million of net debt at the end of 2022. So we certainly can support higher level of debts than that. And that means there's plenty of cash to enhance cash returns to shareholders and then have availability of funds and depending on how we structure it for future organic growth projects when we decide to initiate those. So restoration of dividend, a financial policy that will provide for increasing cash returns to shareholders over the long term with funds available for organic growth investments."

And that's what allowed us to be as successful as we were in 2020. 
And as we look at 2021 and beyond, we continue to leverage, whether that be data analytics, the AI and how that applies, the tools that are out there, and we look for opportunities. A lot of those things are embedded in the plans today, but I think it's also going to drive additional things as we go forward. That won't require the investments or the dollars that we had thought about previously, just from the fact that we've got it internalized and we're leveraging a lot of the energy, passion and excitement of our workforce and tapping into ideas that are allowing us to add incremental benefits across the organization from an efficiency perspective as well as from a cost perspective. 
And so it's really exciting to see the folks at all levels of the organization have the opportunity and take the opportunity to provide ideas that then turn into significant value for us as an organization. And so I just continue to be encouraged with our ability to execute on those things and identify opportunities going forward to leverage data, leverage analytics and put the right information in the right people's hands at the right time to make good decisions."

If we were sitting here, as we normally do around our conference desk in Phoenix, Kathleen would be kicking me out off the table because that question is just like giving a monkey a machine gun. 2003, we had gone through",716,"So we're working remotely, Lucas. If we were sitting here, as we normally do around our conference desk in Phoenix, Kathleen would be kicking me out off the table because that question is just like giving a monkey a machine gun. 2003, we had gone through a real tough time in copper with the economic issues of the late 1990s, the global recession, the global slowdown. 
Copper prices had dropped at one point to below $0.70. And I recall, and it was at a -- Timna, at a Merrill Lynch conference in Ireland, that was my first conference as CEO, it was right before I made CEO. And the price of copper just dipped over $0.70, nobody in the industry thought it could go beyond $1 within the foreseeable future. And everybody was running the business. So what happened? China emerged in a way nobody expected, created a whole new element of demand. Historically, whenever copper prices jumped up, the industry had projects primarily in Latin America to invest in. 
And the industry was widely divided and there'd be new investment. Supplies would come on, the business cycle would turn down and copper prices would drop. This time, China added, in 2003, a permanent element of new demand that was beyond the traditional demand from copper that was tied into global industrial production. And there was widespread expectation that the industry would invest and add new supplies. I remember my partnership, Goodyear, got up at that conference and said in price of copper, he hoped that the price wouldn't rise too much because it would create uneconomic investment. 
Well, what happened was the industry started looking for new projects then and geologically, they weren't there, and there were all these other barriers to investment. So we had higher prices without a supply response. That led us to do the Phelps Dodge deal in 2007. We're -- our market cap in 2003 was $6 billion. It was $12 billion at the Phelps Dodge deal. We did a $38 billion business combination, the biggest in the industry, lived through the financial crisis and then emerged in 2011 as a company with a $60 billion market cap and no debt. 
So what do we like here? The reason that I feel this is an echo is that we still have a world that's being burdened by the economic slowdown with COVID. While there had been recoveries in pockets of the economy, there's been stimulus by governments, and China has recovered much faster than we heard about earlier, think about a world where we had a slowdown to the extent we did in 2020 and copper inventories are at levels that we hadn't seen since the mid-2000s. 
And so here we are, and we just talked about how there's not a huge rush to invest in new projects. All the major companies want to grow copper as part of their portfolios. That's been the case since the mid-2000s, and they've been challenged in doing that. Projects today around the world, geologically, are more difficult, less quality than they were, underground, lower grades. You look at Cerro Verde, Cobre Panama. These are big, low-grade projects that require huge investments in infrastructure and equipment and mill processing. And then you have these barriers to production that keep some attractive projects around the world from going forward. 
You have political issues in countries that -- in Africa, it's challenged. Latin America is having political issues. Indonesia's been what it's been. So I do feel that if the world's global economy recovers in a reasonable way, not an extreme way, and we have this big move towards -- look at all the stats that are coming about for electric vehicles in the United States. I mean, think about what General Motors is doing and what China is doing. 
You think about the change in the global perception about climate change in the United States, forest fires, hurricanes. I mean, this is something that's going to have to be addressed. And when it is addressed, it's going to require tremendous amounts of infrastructure spending, extraordinary amounts. And in all of those elements of spending, there's an element of copper of significance into it. So that's why I feel like we are echoing 2003 today."

Then after Phel",454,"So again, yes. I look over the shoulder. If you look back at Freeport, when copper prices began rising in 2003, 2004, we returned tremendous amounts of cash to investors out of Grasberg. We were like a royalty trust or an MLP or something. Then after Phelps Dodge, we delevered very quickly, and we start returning to paying dividends again. And we were well positioned in 2011 to continue to do that. The Board decided to invest in oil and gas and took it away. So here we are, coming back from the situation that we are now. We don't need a commodities boom to generate lots of cash to return to shareholders. 
At $3.50 copper, you see what the numbers are. I think copper could go much higher than $3.50. I can't guarantee it, but in my gut, and Timna, that's one of the reasons I want to keep working. I think it's going to be really a special time. And when that happens, we will be able to really return cash to shareholders in a substantial way. This question of investing, I mean, right now, money is so cheap, you wouldn't want to bring in a joint venture partner. That may not stay that way forever, but financing is incredibly cheap and available. 
And I wish Phelps Dodge hadn't given up the interest in Morenci or the interest in Cerro Verde. So if we got good projects, we'll look at the most efficient way to finance it. That could well be -- could be partners because lots of people want to be our partners. And then others may have projects that we have the opportunity to join in on. There could be opportunities in the M&A market. But all of that is part of this really bright future that I see for Freeport. The vision right now is focused on getting 2021 to be as successful as 2020 was. 
And when that happens, when that happens, and we got long-term run rates at Grasberg, Josh and his team has fine-tuned our business in the Americas. We got this Lone Star project, don't overlook that. That could be a new Morenci down the road. This is just a company that's really well situated to generate cash, not have to do anything to have a sustainable future but having the world open to us to do lots of different things. It's really, really exciting. 
All right. Thank you all for participating. We look forward to reporting our progress in 2021. And take care of yourselves, your families, the people around you. We're not over the hump yet on COVID, but just hang in there. This life is going to get better. Thanks for participating."

Earlier this morning, we reported our fourth quarter and full year 2020 operating and financial results and a copy of today's press release and our slides are available on our website at fcx.com. Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website home page and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. 
Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on this call will include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described on our SEC filings. 
On the call today are Richard Adkerson. We also have a number of our senior team with us today: Mark Johnson is here, Josh Olmsted, Mike Kendrick, Rick Coleman and Steve Higgins. I'll start by briefly summarizing the results for the quarter, and then we'll turn the call over to Richard, who will be reviewing our outlook. After our prepared remarks, we'll be taking questions. 
Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $708 million or $0.48 per share in the fourth quarter, and $599 million or $0.41 per share for the year ended 2020. We had a number of special items in the fourth quarter, which are detailed on VII of our press release. Those total net credits of $142 million or $0.10 a share mainly associated with the gain on the sale of assets and partly offset by charges for a litigation settlement and international tax matters. 
Our adjusted net income attributable to common stock after these items totaled $566 million or $0.39 per share for the fourth quarter of 2020. Our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA for the fourth quarter approximated $1.9 billion, and we generated $4.2 billion of adjusted EBITDA for the year 2020. A reconciliation of our EBITDA is available on Page 38 of the slide materials. 
We had a very strong fourth quarter. Our sales volumes of copper of 866 million pounds were 3% above our October 2020 estimate. And our gold sales of 293,000 ounces were 9% higher than our October 2020 guidance. These primarily reflected higher copper sales from Cerro Verde and in Indonesia and higher gold ore grades in Indonesia. We benefited during the quarter from improved pricing for both copper and gold. The realized price of copper was $3.40 per pound in the fourth quarter, and that was 24% above the year ago quarterly average. 
Fourth quarter gold realized price was $18.70 per ounce, and that was about 25% above the year ago average. Our unit net cash costs came in at an average of $1.28 per pound of copper, and that was lower than what we had guided to in October. Notably, in the fourth quarter, we generated very strong cash flows, which totaled $1.3 billion in the quarter. And that exceeded our capital spending of just under $400 million during the period. We were -- together with our asset sale proceeds in the fourth quarter, we were successful in reducing our net debt by about $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter alone, and we ended the year with net debt approximating $6.1 billion. We had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility, consolidated cash of $3.7 billion, and we're in a strong position as we look forward to generating increasing cash flows as we go forward. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to our slide materials that you can reference on our website."

It's great to be able to talk to you today about our performance in 2020 and our positive outlook. It's been a head-spinning year. When we think back to March and April and all of the challenges we were facing at that point and the world was facing, to have -- be at this point is really head spinning in many ways and remarkable, but it's been quite a year for Freeport. I really hope you and your families and colleagues are staying safe and well. We've all made personal sacrifices. It's been a tough year for us at Freeport. The progress our company has made has really been a godsend as we've all been working in ways that are so different than in the past. 
We remain focused on working to protect our health and safety of our people. We're supporting the communities where we operate during this crisis. We're really encouraged by the scientific advances with therapeutics and now that vaccines are finally being distributed. But all -- we know all this is going to take time to have the distribution widely placed, and we're all looking forward to returning to normal lives. But for the time being, we're staying diligent with our protocols. And these have really proven to be so effective for us at Freeport. 
I'm immensely proud of our Freeport team for their response to the COVID challenge. Navigating through a pandemic like this that none of us have ever seen and with this degree of duration has been difficult for everyone and all the communities around us. Our team has demonstrated real resilience, confidence and drive throughout all of this, come together to address the situation proactively while we've maintained focus on continuing to protect and enhance our business, and that's worked for the benefit of all stakeholders. 
On Slide 3, we show the highlights for 2020, a year of extraordinary accomplishment for Freeport. We laid a strong foundation for future growth and cash flows and profitabilities, which is exactly what we set out to do and had a strategy to do. And to have been able to achieve what we did in the face of COVID is nothing short of remarkable. 
Earlier in 2020, we announced in April, we moved quickly to develop new operating protocols to maintain our business's continuity. We totally redesigned our operating plans from what we had announced this time a year ago to safeguard our business, protect our liquidity and to be responsive to the really heightened uncertainty that we were facing and everyone's facing. 
At Freeport, all hands were on deck to build an optimal plan. Each of our operating teams around the globe played an employment role in developing and then executing these aggressive plans. We just had a tremendous buy-in by everyone, and that enabled us to execute the plans so well. A big positive from this process that our team's collaboration, which has always been a strength of our organization, is now more strong than it's ever been. Employee engagement, commitment, energy and morale at a very high level. We effectively executed the revised plans, had a big focus on cost and capital management. And then significantly, we advanced the largest block caving operation in the world at our Grasberg mine in Indonesia. You'll see we met our key milestones for this massive multiyear, multibillion-dollar undertaking. At the same time, we also completed on time and on budget the Lone Star project in Arizona, and this is a potential future keystone asset for our company. The progress we made this year set the foundation for strong cash flows literally for years to come. 
We turned the corner during 2020 to begin generating sustainable and substantial free cash flow. Beginning in the third quarter of 2020 and now continuing in the fourth quarter and as we look forward, we've generated and are generating significant free cash flow and that enabled us to reduce our net debt by $2.4 billion in the second half of the year. 
Slide 4 highlights key financial metrics by comparing our actual results for 2020 with the plan we presented to you last January prior to the onset of the pandemic. So this is not the revised April plan but the one that we had before we knew what we were facing. In that comparison, our unit net cash cost for 2020 were 15% lower than the January 2020 guidance. EBITDA and operating cash flow improved by over 25%. Capital spending was reduced by 29%. We also generated approximately $550 million in after-tax proceeds from the sale of a noncash flow-producing assets that we disposed of this year. 
We ended the year with $2.7 billion lower debt than our original January plan. Think about that. Facing COVID, with all the uncertainties, having to make the changes and then coming back to do so much better than we set out to do before COVID was known about. This was accomplished at an average copper price realization of $2.95 for the year, 10% a pound higher than our plan, $0.10 per ounce, just $0.10 and well below the current price. The team did an outstanding job. We're strongly positioned for the future. 
In addition to the strong operating and financial performance in 2020, we achieved new milestones in the ESG area. And that's shown on Slide 5. We committed to the Copper Mark. This is a new assurance framework developed by the International Copper Association and our Steve Higgins is now the President of ICA to promote and demonstrate responsible production practices, focusing on meeting the United Nations Sustainability Development Goals. Big step forward. We established climate targets and added transparency with a new climate report, which is now available on our website. 
We took a leading role with ICMM, International Council of Metals and Mining, beginning over a year ago when it served as the industry representative in a multi-stakeholder initiative to develop a new tailing standard for the mining industry following the disasters in Brazil and then the subsequent development of implementation guidance for ICMM members. This was a major undertaking by the industry and by our company, which took a lead in the process, and it reflects the importance of managing tailings storage facilities safely and responsibly. After serving 2 terms as Chairman of ICMM more than 10 years ago, I recently accepted a new term as Chairman. ICMM currently has 27 CEO council members from the largest global mining and metals companies, and I'm leading a strategic review of the organization to meet the increasing importance of ESG issues facing our industry. 
We advanced our inclusion and diversity initiatives, which is core to our values at Freeport. We invested in our communities and continue to expand organizational resources in this effort. Worker safety is our highest priority, and we showed that with what we did in response to COVID. 
Our safety statistics in 2020, measured by interest rates -- in incidence rates met our targets. Fatality position continues to be a focus of our work safety management. Regrettably, we had 5 fatalities in our operations last year. 
On Slide 6, you've heard me say for a long time that the copper price would benefit from its favorable fundamental outlooks. Prices rose significantly in late 2020 in recognition of copper's favorable demand trends and the limited ability of the industry to increase supply. The recent price move is significant, but note that prices are still lower than they were just over 10 years ago -- or almost 10 years ago. Arguably, the fundamental outlook for copper today is better than it was 10 years ago. China is leading the recovery and global stimulus measures in countries around the world are also being positive for growth in copper demand. Freeport is the leading -- is a leading producer of copper, and this commodity is critical to the economy of the future. It's essential to support global growth and in broad scale the economic activity, but it is also essentially strategic for technologies required for the transition to a global, cleaner energy future. That's on the front burner for everyone. 
More and more, we are seeing adoption of policies to reduce carbon emissions around the globe. 70% of the world's copper supply is used to deliver electricity. As clean energy initiatives are implemented, the intensity of copper use will increase. 
The chart on Slide 7 shows that copper utilization in electric vehicles and in the generation of renewable power is more than 4 times greater per unit than for traditional vehicles and power generation. CRU estimates that copper demand for electrification and renewables will increase significantly over the coming years. In a relatively short time frame, global demand just from these green initiatives could approximate the size of today's U.S. copper market. As demand accelerates, copper supply will continue to struggle to keep up. And this supports a favorable near-term and long-term fundamental outlook. 
Its current situation echoes the early 2000s when I became CEO of Freeport at a time when Chinese demand appeared and accelerated in such a dramatic fashion without a supply response, which created the commodity supercycle and sharp increases in copper prices. Very similar to what we're facing today. 
Turning to Indonesia on Slide 8. Our PT-FI team is delivering really impressive results. During 2020, we built the momentum for the ramp-up of our massive underground mines. And by the fourth quarter, we have reached nearly 70% of the targeted annual run rates for sales volumes. This is something we were looking forward to beginning in the mid-1990s when we designed the original pit, which is now completed and is something that we've been investing in over the past 15 years. And to see it coming together like it is, is truly gratifying. And Mark Johnson and his team have just done an exceptional job. 
Continued growth during 2021 is expected to enable us to reach our full annualized targets by the end of this year. Considering the operating health challenges we faced in Papua, this is notable and striking. The team stayed on schedule, met our objectives. The project is massive and complex. And we did this by designing and maintaining effective COVID protocols in a very large workplace in a very challenging remote location. Our progress with ramp-up has reduced risk for PT-FI's underground mine significantly. 
The major risk as we started this was developing the infrastructure. The infrastructure is in place. There's always risk in mining. It's inherent in our business, but the major risk for this underground development are behind us. And we are confident and have a track record of managing the types of risk we'll be facing going forward. We can't make them go away, but we can manage them. And so we're really pleased with where we stand with that process. 
We're also continuing discussions currently regarding the new smelter in Indonesia. In early 2020, we requested a delay in agreed time schedule for completing of a construction of the new smelter at a site in Eastern Java near Gresik, which is near the existing PT smelting facility. We haven't been able to progress work there because of COVID issues for the local workforce and international contracts. This is a greenfield smelter with a total cost of about $3 billion. That number continues to be refined and changed. And this project would be debt-financed by PT-FI, the Indonesian entity. 
Over the last several months, PT-FI and our partner and majority shareholder in PT-FI, the Indonesian state-owned company MIND ID, have been discussing with the government alternatives to this commitment to build a new smelter, which was reflected in our IUPK mining license granted in December 2018. During the fourth quarter, we advanced discussions with the majority owner of the existing PT smelting facility at Gresik for a 30% expansion to add smelting capacity in Indonesia and partially satisfy our commitment to the government. Commercial and financing discussions for these expansions are being advanced. Engineering is in progress. Initial estimates indicate that this project could be done for $250 million and be done efficiently in the current TCRC environment and it would partially meet our obligation to the government. 
Then separately, at the request of the government, at the request of the government, PT-FI is currently engaged in discussion with a third party regarding the potential for the development of a new greenfield smelter at an alternate location away from Eastern Java. This project would be in lieu of PT-FI's constructing the new greenfield smelter that I mentioned above. 
The third party -- a third party would lead the development for this smelter and arrange its financing. PT-FI would commit to be a supplier of concentrate for the project, and the partners and the government are working expeditiously to reach a decision on the path forward. 
On Slide 10, we show our 2021 priorities for our ongoing efforts in creating values for our company. We built -- we were building on the progress of 2020 by focusing on the execution of plans to grow production volumes, manage costs and capital spending efficiently. We're expanding our recent innovation efforts, applying technology and innovating -- innovative management processes in our operations around the world. And all of this, while we manage and are sensitive to our responsibilities to workers, communities, governments and other stakeholders. 
We look forward to resuming cash returns to shareholders during 2021, and we'll be in a position to do that, and we will be in discussions with our Board on taking actions. We will be in a period now and far -- for the long term of harvesting cash flows now that we are completing the major long-term investment program in Indonesia. And we're discussing with the Board a financial policy that would allow and enable a near-term resumption of the dividend and then, over time, a performance-based shareholder return policy. Significantly, we have recommenced work we suspended early in 2020 to evaluate and advance future organic growth opportunities from our large portfolio of undeveloped reserves and mineral resources, and we look forward to doing that. 
The efforts of 2020, we worked with our team over many years now, has enabled us to increase margins and cash flow substantially for 2021 below and beyond. At $3.50 copper, we're on a path to nearly double EBITDA from 2020 levels. Copper sales for 2021 are projected to increase 20% over 2020. Gold volumes are projected to increase by over 50%. Our unit net cash costs of production will decline. And this is occurring at a time for improved pricing for copper. I recall in an earlier conference call like this, I said an ideal situation for Freeport would be able to be completing the Grasberg expansion at times of good copper prices. And here we are. 
The significantly higher cash flows will enable us to maintain a strong balance sheet, build value in our business, return substantial cash flows to shareholders. 
As shown on Slide 12, we have a long-lived portfolio of mineral reserves. Reserve life for our proved and probable reserves are over 30 years. We have substantial options for the potential to expand our reserve base from our large inventory of metal resources beyond reported reserves. All of this is associated with brownfield expansions of our existing ore bodies. What this means is that for our company to have long-term success, we are not required to have success in exploration. We hope we do. We're not required to do deals. Strategic opportunities may come to us. But we've got this base already in our portfolio that provides for a sustainable long-term future for Freeport. 
Slide 13 highlights the organic projects we are now assessing. During 2020, to conserve cash, we paused work on our expansion projects. We're now reengaged a broad range of opportunities. During 2021, we will be developing a ranking of these projects to guide our thinking on sequencing and long-term planning. We have no plans to increase substantially capital spending on projects in the near term. But in the long term, these growth opportunities will be approached in a measured and disciplined way. 
I'll close with Slide 14, which we -- which I have titled the Freeport Edge, which is the term we're using internally around our company. Our management team at Freeport has extensive experience in managing this business. Leadership teams across the company are seasoned, value-oriented and intensely engaged. We have a management structure that is collaborative. We're experienced in working together, and we're decisive. To make a decision, we execute. We recognize our responsibilities we undertake when we're granted hard-earned license to operate. And we never cut corners on important issues. 
Looking at our team at Freeport, it is a combination of managements with long tenure and experience. We also have a cadre of younger managers who bring new ideas, approaches and energies. We have strategic new hires who bring outside perspectives. We've had 3 senior executives who've retired at the end of their careers over the last 2 years. Internal replacements were promoted and performing effectively. And this just demonstrates the depth of talent in our organization. 
Freeport is foremost in copper. Our portfolio of assets is large and high quality. We're an established industry leader, operate mines that are among the largest in the world. Our assets are long-lived and durable with embedded options, reserve, resource growth. We have strong operating franchises in the United States, South America and Indonesia. We're a reliable supplier to the global copper industry, have industry-leading technical capabilities, supported by a strong track record of project execution and business management over many years. We've earned the trust and respect of our partners, our customers, suppliers, financial important markets and most importantly, our workers, communities and host countries where we operate. 
Our block caving experience is among the most extensive and long-standing in the history of the global mining industry. We've been operating block caves in Indonesia since the early 1980s. We have an important molybdenum block caving operation in Colorado. And this is critically important as we transition Grasberg to become the largest block caving operation in the world. 
I'll close before turning to your questions by thanking our people and recognizing their strength, resiliency and performance. I'm proud to be part of this team, and I look forward to continue to be part of the team and to participate in our future successes. We will build on our accomplishments as we -- as will be depicted on our 2020 annual report to shareholders. We are charging ahead responsibly, reliably and relentlessly. 
Thank you for your attention. And operator, let's open the lines for questions."

I'll be brief. Continuing with the slide presentation on Slide 16. We provide some additional details on the quarter and our operating plans. We're continuing in the U.S",751,"Richard, I'm just going to make a few comments, and then we can take the questions. I'll be brief. 
Continuing with the slide presentation on Slide 16. We provide some additional details on the quarter and our operating plans. We're continuing in the U.S. to ramp up production from the new Lone Star mine. And in January of this year, we commenced a restart of the Chino mine, which we had previously announced. In South America, we're continuing to operate Cerro Verde at a reduced rate of roughly 360,000 tonnes per day. We did a little more than that in the fourth quarter. And our team is prepared to increase rates to a level of 400,000 tonnes, which is about where we were -- tonnes per day, which was about where we were pre-COVID after the COVID restrictions are lifted. At El Abra, we've incorporated in our latest plans an increase in operating rates, which will provide additional volumes beginning in 2022. And as we've talked about at Grasberg, we made excellent progress in the fourth quarter and are continuing to execute the ramp-up plan to achieve the targeted metal run rates by the end of this year. 
Slide 17, we present the outlook for 2021. The guidance is largely in line with our previous estimates. We made some minor revisions to 2021 volumes. These were largely timing in nature to reflect the latest Grasberg mine plans. And we've updated our cost models to incorporate the current pricing for energy currencies and ongoing maintenance programs. We expect to sell just over 3.8 billion pounds of copper in 2021 at an average unit net cash cost of $1.25 per pound. And at $3.50 copper, this would generate about $8 billion of EBITDA and $5.5 billion in operating cash flows for the year 2021, which is nearly double the 2020 levels. And as you'll see, we expect further growth in 2022 and 2023, which is shown on Slide 18, where we provide a 3-year outlook for volumes. After expecting growth of nearly 20% in copper, over 50% for gold in 2021 versus 2020, we're projecting further growth of 13% in copper volumes and over 20% in gold volumes for the year 2022. And these projects have been in development for some time. Most of the capital is behind us, which gives us a runway here of generating growth in cash flows and margins. 
The buildup in volumes for 2021 is reflected on Slide 19. 
And on Slide 20, we show the significance of the cash flow generation using these volumes and our cost estimates. And we show a range of prices from $3.50 to $4 copper, holding gold flat at $18.50 per ounce and molybdenum at $9 per pound. But you can see that the growth in volumes at very low incremental cost results in EBITDA ranging from over $10 billion per annum on average for the years 2022 and 2023 to over $12 billion per year at $4 copper. And operating cash flows, which are net of our taxes and interest costs, would range from $7 billion at $3.50 per pound of copper to over $8.5 billion at $4 copper. And as Richard was mentioning, the $4 copper is still well below historical periods of demand strength. 
The cash flows generation are expected to be significantly above our planned capital spending, which will provide substantial free cash flows as we go forward. 
On Slide 21 includes our projected capital of $2.3 billion in 2021. That excludes potential spending on the Indonesian smelter, which would be debt-financed and is still under evaluation. We're maintaining our basic capital plans. We're being very disciplined about capital spend. The 2021 capital is roughly, as you'll see, about $100 million higher than the previous forecast, and that incorporates an acceleration of some mining equipment investments to provide capacity assurance for our plans. We're in a strong financial position, as you see. We've entered a period of exceptional free cash flow generation. The long-lived asset base and ongoing cost and capital management will provide the ability to continue to strengthen our balance sheet, provide cash returns to shareholders and build additional values in our asset base. 
Regarding financial policy, we're working with our Board on a shareholder return policy that would balance our priorities while providing increasing returns to shareholders based on this performance. It's a very exciting time for Freeport, and we're staying very focused on continuing our momentum. 
And now, operator, we'd like to take questions."

We just -- we have a -- we'll have Board meetings early this year, and we're going to sit down with the Board about a broader long-term financial policy that I made reference to. And we'll be in a position to recommend to the Board to reinstate the dividend. But there's no need for further financial metrics with that when you look at our improved financial situation when we were paying the dividend before. 
The issue with the growth project is one that requires more work and requires some time in evaluating the market as we go forward. They range in size, but the projects are large ones. We have a significant expansion opportunity in El Abra in Chile with our partner, CODELCO, and it's on the order of the project we did at Cerro Verde several years ago. And we have a series of projects in the U.S. that initially aren't as large, although down the road, there are some very large ones available. 
The U.S. has some advantages. Tax rates are very favorable, and we have a very large loss carryforward. So we don't pay taxes in the U.S. for years to come. We own most of the lands in fees, so there's no royalties. And so when you cut out taxes and royalties in the U.S. versus foreign economics and with a favorable energy situation in the U.S. and community support for workers, there's just a lot of advantages there. 
So we had to suspend this work because of the uncertainties of COVID. We're now -- Rick Coleman and his team are digging back into it, and we're going to be doing trade-offs of these individual projects as we go forward in 2021. And we'll be able to report to you about our intentions. We -- we're constantly approached by others in the industry who would like to be our partners in these projects. And so there will be a lot of opportunities there. And it's to say today, we're just resuming the work that we were engaged in previously."

We have rights to operate under a shareholders agreement, we being FCX. MIND ID owns 51%. So it's a separate entity. And it is the entity that would construct and finance the smelter. So it's no 50-50 sharing. I mean it is -- it'd be financed in that entity. It's a substantial entity with no external debt. From time to time, there's some borrowings from FCX, but  to meet working capital needs. But it's a substantial entity that clearly can debt finance this entity on its own. So that's the way this thing would be approached and financed. 
Now we do consolidate that entity because of our operating rights. It's a very positive thing that we do have the ability to do that under the accounting rules because that way, we can report it as part of our global operations. So to the extent that alternative is followed and PT-FI takes the lead in constructing and financing the smelter, the debt that it incurs would be consolidated on our balance sheet, but there wouldn't be obligations of FCX to provide funding for it."

Now this new alternative would result in not having to build the greenfield smelter. Another party would come in and do that, arrange it and finance it. So the debt would not be incurred by PT-FI, okay? We're still in the process of negotiating TCRC rates for that. There will be some need for financial support because of the market. But there's an opportunity for us to end up in a much more favorable situation for PT-FI if we're successful in these negotiations. And the government considers it positive because it would be a step in their own government initiatives to develop industry in Indonesia. This would tie into some nickel operations and potentially some downstream battery operations and the like for Indonesia. 
So strategically, the government of Indonesia sees it's positive. It could be positive for PT-FI. And so that's the basis for our deal. And now we're in the process of negotiating the terms of that deal."

And those would have been in the original plan. So some of it is timing related. And some of it really is just trying to be as efficient as possible with our equipment fleets. And that's one of the benefits that we have by operating all these mines is planning the equipment fleets where they bring the highest value, moving -- we can move equipment from different sites to benefit from just being able to operate them together. 
And we're also just really trying to work the assets, use this technology that we have and the organizational improvement initiatives to work the assets harder.

And so yes, there's always tension and pressure of people wanting to invest more in our mine equipment and our mining business, but we're really taking a very disciplined approach and using the learnings that we gained in 2020 and even prior to that to try to drive better capital efficiency in the business."

I really enjoy and love the people I work with. We just have this incredible good spirit among our team. 
I do have a concern. That's why I made some of the comments on the last slide. Some people look at me and say, Freeport's an old company maybe. But we really -- if you look throughout our organization, we have a lot of young experienced managers with our longer-tenured people. We have great depth. We're showing we can sustain positions. When I do leave the -- we're going to have a sustainable company going forward. We're going to have a sustainable Board. We're working on that now. But -- so anyway, I'm -- been a crazy year for someone who traveled all the time to be working like I've worked, like other people work. But having this success with the company, which is not just a peak thing or an unusual thing, but this is -- you look at the markets, inventories are low. There's elements of copper demand that are new, that are growing. Supplies, I mean, all of this is coming in place. And I think it's going to be -- it was a great year for Freeport. I mean, we went from below $5 a share to be in the eighth best-performing stock in the S&P 500. I mean, how can you envision that? I mean that's a head spinner. But I think there's great things to come, and I want to be here and be part of it because we worked so hard to get that. 
I should mention that Jim Bob died recently. He and I -- I met him in my first year out of college as he was starting off at McMoRan, and we were 2 different people, but we established a very good partnership. We brought different skills to bear in building Freeport. And in his later years, jim Bob was focused on his oil and gas concepts. And -- but he was always there. We did have a major disagreement. I mean, there's no way to hide it over the oil and gas deal in 2011. He thought it was a really good deal for the company. I did not. The Board decided to do it, and it caused the significant problems when commodity prices fell. He's been -- he was very sick for a while, but I'm happy to say that in recent years, he and I established in recent times, he and I reestablished a really good personal relationship, and it was a sad day for all of us when he lost his life to COVID."

We mentioned just how well Grasberg Block Cave is going, and we're ahead of schedule on that. Grasberg -- the Deep MLZ mine has had the challenges over time with having the seismicity events that are mining related, not natural. And we've implemented a program of using fracking technology to precondition the ore bodies so that we could leave the pressures that cause these. We still face them from time to time, but we've got great procedures for dealing with it.

Chris, Deep MLZ, as Richard mentioned in the fourth quarter, we were ahead on all the development aspects, the -- where we were on target on drawbelling, undercutting. And where we had some challenges was in the -- in just the material flow. And what I mean from there is taking the material from the extraction level, getting it through the rock breaker or getting it to the grizzlies through the internal ore passes, the 60-meter long ore passes and getting them into the trucks that take it to the crusher. 
The problems that we had there was we deal from everything from very, very coarse blocking material to fine sticky material. And we're coming up with methods that I'm confident will address that and allow us to take both the big stuff and the fine stuff and run them through these ore passes. It's something that we saw at the initial stages of DMLZ, and we're working our way through that. 
On the GBC, the Grasberg Block Cave, we had a very good year. We were on drawbelling, undercutting. We were ahead on our tonnage rates for the fourth quarter, marginally ahead, and we're in a good position there. We build our second -- we'll complete the second crusher at GBC in April of this year, which will be a major milestone. We continue to develop the rail haulage, and there's a major milestone that we'll achieve in the second quarter to let these trains run in a loop rather than out and back. 
And that's going to increase our production from our overall mine system. So both mines are tracking well. And as Richard mentioned, we do have the DOZ. It's a mature mine. But it hit targets -- Big Gossan, our stope mine, was -- we had very good results this last year, last quarter, in particular. So it's -- we've had some pluses and minuses, but overall, we're in a very good position entering this year. And in -- particularly in the GBC, we've hit our peak in our drawbelling in 2020. 
And just associated with the mine plan and consistent with our long-range plans, that starts to tail off. We don't need as many drawbells to continue to sustain the ramp-up in production. Deep MLZ, we pretty much stay steady for the next 3 years on drawbelling and undercutting. So the next 2 years is really just doing more of the same of growing these mines. There's no real rate increase in the amount of development. In fact, it's flatter or dropping off. And it's just a matter of continuing to be very consistent in how we've -- going forward as to what we've been able to demonstrate over the last couple of years and particularly in 2020."

So there's really no significant change in our underground plans, both at Deep MLZ and GBC.
The other 2 mines, DOZ and Big Gossan, are both very consistent. In fact, in Big Gossan, we've changed our stope sequencing a bit. That's going to add some metal. So we'll continue to look for opportunities and to reflect our actual production and operation over the previous quarters."

And just a side comment, these other 2 mines that we have look tiny compared with Grasberg Block Cave and the Deep MLZ. But when you look at underground mines in the industry, those are substantial mines in and of themselves. This copper difference is just a rounding. I mean, it's less than 1%. I mean, so we're right on plan for copper. And the gold things, remember, we had higher goal now, we upgraded our goal for 2022. So every year, there's going to be those kinds of adjustments. We're going to try to produce more gold, which we're able to do in 2020. And then we adjust our plans for that. So we're -- there's nothing here other than we're right on our targets, and everything is going as planned.
The financial policy, I'll go back and say what I've said before. We have ongoing and formal discussions with Board members. We have formal Board members coming up. My anticipation is that there will be a restoration of our dividend and then a financial policy that will give guidance to the market of how we will be dividing cash flows in the future for further debt reduction. Although, quite frankly, we're -- if you look at our cash flows that we talked to you about today and in a $3.50 copper price, we get down to about $3 million of net debt at the end of 2022. So we certainly can support higher level of debts than that. And that means there's plenty of cash to enhance cash returns to shareholders and then have availability of funds and depending on how we structure it for future organic growth projects when we decide to initiate those. So restoration of dividend, a financial policy that will provide for increasing cash returns to shareholders over the long term with funds available for organic growth investments."

And that's what allowed us to be as successful as we were in 2020. 
And as we look at 2021 and beyond, we continue to leverage, whether that be data analytics, the AI and how that applies, the tools that are out there, and we look for opportunities. A lot of those things are embedded in the plans today, but I think it's also going to drive additional things as we go forward. That won't require the investments or the dollars that we had thought about previously, just from the fact that we've got it internalized and we're leveraging a lot of the energy, passion and excitement of our workforce and tapping into ideas that are allowing us to add incremental benefits across the organization from an efficiency perspective as well as from a cost perspective. 
And so it's really exciting to see the folks at all levels of the organization have the opportunity and take the opportunity to provide ideas that then turn into significant value for us as an organization.

If we were sitting here, as we normally do around our conference desk in Phoenix, Kathleen would be kicking me out off the table because that question is just like giving a monkey a machine gun. 2003, we had gone through",716,"So we're working remotely, Lucas. If we were sitting here, as we normally do around our conference desk in Phoenix, Kathleen would be kicking me out off the table because that question is just like giving a monkey a machine gun. 2003, we had gone through a real tough time in copper with the economic issues of the late 1990s, the global recession, the global slowdown. 
Copper prices had dropped at one point to below $0.70. And I recall, and it was at a -- Timna, at a Merrill Lynch conference in Ireland, that was my first conference as CEO, it was right before I made CEO. And the price of copper just dipped over $0.70, nobody in the industry thought it could go beyond $1 within the foreseeable future. And everybody was running the business. So what happened? China emerged in a way nobody expected, created a whole new element of demand. Historically, whenever copper prices jumped up, the industry had projects primarily in Latin America to invest in. 
And the industry was widely divided and there'd be new investment. Supplies would come on, the business cycle would turn down and copper prices would drop. This time, China added, in 2003, a permanent element of new demand that was beyond the traditional demand from copper that was tied into global industrial production. And there was widespread expectation that the industry would invest and add new supplies. I remember my partnership, Goodyear, got up at that conference and said in price of copper, he hoped that the price wouldn't rise too much because it would create uneconomic investment. 
Well, what happened was the industry started looking for new projects then and geologically, they weren't there, and there were all these other barriers to investment. So we had higher prices without a supply response. That led us to do the Phelps Dodge deal in 2007. We're -- our market cap in 2003 was $6 billion. It was $12 billion at the Phelps Dodge deal. We did a $38 billion business combination, the biggest in the industry, lived through the financial crisis and then emerged in 2011 as a company with a $60 billion market cap and no debt. 
So what do we like here? The reason that I feel this is an echo is that we still have a world that's being burdened by the economic slowdown with COVID. While there had been recoveries in pockets of the economy, there's been stimulus by governments, and China has recovered much faster than we heard about earlier, think about a world where we had a slowdown to the extent we did in 2020 and copper inventories are at levels that we hadn't seen since the mid-2000s. 
And so here we are, and we just talked about how there's not a huge rush to invest in new projects. All the major companies want to grow copper as part of their portfolios. That's been the case since the mid-2000s, and they've been challenged in doing that. Projects today around the world, geologically, are more difficult, less quality than they were, underground, lower grades. You look at Cerro Verde, Cobre Panama. These are big, low-grade projects that require huge investments in infrastructure and equipment and mill processing. And then you have these barriers to production that keep some attractive projects around the world from going forward. 
You have political issues in countries that -- in Africa, it's challenged. Latin America is having political issues. Indonesia's been what it's been. So I do feel that if the world's global economy recovers in a reasonable way, not an extreme way, and we have this big move towards -- look at all the stats that are coming about for electric vehicles in the United States. I mean, think about what General Motors is doing and what China is doing. 
You think about the change in the global perception about climate change in the United States, forest fires, hurricanes. I mean, this is something that's going to have to be addressed. And when it is addressed, it's going to require tremendous amounts of infrastructure spending, extraordinary amounts. And in all of those elements of spending, there's an element of copper of significance into it. So that's why I feel like we are echoing 2003 today."

If you look back at Freeport, when copper prices began rising in 2003, 2004, we returned tremendous amounts of cash to investors out of Grasberg. We were like a royalty trust or an MLP or something. Then after Phelps Dodge, we delevered very quickly, and we start returning to paying dividends again. And we were well positioned in 2011 to continue to do that. The Board decided to invest in oil and gas and took it away. So here we are, coming back from the situation that we are now. We don't need a commodities boom to generate lots of cash to return to shareholders. 
At $3.50 copper, you see what the numbers are. I think copper could go much higher than $3.50. I can't guarantee it, but in my gut, and Timna, that's one of the reasons I want to keep working. I think it's going to be really a special time. And when that happens, we will be able to really return cash to shareholders in a substantial way. This question of investing, I mean, right now, money is so cheap, you wouldn't want to bring in a joint venture partner. That may not stay that way forever, but financing is incredibly cheap and available. 
And I wish Phelps Dodge hadn't given up the interest in Morenci or the interest in Cerro Verde. So if we got good projects, we'll look at the most efficient way to finance it. That could well be -- could be partners because lots of people want to be our partners. And then others may have projects that we have the opportunity to join in on. There could be opportunities in the M&A market. But all of that is part of this really bright future that I see for Freeport. The vision right now is focused on getting 2021 to be as successful as 2020 was. 
And when that happens, when that happens, and we got long-term run rates at Grasberg, Josh and his team has fine-tuned our business in the Americas. We got this Lone Star project, don't overlook that. That could be a new Morenci down the road. This is just a company that's really well situated to generate cash, not have to do anything to have a sustainable future but having the world open to us to do lots of different things. It's really, really exciting. 
All right. Thank you all for participating. We look forward to reporting our progress in 2021. And take care of yourselves, your families, the people around you. We're not over the hump yet on COVID, but just hang in there. This life is going to get better. Thanks for participating."

Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website home page and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. 
Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on this call will include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described on our SEC filings. 
On the call today are Richard Adkerson. We also have a number of our senior team with us today: Mark Johnson is here, Josh Olmsted, Mike Kendrick, Rick Coleman and Steve Higgins. I'll start by briefly summarizing the results for the quarter, and then we'll turn the call over to Richard, who will be reviewing our outlook. After our prepared remarks, we'll be taking questions. 
Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $708 million or $0.48 per share in the fourth quarter, and $599 million or $0.41 per share for the year ended 2020. We had a number of special items in the fourth quarter, which are detailed on VII of our press release. Those total net credits of $142 million or $0.10 a share mainly associated with the gain on the sale of assets and partly offset by charges for a litigation settlement and international tax matters. 
Our adjusted net income attributable to common stock after these items totaled $566 million or $0.39 per share for the fourth quarter of 2020. Our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA for the fourth quarter approximated $1.9 billion, and we generated $4.2 billion of adjusted EBITDA for the year 2020. A reconciliation of our EBITDA is available on Page 38 of the slide materials. 
We had a very strong fourth quarter. Our sales volumes of copper of 866 million pounds were 3% above our October 2020 estimate. And our gold sales of 293,000 ounces were 9% higher than our October 2020 guidance. These primarily reflected higher copper sales from Cerro Verde and in Indonesia and higher gold ore grades in Indonesia. We benefited during the quarter from improved pricing for both copper and gold. The realized price of copper was $3.40 per pound in the fourth quarter, and that was 24% above the year ago quarterly average. 
Fourth quarter gold realized price was $18.70 per ounce, and that was about 25% above the year ago average. Our unit net cash costs came in at an average of $1.28 per pound of copper, and that was lower than what we had guided to in October. Notably, in the fourth quarter, we generated very strong cash flows, which totaled $1.3 billion in the quarter. And that exceeded our capital spending of just under $400 million during the period. We were -- together with our asset sale proceeds in the fourth quarter, we were successful in reducing our net debt by about $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter alone, and we ended the year with net debt approximating $6.1 billion. We had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility, consolidated cash of $3.7 billion, and we're in a strong position as we look forward to generating increasing cash flows as we go forward. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to our slide materials that you can reference on our website."

It's great to be able to talk to you today about our performance in 2020 and our positive outlook. It's been a head-spinning year. When we think back to March and April and all of the challenges we were facing at that point and the world was facing, to have -- be at this point is really head spinning in many ways and remarkable, but it's been quite a year for Freeport. I really hope you and your families and colleagues are staying safe and well. We've all made personal sacrifices. It's been a tough year for us at Freeport. The progress our company has made has really been a godsend as we've all been working in ways that are so different than in the past. 
We remain focused on working to protect our health and safety of our people. We're supporting the communities where we operate during this crisis. We're really encouraged by the scientific advances with therapeutics and now that vaccines are finally being distributed. But all -- we know all this is going to take time to have the distribution widely placed, and we're all looking forward to returning to normal lives. But for the time being, we're staying diligent with our protocols. And these have really proven to be so effective for us at Freeport. 
I'm immensely proud of our Freeport team for their response to the COVID challenge. Navigating through a pandemic like this that none of us have ever seen and with this degree of duration has been difficult for everyone and all the communities around us. Our team has demonstrated real resilience, confidence and drive throughout all of this, come together to address the situation proactively while we've maintained focus on continuing to protect and enhance our business, and that's worked for the benefit of all stakeholders. 
On Slide 3, we show the highlights for 2020, a year of extraordinary accomplishment for Freeport. We laid a strong foundation for future growth and cash flows and profitabilities, which is exactly what we set out to do and had a strategy to do. And to have been able to achieve what we did in the face of COVID is nothing short of remarkable. 
Earlier in 2020, we announced in April, we moved quickly to develop new operating protocols to maintain our business's continuity. We totally redesigned our operating plans from what we had announced this time a year ago to safeguard our business, protect our liquidity and to be responsive to the really heightened uncertainty that we were facing and everyone's facing. 
At Freeport, all hands were on deck to build an optimal plan. Each of our operating teams around the globe played an employment role in developing and then executing these aggressive plans. We just had a tremendous buy-in by everyone, and that enabled us to execute the plans so well. A big positive from this process that our team's collaboration, which has always been a strength of our organization, is now more strong than it's ever been. Employee engagement, commitment, energy and morale at a very high level. We effectively executed the revised plans, had a big focus on cost and capital management. And then significantly, we advanced the largest block caving operation in the world at our Grasberg mine in Indonesia. You'll see we met our key milestones for this massive multiyear, multibillion-dollar undertaking. At the same time, we also completed on time and on budget the Lone Star project in Arizona, and this is a potential future keystone asset for our company. The progress we made this year set the foundation for strong cash flows literally for years to come. 
We turned the corner during 2020 to begin generating sustainable and substantial free cash flow. Beginning in the third quarter of 2020 and now continuing in the fourth quarter and as we look forward, we've generated and are generating significant free cash flow and that enabled us to reduce our net debt by $2.4 billion in the second half of the year. 
Slide 4 highlights key financial metrics by comparing our actual results for 2020 with the plan we presented to you last January prior to the onset of the pandemic. So this is not the revised April plan but the one that we had before we knew what we were facing. In that comparison, our unit net cash cost for 2020 were 15% lower than the January 2020 guidance. EBITDA and operating cash flow improved by over 25%. Capital spending was reduced by 29%. We also generated approximately $550 million in after-tax proceeds from the sale of a noncash flow-producing assets that we disposed of this year. 
We ended the year with $2.7 billion lower debt than our original January plan. Think about that. Facing COVID, with all the uncertainties, having to make the changes and then coming back to do so much better than we set out to do before COVID was known about. This was accomplished at an average copper price realization of $2.95 for the year, 10% a pound higher than our plan, $0.10 per ounce, just $0.10 and well below the current price. The team did an outstanding job. We're strongly positioned for the future. 
In addition to the strong operating and financial performance in 2020, we achieved new milestones in the ESG area. And that's shown on Slide 5. We committed to the Copper Mark. This is a new assurance framework developed by the International Copper Association and our Steve Higgins is now the President of ICA to promote and demonstrate responsible production practices, focusing on meeting the United Nations Sustainability Development Goals. Big step forward. We established climate targets and added transparency with a new climate report, which is now available on our website. 
We took a leading role with ICMM, International Council of Metals and Mining, beginning over a year ago when it served as the industry representative in a multi-stakeholder initiative to develop a new tailing standard for the mining industry following the disasters in Brazil and then the subsequent development of implementation guidance for ICMM members. This was a major undertaking by the industry and by our company, which took a lead in the process, and it reflects the importance of managing tailings storage facilities safely and responsibly. After serving 2 terms as Chairman of ICMM more than 10 years ago, I recently accepted a new term as Chairman. ICMM currently has 27 CEO council members from the largest global mining and metals companies, and I'm leading a strategic review of the organization to meet the increasing importance of ESG issues facing our industry. 
We advanced our inclusion and diversity initiatives, which is core to our values at Freeport. We invested in our communities and continue to expand organizational resources in this effort. Worker safety is our highest priority, and we showed that with what we did in response to COVID. 
Our safety statistics in 2020, measured by interest rates -- in incidence rates met our targets. Fatality position continues to be a focus of our work safety management. Regrettably, we had 5 fatalities in our operations last year. 
On Slide 6, you've heard me say for a long time that the copper price would benefit from its favorable fundamental outlooks. Prices rose significantly in late 2020 in recognition of copper's favorable demand trends and the limited ability of the industry to increase supply. The recent price move is significant, but note that prices are still lower than they were just over 10 years ago -- or almost 10 years ago. Arguably, the fundamental outlook for copper today is better than it was 10 years ago. China is leading the recovery and global stimulus measures in countries around the world are also being positive for growth in copper demand. Freeport is the leading -- is a leading producer of copper, and this commodity is critical to the economy of the future. It's essential to support global growth and in broad scale the economic activity, but it is also essentially strategic for technologies required for the transition to a global, cleaner energy future. That's on the front burner for everyone. 
More and more, we are seeing adoption of policies to reduce carbon emissions around the globe. 70% of the world's copper supply is used to deliver electricity. As clean energy initiatives are implemented, the intensity of copper use will increase. 
The chart on Slide 7 shows that copper utilization in electric vehicles and in the generation of renewable power is more than 4 times greater per unit than for traditional vehicles and power generation. CRU estimates that copper demand for electrification and renewables will increase significantly over the coming years. In a relatively short time frame, global demand just from these green initiatives could approximate the size of today's U.S. copper market. As demand accelerates, copper supply will continue to struggle to keep up. And this supports a favorable near-term and long-term fundamental outlook. 
Its current situation echoes the early 2000s when I became CEO of Freeport at a time when Chinese demand appeared and accelerated in such a dramatic fashion without a supply response, which created the commodity supercycle and sharp increases in copper prices. Very similar to what we're facing today. 
Turning to Indonesia on Slide 8. Our PT-FI team is delivering really impressive results. During 2020, we built the momentum for the ramp-up of our massive underground mines. And by the fourth quarter, we have reached nearly 70% of the targeted annual run rates for sales volumes. This is something we were looking forward to beginning in the mid-1990s when we designed the original pit, which is now completed and is something that we've been investing in over the past 15 years. And to see it coming together like it is, is truly gratifying. And Mark Johnson and his team have just done an exceptional job. 
Continued growth during 2021 is expected to enable us to reach our full annualized targets by the end of this year. Considering the operating health challenges we faced in Papua, this is notable and striking. The team stayed on schedule, met our objectives. The project is massive and complex. And we did this by designing and maintaining effective COVID protocols in a very large workplace in a very challenging remote location. Our progress with ramp-up has reduced risk for PT-FI's underground mine significantly. 
The major risk as we started this was developing the infrastructure. The infrastructure is in place. There's always risk in mining. It's inherent in our business, but the major risk for this underground development are behind us. And we are confident and have a track record of managing the types of risk we'll be facing going forward. We can't make them go away, but we can manage them. And so we're really pleased with where we stand with that process. 
We're also continuing discussions currently regarding the new smelter in Indonesia. In early 2020, we requested a delay in agreed time schedule for completing of a construction of the new smelter at a site in Eastern Java near Gresik, which is near the existing PT smelting facility. We haven't been able to progress work there because of COVID issues for the local workforce and international contracts. This is a greenfield smelter with a total cost of about $3 billion. That number continues to be refined and changed. And this project would be debt-financed by PT-FI, the Indonesian entity. 
Over the last several months, PT-FI and our partner and majority shareholder in PT-FI, the Indonesian state-owned company MIND ID, have been discussing with the government alternatives to this commitment to build a new smelter, which was reflected in our IUPK mining license granted in December 2018. During the fourth quarter, we advanced discussions with the majority owner of the existing PT smelting facility at Gresik for a 30% expansion to add smelting capacity in Indonesia and partially satisfy our commitment to the government. Commercial and financing discussions for these expansions are being advanced. Engineering is in progress. Initial estimates indicate that this project could be done for $250 million and be done efficiently in the current TCRC environment and it would partially meet our obligation to the government. 
Then separately, at the request of the government, at the request of the government, PT-FI is currently engaged in discussion with a third party regarding the potential for the development of a new greenfield smelter at an alternate location away from Eastern Java. This project would be in lieu of PT-FI's constructing the new greenfield smelter that I mentioned above. 
The third party -- a third party would lead the development for this smelter and arrange its financing. PT-FI would commit to be a supplier of concentrate for the project, and the partners and the government are working expeditiously to reach a decision on the path forward. 
On Slide 10, we show our 2021 priorities for our ongoing efforts in creating values for our company. We built -- we were building on the progress of 2020 by focusing on the execution of plans to grow production volumes, manage costs and capital spending efficiently. We're expanding our recent innovation efforts, applying technology and innovating -- innovative management processes in our operations around the world. And all of this, while we manage and are sensitive to our responsibilities to workers, communities, governments and other stakeholders. 
We look forward to resuming cash returns to shareholders during 2021, and we'll be in a position to do that, and we will be in discussions with our Board on taking actions. We will be in a period now and far -- for the long term of harvesting cash flows now that we are completing the major long-term investment program in Indonesia. And we're discussing with the Board a financial policy that would allow and enable a near-term resumption of the dividend and then, over time, a performance-based shareholder return policy. Significantly, we have recommenced work we suspended early in 2020 to evaluate and advance future organic growth opportunities from our large portfolio of undeveloped reserves and mineral resources, and we look forward to doing that. 
The efforts of 2020, we worked with our team over many years now, has enabled us to increase margins and cash flow substantially for 2021 below and beyond. At $3.50 copper, we're on a path to nearly double EBITDA from 2020 levels. Copper sales for 2021 are projected to increase 20% over 2020. Gold volumes are projected to increase by over 50%. Our unit net cash costs of production will decline. And this is occurring at a time for improved pricing for copper. I recall in an earlier conference call like this, I said an ideal situation for Freeport would be able to be completing the Grasberg expansion at times of good copper prices. And here we are. 
The significantly higher cash flows will enable us to maintain a strong balance sheet, build value in our business, return substantial cash flows to shareholders. 
As shown on Slide 12, we have a long-lived portfolio of mineral reserves. Reserve life for our proved and probable reserves are over 30 years. We have substantial options for the potential to expand our reserve base from our large inventory of metal resources beyond reported reserves. All of this is associated with brownfield expansions of our existing ore bodies. What this means is that for our company to have long-term success, we are not required to have success in exploration. We hope we do. We're not required to do deals. Strategic opportunities may come to us. But we've got this base already in our portfolio that provides for a sustainable long-term future for Freeport. 
Slide 13 highlights the organic projects we are now assessing. During 2020, to conserve cash, we paused work on our expansion projects. We're now reengaged a broad range of opportunities. During 2021, we will be developing a ranking of these projects to guide our thinking on sequencing and long-term planning. We have no plans to increase substantially capital spending on projects in the near term. But in the long term, these growth opportunities will be approached in a measured and disciplined way. 
I'll close with Slide 14, which we -- which I have titled the Freeport Edge, which is the term we're using internally around our company. Our management team at Freeport has extensive experience in managing this business. Leadership teams across the company are seasoned, value-oriented and intensely engaged. We have a management structure that is collaborative. We're experienced in working together, and we're decisive. To make a decision, we execute. We recognize our responsibilities we undertake when we're granted hard-earned license to operate. And we never cut corners on important issues. 
Looking at our team at Freeport, it is a combination of managements with long tenure and experience. We also have a cadre of younger managers who bring new ideas, approaches and energies. We have strategic new hires who bring outside perspectives. We've had 3 senior executives who've retired at the end of their careers over the last 2 years. Internal replacements were promoted and performing effectively. And this just demonstrates the depth of talent in our organization. 
Freeport is foremost in copper. Our portfolio of assets is large and high quality. We're an established industry leader, operate mines that are among the largest in the world. Our assets are long-lived and durable with embedded options, reserve, resource growth. We have strong operating franchises in the United States, South America and Indonesia. We're a reliable supplier to the global copper industry, have industry-leading technical capabilities, supported by a strong track record of project execution and business management over many years. We've earned the trust and respect of our partners, our customers, suppliers, financial important markets and most importantly, our workers, communities and host countries where we operate. 
Our block caving experience is among the most extensive and long-standing in the history of the global mining industry. We've been operating block caves in Indonesia since the early 1980s. We have an important molybdenum block caving operation in Colorado. And this is critically important as we transition Grasberg to become the largest block caving operation in the world. 
I'll close before turning to your questions by thanking our people and recognizing their strength, resiliency and performance. I'm proud to be part of this team, and I look forward to continue to be part of the team and to participate in our future successes. We will build on our accomplishments as we -- as will be depicted on our 2020 annual report to shareholders. We are charging ahead responsibly, reliably and relentlessly. 
Thank you for your attention. And operator, let's open the lines for questions."

I'll be brief. Continuing with the slide presentation on Slide 16. We provide some additional details on the quarter and our operating plans. We're continuing in the U.S",751,"Richard, I'm just going to make a few comments, and then we can take the questions. I'll be brief. 
Continuing with the slide presentation on Slide 16. We provide some additional details on the quarter and our operating plans. We're continuing in the U.S. to ramp up production from the new Lone Star mine. And in January of this year, we commenced a restart of the Chino mine, which we had previously announced. In South America, we're continuing to operate Cerro Verde at a reduced rate of roughly 360,000 tonnes per day. We did a little more than that in the fourth quarter. And our team is prepared to increase rates to a level of 400,000 tonnes, which is about where we were -- tonnes per day, which was about where we were pre-COVID after the COVID restrictions are lifted. At El Abra, we've incorporated in our latest plans an increase in operating rates, which will provide additional volumes beginning in 2022. And as we've talked about at Grasberg, we made excellent progress in the fourth quarter and are continuing to execute the ramp-up plan to achieve the targeted metal run rates by the end of this year. 
Slide 17, we present the outlook for 2021. The guidance is largely in line with our previous estimates. We made some minor revisions to 2021 volumes. These were largely timing in nature to reflect the latest Grasberg mine plans. And we've updated our cost models to incorporate the current pricing for energy currencies and ongoing maintenance programs. We expect to sell just over 3.8 billion pounds of copper in 2021 at an average unit net cash cost of $1.25 per pound. And at $3.50 copper, this would generate about $8 billion of EBITDA and $5.5 billion in operating cash flows for the year 2021, which is nearly double the 2020 levels. And as you'll see, we expect further growth in 2022 and 2023, which is shown on Slide 18, where we provide a 3-year outlook for volumes. After expecting growth of nearly 20% in copper, over 50% for gold in 2021 versus 2020, we're projecting further growth of 13% in copper volumes and over 20% in gold volumes for the year 2022. And these projects have been in development for some time. Most of the capital is behind us, which gives us a runway here of generating growth in cash flows and margins. 
The buildup in volumes for 2021 is reflected on Slide 19. 
And on Slide 20, we show the significance of the cash flow generation using these volumes and our cost estimates. And we show a range of prices from $3.50 to $4 copper, holding gold flat at $18.50 per ounce and molybdenum at $9 per pound. But you can see that the growth in volumes at very low incremental cost results in EBITDA ranging from over $10 billion per annum on average for the years 2022 and 2023 to over $12 billion per year at $4 copper. And operating cash flows, which are net of our taxes and interest costs, would range from $7 billion at $3.50 per pound of copper to over $8.5 billion at $4 copper. And as Richard was mentioning, the $4 copper is still well below historical periods of demand strength. 
The cash flows generation are expected to be significantly above our planned capital spending, which will provide substantial free cash flows as we go forward. 
On Slide 21 includes our projected capital of $2.3 billion in 2021. That excludes potential spending on the Indonesian smelter, which would be debt-financed and is still under evaluation. We're maintaining our basic capital plans. We're being very disciplined about capital spend. The 2021 capital is roughly, as you'll see, about $100 million higher than the previous forecast, and that incorporates an acceleration of some mining equipment investments to provide capacity assurance for our plans. We're in a strong financial position, as you see. We've entered a period of exceptional free cash flow generation. The long-lived asset base and ongoing cost and capital management will provide the ability to continue to strengthen our balance sheet, provide cash returns to shareholders and build additional values in our asset base. 
Regarding financial policy, we're working with our Board on a shareholder return policy that would balance our priorities while providing increasing returns to shareholders based on this performance. It's a very exciting time for Freeport, and we're staying very focused on continuing our momentum. 
And now, operator, we'd like to take questions."

And we'll be in a position to recommend to the Board to reinstate the dividend. But there's no need for further financial metrics with that when you look at our improved financial situation when we were paying the dividend before. 
The issue with the growth project is one that requires more work and requires some time in evaluating the market as we go forward. They range in size, but the projects are large ones. We have a significant expansion opportunity in El Abra in Chile with our partner, CODELCO, and it's on the order of the project we did at Cerro Verde several years ago. And we have a series of projects in the U.S. that initially aren't as large, although down the road, there are some very large ones available. 
The U.S. has some advantages. Tax rates are very favorable, and we have a very large loss carryforward. So we don't pay taxes in the U.S. for years to come. We own most of the lands in fees, so there's no royalties. And so when you cut out taxes and royalties in the U.S. versus foreign economics and with a favorable energy situation in the U.S. and community support for workers, there's just a lot of advantages there. 
So we had to suspend this work because of the uncertainties of COVID. We're now -- Rick Coleman and his team are digging back into it, and we're going to be doing trade-offs of these individual projects as we go forward in 2021. And we'll be able to report to you about our intentions. We -- we're constantly approached by others in the industry who would like to be our partners in these projects. And so there will be a lot of opportunities there. And it's to say today, we're just resuming the work that we were engaged in previously."

From time to time, there's some borrowings from FCX, but  to meet working capital needs. But it's a substantial entity that clearly can debt finance this entity on its own. So that's the way this thing would be approached and financed. 
Now we do consolidate that entity because of our operating rights. It's a very positive thing that we do have the ability to do that under the accounting rules because that way, we can report it as part of our global operations.

So at this point, it's -- I think it's fair to still consider we may have ways of reducing the capital, and we're working towards those, but to think about both those projects together and the precious metal facilities all being a $3 billion project for PT-FI. Now this new alternative would result in not having to build the greenfield smelter. Another party would come in and do that, arrange it and finance it. So the debt would not be incurred by PT-FI, okay? We're still in the process of negotiating TCRC rates for that. There will be some need for financial support because of the market. But there's an opportunity for us to end up in a much more favorable situation for PT-FI if we're successful in these negotiations. And the government considers it positive because it would be a step in their own government initiatives to develop industry in Indonesia. This would tie into some nickel operations and potentially some downstream battery operations and the like for Indonesia. 
So strategically, the government of Indonesia sees it's positive. It could be positive for PT-FI. And so that's the basis for our deal. And now we're in the process of negotiating the terms of that deal."

If we do go forward with our original commitment, build the smelter, just remember that the negative economics of that smelter are born more than 70% by the government of Indonesia because of taxes, royalties, they're 51% equity ownership in PT-FI. And so in essence, less than 30% of the negative economics of the smelter come back to FCX through its 49% shareholding in PT-FI. Many people are -- seem to be assigning more negative value for FCX to the smelter than the economics really justify currently. And that's why we're so -- and that's why we are aligned with the government in trying to make this as economic as possible."

We did bring forward, as I mentioned, we brought back in $100 million of mine equipment, really allowing us to do some rebuilds more quickly than what was in the April plan.
And those would have been in the original plan. So some of it is timing related. And some of it really is just trying to be as efficient as possible with our equipment fleets. And that's one of the benefits that we have by operating all these mines is planning the equipment fleets where they bring the highest value, moving -- we can move equipment from different sites to benefit from just being able to operate them together. 
And we're also just really trying to work the assets, use this technology that we have and the organizational improvement initiatives to work the assets harder. And we started that program, what we called Americas' Concentrator, but it is -- it applies not just to milling operations but mining operations and really looking to improve the lives of our equipment, improve entire lives, all those things really add up. 
And so yes, there's always tension and pressure of people wanting to invest more in our mine equipment and our mining business, but we're really taking a very disciplined approach and using the learnings that we gained in 2020 and even prior to that to try to drive better capital efficiency in the business."

I do have a concern. That's why I made some of the comments on the last slide. Some people look at me and say, Freeport's an old company maybe. But we really -- if you look throughout our organization, we have a lot of young experienced managers with our longer-tenured people. We have great depth. We're showing we can sustain positions.

There's elements of copper demand that are new, that are growing. Supplies, I mean, all of this is coming in place. And I think it's going to be -- it was a great year for Freeport.

I should mention that Jim Bob died recently. He and I -- I met him in my first year out of college as he was starting off at McMoRan, and we were 2 different people, but we established a very good partnership. We brought different skills to bear in building Freeport. And in his later years, jim Bob was focused on his oil and gas concepts. And -- but he was always there. We did have a major disagreement. I mean, there's no way to hide it over the oil and gas deal in 2011. He thought it was a really good deal for the company. I did not. The Board decided to do it, and it caused the significant problems when commodity prices fell. He's been -- he was very sick for a while, but I'm happy to say that in recent years, he and I established in recent times, he and I reestablished a really good personal relationship, and it was a sad day for all of us when he lost his life to COVID."

Chris, Deep MLZ, as Richard mentioned in the fourth quarter, we were ahead on all the development aspects, the -- where we were on target on drawbelling, undercutting. And where we had some challenges was in the -- in just the material flow. And what I mean from there is taking the material from the extraction level, getting it through the rock breaker or getting it to the grizzlies through the internal ore passes, the 60-meter long ore passes and getting them into the trucks that take it to the crusher. 
The problems that we had there was we deal from everything from very, very coarse blocking material to fine sticky material. And we're coming up with methods that I'm confident will address that and allow us to take both the big stuff and the fine stuff and run them through these ore passes. It's something that we saw at the initial stages of DMLZ, and we're working our way through that. 
On the GBC, the Grasberg Block Cave, we had a very good year. We were on drawbelling, undercutting. We were ahead on our tonnage rates for the fourth quarter, marginally ahead, and we're in a good position there. We build our second -- we'll complete the second crusher at GBC in April of this year, which will be a major milestone. We continue to develop the rail haulage, and there's a major milestone that we'll achieve in the second quarter to let these trains run in a loop rather than out and back. 
And that's going to increase our production from our overall mine system. So both mines are tracking well. And as Richard mentioned, we do have the DOZ. It's a mature mine. But it hit targets -- Big Gossan, our stope mine, was -- we had very good results this last year, last quarter, in particular. So it's -- we've had some pluses and minuses, but overall, we're in a very good position entering this year. And in -- particularly in the GBC, we've hit our peak in our drawbelling in 2020. 
And just associated with the mine plan and consistent with our long-range plans, that starts to tail off. We don't need as many drawbells to continue to sustain the ramp-up in production. Deep MLZ, we pretty much stay steady for the next 3 years on drawbelling and undercutting. So the next 2 years is really just doing more of the same of growing these mines. There's no real rate increase in the amount of development. In fact, it's flatter or dropping off. And it's just a matter of continuing to be very consistent in how we've -- going forward as to what we've been able to demonstrate over the last couple of years and particularly in 2020."

There might have been some ones or twos that are different, but it's not anything that was significant in our forecast.
As Richard mentioned, it's more about this -- where we are in the ramping up of the tonnes, and it's more in line. Any changes in the tonnage is more a reflection of this material flow challenge that we're undertaking. But it's just marginally behind. And at the same time, the GBC is marginally ahead. And so the ramp-up rates are very consistent from one forecast to the other. Some slight changes in grades that are nothing significant. It's not drilling results. It's not any changes in reserves. It's simply where we're actually drawing. There's some -- at the end of every quarter, we reflect what we've done, and then we build that into what we're doing forward. So there's really no significant change in our underground plans, both at Deep MLZ and GBC.
The other 2 mines, DOZ and Big Gossan, are both very consistent. In fact, in Big Gossan, we've changed our stope sequencing a bit. That's going to add some metal. So we'll continue to look for opportunities and to reflect our actual production and operation over the previous quarters."

But when you look at underground mines in the industry, those are substantial mines in and of themselves. This copper difference is just a rounding. I mean, it's less than 1%. I mean, so we're right on plan for copper. And the gold things, remember, we had higher goal now, we upgraded our goal for 2022. So every year, there's going to be those kinds of adjustments. We're going to try to produce more gold, which we're able to do in 2020. And then we adjust our plans for that. So we're -- there's nothing here other than we're right on our targets, and everything is going as planned.
The financial policy, I'll go back and say what I've said before. We have ongoing and formal discussions with Board members. We have formal Board members coming up. My anticipation is that there will be a restoration of our dividend and then a financial policy that will give guidance to the market of how we will be dividing cash flows in the future for further debt reduction. Although, quite frankly, we're -- if you look at our cash flows that we talked to you about today and in a $3.50 copper price, we get down to about $3 million of net debt at the end of 2022. So we certainly can support higher level of debts than that. And that means there's plenty of cash to enhance cash returns to shareholders and then have availability of funds and depending on how we structure it for future organic growth projects when we decide to initiate those. So restoration of dividend, a financial policy that will provide for increasing cash returns to shareholders over the long term with funds available for organic growth investments."

If we were sitting here, as we normally do around our conference desk in Phoenix, Kathleen would be kicking me out off the table because that question is just like giving a monkey a machine gun. 2003, we had gone through",716,"So we're working remotely, Lucas. If we were sitting here, as we normally do around our conference desk in Phoenix, Kathleen would be kicking me out off the table because that question is just like giving a monkey a machine gun. 2003, we had gone through a real tough time in copper with the economic issues of the late 1990s, the global recession, the global slowdown. 
Copper prices had dropped at one point to below $0.70. And I recall, and it was at a -- Timna, at a Merrill Lynch conference in Ireland, that was my first conference as CEO, it was right before I made CEO. And the price of copper just dipped over $0.70, nobody in the industry thought it could go beyond $1 within the foreseeable future. And everybody was running the business. So what happened? China emerged in a way nobody expected, created a whole new element of demand. Historically, whenever copper prices jumped up, the industry had projects primarily in Latin America to invest in. 
And the industry was widely divided and there'd be new investment. Supplies would come on, the business cycle would turn down and copper prices would drop. This time, China added, in 2003, a permanent element of new demand that was beyond the traditional demand from copper that was tied into global industrial production. And there was widespread expectation that the industry would invest and add new supplies. I remember my partnership, Goodyear, got up at that conference and said in price of copper, he hoped that the price wouldn't rise too much because it would create uneconomic investment. 
Well, what happened was the industry started looking for new projects then and geologically, they weren't there, and there were all these other barriers to investment. So we had higher prices without a supply response. That led us to do the Phelps Dodge deal in 2007. We're -- our market cap in 2003 was $6 billion. It was $12 billion at the Phelps Dodge deal. We did a $38 billion business combination, the biggest in the industry, lived through the financial crisis and then emerged in 2011 as a company with a $60 billion market cap and no debt. 
So what do we like here? The reason that I feel this is an echo is that we still have a world that's being burdened by the economic slowdown with COVID. While there had been recoveries in pockets of the economy, there's been stimulus by governments, and China has recovered much faster than we heard about earlier, think about a world where we had a slowdown to the extent we did in 2020 and copper inventories are at levels that we hadn't seen since the mid-2000s. 
And so here we are, and we just talked about how there's not a huge rush to invest in new projects. All the major companies want to grow copper as part of their portfolios. That's been the case since the mid-2000s, and they've been challenged in doing that. Projects today around the world, geologically, are more difficult, less quality than they were, underground, lower grades. You look at Cerro Verde, Cobre Panama. These are big, low-grade projects that require huge investments in infrastructure and equipment and mill processing. And then you have these barriers to production that keep some attractive projects around the world from going forward. 
You have political issues in countries that -- in Africa, it's challenged. Latin America is having political issues. Indonesia's been what it's been. So I do feel that if the world's global economy recovers in a reasonable way, not an extreme way, and we have this big move towards -- look at all the stats that are coming about for electric vehicles in the United States. I mean, think about what General Motors is doing and what China is doing. 
You think about the change in the global perception about climate change in the United States, forest fires, hurricanes. I mean, this is something that's going to have to be addressed. And when it is addressed, it's going to require tremendous amounts of infrastructure spending, extraordinary amounts. And in all of those elements of spending, there's an element of copper of significance into it. So that's why I feel like we are echoing 2003 today."

If you look back at Freeport, when copper prices began rising in 2003, 2004, we returned tremendous amounts of cash to investors out of Grasberg. We were like a royalty trust or an MLP or something. Then after Phelps Dodge, we delevered very quickly, and we start returning to paying dividends again. And we were well positioned in 2011 to continue to do that. The Board decided to invest in oil and gas and took it away. So here we are, coming back from the situation that we are now. We don't need a commodities boom to generate lots of cash to return to shareholders. 
At $3.50 copper, you see what the numbers are. I think copper could go much higher than $3.50. I can't guarantee it, but in my gut, and Timna, that's one of the reasons I want to keep working. I think it's going to be really a special time. And when that happens, we will be able to really return cash to shareholders in a substantial way. This question of investing, I mean, right now, money is so cheap, you wouldn't want to bring in a joint venture partner. That may not stay that way forever, but financing is incredibly cheap and available. 
And I wish Phelps Dodge hadn't given up the interest in Morenci or the interest in Cerro Verde. So if we got good projects, we'll look at the most efficient way to finance it. That could well be -- could be partners because lots of people want to be our partners. And then others may have projects that we have the opportunity to join in on. There could be opportunities in the M&A market. But all of that is part of this really bright future that I see for Freeport. The vision right now is focused on getting 2021 to be as successful as 2020 was. 
And when that happens, when that happens, and we got long-term run rates at Grasberg, Josh and his team has fine-tuned our business in the Americas. We got this Lone Star project, don't overlook that. That could be a new Morenci down the road. This is just a company that's really well situated to generate cash, not have to do anything to have a sustainable future but having the world open to us to do lots of different things.

We released our results this morning, and a copy of today's press release and slides are available on our website at fcx.com. 
Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. 
In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. 
Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. Like to refer every one to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our annual report on Form 10-K. 
On the call with me today, Richard Adkerson, our Chairman and CEO. We've got Mark Johnson, who leads our Indonesian operations; Josh Olmsted, who leads our Americas operations; Mike Kendrick, who leads our Molybdenum business; Steve Higgins, who leads our commercial activities and is our Chief Administrative Officer as well; and Rick Coleman, who leads our project development activities. 
And I'll just start with briefly summarizing our financial results. We'll work through our slides and some prepared remarks, and then we'll take your questions. 
Today, we reported first quarter 2021 net income attributable to common stock of $718 million. That was $0.48 per share. And adjusted net income of $756 million or $0.51 per share after adjusting for net charges totaling $38 million or $0.03 per share. And the detail of those net nonrecurring charges are in the press release on Roman numeral VI. 
We reported adjusted earnings before interest taxes, depreciation and amortization or adjusted EBITDA during the quarter of $2.04 billion, and we've got a reconciliation of our EBITDA calculations on Page 36 of our slide deck. 
In the first quarter of 2021, we had copper sales of 825 million pounds, which approximated our estimate. Our gold production in the first quarter of 2021 was in line with our estimate in January. However, we had a deferral of certain shipments in Indonesia to the second quarter, and that resulted in a timing variance for our gold sales. 
In the first quarter, we benefited from improved pricing. Our first quarter average realized copper price was $3.94 per pound, substantially above the year ago quarter. And our gold price of $17.13 per ounce was also above the year ago realized price. 
We continue to focus on maintaining a low-cost position. Our consolidated average unit net costs for our copper mines average $1.39 per pound of copper in the first quarter. We generated strong operating cash flows totaling $1.1 billion, and that was net of $300 million of working capital uses. And the cash flows exceeded capital spending, which totaled $370 million during the quarter. 
As you've seen, our Board in February adopted a new financial policy aligned with our strategic objectives of maintaining the strong balance sheet, increasing cash returns to shareholders and advancing opportunities for future growth. 
We ended the quarter in a strong financial position with $4.6 billion of consolidated cash, $9.8 billion of debt and our net debt -- our debt net of cash was $5.2 billion at the end of March. 
Richard, I'd like to turn the call over to you, and we'll start reviewing the slide materials that are on our website."

I couldn't be more pleased to be able to review with you our first quarter performance and particularly the exciting progress we've achieved over the past year where we all faced such uncertainties. It's a special, active invigorating time here at Freeport. Our teams are working safely. We remain vigilant with COVID as we have successfully executed our operations plans, and we're now working on projects for future growth. 
Our Grasberg underground ramp-up is proceeding on schedule. That's key for our strategy. Production in the United States is increasing with our newly commissioned Lone Star mine, the first quarter start -- restart of our Chino mine in New Mexico, and from increased mine rates, where we, at Morenci, our flagship mine in the U.S., the largest in North America, where we could curtail production a year ago to conserve cash. 
In South America, we're working to restore production levels to prepandemic levels, and we'll achieve that over the next 12 months. The Cerro Verde team in Peru and our El Abra team in Chile are doing an outstanding work in navigating these issues. 
We are focusing on sustainability initiatives as all businesses are. This has always been key to Freeport in managing our operations. We are moving to certify each of our operations with the new Copper Mark. This Copper Mark is an industry framework that was recently developed by the International Copper Association to ensure responsible production consistent with UN Sustainable Development Goals. To date, we lead the industry with 6 of our operations now certified, and we're working to get all certified. 
Going to the slides, I have just a few slides to review with you. On Slide 3, our annual sustainability report has been published and is now available on our website. This is the 20th year we've reported on sustainability. We're working to make it better. I encourage all of you -- each of you to read it. We are proud of our good work on sustainability and remain committed to continuous improvement.
Past years, we released this report with our annual shareholders at our Annual Shareholders meeting. We moved it up. We've added new resources to our Freeport team working on sustainability issues. And I congratulate this team for their efforts to make this report available now earlier so that we can facilitate our expanding engagements with the broad set of constituencies that are now focused on our sustainability performance and initiatives. 
Last year, we published our initial report on climate. Our 2021 report is forthcoming. We recently published our annual report to shareholders with what I think is a great theme, charging ahead, responsibly, reliably and relentlessly. This theme portrays where we are currently positioned at Freeport. As a leading and growing global copper producer, we are determined to succeed and operate responsibly. In the Freeport tradition, we'll be relentless in the execution of our strategy. 
Slide 4. Our first quarter production was in line with our targets. We increased our 2021 sales guidance 3.85 billion pounds of copper and our 2022 volumes to 4.4 billion pounds. 
The Grasberg ramp-up that I referenced earlier continues to progress in a simply outstanding fashion. We've now achieved 75% of our annualized targeted long run metal production run rate. We are on track to be at 90% by the third quarter and full rates by year-end. After all these years of hard work, reporting this progress is simply a highlight of my career. The credit, though, goes to our team on the ground in Indonesia, supported by our global team of technical experts. This is a historical major accomplishment as we've converted as we are finalizing the conversion of the Grasberg open pit To this massive underground operations. 
Our Americas businesses are going well. We are achieving production and cost targets, and now we're actively focusing and working on future growth opportunities, generating strong cash flows, improving our balance sheet. Over the past 12 months, net debt was reduced by over $3 billion to $5.2 billion by the end of this first quarter. But during this period, copper price averaged $3.13. It's now over $4.25. Many are predicting higher prices near term. Our near-term outlook of copper and gold sales volumes is substantially higher. Our recent performance, this large reduction in debt with lower commodity prices, lower production volumes demonstrates the current strength of our company and generating cash flows. Our strong performance and the positive outlook for our business and the commodities has enabled our Board to adopt a new financial policy, which will provide increasing cash returns to shareholders while providing flexibility for growth and building a very strong balance sheet. 
We've also added 2 new directors: David Abney, the retired Chairman and CEO of UPS, with its massive global supply chain operations; and Bob Dudley, the retired CEO of BP, a long time leader in the global extractive industry, have joined our Board. Each of these men have strong knowledge and experience in global markets and with issues we face in managing our business. Bob and David had many opportunities to join other boards. Their decisions to join our boards is personally gratifying and appreciated. They are really enthusiastic about working with their fellow directors at Freeport and our management team and creating value responsibly for our stakeholders. 
Moving to Slide 5. Countries around the world are responding to COVID with aggressive fiscal and monetary policies. This is an important element of near-term demand for copper, extending beyond China. China has been the driver of copper demand growth over the past 2 decades. Now the source of new demand is expanding. In addition to continuing strong copper consumption in China, higher copper consumption in developed countries with COVID recovery initiatives and the increasingly important demand in emerging markets driven by global growth, copper now has major new sources of demand from global investments in carbon reduction, infrastructure and expanded technology, 5G, artificial intelligence and data analytics broadly all require more copper. 
Importantly, copper is essential to the transition to a global cleaner energy future. Roughly 70% of copper is used delivery electricity. As clean energy initiatives are implemented, copper intensity in the economy expands in a major way. The outlook for copper has never been better. 
Slide 6. Significant demand growth is inevitable. The supply to meet this growth is severely challenged. It's going to require meaningfully higher prices to support mine investment. The combination of rising demand, scarcity of new supplies point to large impending structural deficits, supporting much higher copper prices than previously anticipated. I'm sure you've noted this in recent forecast by widening group of industry analysts. Freeport is notably well positioned to benefit from these fundamentals, a leading responsible large-scale producer of copper with near-term and longer-term growth embedded in our portfolio. The scarcity value of a portfolio like ours is unique. It's extremely valuable now, and it's going to be even more valuable as large market deficits emerge. 
Slide 7 highlights our near-term growth. For 2021, copper volumes are anticipated to be 20% higher and gold volumes 50% higher than in 2020 -- 55% higher than in 2020. Volumes are expected to grow further in 2020 in the 15% to 20% range for both copper and gold. The capital to achieve these near-term higher volumes and the execution risks are largely behind us. Higher volumes with low incremental costs will yield expanded margins. At prices ranging from $4 to $5 for copper, we would generate annual EBITDA for 2022 and 2023 of over $12 billion to the range of $17 billion per annum. That's big numbers. 
Page 8 describes this new financial policy adopted -- our Board adopted earlier this year, is designed first to support a strong balance sheet, increased returns to shareholders and provide funds for investments for the future. The current market for copper and its favorable outlook are providing substantial cash flows to meet these objectives as I just outlined. Our Board approved a base dividend of $0.30 per annum per share. Our first quarterly dividend will be paid in May after -- as we resume dividends, after reaching a target net debt in the $3 billion to $4 billion range, which at today's prices will do by the end of this year. Our Board's policy establishes as a performance-based payout framework for additional cash return to shareholders through dividends and potentially stock buybacks. 
Returns to shareholders will be determined by allocating available cash flow of up to 50% to shareholder returns and the balance available for future growth and potentially further debt reduction below our targeted $3 billion to $4 billion. Our Board will assess the additional payout at least annually. With the current level of copper prices and the outlook for copper and gold prices, the numbers above point to a large cash returns to shareholders with substantial financial resources available for future growth investments. 
Slide 9 describes some of these growth investments. We have multiple options across our portfolio. We resumed our work that we suspended a year ago because of COVID to evaluate in the timing and the initiation of these opportunities. In the U.S., we're looking at expansions at Lone Star and Bagdad and also evaluating opportunities to increase production from leach recovery technologies. That's really exciting. 
The Lone Star mine is our newest mine. It's adjacent to our existing operations in Southeast Arizona where the company's operations go back to the 1,800s. There, we have strong community support. We have great relationships with the Native American groups. We're evaluating expansions of Lone Star's oxides ore, which we're now producing and which are growing in terms of the availability of ores. But importantly, we're also conducting these longer-range planning for the development in what looks to be a potentially world-class sulfide resource right in the midst of this historical mining area. 
At Bagdad, in Northwest Arizona, we have an opportunity to construct a new concentrator to double production. We have a very long reserve life there. Also there, we have strong community support. I keep emphasizing this because that's a challenge for new supply development around the world. 
We are focused on technology to reduce capital intensity in these projects. Leach technology initiatives provide substantial opportunities in this regard to add value all across the portfolio. We're continuing to evaluate an attractive, potentially significant expansion of our El Abra mine in Chile where we're partners with CODELCO. This project would require larger investment and longer lead times than our U.S. project. Resource is attractive and very large. And this signifies that a major future expansion of El Abra is likely. 
We're evaluating the development of a new deposit and undeveloped deposit at PT-FI and Papua, Indonesia. It's called Kucing liar. This copper-gold project involves a large block cave mine using the substantial infrastructure already in place for Grasberg. It would benefit from our expertise and long track record of success in block caving. 
We're also -- and this is a lot of fun in evaluating a series of interesting investments in projects that support our carbon reduction and other sustainability goals. This involves ideas of developing new energy generation. It's clean, renewable for our operations in nearby communities. And we're advancing plans for an exciting projects at Atlanta Copy and Spain to recover valuable metals through recycling and electronic devices, which, again, is good from a sustainability standpoint. 
Now we have these opportunities, we're going to be disciplined by making new investments by being selective and measured in deploying capital, focused on value-added investments and do this because we have such long live reserves, established license to operate, and we're going to work with communities effective by new investments. 
Slide 10 points to this reserve position. Our reserve life is over 30 years. Now that's proved and probable economically recoverable reserves. In addition, we have identified over 100 million pounds of copper from metal resources beyond reserves, all part of our existing operations. We're going to be working to incorporate these into future reserve additions and mine plans. It is becoming increasingly more challenging and costly for our industry to develop supplies to meet the dramatically increasing demand for copper. And our team literally loves where our Freeport is situated in this environment. 
Slide 11. We have strong operating franchises in the U.S., South America and Indonesia. In all of these localities, we've earned the trust and respect of our partners, our customers, suppliers, financial markets and most importantly, our workers, communities in the countries where we operate. We have significant development in large-scale operating expertise -- development and large-scale operating expertise. We have all the capabilities now to undertake new projects anywhere in the world, regardless of the ore of the situation in a responsible and efficient manner. 
I want to close by recognizing the people of Freeport around the globe. Their commitment, dedication are remarkable achievements over the past year of COVID is really special. In the context of all the challenges our team has faced over the years and we have overcome, I'm just immensely proud of this team. Building on these accomplishments with an increasingly bright future, Freeport is charging ahead responsibly, reliably and relentlessly. 
Kathleen is going to review the financial results with you."

Starting on Slide 14, we provide some additional details on our operating activities. You can see in the U.S., the Lone Star mine is operating well. We see opportunities to continue to increase our stacking rates there and fill up the tank house, which has a capacity in the 285 million pound per annum range. With continued success in increasing the mining and stacking rates, we'll have an opportunity for relatively low incremental investments, increased production from the Lone Star oxides, well above the original design. 
We restarted Chino in the first quarter at a 50% rate. And as we gain the efficiencies we are targeting there, we'll likely have opportunities to ramp up further. At Morenci, we're increasing mining rates by about 10%. This was previously planned for 2022, but we are accelerating this, which will give us additional production in 2022 compared with the earlier plan and set us up for growing production over time. 
In South America, the team was able to achieve stronger rates compared with our plan. Because of the operating restrictions in Peru, we felt it was prudent to maintain our plan this year at a milling rate of 360,000 tonnes per day and we expect to ramp that up over the next 12 months to the 400,000 tonne per day level as COVID restrictions are lifted. 
At El Abra, we're making great progress increasing our operating rates to provide additional copper in 2022. As Richard mentioned, at Grasberg, we made excellent progress in the first quarter, continuing to execute the ramp-up plan to achieve our targeted metal run rates by the end of the year. We ended the first quarter with more inventory than originally expected, and these sales will be recorded in the second quarter. You will note from our detailed schedules in the reference material that we made some small changes in the Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ mine sequencing. The net effect of these were not material to our metal production, and the outlook is similar to the prior plans. We're very encouraged with the scale of the ramp-up going on both at Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ. We'll be adding a second crusher at Grasberg Block Cave this quarter, which will set us up to continue to increase rates there. 
On the next slide, we provide an update on our plans to develop new smelter capacity in Indonesia to meet our commitments to the government. We're proceeding with our Japanese partners at PT Smelting to expand the existing smelter. This can be done on a relatively low-cost basis and would reduce the required capacity for the new smelter to 1.7 million tonnes of concentrate per annum. The cost for PT Smelting is roughly $250 million. And PT-FI would fund these costs through a bank financing, which is currently in progress. 
As you've read, we have been engaging in discussions with third-party for the balance of the requirement, whereby this party would build the new smelter under a structure similar to what we developed for the PT smelting existing smelter in the 1990s. To date, the parties have had extensive negotiations, but we have not yet reached acceptable commercial terms. In the interim, we're continuing our planning on the greenfield project in East Java. 
As we show on this chart on the right, you'll see that the long-term cost, the economics for the financing of the smelter, which we would plan to finance with debt, would be offset by a phaseout of the 5% export duty we're currently paying. So the economic impact for PT-FI is not material. 
On slide -- on the next slide, Slide 16, we provide our 3-year outlook for copper volumes, gold volumes and molybdenum volumes. We're increasing our copper sales volumes in 2021 to 3.85 billion pounds from the prior estimate of just over 3.8 billion pounds. And we've increased our 2022 guidance by 100 million pounds to 4.4 billion pounds of copper, and that's reflective of incremental increases in the U.S. The rest of the sales estimates are largely unchanged. As Richard mentioned, we're continuing to assess additional incremental near-term growth opportunities while we conduct our longer-range development planning. 
We provided on Slide 17 an overview of our estimated unit net cash cost for the year. You will note that we have updated our estimate to average $1.33 per pound of copper in net unit cash costs compared with the prior estimate of $1.25 per pound. A large portion of this increase is associated with higher royalties, duties and profit sharing related to the change in price assumptions from $3.50 per pound of copper to $4 per pound. We've also increased our cost estimates to reflect higher energy costs, principally oil related, which our forecast is now higher by about 25%. Our team continues to do a great job in managing costs efficiently. We have seen some increases, but they have not been -- they've not been significant. Our team continues to look for creative ways to maintain our low-cost position. 
On Slide 18, we show the significance of cash flow generation using our volume and cost estimates, and we provided sensitivities ranging from $4 per pound copper to $5, and we hold gold flat at $1,750 per ounce and molybdenum an $11 per pound. The growth in volumes at low incremental costs results in very significant EBITDA generation. You can see here ranging from over $12.5 billion per annum on average for 2022 and 2023 at $4 copper to $17 billion per annum at $5 copper. Operating cash flows under these price scenarios would range from nearly $9 billion to $12 billion. And these cash flows are significantly above our planned capital spending, providing substantial free cash flows as we go forward. 
On Slide 19, we show our capital project forecast and we show projected capital of $2.3 billion in 2021. That includes potential spending on the Indonesian smelter, which, again, would be debt financed. But these -- the 2021 guidance numbers are very similar to what we had in our previous reports. Our 2022 capital of $2.2 billion on a consolidated basis is about $200 million higher than our previous forecast, and that incorporates an acceleration of mining investments to bring volumes forward and provide capacity assurance for our plans. We've entered -- we are in a strong financial position and have entered a period of exceptional free cash flow generation. 
Slide 20 kind of shows you that the exceptional cash flow generation that we have in the business. You can see on the slide where in a 6-month period of time, our cash balance has increased by over $2 billion. Our long-lived asset base, our growing production profile, strong markets provide the ability to continue to strengthen our balance sheet, provide cash returns to shareholders and build additional values in our asset base. Our financial policy that Richard talked about earlier is designed to tick all of these boxes, and we look forward to executing on these plans. 
And in closing, I'd just say to echo what Richard said, it's an exciting time at Freeport. We've got the right assets at the right time, and we're staying focused on continuing our momentum. And now operator, I would like to open the call for questions."

But it sounds like there's a significant amount of cash returns potential upcoming of the assumed current copper prices. But maybe on the other side of that, could you discuss how you're thinking about when the right time the sanction growth would be? And any color you can provide on sort of long-term or sustainable copper prices that you would need to see or need the base case in your assumptions for this? And then you mentioned being disciplined and selective. But as you look over the next couple of years, at what point would you start considering up pulling the trigger on growth?"

And now we've resumed those analysis with the purpose of understanding the pros and cons of each of the projects and developing an evaluation of them. That basic work of the valuation we expect to continue at least through the end of this year. And by the end of the year, we hope to be able to have a clear path, a clear path forward. So it will be some time before there is any commitment to actually initiate significant capital spending. And then in the meantime, we pointed to all the volume growth that's coming about from Grasberg, the resumption of operations from COVID, et cetera. So we're going to have increasing volumes with strong prices and high cash flows. With limited amount of capital being spent because we just won't be ready, as you say, to sanction projects. 
We don't have any particular targeted copper price. We've always looked at a scenario of different prices that -- of how a new project would fit into our portfolio. We want to take advantage of these resources that we have and yet have risk management by how they fit into all of our existing portfolio. So we don't look at it so much on an individual project-by-project basis, but how does it fit in with with our projects. 
Freeport really benefits from the fact that we operate all of the projects we have interest in. So that allows us to approach these on a -- from a consistent corporate strategic basis as opposed to an individual project-by-project basis. 
Certainly, at these price levels, our projects are economic. And now you know the prospects are for prices to go much higher. So I anticipate that over time, we will be spending money on capital. That's just not going to happen in the near term. And that's going to be a feature of the entire industry because even when we decide to spend, the time frame for developing a project is multiple years, minimum 6 to 8 years. So all of that's going to be, as you well know, Emily, because you write about it all the time, that's going to be very supportive of copper prices. You can't turn on the valve quickly to add new mine supply. And when you can't do that and volume and demand rises, that translates into higher prices."

It was good to see that you appear to be operating well there despite the escalation of COVID.

So the first question is related to the contracts and licenses that you have in Peru. Is it similar to what you have in Indonesia where you have a stability agreement with international arbitration provisions should something go wrong in terms of government trying to significantly increase taxes or try to nationalize the mine. is that -- do you have that same sort of protection there?"

So we just step back and watch political environments. We know we have to work with whatever government, wherever in the world that a country selects. But we do have strong rights to do that. 
And unlike some operations in Peru, we have positive relationships with the local community because of social investments we've made in water and wastewater projects. So our team there is just -- I mean, I can't tell you what a great job they go. A year ago, we were really worried about Peru. Our workers lived in the city of Arequipa.

We did do some drilling over the last couple of years. And we revisited some of the metallurgical work. The big change there was, and as Richard alluded to, the original KL mine plan was more focused on higher copper equivalent grade, but it also had much higher pyrite and required a significant change to our processing. The new mine plan focuses on some slightly lower copper equivalent portion of the resource that has now become the reserve. And we've -- and it's part of the ore body. Essentially, we leave the mill as it is. The pyrite problem is largely diminished and almost eliminated. So the overall capital as far as processing, power requirements, environmental management have dropped significantly. In addition, this new portion of the new mine plan, the areas that we mine, the gold recoveries go up substantially. We -- in our initial reserves, several years ago, gold recoveries were below 50%. The new plan has gold recoveries over 60%, and we think there's upside there. So it's a much less capital intensive, much more robust plan, a lot less environmental management costs to go with this new KL plan. 
The one thing, Richard mentioned it, it's independent, but in some ways, it does tie in. We share parts of the GBC ore flow system. KL ramps up, and in coordination with the GBC plan, we used some of the same conveyor. And then the big part was that the mill is relatively unchanged with this new plan."

And in the in light of that, when we think about the framework for retaining capital versus returning capital, to what extent could this be subject to review we spend a lot of time on this call talking about organic growth, for example. so could there be an incentive to toggle this ratio more towards the growth side. and then along the same vein, M&A, have your views on that evolved? And if so, what geography could make sense? Would you be -- could you be looking at producing miners or would you book preproduction? Would appreciate any updated thoughts on that as well."

And I say there's 3 kind of eras of copper demand, pre-early 2000s, it was all driven by developed countries' GDP. Copper is most correlated commodity to GDP, and it would rise and fall based on business cycles. China emerged and now for almost 2 decades has dominated new demand growth. It's all come from China when you look at it. The rest of the world has kind of been flat. 
The new era today, which is so exciting, is China's rate of growth, which people have been pointing to for some time, inevitably is falling, has to fall. COVID's kind of complicated all that up. But it's absolute demand for copper volumes is so strong because this economy has grown, and that's going to continue with the -- even as it pivots its economy to consumers and exports, its -- the absolute amount of copper that it grows, even though the rate of growth will drop, absolutely not be strong. Now the reason I'm so excited about now is now you've got -- it's COVID recovered in the developed world, but also all this movement around the world, you see it clearly here in the United States to push money to a broader set of people to enhance consumption, all this move towards incoming and equality, which everybody recognize we got to do. And that's going to create new copper demand. And then my long-term story has always been in the undeveloped global growth, all the vast numbers of people around the world that are living in substandard conditions have aspirations of having better conditions, that requires more energy, more transportation, communication, more copper. So that's why I say the demand side to me is in a new era, and it's really positive. And the supply side, I don't know how it's going to keep up with it. I literally don't. Here, we have all of these projects at Freeport. The price of copper could double overnight. Some people are talking about it doubling anyway. But overnight, and we couldn't add new production of significance for a number of years, for a number of years. So it's going to be really interesting to see prices -- I just -- unless there's some global calamity, prices, it just seems to me, clearly have to rise substantially. Substitution has to occur. Scrap has to grow. But how to meet that demand. And that's why I'm so thrilled about where we are after all this time working to put this company together. John Tumazos referenced it. I mean we've been through so much. But I recall, Kathleen and I developed a strategy in 2003, 2004 when I became CEO of focusing on copper. And now it's so great here, all these years later to see it coming to fruition."

Our strategy is straightforward: execute, invest, invest in a disciplined way in our resources that provide growth that create value. If something comes to us, we're going to be in a position to consider it, but that's not our strategic objective. 
You mentioned start-up operations, and that's come to us all the time. But we have trouble -- it's been a big barrier to make the economics of those work because to get into it, you've got to pay the value that's been made already. When we have all these resources in our portfolio where there's no value being given to them in our share price. So we see -- that's been a real barrier of making even what might be, at some level, interesting projects work economically for our company.

But it does sound like the project, as for John's comment, has changed. So I just want to try and understand a little bit because when you look at the grade of this, at the point, the reserve grade is, whatever, 0.9 copper and 0.9 gram per tonne gold. So it's a little more gold than some of the others. So in this new plan, I guess my first question is, you talked about certain areas of the ore body. Is there an area that's higher grade which you start, which helps the economics? And my second question, it sounds like the new plan obviously saves CapEx, which is good. Technically, probably is easier, which is good. But then you talk about lower copper equivalencies, so I'm trying to figure out just how much lower that copper equivalency is.

So what we've done in this new plan is brought forward. There's about half of the old reserve that overlaps with the -- that overlaps with the old reserve. And then there's another half where we've deferred a part of the lower-value ore and being able to substitute it with higher-value ore. This order that we're now mining would be sediment hosted, very similar to what we've milled for years in the DOZ, Deep MLZ. The old reserve was very much centered on this, this fault that had the highest grades, but had, as Richard and Kathleen mentioned, some of the bigger challenges were a new mill. We had to grind it much finer. That came with additional power requirements. And then we had to manage the pyrite, which for us is to segregate it from the [indiscernible] storage separately. So by recognizing all the costs that are associated with some of the higher copper equivalent grade, that's a combination of the copper and gold value and substitute it with looking more on a value rather than purely on copper equivalency.

Like to refer every one to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our annual report on Form 10-K.
On the call with me today is Richard Adkerson, our Chairman and CEO. We've got Mark Johnson, who leads our Indonesian operations; Josh Olmsted, who leads our Americas operations; Mike Kendrick, who leads our molybdenum business; Steve Higgins, who leads our commercial activities and is our Chief Administrative Officer as well; and Rick Coleman, who leads our project development activities. And I'll just start with briefly summarizing our financial results. We'll work through our slides and some prepared remarks, and then we will take your questions.
Today, we reported first quarter 2021 net income attributable to common stock of $718 million, that was $0.48 per share. And adjusted net income of $756 million or $0.51 per share after adjusting for net charges totaling $38 million or $0.03 per share, and a detail of those net nonrecurring charges are in the press release on Roman numeral VI. We reported adjusted earnings before interest taxes, depreciation and amortization or adjusted EBITDA during the quarter of $2.04 billion, and we've got a reconciliation of our EBITDA calculations on Page 36 of our slide deck. 
In the first quarter of 2021, we had copper sales of 825 million pounds, which approximated our estimate. Our gold production in the first quarter of 2021 was in line with our estimate in January. However, we had a deferral of certain shipments in Indonesia to the second quarter, and that resulted in a timing variance for our gold sales. In the first quarter, we benefited from improved pricing. Our first quarter average realized copper price was $3.94 per pound, substantially above the year ago quarter. And our gold price of $17.13 per ounce was also above the year ago realized price. 
We continue to focus on maintaining a low-cost position. Our consolidated average unit net costs for our copper mines average $1.39 per pound of copper in the first quarter. We generated strong operating cash flows totaling $1.1 billion, and that was net of $300 million of working capital uses. And the cash flow has exceeded capital spending, which totaled $370 million during the quarter. As you've seen, our Board, in February, adopted a new financial policy aligned with our strategic objectives of maintaining the strong balance sheet, increasing cash returns to shareholders and advancing opportunities for future growth. We ended the quarter in a strong financial position with $4.6 billion of consolidated cash, $9.8 billion of debt and our net debt -- our debt, net of cash, was $5.2 billion at the end of March.
Richard, I'd like to turn the call over to you, and we'll start reviewing the slide materials that are on our website."

I couldn't be more pleased to be able to review with you our first quarter performance and particularly the exciting progress we've achieved over the past year where we all faced such uncertainties. It's a special, active invigorating time here at Freeport. Our teams are working safely. We remain vigilant with COVID as we have successfully executed our operations' plans, and we're now working on projects for future growth. 
Our Grasberg underground ramp up is proceeding on schedule, that's key for our strategy. Production in the United States is increasing with our newly commissioned Lone Star mine, the first quarter start -- restart of our Chino mine in New Mexico, and from increased mine rates where we -- at Morenci, our flagship mine in the U.S., the largest in North America, where we could curtail production a year ago to conserve cash.
In South America, we're working to restore production levels to prepandemic levels, and we'll achieve that over the next 12 months. The Cerro Verde team in Peru and our El Abra team in Chile are doing an outstanding work in navigating these issues. We are focusing on sustainability initiatives as all businesses are. This has always been key to Freeport in managing our operations. We are moving to certify each of our operations with the new Copper Mark. This Copper Mark is an industry framework that was recently developed by the International Copper Association to ensure responsible production consistent with UN Sustainable Development Goals. To date, we lead the industry with 6 of our operations now certified, and we're working to get all certified.
Going to the slides, I have just a few slides to review with you. On Slide 3, our annual sustainability report has been published and is now available on our website. This is the 20th year we've reported on sustainability. We're working to make it better. I encourage all of you -- each of you to read it. We are proud of our good work on sustainability and remain committed to continuous improvement. Past years, we released this report with our annual shareholders at our Annual Shareholders' meeting. We moved it up. We've added new resources to our Freeport team working on sustainability issues. And I congratulate this team for their efforts to make this report available now earlier so that we can facilitate our expanding engagements with a broad set of constituencies that are now focused on our sustainability performance and initiatives. 
Last year, we published our initial report on climate. Our 2021 report is forthcoming. We recently published our annual report to shareholders with what I think is a great theme, charging ahead, responsibly, reliably and relentlessly. This theme portrays where we are currently positioned at Freeport. As a leading and growing global copper producer, we are determined to succeed and operate responsibly, and the Freeport tradition will be relentless in the execution of our strategy.
Slide 4. Our first quarter production was in line with our targets. We increased our 2021 sales guidance 3.85 billion pounds of copper and our 2022 volumes to 4.4 billion pounds. The Grasberg ramp up that I referenced earlier continues to progress in a simply outstanding fashion. We've now achieved 75% of our annualized targeted long-run metal production run rate. We are on track to be at 90% by the third quarter and full rates by year-end. After all these years of hard work, reporting this progress is simply a highlight of my career. The credit, though, goes to our team on the ground in Indonesia, supported by our global team of technical experts. This is a historical major accomplishment as we've converted -- as we are finalizing the conversion of the Grasberg open pit to this massive underground operations.
Americas businesses are going well. We are achieving production and cost targets. And now we're actively focusing and working on future growth opportunities, generating strong cash flows, improving our balance sheet. Over the past 12 months, net debt was reduced by over $3 billion to $5.2 billion by the end of this first quarter. But during this period, copper price averaged $3.13. It's now over $4.25. Many are predicting higher prices near term. Our near-term outlook of copper and gold sales volumes is substantially higher. Our recent performance, this large reduction in debt with lower commodity prices, lower production volumes, demonstrates the current strength of our company in generating cash flows. Our strong performance and the positive outlook for our business and the commodities has enabled our Board to adopt a new financial policy, which will provide increasing cash returns to shareholders while providing flexibility for growth and building a very strong balance sheet.
We've also added 2 new directors: David Abney, the retired Chairman and CEO of UPS, with its massive global supply chain operations; and Bob Dudley, the retired CEO of BP, a long-time leader in the global extractive industry, have joined our Board. Each of these men have strong knowledge and experience in global markets and with issues we face in managing our business. Bob and David had many opportunities to join other Board. Their decisions to join our Board is personally gratifying and appreciated. They are really enthusiastic about working with their fellow directors at Freeport and our management team and creating value responsibly for our stakeholders.
Moving to Slide 5. Countries around the world are responding to COVID with aggressive fiscal and monetary policies. This is an important element of near-term demand for copper, extending beyond China. China has been the driver of copper demand growth over the past 2 decades. Now the source of new demand is expanding. In addition to continuing strong copper consumption in China, higher copper consumption in developed countries with COVID recovery initiatives and the increasingly important demand in emerging markets driven by global growth, copper now has major new sources of demand from global investments in carbon reduction, infrastructure and expanded technology, 5G, artificial intelligence and data analytics broadly all require more copper. Importantly, copper is essential to the transition to a global cleaner energy future. Roughly 70% of copper is used to deliver electricity. As clean energy initiatives are implemented, copper intensity in the economy expands in a major way. The outlook for copper has never been better. 
Slide 6. Significant demand growth is inevitable. Supply to meet this growth is severely challenged. It's going to require meaningfully higher prices to support mine investment. The combination of rising demand, scarcity of new supplies point to large impending structural deficits, supporting much higher copper prices than previously anticipated. I'm sure you've noted this in recent forecast by mining group of industry analysts. Freeport is notably well positioned to benefit from these fundamentals, a leading responsible large-scale producer of copper with near-term and longer-term growth embedded in our portfolio. The scarcity value of a portfolio, like ours, is unique. It's extremely valuable now and it's going to be even more valuable as large market deficits emerge. 
Slide 7 highlights our near-term growth. For 2021, copper volumes are anticipated to be 20% higher and gold volumes 50% higher than in 2020 -- 55% higher than in 2020. Volumes are expected to grow further in 2020 in the 15% to 20% range for both copper and gold. The capital to achieve these near-term higher volumes and the execution risks are largely behind us. Higher volumes with low incremental costs will yield expanded margins. At prices ranging from $4 to $5 for copper, we would generate annual EBITDA for 2022 and 2023 of over $12 billion to the range of $17 billion per annum. That's big numbers.
Page 8 describes this new financial policy adopted -- our Board adopted earlier this year. It's designed first to support a strong balance sheet, increased returns to shareholders and provide funds for our investments for the future. The current market for copper and its favorable outlook are providing substantial cash flows to meet these objectives as I just outlined. Our Board approved a base dividend of $0.30 per annum per share. Our first quarterly dividend will be paid in May after -- as we resume dividends, after reaching a target net debt in the $3 billion to $4 billion range, which at today's prices will do by the end of this year. Our Board's policy establishes as a performance-based payout framework for additional cash return to shareholders through dividends and potentially stock buybacks.
Returns to shareholders will be determined by allocating available cash flow of up to 50% to shareholder returns and the balance available for future growth and potentially further debt reduction below our targeted $3 billion to $4 billion. Our Board will assess the additional payout, at least, annually. With the current level of copper prices and the outlook for copper and gold prices, the numbers noted above point to a large cash returns to shareholders with substantial financial resources available for future growth investments. 
Slide 9 describes some of these growth investments. We have multiple options across our portfolio. We resumed our work that we suspended a year ago because of COVID to evaluate in the timing and the initiation of these opportunities. In the U.S., we're looking at expansions at Lone Star and Bagdad and also evaluating opportunities to increase production from leach recovery technologies. That's really exciting. 
The Lone Star mine is our newest mine. It's adjacent to our existing operations in Southeast Arizona where the company's operations go back to the 1800s. There, we have strong community support. We have great relationships with the Native American groups. We're evaluating expansions of Lone Star's oxides ore, which we're now producing and which are growing in terms of the availability of ores. But importantly, we're also conducting these longer-range planning for the development in what looks to be a potentially world-class sulfide resource right in the midst of this historical mining area. 
At Bagdad, in Northwest Arizona, we have an opportunity to construct a new concentrator to double production. We have a very long reserve life there. Also, there, we have strong community support. I keep emphasizing this because that's a challenge for new supply development around the world. 
We are focused on technology to reduce capital intensity in these projects. Leach technology initiatives provide substantial opportunities in this regard to add value all across the portfolio. We're continuing to evaluate an attractive, potentially significant expansion of our El Abra mine in Chile where we're partnered with CODELCO. This project would require larger investment and longer lead times than our U.S. project. Resource is attractive and very large. This signifies that a major future expansion of El Abra is likely. 
We're evaluating the development of a new deposit, an undeveloped deposit, at PT-FI in Papua, Indonesia. It's called Kucing Liar. This copper-gold project involves a large block cave mine using the substantial infrastructure already in place for Grasberg. It would benefit from our expertise and long track record of success in block caving.
We're also -- and this is a lot of fun in evaluating a series of interesting investments in projects that support our carbon reduction and other sustainability goals. This involves ideas of developing new energy generation. It's clean, renewable for our operations and nearby communities. And we're advancing plans for an exciting projects at Atlantic Copper and Spain to recover valuable metals through recycling electronic devices, which, again, is good from a sustainability standpoint.
Now we have these opportunities. We're going to be disciplined by making new investments, by being selective and measured in deploying capital, focused on value-added investments and do this because we have such long live reserves, established license to operate and we're going to work with communities effective by new investments.
Slide 10 points to this reserve position. Our reserve life is over 30 years. Now that's proved and probable economically recoverable reserves. In addition, we have identified over 100 billion pounds of copper from metal resources beyond reserves, all part of our existing operations. We're going to be working to incorporate these into future reserve additions and mine plants. It is becoming increasingly more challenging and costly for our industry to develop supplies to meet the dramatically increasing demand for copper. And our team literally loves where our Freeport is situated in this environment.
Slide 11. We have strong operating franchises in the U.S., South America and Indonesia. In all of these localities, we've earned the trust and respect of our partners, our customers, suppliers, financial markets, and most importantly, our workers' communities in the countries where we operate. We have significant development in large-scale operating expertise -- development and large-scale operating expertise. We have all the capabilities now to undertake new projects anywhere in the world, regardless of the ore or the situation in a responsible and efficient manner.
I want to close by recognizing the people of Freeport around the globe. Their commitment, dedication are remarkable achievements over the past year of COVID is really special. In the context of all the challenges our team has faced over the years and we have overcome, I'm just immensely proud of this team. Building on these accomplishments with an increasingly bright future, Freeport is charging ahead responsibly, reliably and relentlessly. 
Kathleen is going to review the financial results with you."

Starting on Slide 14, we provide some additional details on our operating activities. You can see, in the U.S., the Lone Star mine is operating well. We see opportunities to continue to increase our stacking rates there and fill up the tank house, which has a capacity in the 285 million pound per annum range. With continued success in increasing the mining and stacking rates, we'll have an opportunity for relatively low incremental investments, increased production from the Lone Star oxides well above the original design. 
We restarted Chino in the first quarter at a 50% rate. And as we gain the efficiencies we are targeting there, we'll likely have opportunities to ramp up further. At Morenci, we're increasing mining rates by about 10%. This was previously planned for 2022, but we are accelerating this, which will give us additional production in 2022 compared with the earlier plan and set us up for growing production over time. 
In South America, the team was able to achieve stronger rates compared with our plan. Because of the operating restrictions in Peru, we felt it was prudent to maintain our plan this year at a milling rate of 360,000 tonnes per day, and we expect to ramp that up over the next 12 months to the 400,000 tonne per day level as COVID restrictions are lifted.
At El Abra, we're making great progress increasing our operating rates to provide additional copper in 2022. As Richard mentioned, at Grasberg, we made excellent progress in the first quarter, continuing to execute the ramp-up plan to achieve our targeted metal run rates by the end of the year. We ended the first quarter with more inventory than originally expected, and these sales will be recorded in the second quarter. You will note from our detailed schedules in the reference material that we made some small changes in the Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ mine sequencing. The net effect of these were not material to our metal production, and the outlook is similar to the prior plans. We're very encouraged with the scale of the ramp up going on both at Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ. We'll be adding a second crusher at Grasberg Block Cave this quarter, which will set us up to continue to increase rates there.
On the next slide, we provide an update on our plans to develop new smelter capacity in Indonesia to meet our commitments to the government. We're proceeding with our Japanese partners at PT Smelting to expand the existing smelter. This can be done on a relatively low-cost basis and would reduce the required capacity for the new smelter to 1.7 million tonnes of concentrate per annum. The cost for PT Smelting is roughly $250 million. And PT-FI would fund these costs through a bank financing, which is currently in progress. 
As you've read, we have been engaging in discussions with third-party for the balance of the requirement, whereby this party would build the new smelter under a structure similar to what we developed for the PT smelting existing smelter in the 1990s. To date, the parties have had extensive negotiations, but we have not yet reached acceptable commercial terms. In the interim, we're continuing our planning on the greenfield project in East Java. 
As we show on this chart on the right, you'll see that the long-term cost, the economics for the financing of the smelter, which we would plan to finance with debt, would be offset by a phaseout of the 5% export duty we're currently paying. So the economic impact for PT-FI is not material.
On slide -- on the next slide, Slide 16, we provide our 3-year outlook for copper volumes, gold volumes and molybdenum volumes. We're increasing our copper sales volumes in 2021 to 3.85 billion pounds from the prior estimate of just over 3.8 billion pounds. And we've increased our 2022 guidance by 100 million pounds to 4.4 billion pounds of copper, and that's reflective of incremental increases in the U.S. The rest of the sales estimates are largely unchanged. As Richard mentioned, we're continuing to assess additional incremental near-term growth opportunities while we conduct our longer-range development planning.
We provided on Slide 17 an overview of our estimated unit net cash cost for the year. You will note that we have updated our estimate to average $1.33 per pound of copper in net unit cash costs compared with the prior estimate of $1.25 per pound. A large portion of this increase is associated with higher royalties, duties and profit sharing related to the change in price assumptions from $3.50 per pound of copper to $4 per pound. We've also increased our cost estimates to reflect higher energy costs, principally oil related, which our forecast is now higher by about 25%. Our team continues to do a great job in managing costs efficiently. We have seen some increases, but they have not been significant. Our team continues to look for creative ways to maintain a low-cost position.
On Slide 18, we show the significance of cash flow generation using our volume and cost estimates. And we provided sensitivities ranging from $4 per pound copper to $5, and we hold gold flat at $1,750 per ounce and molybdenum an $11 per pound. The growth in volumes at low incremental costs results in very significant EBITDA generation. You can see here, ranging from over $12.5 billion per annum on average for 2022 and 2023 at $4 copper to $17 billion per annum at $5 copper. Operating cash flows under these price scenarios would range from nearly $9 billion to $12 billion. And these cash flows are significantly above our planned capital spending, providing substantial free cash flows as we go forward.
On Slide 19, we show our capital project forecast and we show projected capital of $2.3 billion in 2021, that includes potential spending on the Indonesian smelter, which again would be debt financed. But these -- the 2021 guidance numbers are very similar to what we had in our previous reports. Our 2022 capital of $2.2 billion on a consolidated basis is about $200 million higher than our previous forecast and that incorporates an acceleration of mining investments to bring volumes forward and provide capacity assurance for our plans. We've entered -- we are in a strong financial position and have entered a period of exceptional free cash flow generation. 
Slide 20 kind of shows you that the exceptional cash flow generation that we have in the business. You can see on the slide, where in a 6-month period of time, our cash balance has increased by over $2 billion. Our long-lived asset base, our growing production profile, strong markets provide the ability to continue to strengthen our balance sheet, provide cash returns to shareholders and build additional values in our asset base. Our financial policy that Richard talked about earlier is designed to tick all of these boxes, and we look forward to executing on these plans. 
And in closing, I'd just say, to echo what Richard said, it's an exciting time at Freeport. We've got the right assets at the right time, and we're staying focused on continuing our momentum. 
And now operator, I would like to open the call for questions."

But it suddenly sounds like there's a significant amount of cash return potential upcoming of the assumed current copper prices. But maybe on the other side of that, could you discuss how you're thinking about when the right time to sanction growth would be? And any color you can provide on sort of long-term or sustainable copper prices that you would need to see or need the base case in your assumptions for this? And then you mentioned being disciplined and selective, but as you look over the next couple of years, at what point would you start considering up pulling the trigger on growth?"

And now we've resumed those analysis with the purpose of understanding the pros and cons of each of the projects and developing an evaluation of them. That basic work of valuation we expect to continue at least through the end of this year. And by the end of the year, we hope to be able to have a clear path path forward. So it will be some time before there is any commitment to actually initiate significant capital spending. And then in the meantime, we pointed to all the volume growth that's coming about from Grasberg, the resumption of operations from COVID, et cetera. So we're going to have increasing volumes with strong prices and high cash flows, with limited amount of capital being spent because we just won't be ready, as you say, to sanction projects.
We don't have any particular targeted copper price. We've always looked at a scenario of different prices that -- of how a new project would fit into our portfolio. We want to take advantage of these resources that we have and yet have risk management by how they fit into all of our existing portfolio. So we don't look at it so much on an individual project-by-project basis but how does it fit in with our projects. Freeport really benefits from the fact that we operate all of the projects we have interest in. So that allows us to approach these on a -- from a consistent corporate strategic basis as opposed to an individual project-by-project basis. 
Certainly, at these price levels, our projects are economic. And now you know the prospects are for prices to go much higher. So I anticipate that over time, we will be spending money on capital, that's just not going to happen in the near term. And that's going to be a feature of the entire industry because even when we decide to spend, the time frame for developing a project is multiple years, minimum 6 to 8 years. So all of that's going to be, as you well know, Emily, because you write about it all the time, that's going to be very supportive of copper prices. You can't turn on the valve quickly to add new mine supply. And when you can't do that and volume and demand rises, that translates into higher prices."

So we just step back and watch political environments. We know we have to work with whatever government, wherever in the world that a country selects, but we do have strong rights to do that. 
And unlike some operations in Peru, we have positive relationships with the local community because of social investments we've made in water and wastewater projects. So our team there is just -- I mean, I can't tell you what a great job they go. A year ago, we were really worried about Peru. Our workers lived in the city of Arequipa.

In the U.S., we had cut back the mining rates significantly. We're starting to ramp those back up. We have some opportunities, still have some opportunities at Morenci that aren't baked into our forecast yet. And then we have opportunities at Chino because our plan right now is running Chino at 50%. In addition to that, as we mentioned, we have some incremental opportunities potentially at Lone Star. So I would say, in the U.S., we do have some opportunities that aren't in our near-term plans that we'll be assessing as well as some of the leach technology applications that Richard referred to earlier.

If we can prove out some of the concepts that we've identified and began working on, it could have a significant impact on our ability to take advantage of long-term stockpiles that we have out there that contain copper today that we haven't been able to extract. And so this leaching technology really could be meaningful as we look for opportunities to get some incremental low-cost incremental copper as we move forward. And so our plans are working on that this year with the goal of having, very similar to Richard's comments about the bigger scale projects, having much more clarity by the end of the year on what that looks like and what the potential value is for us.

As I said, we don't -- we just run our business, support communities, be prepared to work with whoever emerges in the political process. 
The mining industry in Peru is -- there's active mining association that's led by Peruvians, and they engage with candidates to understand and interact and communicate with them on policies affecting mining. And I'm sure they will be working with both of these candidates as we go forward. And you will notice the candidate, who earlier was being very aggressive in talking about mining, is now making comments about the importance of mining to Peru.

Some important elements of our costs are correlated to copper prices. They're correlated. I mean things like royalties, this profit-sharing plans, labor cost in general, there's correlation. Then there's other input costs that are correlated. Energy cost, which is an important element of cost and energy costs have risen in recent months. Copper prices have risen even more, thankfully, but energy costs are built into that. And then certain other costs are seeing some inflation. So far, energy costs are the ones that are outside of the profit-sharing. Royalty costs are the ones that have the biggest impact. And as time goes by and copper prices rise, we'll have to deal with inflation. But we have such strong margins, we have a great supply group team that works with our suppliers to offset costs wherever we can. We're working really aggressively to do that. 
So Timna, I think -- I mean, I know you realize this because you're right about it, but inflation is good for copper. I mean inflation is good for copper. What the world is doing today with all this spending on COVID recovery, with spending around the world that's being driven to deal with economic inequalities, that's pushing money to people who consume to create economic velocity, which creates demand for copper.

The big change there was, and as Richard alluded to, the original KL mine plan was more focused on higher copper equivalent grade, but it also had much higher pyrite and required a significant change to our processing. The new mine plan focuses on some slightly lower copper equivalent portion of the resource that has now become the reserve. And we've -- and it's part of the ore body. Essentially, we leave the mill as it is. The pyrite problem is largely diminished and almost eliminated. 
So the overall capital as far as processing, power requirements, environmental management have dropped significantly. In addition, this new portion of the new mine plan, the areas that we mine, the gold recoveries go up substantially. We -- in our initial reserves, several years ago, gold recoveries were below 50%. The new plan has gold recoveries over 60%, and we think there's upside there. So it's a much less capital-intensive, much more robust plan, a lot less environmental management costs to go with this new KL plan. 
The one thing, Richard mentioned it, it's independent, but in some ways, it does tie in. We share parts of the GBC ore flow system. KL ramps up. And in coordination with the GBC plan, we used some of the same conveyor. And then the big part was that the mill is relatively unchanged with this new plan."

And I say there's 3 kind of eras of copper demand, pre-early 2000s, it was all driven by developed countries' GDP. Copper is most correlated commodity to GDP, and it would rise and fall based on business cycles. China emerged and now for almost 2 decades has dominated new demand growth. It's all come from China when you look at it. The rest of the world has kind of been flat. The new era today, which is so exciting, is China's rate of growth, which people have been pointing to for some time, inevitably is falling, has to fall. 
COVID's kind of complicated all that up. But its absolute demand for copper volumes is so strong because this economy has grown and that's going to continue with the -- even as it pivots its economy to consumers and exports, its -- the absolute amount of copper that it grows, even though the rate of growth will drop, absolutely will not be strong. Now -- the reason I'm so excited about now is, now you've got -- it's COVID recovered in the developed world, but also all this movement around the world, you see it clearly here in the United States, to push money to a broader set of people to enhance consumption. All this move towards incoming in equality, which everybody recognize we got to do. And that's going to create new copper demand. 
And then my long-term story has always been in the undeveloped world, global growth, all the vast numbers of people around the world that are living in substandard conditions have aspirations of having better conditions, that requires more energy, more transportation, communication, more copper. So that's why I say the demand side, to me, is in a new era, and it's really positive. And the supply side, I don't know how it's going to keep up with it. I literally don't. Here, we have all of these projects at Freeport. 
The price of copper could double overnight. Some people are talking about it doubling anyway, but overnight. And we could not do new production of significance for a number of years, for a number of years. So it's going to be really interesting to see prices -- I just -- unless there's some global calamity, prices, it just seems to me, clearly have to rise substantially. Substitution has to occur. Scrap has to grow. But how to meet that demand? And that's why I'm so thrilled about where we are after all this time working to put this company together. John Tumazos referenced it. I mean, we've been through so much. But I recall, Kathleen and I developed a strategy in 2003, 2004 when I became CEO of focusing on copper.

You just look over and over again. Phelps Dodge came to us as an opportunity. It wasn't a strategic plan to do it. We had talked with them about buying us. So where we are now is we have no strategy of engaging in M&A markets. But we'll be positioned now, for the first time in a long, long time, to -- if an opportunity comes to us to take advantage of. Our strategy is straightforward: execute, invest in a disciplined way in our resources that provide growth that create value. If something comes to us, we're going to be in a position to consider it, but that's not our strategic objective. 

You mentioned start-up operations, and that's come to us all the time. But we have trouble -- it's been a big barrier to make the economics of those work because to get into it, you've got to pay the value that's been made already. When we have all of these other resources in our portfolio where there's no value being given to them in our share price. So we see -- that's been a real barrier of making even what might be, at some level, interesting projects work economically for our company. And we've had a long saying at Freeport, ""Big mines get bigger and small mines get smaller."" So that's also a tough issue."

So I just want to try and understand a little bit because when you look at the grade of this, at the point, the reserve grade is, whatever, 0.9 copper and 0.9 gram per tonne gold. So it's a little more gold than some of the others. So in this new plan, I guess my first question is, you talked about certain areas of the ore body. Is there an area that's higher grade which you start, which helps the economics? 
And my second question, it sounds like the new plan obviously saves CapEx, which is good. Technically, probably is easier, which is good. But then you talk about lower copper equivalencies, so I'm trying to figure out just how much lower that copper equivalency is? And secondary, that obviously, that depends on price assumptions, too.

You mentioned the 0.9, but it has a very low recovery, some of the ore. So what we have developed here is a more optimal plan that reduces upfront CapEx and modestly changes the total ore.

And I think the major advance was understanding where the -- not necessarily the highest grade but we're the highest value after-capital investment was in the ore body. And if not for having a debt -- our contract with the government goes up to 2041. If not for that, the material that we've deferred would also be in reserves. So what we've done in this new plan is brought forward -- there's about half of the old reserve that overlaps with the old reserve. And then there's another half where we've deferred a part of the lower-value ore and being able to substitute it with higher-value ore. This order that we're now mining would be sediment hosted, very similar to what we've milled for years in the DOZ, Deep MLZ. 
The old reserve was very much centered on this fault that had the highest grades, but had, as Richard and Kathleen mentioned, some of the bigger challenges where a new mill we had to grind it much finer. That came with additional power requirements. And then we had to manage the pyrite, which for us is to segregate it from the [ Mod-88 ] and store it separately. So by recognizing all the costs that are associated with some of the higher copper equivalent grade, that's a combination of the copper and gold value, and substitute it with looking more on a value rather than purely on copper equivalency. We came up with a much more optimal sequencing of the mine with the opportunity to go after this other material at a later date if we had the opportunity to mine beyond 2041."

FCX released our results earlier this morning, and a copy of today's press release and slides are available on our website at fcx.com. 
Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. 
Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. I'd like to refer every one to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings. 
On the call with me today are Richard Adkerson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Johnson, our Chief Operating Officer for Indonesia; Josh Olmsted, our Chief Operating Officer for the Americas; Mike Kendrick, who leads our molybdenum business; Rick Coleman, who leads our construction and growth projects; and Steve Higgins, our Chief Administrative Officer. 
I'll start by briefly summarizing our financial results, and then we'll turn the call over to Richard, who will review our outlook in the slide presentation materials that have been provided to you. As usual, after our remarks, we'll open up the call for questions. 
Today, FCX reported second quarter 2021 net income attributable to common stock of $1.08 billion or $0.73 per share. That included net charges totaling $56 million or $0.04 per share detailed on Page VII of our press release. Adjusted net income attributable to common stock totaled $1.14 billion or $0.77 per share. Our adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2021 totaled $2.7 billion. And you can find a reconciliation of our EBITDA calculations on Page 35 of our slide deck materials. 
We had a strong second quarter. Our copper sales of 929 million pounds and gold sales of 305,000 ounces were significantly above the year ago quarter, but our sales were approximately 5% lower for copper and 8% lower for gold relative to our recent estimates, primarily reflecting the timing of shipments from Indonesia. Our annual guidance is consistent with our prior estimates. Our results in the second quarter benefited from strong pricing. Our second quarter average realized copper price of $4.34 a pound was 70% higher than the year ago quarterly average. Our net unit cash cost of $1.48 per pound of copper on average in the second quarter was slightly above our estimate going into the quarter of $1.42 per pound, but that primarily related to nonrecurring charges associated with a new 4-year labor agreement at Cerro Verde. Operating cash flow generation was extremely strong, totaling $2.4 billion during the quarter. That included $0.5 billion of working capital sources. And our operating cash flow significantly exceeded our capital expenditures of $433 million during the quarter. Our consolidated debt totaled $9.7 billion at the end of June. And our consolidated cash and cash equivalents totaled $6.3 billion at the end of June. Net debt was $3.4 billion at the end of the quarter. And we achieved our targeted net debt level several months ahead of our schedule. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, and we'll be reviewing the slide materials that have been provided. Go ahead, Richard."

We are really pleased to report in what's now becoming a string of really strong operating performances for our company. And with this great positive outlook for our business, we're all really enthusiastic about it. Hoping all of you are staying healthy through this pandemic. Vaccinations are giving us an opportunity to protect ourselves and those around us, and we're working hard to encourage our people globally to take full advantage of this opportunity whenever possible. 
Our teams are working safely. We remain diligent with our protocols that have been so effective. With the recent rise in cases globally, we are refocusing, redoubling our efforts, restoring some protocols that we had loosened to keep our team and communities safe. 
Our results in the second quarter demonstrate really strong execution of our plans, really strong and favorable pricing for our products. Kathleen mentioned the shipping issue. Logistics is an issue globally. We've been able to -- we basically met or slightly exceeded our production targets. We've been able to ship everything we produced. We would have beat our sales target. We also, common in the mining industry, had some one-off type issues affecting production. Without those and with shipping, we would have had a real strong beat on our previous guide. 
Really important, our Grasberg underground ramp-up is proceeding on schedule. This is a remarkable and, I would say, a historic success for both our company and even the mining industry. Our team in Indonesia is doing remarkable and outstanding work. And this is building value for our shareholders and long-term, sustainable, low-cost values for the future. 
Production. We're making money in the Americas. Copper prices -- production in the U.S. is increasing. Our Lone Star project in Eastern Arizona is really exciting. We have a series of ongoing value-enhancing opportunities in the U.S. in front of us. And I'm personally really encouraged about future growth in the U.S. 
The South America teams in Peru and Chile are navigating the pandemic effectively. We're restoring production that we curtailed a year ago. We have achieved these outstanding financial results made possible by the hard work and investments we've been making for many years. We are now generating significant cash flows, which will be sustainable for years in the future. This quarter alone, we had $2 billion of cash flow after capital spending. That's just remarkable considering where we were just a year ago. 
Kathleen mentioned, it's notable that we reached our debt target several months earlier than our forecast earlier this year. We ended the quarter with $3.4 billion of net debt, and that's within the targeted range we set at $3 billion to $4 billion. We've reduced our debt by like 60% over the past year. We're now positioned in accordance with the financial policy that our Board adopted earlier this year and that we disclosed to the market to shift our capital allocation priorities by increasing cash returns to shareholders as we make disciplined investments for future growth of our business. This policy will allow us to maintain a strong balance sheet with high-grade credit metrics while providing cash for increasing shareholder returns and investing in our company's long-term future. 
Slide 4 talks about how we're devoting significant attention and resources to sustainability initiatives. And this has always been key to our company and a position of our company. We are committed to the sustainability principles of ICMM. We're also moving to certify all of our operations with the Copper Mark, a relatively new industry framework developed by the International Copper Association to ensure responsible production consistent with UN Sustainability Development goals. To date, we lead the industry with 6 of our operations now certified. In the second quarter, we submitted 5 additional operating sites for this initiative, and we've committed to validate all of our sites to this robust framework. 
Responsible production is critical in building and maintaining trust, which we've earned over the years through long-standing partnerships with communities as we deliver a product, copper, valued by society, produced in safe, environmentally sound, innovative manner. 
Slide 5 talks about electrification, which is key to copper. Majority of copper goes into generating and transmitting electricity, and copper is critical in every aspect of achieving low carbon goals for the global economy. This ranges from electric vehicles and supporting infrastructure to clean energy from wind and solar. Copper is just simply essential to a green economy. This transition is now just beginning to unfold. It will add significantly to future demand for copper. And as the global leading copper producer, Freeport is solidly positioned to benefit from this higher future demand. 
In addition, now companies around the world are responding to COVID with aggressive physical and monetary policies. This alone is creating important near-term copper demand beyond China. And China's consumption remains strong. There are some mixed economic signals. But even with that, demand for copper in China is strong. And now as higher consumption is being generated from economic recovery in developed countries around the world, that's even in the face of an important sector of copper demand, automobiles, which is being constrained by this chip problem. So this increasingly important incremental demand outside China, the long-term growth from global -- from growth in emerging markets just is very positive for our outlook. 
Copper demand is also expanding from technology advances and communications. 
[Audio Gap] 
This recent pullback in copper pricing that we've seen has not altered in any way our conviction, but the favorable long-term outlook for copper. This is a decision we made years ago, which underscores our strategy in Freeport to focus on copper because of its favorable fundamentals, the nature of our assets and our team. There are always actions that influence and short-term pricing at any point in time. So beyond that, indisputable facts support a positive fundamental outlook for copper. Demand growth is inevitable, maintaining supply or growing supply is challenged. Our prices will be required to support major new investments in copper. Rising demand, scarcity of supplies point to large impending structural deficit, supporting much higher future copper prices. 
Our company has high-quality assets, industry-leading experience, highly motivated team will allow us to benefit from these fundamentals. Portfolio of assets in the copper business is rare, if not unique, in our industry. It would be difficult, if not impossible to replicate these assets. With strong growing production, embedded brownfield, low-risk growth from our large portfolio of undeveloped resources, our assets are extremely valuable in today's world and will become more valuable as these market develops -- market that emerge in the future. 
Slide 7 highlights our growing margins and cash flows. We've had meaningful volume growth in recent quarters that you've all seen. This growth will continue. For the year 2021, copper volumes are projected to increase 20%, gold volume 55% over 2020. Then looking forward to 2022, we'll see a further growth of 15% to 20% over 2021 levels. The capital and execution risk to achieve these higher volumes are largely behind us. Our volumes will -- with low incremental costs, we yield expanding margins at prices ranging from $4 to $5 per pound for copper. We've generated annual EBITDA for '22 and '23 of $12 billion to $17 billion of copper with capital expenditures in the range of $2.5 billion a year. 
Looking back, there was always an overhang for report related to execution risk with this underground development, political risk in Indonesia, debt levels. You look back over the past 3 years, we have met and mitigated all of these major risks that were overhanging our company, and it's been a really exciting and gratifying time for our company. 
Slide 8 highlights the great progress we're making with the Grasberg underground ramp-up. I just met with Mark Johnson and his team in Indonesia and really congratulated them on the fabulous work they're doing even in the face of COVID. In the second quarter, we achieved just under 80% of our target annualized run rate for metal sales. We're on track to reach full rates of metal production by the end of the year. And our team in Indonesia has just done a fabulous job in the face of dealing with pandemic and a challenging physical environment. We executed well-designed operating protocols. We're dealing with this new upturn in cases in Indonesia in recent weeks. We're helping to support the government and our local community. We've implemented travel, other restrictions to mitigate the spread. We're encouraged by the increasing availability of vaccines at our job site and generally in Indonesia. A number of our workers -- a significant number have already received vaccines -- have received vaccines. We have a goal providing vaccines to all of our workforce in the second half of the year. And we're supporting nearby communities in their efforts to respond to COVID. We have a real strong support from the government of Indonesia, a real positive partnership with PT-FI state home shareholders on that shareholder mine. I think we're all working together in our mine. 
I've been working in pop for 30 years -- over 30 years. And I'm personally proud and gratified by our team's accomplishments since we began investing in the underground over 20 years ago, transition from the open pit that began 18 months ago and dealing with COVID, it's just remarkable what we've been able to do. Planning and investing in this transition began in the 1990. Now experiencing this success is special for all of us at Freeport. We now look forward to continuing long-term success at Grasberg by building value on this world-class historic mining district with low-cost, high-volume and sustainable production. 
Slide 9 shows the multiple options for brownfield low-risk growth across our global portfolio. Increasingly encouraged by the opportunities in the U.S. where we have favorable community support across the board with where we operate, favorable tax situation and a long history of working in a responsible way. We are expanding our mine production at Lone Star, Bagdad, other sites. And we have exciting new opportunities from technology evolving leach recovery from our historical operations. 
The Lone Star mine, our newest operation, is situated adjacent to our long-standing operations in Southeast Arizona. There, we have strong community support, and this new mine is performing above design capacity. We're evaluating expansions of Lone Star's oxide ores. We're actually making a lot of money in what normally would be stripping operations. We're conducting long-range planning for the development of a potentially world-class sulfide resource that lies beneath this oxide cover in our historical mining area. We have an opportunity and a strong likelihood of moving forward with constructing a new concentrating to double production in our back-end mine in Northwest Arizona. We expect to commence this project next year. 
Emerging leaching technology, which I am pumped about, provides substantial opportunities for added growth across our portfolio of global resources. We are evaluating an attractive expansion operation -- expansion opportunity at our El Abra mine in Chile where we're partners with CODELCO. This project would require significant capital investment and long lead time, but it's attractive large major future expansion and operator is likely, but not now. We are deferring investment decision on this project until we have more clarity about the mining policy issues currently under consideration by the government in Chile. 
We're also evaluating development of an underground deposit of Kucing Liar in the Grasberg district operated by PT-FI. This copper gold resource involves a large block cave mine using the substantial infrastructure that we already have in place. We have expertise, long track record. Mark and his team has come up with revised development plans that make the project less capital-intensive. The economic is better. It's a large operation. It would be a block cave with about 90,000 tonnes per day. So that's a real big 6 billion tonnes of copper resource, 6 million ounces of gold, and it fits right in with our plans. 
We have additional opportunities to invest in projects to support our copper -- our carbon reduction, other sustainability goals, including investing to develop been clean renewable energy for our operations and communities. We're advancing plans for an exciting ESG-type project to recover metals from the recycle of electronic devices at our Atlantic Copper processing facilities in Spain. 
Bottom line, we're going to be disciplined in devoting capital to new investments. We're going to be focused on value-added projects supported by long life reserves. We have a long track record of success in developing projects. We have established license and operate and positive relationship and support from communities where we have the opportunities to invest. 
Slide 10 goes back to Lone Star, shows we're meeting, exceeding expectation. Regional plan was 75,000 tonnes a day, 200 million pounds of copper. We now exceeded this, reaching the targeted rate 95,000 tonnes a day. On a sustained basis, we have takeouts capacity to do this to yield 285 million pounds of copper. Looking at a further increment that would involve a relatively small investment in bank houses, mining equipment to produce 300-or-more pounds of copper, 50% more our than original design. 
The project view though is longer term. We have a major opportunity for Lone Star become a cornerstone asset for our company. Potential resource is 10x more than our current reserve. As we mine these oxide ores, we're gaining access to this underlying potentially massive sulfide resource. Long term, we [indiscernible] asset for our company. 
Slide 11 talks about this reference I made earlier through leaching technology, gaining additional copper from material that's already mined. We're progressing this. We have lots of opportunities to apply. It's an exciting potentially high-value opportunity with low incremental cost and low carbon footprint. We're engaged in multiple studies using a range of different technologies internally and externally to capture this value from existing stockpiles. Our estimate now is for 38 billion pounds of copper in these stockpiles. This is material that's already been in mined. And if we can recover just 10% to 20% of this material, it would be like having a major new mine with variable capital and operating costs. A significant portion of this is in our flagship Morenci mine, the largest mine in North America, where we are now applying artificial intelligence, data analytics to help us understand what's going on with these leasing performance opportunities. Our team historically was an instrumental in unlocking substantial values years ago with within new SXEW technology. We are now focused on taking this leaching technology to the next level by using modern approaches to it. We've established a cross-functional team of technical experts, metallurgists, mine planners, data scientists, geologists, business analysts all working together to take full advantage of this really exciting opportunity. 
Slide 12. We have strong operating franchises in the U.S., South America and Indonesia, gained the trust and respect of our partners, our customers, suppliers, financial markets, and more importantly, the workers, communities and host governments where we operate. We have significant large-scale project development, operating expertise. Team Freeport has all the capabilities to undertake new projects in a responsible, efficient manner. 
I want to close on Slide 13 by recognizing the people of Freeport. all around the world, their commitment, dedication, we see a positive outlook, cooperative spirit is just gratifying. Our team is passionate about the role we're going to play in achieving a better and more sustainable future for everyone. Freeport has the capabilities and drive to continue to meet exceed our own high level of expectations and those of our stakeholders. We're living in a great -- a time of great challenge and exceptional opportunity for our business. And our team, we're meeting the challenges, embracing the opportunities. Our future is bright. We at Freeport are charging ahead responsibly, reliably and relentlessly. 
Kathleen, I'll turn the call back over to you to talk about our financial results."
273607,1672837974,2349441,"Freeport-McMoRan Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2021",2021-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Freeport-McMoRan Inc.","Executives","Okay. Great.

Richard talked about the great progress we're making a",1544,"Okay. Great. Thank you, Richard, and I'm going to start on Slide 15 and just make some brief comments on our operating matters and go through our financials, and then we'll open it up for questions. 
Richard talked about the great progress we're making at Lone Star. We're very focused now on sustaining the rates to keep our tankhouse full there, which has a capacity of 285 million pounds per year of copper and looking at potential increments beyond that with relatively small and attractive investments. Richard also mentioned our plans at Bagdad, we're advancing studies to double the capacity there and hope to be in a position to qualify a project and commence a project there next year. 
At Morenci, we've started to increase our mining rates, which had been curtailed in the last 12 months. We averaged about 725,000 tonnes per day of mine material in the second quarter and are ramping up to reach 800,000 tonnes per day by the end of this year, going to 900,000 tonnes a day in 2023. We've also advanced from 2022 the restart of some of Morenci milling capacity. That was also idled last year to reduce cost. Now with the improvement in copper prices, these actions result in more profitable production. 
We're also very encouraged by the opportunity to add low-cost production at Morenci through our leach technology initiatives. In South America, the teams are continuing to work to restore production to prepandemic levels. We continue to target a full restoration at Cerro Verde in 2022. And we've been running at about 95% of the mill capacity in recent months. You've seen in our press release that the Cerro Verde team reached a new 4-year labor agreement with a significant percentage the workforce during the second quarter. That was in advance of our labor agreement exploration, which is coming up at the end of August of this year. We're very pleased with the win-win outcome of the agreement and now working to conclude a mutually satisfactory agreement with the balance of employees. 
At El Abra in Chile, we're well on our way to restoring production levels that were curtailed last year. We're increasing the stacking rate of material on the leach pads and moving forward to add a new leach pad to accommodate the higher rates. This is capital that was always part of our plan, but was deferred last year as part of the capital conservation plans that we rolled out in April of last year. This allows El Abra to increase production on a sustained basis to about 200 million to 250 million pounds per annum for the next several years as we assess opportunities for a major expansion there. 
As Richard talked about at Grasberg, we're continuing to deliver results and generating strong cash flows. As you recall, we started the second quarter with significantly more concentrate inventory than we normally carry. With the strong production volumes and some maintenance downtime at our port, weather issues at quarter end, sales were below our earlier estimates in the quarter. This is really a short-term timing issue, and we expect to be able to work inventory levels down in the second half of this year. 
We successfully commissioned at Grasberg the second crusher at our Grasberg Block Cave during the quarter, and that will provide sufficient capacity for a ramp-up to 130,000 tonnes per day. You've seen the performance and the records achieved from the Grasberg Block Cave during the quarter. We're also moving to advance the installation of our third SAG mill there. That's been part of our plan to support the higher rates of throughput. We've also identified an opportunity to invest in a new mill circuit that will allow us to increase copper and gold production in Indonesia through the achievement of higher mill recoveries when the initial phases of this project and the economics are highly attractive. Our global team also remains focused on cost management and efficiency projects to extend equipment lives, improve energy efficiency and maintenance practices with the use of technology. We have experienced some degree of cost increases this year, principally energy price increases and, to a lesser extent, the impact on consumables of steel price increases, increased freight costs and sulfuric acid cost. We've had -- partially offsetting these items, we've had the benefits of a weaker exchange rate in South America versus the U.S. dollar. The increases in costs have been offset by significant increase in molybdenum prices in recent months, and those have provided a very nice hedge to certain of these cost inflation items. 
We talked on slide, you've seen in the release our plans for -- to meet our commitments in Indonesia for the new smelter. On Slide 16, we provide an update on our plans to meet the commitment that we agreed to with the Indonesian government in 2018 to construct 2 million tonnes per year of in-country processing facility of copper concentrate. We have been advancing the discussions with our Japanese partners to expand the existing smelter at PT Smelting. That would fulfill a portion of the obligation. And there are several financial and operating benefits of expanding this facility, which has been expanded very efficiently in the past. After considering various alternatives for the balance of the commitment, we've concluded that the best long-term option is to continue with our plans to construct a new greenfield smelter in East Java near the existing facilities at PT Smelting. 
We recently entered into an EPC contract with Chiyoda to construct a 1.7 million tonne facility there. And we're now focused on completing the project as efficiently and as timely as possible. We show in the graph on Slide 16, on the right, the estimated timing of expenditures over roughly a 3-year period. FCX is responsible for 49% of these expenditures. We recently completed a new $1 billion bank credit facility for PT-FI to advance these projects and are planning additional debt financing, which can be attained at attractive rates to fund these activities. As indicated, the long-term cost of the financing expected for the smelter would be offset by a phaseout of the 5% export duty. And we show a graph on the bottom of Slide 16 which shows you that the economic impact is not material as the cost of the smelter would be essentially offset in lower duties, which we're currently paying. 
Slide 17 provides a 3-year outlook for volumes. These are consistent with our previous guidance. We're continuing to pursue additional incremental near-term growth opportunities and conducting our longer-range development planning. 
Moving to Slide 18, we show the significance of cash flow generation using these volumes and cost estimates. And the price is ranging from $4 to $5 copper and holding gold and molybdenum flat at $1,800 per ounce of gold and $16 per pound of molybdenum. What you see here on these graphs, we would generate EBITDA in the range of over $12.5 billion per annum for '22 and '23 on average at $4 copper to $17 billion per annum at $5 copper. And at our operating cash flows, net of taxes and interest would be $9 billion to $12 billion using these price assumptions. As demonstrated in the second quarter, we're generating very significant free cash flow, and this trend is expected to continue with cash flow significantly above our capital spending. 
On Slide 19, we include our projected capital of $2.2 billion this year and $2.5 billion in 2022. As you'll note, we shifted about $100 million in expenditures from 2021 to 2022, which was timing related. And we've advanced some capital from future years into 2022 to reflect the timing of additional leach pad construction at Lone Star and the addition of some highly attractive growth spending in Indonesia related to mill recoveries. 
We've entered a period of outstanding free cash flow generation, that growing volumes, strong markets and low capital requirements. You'll see on Slide 20, and this is backward looking, but over the last 12 months, we've reduced our net debt by $5 billion, and that included $2 billion in the second quarter alone. You'll see our credit metrics are strong and less than 0.5x EBITDA on a trailing 12-month basis. And we're projecting our credit metrics to continue to be strong and improving. As Richard mentioned, we achieved our targeted net debt level several months ahead of our schedule with our long-lived asset base and growing production profile and strong markets. We'll have the ability to continue to strengthen our balance sheet, provide increasing cash returns to shareholders and build additional values in our asset base. 
The slide on 21 just reiterates our financial policy. We have performance-based payout policy, which was established by our Board earlier this year, providing up to 50% of free cash flow, would be used for shareholder returns with the balance available for growth and further balance sheet improvements. And with the recent achievement of our net debt target, we expect our Board will consider additional payouts to shareholders with our 2021 results. We're looking forward to reporting on our continued progress and continuing to build additional values as we go forward. 
And now operator, we'd like to open the call up for questions."

There's a series of efforts by different parties to develop different technologies. We have our own R&D work going on, and we're looking across the board at how this might apply to us. I think we are especially situated to take advantage of it because we have these large number and size of past leaching operations, some of which are now totally inactive that we can look to apply these to. So we have a special opportunity in industry. Others have some, but we have a special opportunity to do -- to look at this in 2 ways. One of it is to use the leaching technology. And by the way, we're supplementing that with this artificial intelligence, data analytics opportunity to measure the impact of all this, but to apply this to an active and existing leaching leach pads that we have a large abundance for. So that's one thing. And then aspirationally, it might provide a way to recover material from mining operations that would otherwise have to be recovered through mill investments. And it could be, and this is looking ahead, an opportunity to minimize capital by recovering low-grade sulfide deposits that would otherwise have to be mined and milled. So it's early stages. We don't have complete answers. I just want to share with you how exciting it is. It's an opportunity for us, opportunities other the industry.

Yes, just as Richard and Kathleen have talked to, it's really exciting with respect to the opportunity there. The thing that I think for us that's unlocking it even more than just the various technologies that are out there that we're studying and researching and running different pilot tests on is the combination of that with the data analytics that Richard touched on. The data analytics that -- and the processes that we learned over the last several years in our application of that technology on the milling side has now opened our eyes to opportunities on the leaching side. And that in combination with the various technologies is really exciting for us because it's allowing us to look at things in a way that we haven't ever looked at previously. And we've started to see some of the the benefits of that at Morenci as we've done some of this pilot work, and that's what's really getting us excited about what the potential is going forward. The other thing that I would note is, as Richard said, it's not a, what I would call, a fundamental game-changer or a step-change for the industry, and it happens over time. But it's really low incremental cost, low carbon footprint and an incremental adder as we go forward. But it's really exciting. There's lots of energy. If I think about the similar things that we saw with our agile efforts earlier, we're seeing similar things on the leaching side as we engage with various levels of the organization. The employee engagement, the excitement and the passion and the ideas that they're bringing to the table in combination with the models that we're generating is really going to, I think, untap -- or tap into, I should say, these opportunities and bring value forward for us."

I mean we do a great job right now with our conservation, reuse of water and -- but it's going to be an ongoing management deal. All of that's built into our current cost structure, and we don't anticipate major changes in that looking forward."

FCX released results earlier this morning, and a copy of today's press release and slides are available on our website at fcx.com.
Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.
Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. I'd like to refer every one to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings.
On the call with me today are Richard Adkerson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Johnson, our Chief Operating Officer for Indonesia; Josh Olmsted, our Chief Operating Officer for the Americas; Mike Kendrick, who leads our molybdenum business; Rick Coleman, who leads our construction and growth projects; and Steve Higgins, our Chief Administrative Officer.
I'll start by briefly summarizing our financial results, and then we'll turn the call over to Richard, who will review our outlook in the slide presentation materials that have been provided to you. As usual, after our remarks, we'll open up the call for questions.
Today, FCX reported second quarter 2021 net income attributable to common stock of $1.08 billion or $0.73 per share. That included net charges totaling $56 million or $0.04 per share detailed on Page VII of our press release. Adjusted net income attributable to common stock totaled $1.14 billion or $0.77 per share. Our adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2021 totaled $2.7 billion. And you can find a reconciliation of our EBITDA calculations on Page 35 of our slide deck materials.
We had a strong second quarter. Our copper sales of 929 million pounds and gold sales of 305,000 ounces were significantly above the year ago quarter, but our sales were approximately 5% lower for copper and 8% lower for gold relative to our recent estimates, primarily reflecting the timing of shipments from Indonesia.
Our annual guidance is consistent with our prior estimates. Our results in the second quarter benefited from strong pricing. Our second quarter average realized copper price of $4.34 a pound was 70% higher than the year ago quarterly average. Our net unit cash cost of $1.48 per pound of copper on average in the second quarter was slightly above our estimate going into the quarter of $1.42 per pound, but that primarily related to nonrecurring charges associated with a new 4-year labor agreement at Cerro Verde.
Operating cash flow generation was extremely strong, totaling $2.4 billion during the quarter. That included $0.5 billion of working capital sources. And our operating cash flow significantly exceeded our capital expenditures of $433 million during the quarter. Our consolidated debt totaled $9.7 billion at the end of June. And our consolidated cash and cash equivalents totaled $6.3 billion at the end of June. Net debt was $3.4 billion at the end of the quarter, and we achieved our targeted net debt level several months ahead of our schedule.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, and we'll be reviewing the slide materials that have been provided. Go ahead, Richard."

We are really pleased to reporting what's now becoming a string of really strong operating performances for our company.

We are really pleased to reporting what's now becoming a string of really strong operating performances for our company. And with this great positive outlook for our business, we're all really enthusiastic about it. Hoping all of you are staying healthy through this pandemic. Vaccinations are giving us an opportunity to protect ourselves and those around us, and we're working hard to encourage our people globally to take full advantage of this opportunity whenever possible.
Our teams are working safely. We remain diligent with our COVID protocols that have been so effective. With the recent rise in cases globally, we are refocusing, redoubling our efforts, restoring some protocols that we had loosened to keep our team and communities safe.
Our results in the second quarter demonstrate really strong execution of our plans, really strong and favorable pricing for our products. Kathleen mentioned the shipping issue. Logistics is an issue globally. We've been able to -- we basically met or slightly exceeded our production targets. We've been able to ship everything we produced. We would have beat our sales target. We also, common in the mining industry, had some one-off type issues affecting production. Without those and with shipping, we would have had a real strong beat on our previous guide.
Really important, our Grasberg underground ramp-up is proceeding on schedule. This is a remarkable and, I would say, a historic success for both our company and even the mining industry. Our team in Indonesia is doing remarkable and outstanding work. And this is building value for our shareholders and long-term, sustainable, low-cost values for the future.
Production. We're making money in the Americas. Copper prices -- production in the U.S. is increasing. Our Lone Star project in Eastern Arizona is really exciting. We have a series of ongoing value-enhancing opportunities in the U.S. in front of us. And I'm personally really encouraged about future growth in the U.S.
The South America teams in Peru and Chile are navigating the pandemic effectively. We're restoring production that we have curtailed a year ago. We have achieved these outstanding financial results made possible by the hard work and investments we've been making for many years. We are now generating significant cash flows, which will be sustainable for years in the future. This quarter alone, we had $2 billion of cash flow after capital spending. That's just remarkable considering where we were just a year ago.
Kathleen mentioned, and it's notable that we reached our debt target several months earlier than our forecast earlier this year. We ended the quarter with $3.4 billion of net debt, and that's within the targeted range we set at $3 billion to $4 billion. We've reduced our debt by like 60% over the past year.
We're now positioned in accordance with the financial policy that our Board adopted earlier this year and that we disclosed to the market to shift our capital allocation priorities by increasing cash returns to shareholders as we make disciplined investments for future growth of our business. This policy will allow us to maintain a strong balance sheet with high-grade credit metrics while providing cash for increasing shareholder returns and investing in our company's long-term future.
Slide 4 talks about how we're devoting significant attention and resources to sustainability initiatives. And this has always been key to our company and a position of our company. We are committed to the sustainability principles of ICMM. We're also moving to certify all of our operations with The Copper Mark, a relatively new industry framework developed by the International Copper Association to ensure responsible production consistent with UN sustainability development goals. To date, we lead the industry with 6 of our operations now certified. In the second quarter, we submitted 5 additional operating sites for this initiative, and we've committed to validate all of our sites to this robust framework.
Responsible production is critical in building and maintaining trust, which we've earned over the years through long-standing partnerships with communities as we deliver a product, copper, valued by society, produced in safe, environmentally sound, innovative manner.
Slide 5 talks about electrification, which is key to copper. Majority of copper goes into generating and transmitting electricity, and copper is critical in every aspect of achieving low carbon goals for the global economy. This ranges from electric vehicles and supporting infrastructure to clean energy from wind and solar. Copper is just simply essential to a green economy. This transition is now just beginning to unfold. It will add significantly to future demand for copper. And as the global leading copper producer, Freeport is solidly positioned to benefit from this higher future demand.
In addition, now companies around the world are responding to COVID with aggressive physical and monetary policies. This alone is creating important near-term copper demand beyond China. And China's consumption remains strong. There are some mixed economic signals. But even with that, demand for copper in China is strong. And now as higher consumption is being generated from economic recovery in developed countries around the world, and that's even in the face of an important sector of copper demand, automobiles, which is being constrained by this chip problem. So this increasingly important incremental demand outside China, the long-term growth from global -- from growth in emerging markets just is very positive for our outlook.
Copper demand is also expanding from technology advances in communications, artificial intelligence applications, expanding connectivity through global infrastructure initiatives and efforts to improve health through using copper to fight viruses and other infections. Slide 6 talks about this growing demand, the global challenges in maintaining much less growing supply makes the outlook for copper, compelling. I would say compelling is an understated word. Really, really positive and enthusiastic about it.
This recent pullback in copper pricing that we've seen has not altered in any way our conviction, but the favorable long-term outlook for copper. This is a decision we made years ago, which underscores our strategy at Freeport to focus on copper because of its favorable fundamentals, the nature of our assets and our team.
There are always actions that influence sentiment  in short-term pricing at any point in time. So beyond that, indisputable facts support a positive fundamental outlook for copper. Demand growth is inevitable. Maintaining supply or growing supply is challenged. Our prices will be required to support major new investments in copper. Rising demand, scarcity of supplies point to large impending structural deficit, supporting much higher future copper prices. Our company has high-quality assets, industry-leading experience, highly motivated team will allow us to benefit from these fundamentals.
Portfolio of assets in the copper business is rare, if not unique, in our industry. It would be difficult, if not impossible to replicate these assets. With strong growing production, embedded brownfield, low-risk growth from our large portfolio of undeveloped resources, our assets are extremely valuable in today's world and will become more valuable as these market develops -- market deficits emerge in the future.
Slide 7 highlights our growing margins and cash flows. We've had meaningful volume growth in recent quarters that you've all seen. This growth will continue. For the year 2021, copper value -- copper volumes are projected to increase 20%; gold volume, 55% over 2020. Then looking forward to 2022, we'll see a further growth of 15% to 20% over 2021 levels.
The capital and execution risk to achieve these higher volumes are largely behind us. Our volumes will -- with low incremental costs, we yield expanding margins at prices ranging from $4 to $5 per pound for copper. We've generated annual EBITDA for '22 and '23 of $12 billion to $17 billion of copper with capital expenditures in the range of $2.5 billion a year.
Looking back, there was always an overhang for report related to execution risk with this underground development, political risk in Indonesia, debt levels. If you look back over the past 3 years, we have met and mitigated all of these major risks that were overhanging our company, and it's been a really exciting and gratifying time for our company.
Slide 8 highlights the great progress we're making with the Grasberg underground ramp-up. I just met with Mark Johnson and his team in Indonesia and really congratulating them on the fabulous work they're doing even in the face of COVID. In the second quarter, we achieved just under 80% of our target annualized run rate for metal sales. We're on track to reach full rates of metal production by the end of the year. And our team in Indonesia has just done a fabulous job in the face of dealing with pandemic and a challenging physical environment.
We executed well-designed operating protocols. We're dealing with this new upturn in cases in Indonesia in recent weeks. We're helping to support the government and our local community. We've implemented travel, other restrictions to mitigate the spread. We're encouraged by the increasing availability of vaccines at our job site and generally in Indonesia. A number of our workers -- a significant number have already received vaccines -- have received vaccines. We have a goal of providing vaccines to all of our workforce in the second half of the year, and we're supporting nearby communities in their efforts to respond to COVID. We have a real strong support from the government of Indonesia, a real positive partnership with PT-FI state home shareholders on that shareholder mine and they were all working together [ and are aligned ].
I've been working in [ Freeport ] for 30 years -- over 30 years. And I'm personally proud and gratified by our team's accomplishments since we began investing in the underground over 20 years ago, transition from the open pit that began 18 months ago and dealing with COVID, it's just remarkable what we've been able to do. Planning and investing in this transition began in the 1990s. Now experiencing this success is special for all of us at Freeport. We now look forward to continuing long-term success at Grasberg by building value to this world-class historic mining district with low-cost, high-volume and sustainable production.
Slide 9 shows the multiple options for brownfield low-risk growth across our global portfolio. Increasingly encouraged by the opportunities in the U.S. where we have favorable community support across the board with where we operate, favorable tax situation and a long history of working in a responsible way. We are expanding our mine production at Lone Star, Bagdad, other sites. And we have exciting new opportunities from technology evolving leach recovery from our historical operations.
The Lone Star mine, our newest operation situated adjacent to our long-standing operations in Southeast Arizona. There, we have strong community support, and this new mine is performing above design capacity. We're evaluating expansions of Lone Star's oxide ores. We're actually making a lot of money in what normally would be stripping operations. We're conducting long-range planning for the development of a potentially world-class sulfide resource that lies beneath this oxide cover in our historical mining area. We have an opportunity and a strong likelihood of moving forward with constructing a new concentrator to double production in our Bagdad mine in Northwest Arizona. We expect to commence this project next year.
Emerging leaching technology, which I am pumped about, provides substantial opportunities for added growth across our portfolio of global resources. We are evaluating an attractive expansion operation -- expansion opportunity at our El Abra mine in Chile where we're partners with CODELCO. This project would require significant capital investment and long lead time, but it's attractive and large. Major future expansion in El Abra is likely, but not now. We are deferring investment decision on this project until we have more clarity about the mining policy issues currently under consideration by the government in Chile.
We're also evaluating development of an underground deposit of Kucing Liar in the Grasberg district operated by PT-FI. This copper gold resource involves a large block cave mine using the substantial infrastructure that we already have in place. We have expertise, long track record. Mark Johnson and his team has come up with revised development plans that make the project less capital-intensive. The economic is better. It's a large operation. It would be a block cave with about 90,000 tonnes per day. So that's a real big, 6 billion tonnes of copper resource, 6 million ounces of gold, and it fits right in with our plans.
We have additional opportunities to invest in projects to support our copper -- our carbon reduction, our sustainability goals, including investing to develop clean renewable energy for our operations and communities. We're advancing plans for an exciting ESG-type project to recover metals from the recycle of electronic devices at our Atlantic Copper processing facilities in Spain.
Bottom line, we're going to be disciplined in devoting capital to new investments. We're going to be focused on value-added projects supported by long life reserves. We have a long track record of success in developing projects. We have established license to operate and positive relationship and support from communities where we have the opportunities to invest.
Slide 10 goes back to Lone Star, shows we're meeting, exceeding expectation. Original plan was 75,000 tonnes a day, 200 million pounds of copper. We now exceeded this, reaching the targeted rate of 95,000 tonnes a day. On a sustained basis, we have takeouts capacity to do this to yield 285 million pounds of copper. Looking at a further increment that would involve a relatively small investment in tank houses, mining equipment to produce 300-or-more pounds of copper, 50% more our than original design.
The project view though is longer term. We have a major opportunity for Lone Star to become a cornerstone asset for our company. Potential resource is 10x more than our current reserve. As we mine these oxide ores, we're gaining access to this underlying potentially massive sulfide resource. Long-term [ cornerstone ] asset for our company.
Slide 11 talks about this reference I made earlier through reaching technology, gaining additional copper from material that's already mined. We're progressing this. We have lots of opportunities to apply. It's an exciting potentially high-value opportunity with low incremental cost and low carbon footprint. We're engaged in multiple studies using a range of different technologies internally and externally to capture this value from existing stockpiles.
Our estimate now is for 38 billion pounds of copper in these stockpiles. This is material that's already been mined. And if we can recover just 10% to 20% of this material, it would be like having a major new mine with variable capital and operating costs. A significant portion of this is in our flagship Morenci mine, the largest mine in North America, where we are now applying artificial intelligence, data analytics to help us understand what's going on with these leaching performance opportunities.
Our team historically was an instrumental in unlocking substantial values years ago with the new SXEW technology. We are now focused on taking this leaching technology to the next level by using modern approaches to it. We've established a cross-functional team of technical experts, metallurgists, mine planners, data scientists, geologists, business analysts all working together to take full advantage of this really exciting opportunity.
Slide 12. We have strong operating franchises in the U.S., South America and Indonesia, gained the trust and respect of our partners, our customers, suppliers, financial markets, and more importantly, the workers, communities and host governments where we operate. We have significant large-scale project development, operating expertise. Team Freeport has all the capabilities to undertake new projects in a responsible, efficient manner.
I want to close on Slide 13 by recognizing the people of Freeport. All around the world, their commitment, dedication, resilience, positive outlook, cooperative spirit is just gratifying. Our team is passionate about the role we're going to play in achieving a better and more sustainable future for everyone. Team Freeport has the capabilities and drive to continue to meet, exceed our own high level of expectations and those of our stakeholders. We're living in a great -- a time of great challenge and exceptional opportunity for our business. At our team, we're meeting the challenges, embracing the opportunities. Our future is bright. We at Freeport are charging ahead responsibly, reliably and relentlessly.
Kathleen, I'll turn the call back over to you to talk about our financial results."
273607,1672837974,2349667,"Freeport-McMoRan Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2021",2021-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Freeport-McMoRan Inc.","Executives","Okay. Great. Thank you, Richard, and I'm going to start on Slide 15 and just make some brief comments on our operating matters and go through our financials, and then we'll open it up for questions.Richard talked about the great progress we're making at",1546,"Okay. Great. Thank you, Richard, and I'm going to start on Slide 15 and just make some brief comments on our operating matters and go through our financials, and then we'll open it up for questions.
Richard talked about the great progress we're making at Lone Star. We're very focused now on sustaining the rates to keep our tankhouse full there, which has a capacity of 285 million pounds per year of copper and looking at potential increments beyond that with relatively small and attractive investments. Richard also mentioned our plans at Bagdad. We're advancing studies to double the capacity there and hope to be in a position to qualify a project and commence a project there next year.
At Morenci, we've started to increase our mining rates, which had been curtailed in the last 12 months. We averaged about 725,000 tonnes per day of mining material in the second quarter and are ramping up to reach 800,000 tonnes per day by the end of this year, going to 900,000 tonnes a day in 2023. We've also advanced from 2022 the restart of some of Morenci milling capacity. That was also idled last year to reduce cost. Now with the improvement in copper prices, these actions result in more profitable production. We're also very encouraged by the opportunity to add low-cost production at Morenci through our leach technology initiatives.
In South America, the teams are continuing to work to restore production to prepandemic levels. We continue to target a full restoration at Cerro Verde in 2022. And we've been running at about 95% of the mill capacity in recent months. You've seen in our press release that the Cerro Verde team reached a new 4-year labor agreement with a significant percentage of the workforce during the second quarter. That was in advance of our labor agreement exploration, which is coming up at the end of August of this year. We're very pleased with the win-win outcome of the agreement and now working to conclude a mutually satisfactory agreement with the balance of employees.
At El Abra in Chile, we're well on our way to restoring production levels that were curtailed last year. We're increasing the stacking rate of material on the leach pads and moving forward to add a new leach pad to accommodate the higher rates. This is capital that was always part of our plan, but was deferred last year as part of the capital conservation plans that we rolled out in April of last year. This allows El Abra to increase production on a sustained basis to about 200 million to 250 million pounds per annum for the next several years as we assess opportunities for a major expansion there.
As Richard talked about at Grasberg, we're continuing to deliver results and generating strong cash flows. As you recall, we started the second quarter with significantly more concentrate inventory than we normally carry with the strong production volumes and some maintenance downtime at our port, weather issues at quarter end, sales were below our earlier estimates in the quarter. This is really a short-term timing issue, and we expect to be able to work inventory levels down in the second half of this year.
We successfully commissioned at Grasberg the second crusher at our Grasberg Block Cave during the quarter, and that will provide sufficient capacity for a ramp-up to 130,000 tonnes per day. You've seen the performance and the records achieved from the Grasberg Block Cave during the quarter.
We're also moving to advance the installation of our third SAG mill there. That's been part of our plan to support the higher rates of throughput. We've also identified an opportunity to invest in a new mill circuit that will allow us to increase copper and gold production in Indonesia through the achievement of higher mill recoveries when the initial phases of this project and the economics are highly attractive.
Our global team also remains focused on cost management and efficiency projects to extend equipment lives, improve energy efficiency and maintenance practices with the use of technology. We have experienced some degree of cost increases this year, principally from energy price increases and, to a lesser extent, the impact on consumables of steel price increases, increased freight costs and sulfuric acid cost. We've had -- partially offsetting these items, we've had the benefits of a weaker exchange rate in South America versus the U.S. dollar. The increases in costs have been offset by significant increase in molybdenum prices in recent months, and those have provided a very nice hedge to certain of these cost inflation items.
We talked on slide, you've seen in the release our plans for -- to meet our commitments in Indonesia for the new smelter. On Slide 16, we provide an update on our plans to meet the commitment that we agreed to with the Indonesian government in 2018 to construct 2 million tonnes per year of in-country processing facility of copper concentrate. We have been advancing the discussions with our Japanese partners to expand the existing smelter at PT Smelting. That would fulfill a portion of the obligation. And there are several financial and operating benefits of expanding this facility, which has been expanded very efficiently in the past.
After considering various alternatives for the balance of the commitment, we've concluded that the best long-term option is to continue with our plans to construct a new greenfield smelter in East Java near the existing facilities at PT Smelting.
We recently entered into an EPC contract with Chiyoda to construct a 1.7 million tonne facility there. And we're now focused on completing the project as efficiently and as timely as possible. We show in the graph on Slide 16 on the right, the estimated timing of expenditures over roughly a 3-year period. FCX is responsible for 49% of these expenditures. We recently completed a new $1 billion bank credit facility for PT-FI to advance these projects and are planning additional debt financing, which can be attained at attractive rates to fund these activities.
As indicated, the long-term cost of the financing expected for the smelter would be offset by a phaseout of the 5% export duty. And we show a graph on the bottom of Slide 16 which shows you that the economic impact is not material as the cost of the smelter would be essentially offset in lower duties, which we're currently paying.
Slide 17 provides a 3-year outlook for volumes. These are consistent with our previous guidance. We're continuing to pursue additional incremental near-term growth opportunities and conducting our longer-range development planning.
Moving to Slide 18, we show the significance of cash flow generation using these volumes and cost estimates. And the price is ranging from $4 to $5 copper and holding gold and molybdenum flat at $1,800 per ounce of gold and $16 per pound of molybdenum.
What you see here on these graphs, we would generate EBITDA in the range of over $12.5 billion per annum for '22 and '23 on average at $4 copper to $17 billion per annum at $5 copper. And at operating cash flows, net of taxes and interest would be $9 billion to $12 billion using these price assumptions. As demonstrated in the second quarter, we're generating very significant free cash flow, and this trend is expected to continue with cash flow significantly above our capital spending.
On Slide 19, we include our projected capital of $2.2 billion this year and $2.5 billion in 2022. As you'll note, we shifted about $100 million in expenditures from 2021 to 2022, which was timing related. And we've advanced some capital from future years into 2022 to reflect the timing of additional leach pad construction at Lone Star and the addition of some highly attractive growth spending in Indonesia related to mill recoveries.
We've entered a period of outstanding free cash flow generation. We've got growing volumes, strong markets and low capital requirements. You'll see on Slide 20, and this is backward looking, but over the last 12 months, we've reduced our net debt by $5 billion, and that included $2 billion in the second quarter alone. You'll see our credit metrics are strong and less than 0.5x EBITDA on a trailing 12-month basis. And we're projecting our credit metrics to continue to be strong and improving.
As Richard mentioned, we achieved our targeted net debt level several months ahead of our schedule with our long-lived asset base and growing production profile and strong markets. We'll have the ability to continue to strengthen our balance sheet, provide increasing cash returns to shareholders and build additional values in our asset base.
The slide on 21 just reiterates our financial policy. We have performance-based payout policy, which was established by our Board earlier this year, providing up to 50% of free cash flow, would be used for shareholder returns with the balance available for growth and further balance sheet improvements. And with the recent achievement of our net debt target, we expect our Board will consider additional payouts to shareholders with our 2021 results. We're looking forward to reporting on our continued progress and continuing to build additional values as we go forward.
And now operator, we'd like to open the call up for questions."

But Josh Olmsted and our Americas team have just done a great job in helping offset that. Mike Kendrick in running our molybdenum business, which is a primary production business and a by-product business and with higher molybdenum prices is offsetting us some of these cost increases. We've got a high gold price which helps us. Danny Hughes is leading our supply chain group.
And so a combination of all these things is helping us as a company to really mitigate much of these increases in costs, working with logistics. So I just wanted to make a note of that because I think it's important giving -- given all of our concerns about where inflation is leading us.

Shipping, for those of you who follow us for a long period of time, know that, that's always a timing issue at Grasberg. Our port there is a very shallow point, a shallow sea there. We have a relatively complicated historical loading operation there. We have to lighter concentrate out to ships and weather shipping schedules. Logistic issues will always have a timing impact.

Does it seem promising to you?
And then how do you judge sort of the potential future impact on Freeport and the copper industry more broadly? Like 10 years from now, if this technology plays out, how much additional copper do you think that Freeport could be producing? And how much additional copper do you think could be produced globally using this technology?"

There's a series of efforts by different parties to develop different technologies. We have our own R&D work going on, and we're looking across the board at how this might apply to us. I think we are especially situated to take advantage of it because we have these large number and size of past leaching operations, some of which are now totally inactive that we can look to apply these to.
So we have a special opportunity in industry. Others have some, but we have a special opportunity to do -- to look at this in 2 ways. One of it is to use the leaching technology. And by the way, we're supplementing that with this artificial intelligence, data analytics opportunity to measure the impact of all this, but to apply this to an active and existing leaching leach pads that we have a large abundance for. So that's one thing.
And then aspirationally, it might provide a way to recover material from mining operations that would otherwise have to be recovered through mill investments. And it could be, and this is looking ahead, an opportunity to minimize capital by recovering low-grade sulfide deposits that would otherwise have to be mined and milled. So it's early stages. We don't have complete answers. I just want to share with you how exciting it is. It's an opportunity for us, opportunity throughout the industry.

Yes, just as Richard and Kathleen have talked to, it's really exciting with respect to the opportunity there. The thing that I think for us that's unlocking it even more than just the various technologies that are out there that we're studying and researching and running different pilot tests on is the combination of that with the data analytics that Richard touched on. The data analytics that -- and the processes that we learned over the last several years in our application of that technology on the milling side has now opened our eyes to opportunities on the leaching side.
And that in combination with the various technologies is really exciting for us because it's allowing us to look at things in a way that we haven't ever looked at previously. And we've started to see some of the benefits of that at Morenci as we've done some of this pilot work, and that's what's really getting us excited about what the potential is going forward.
The other thing that I would note is, as Richard said, it's not a, what I would call, a fundamental game changer or a step change for the industry, and it happens over time. But it's really low incremental cost, low carbon footprint and an incremental adder as we go forward.
But it's really exciting. There's lots of energy. If I think about the similar things that we saw with our agile efforts earlier, we're seeing similar things on the leaching side as we engage with various levels of the organization. The employee engagement, the excitement and the passion and the ideas that they're bringing to the table in combination with the models that we're generating is really going to, I think, untap -- or tap into, I should say, these opportunities and bring value forward for us."

Earlier this morning, we reported our third quarter 2021 operating and financial results, and a copy of today's press release and the slides are available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. 
Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in FCX's SEC filings. 
On the call with me today are Richard Adkerson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Johnson, our COO of Indonesia; Josh Olmsted, our Chief Operating Officer for the Americas; Steve Higgins, our Chief Administrative Officer; Rick Coleman, who runs our engineering and construction business; and Mike Kendrick, who runs our molybdenum business. 
I'll start by briefly summarizing our financial results, and then we'll turn the call over to Richard, who will go through the materials in our slide presentation materials. After our formal remarks, we'll take your questions. 
Today, FCX reported third quarter 2021 net income attributable to common stock of $1.4 billion, that was $0.94 per share, and adjusted net income attributable common stock of $1.3 billion or $0.89 per share. The $0.89 per share excludes net credits totaling $0.05 a share, primarily associated with tax credits related to the release of valuation allowances at PT Freeport Indonesia and a gain on the sale of FCX's remaining Cobalt business. The details of our adjusted net income are reflected in our press release on Page VII. We generated adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of roughly $3 billion, and we've got a reconciliation of the EBITDA on Page 37 of our slide deck. Favorable results in the third quarter reflect strong execution by our team, growing our production volume safely, efficiently and responsibly. Our sales volumes for the quarter for copper exceeded 1 billion pounds. That approximated our prior estimate in July of 2021 and was above the year ago period. Gold sales of 400,000 ounces were approximately 12% higher than our prior estimate and also significantly above the year ago period. We also benefited from positive pricing for copper. Our third quarter average realized copper price was $4.20 per pound. That was substantially above the year ago period. And gold prices were slightly below the year ago period. We also benefited from improved molybdenum prices in the quarter, where prices nearly doubled from the year-ago period. 
Net unit cash costs were $1.24 per pound in the third quarter. That was lower than our estimate going into the period, and we had some good performance from our leach production, which reduced our unit production costs in the period. We generated strong cash flows, and we've been doing that every quarter this year, generating $2 billion of operating cash flow, which exceeded capital spending of roughly $500 million during the quarter. 
Our balance sheet is strong. We ended the quarter with consolidated debt of $9.7 billion and consolidated cash of $7.7 billion, which resulted in net debt of $2 billion. We had no borrowings under our credit facility and have $3.5 billion available. We also announced today some liability management, where we called for redemption our outstanding notes due 2022 that has a total principal amount of $524 million. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to the slide presentation materials. Richard, go ahead."

I'm really pleased to be able to review our strong performance for this quarter, where we are with the company. It's a special time several years ago in the call I said if we could be fortunate enough to ramp up our underground production at Grasberg at the same time we had a positive copper market, it would be a great time for Freeport, and this is really a great time for us. 
We're going to focus on the future, but just one comment. I was last at job site 2 years ago in October, and we were just completing the mining of the open pit and starting the ramp up of the Grasberg Block Cave. And so during this 2-year period, our progress has been nothing short of remarkable. And I really congratulate our team in the job site, but also in the Americas. But what we've been able to accomplish even in the face of all the distractions and challenges that COVID brought on. I hope you and all your family and your colleagues are staying healthy. This thing is not over. We're keeping our guards up. I encourage you, too, as well. We have, at Freeport, had a successful program to get vaccines to our people internationally. Over 90% of our people in South America are now vaccinated and 85% in pipeline in Indonesia are vaccinated. We continue to be challenged in some of our operations in the United States, which is common across our country, unfortunately. We're encouraging our people and making some progress there. But the news is we've been able to meet the challenge of of COVID and accomplished what we are reporting to you today. 
Our copper volumes have grown over 20% from a year ago, and that reflects this really exceptional execution of our business. With these prices that we have today, we're generating very strong margin. Our EBITDA doubled from a year ago. Our strong operating cash flows that Kathleen mentioned in the quarter are really exceptional and particularly when you looked at our capital expenditures were only $500 million. Now this is generating cash flows to -- now that we've met our debt target, and we met that at the end of June way ahead of what we anticipated at the beginning of the year, we're now focused on managing these cash flows. And that's a happy time for us looking at investments for our long-term future. At the same time, we're being able to increase returns to shareholders and maintain a really strong balance sheet, which is going to be a real hallmark of our company going forward. 
Everybody is focused on carbon reduction and climate initiatives. And with COP26 coming up next month, it's going to be all over the papers. We published our second report on our climate initiatives. We put a lot more resources into it. We're really focused on it. As a company, compared with other natural resource companies, we have much limited Scope 3 emissions and other natural resources, and we're really focused on our Scope 1 and 2 emissions and have a plan to achieve targets that we believe are realistic and achievable. We and the other 28 members of ICMM, International Council of Mining and Metals, which I chair, have signed a commitment to work towards having zero net carbon emissions by 2050, and everybody is working hard on it. 
We're also continuing to make progress to certify all of our operations with the International Copper Association Copper Mark. And this just clearly demonstrates our commitment to responsible production. 
You recall that I became Chairman earlier this year. And when that occurred, I made a real commitment to build the kind of board that a company like ours really needs and deserves. We have added 4 new members in 2021. We added 2 this quarter, Marcelo Donadio and Sara Lewis. That brings us to a total of 8 independent directors, which have a broad range of experience. And it's going to be a real strength of our company going forward. 
Underlying all of this is the fundamental outlook for copper is incredibly favorable. Copper's role in the economy -- and as the economy changes with global investments in infrastructure -- and I know we have a controversy here -- but countries around the world are going to build infrastructure, less developed countries are going to develop, the world is getting increasingly focused on electrification with modern technology, 5G and artificial intelligence. And then a new major element that people are talking about and recognizing now, for demand that's coming, it's not here in real significance now, is all the investments that people are going to be making to reduce carbon. And across the board, those investments stands for copper. And then you've got -- and we'll talk about this more, the commodity really supported by supply factors. 
I mentioned our climate report is reported in September. It's on our website. I encourage you all to take a look at it. It really details work in a much more comprehensive way than we did in our first report last year about how our company will work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and how we are approaching climate scenario analysis, and we're reporting in line with recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. We are, as a company and as an organization, firmly committed to this. We see it in our everyday lives with the forest fires in our operations in the West and hurricanes on the Gulf Coast, weather patterns all around the world. We all know we need to do this, and we're committed to do our part for our company. And as I said, as the rest of the world, the rest of the industry focuses on this, it's going to create a lot of copper demand. 
We established a target to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions in Indonesia by 30%, which is a new target for us. We have this aspirational goal of net zero by 2050. Our 2 big issues are: one, the coal-powered power plant in Indonesia, a lot of power required for our massive operations there. We're now investing in a dual fuel-powered plant there. We're looking to a future of power being generated by biodiesel initially, natural gas, looking at hydropower opportunity. So we're working on that. And then the other major issue is how to convert our big-haul truck fleet, massive trucks, diesel-driven to -- how to work with our suppliers and others in the industry to convert that to electrical or hydrogen-fired vehicles. We'll hear a lot more about this in the week. Just know that our company is committed to deal with our own emissions and to work with industry and communities in general to meet the things we need to meet with climate change. 
Copper is essential to that. It's a strategic metal in many respects for the future. The world is getting increasingly electrified, and more than 65% of the world's copper is used to deliver electricity. And when you look at electric vehicles, charging stations, clean power from wind, solar, all of these require significantly more copper to operate than the way that things are currently done now. And so it's a challenging time for us, and we're serious about this challenge, but it is also a great opportunity for us as a responsible global copper producer. 
So we got these rising demand, and supply is a real issue for this industry. Even today, with the economic uncertainties in China and globally, copper inventories are remarkably low. The LME recently hit a 47-year low. Shanghai is lower than it's been since 2009. And while there will be some new projects that were started 4 or 5 years ago delayed by COVID coming on stream in the next couple of years, that will bring some new copper to the market. Beyond that, the -- copper is pretty empty in terms of new supply projects of any significance. And the world today, the opportunities are smaller. They're more difficult to develop and produce. Permitting still requires a very long period of time. And so the industry really, one, has an issue with meeting the demand with supply, and that's going to require action across a lot of fronts, more scrap, some substitution. But copper as a commodity is so much better than any alternatives that in whatever environment you can envision for the world going forward, absent some doom's day situation in the global economy, it's just in a situation of where copper prices have to be strong and, in my view, stronger than they are today. 
Turning to Slide 7. What this means for our company is, with all the work we've done today in preparing our business and building our assets, we're going to have really significant margins and cash flow. 6 years ago, our company was facing real challenges, and we worked our way through that very successfully. As we were working so hard in facing, dealing with some real tough problems and dealing with unsustainable debt level at that time, we all looked at ourselves and talked about the assets that we had in our company, the long-term assets, the quality of the team, our track record, our capabilities. And that's really what inspired us all to work so hard to get to where we are today. 
Copper volumes are 20%, gold volumes are 50% higher than they were a year ago. And they'll be growing another 15%, 20% next year. It's a great feeling as we were ending the quarter and looking at September particularly to recognize that the capital and execution risk to achieve these higher volumes, which we've been pointing to for a very long period of time, that those risks are behind us. The higher volumes are coming with low incremental cost. At copper prices from $4 to $5, we would generate annual EBITDA for the next couple of years on the order of $12.5 billion to $17 billion per year. And our capital expenditures -- and we have a new project that we'll be talking about in Indonesia, including that, our capital expenditures will range in the order of $2 billion to $2.5 billion a year. So that means where we're wanting to be, where we're targeting to be, where we thought we would be. But the important part is, now we've done it, we're just not pointing to it. 
And Slide 8 shows about this ramp-up of the Grasberg mine, man, that was -- this slide looks like this was really a straightforward, easy-to-accomplish deal. There are challenges every day, I say. This is the most complicated mine in the world when it was an open pit mine. And now in the industry historically -- historic large underground mine, it is truly remarkable. The third quarter was 90% of our target annualized rate. We were at target in September. We're now on track to reach full rates metal production by the end of the year. And our team in Indonesia just needs to be congratulated and recognized for meeting all these targets. And it was strategically so important for us, and it was a real matter of concern back in March of 2020 when we had COVID facing us. It's easy on paper, but man, it's a challenge every day. And I had a great meeting with our team in advance of this call. And the excitement, morale and so forth is just exceptional. It's really something special for our company, and we now look forward to taking the steps that we need to take to sustain this for the life of this ore body. We're beginning to talk with the government and getting positive initial responses about extending our operating rights beyond 2041. Because of the ramp-up, the limit of the operating rights, we haven't done much exploratory drilling, extension-type core drilling. Our feeling and our confidence is there's a lot more resources beyond what we're developing now. And we're explaining that to the government. As I said, initial reactions are positive. And I'm confident that we will not be facing an end to -- of this operation in 2041. That makes no sense for any stakeholder. We need to look at it to take advantage of the long-term resources available to us. 
Slide 9 talks about our growth of our company. Real strength of Freeport is its large reserve base. 30, 35 years of life in its proved and probable reserves, which gives us a sustainable ability of our operations for a very long period of time. And beyond that, we have resources that are even larger than our reserves that are brownfield resources, which is really important in the Americas because that means that we are not trying to permit or gain community approval to build new mines. We have great support for our communities. We've involved them. We share our benefits with them. And so as a result, we have these multiple options for long term where we have great community support, you have the benefit of strong community education, great workforce, great community. We pay our people really well. We make sure they have living wages. We're sensitive to them. So here, we see, across the board, Bagdad in Northwest Arizona, long reserve life, do a concentrated project and double production. 
Lone Star. You're going to hear a lot about Lone Star in Freeport's future. This resource has a long-term opportunity to be a flagship asset. It's just across the ridge from Morenci, the largest mine in North America. We honestly believe this can be another long-term Morenci. And it's got -- right now, we're having real success with our -- the new oxide mine we started this past year. It's expanding. It's got further expansions. We're able to make it economic by using available production facilities that are nearby Safford mine that's  winding down. And then processing this upside is really a stripping operation for this enormous sulfide deposit. 
We have a great project in Chile at our El Abra mine where we're partners with CODELCO. This is a mine where we have a sulfide leaching project going on now. There's a big sulfide resource there. It would be a big price capital project to build a mill with desalinization plant. We're looking at a number of alternatives there. Chile is going through a process of the government, the people assessing how they're going to tax and what the physical regime is going to be for mining projects. We want to wait to see how that plays out before making any investment decision. But in the meantime, we're getting more -- we're getting prepared, working with communities, working with preparing for permitting and so forth. This will be a project the world will ultimately need going forward. 
We've got a project -- it's not very big -- in Europe at our Atlantic Copper smelter, where we're going to be recycling electronic equipment. This responds to people wanting to see this sort of thing happening. It's a way of generating some copper without carbon emissions of significance and investments. And so we're looking for that. We're looking at other opportunities like that. 
And then this Kucing Liar mine in Indonesia is really special. It is a -- I was actually out there in the '90s when -- as we were driving the Amole drift, which was a dewatering drift going underneath the Grasberg open pit -- as we were driving the pit, we found this ore body. The engineers give our geologists a hard time about it because they literally pierced this ore body that we had not seen previously that lies really to the south flank of the Grasberg pit. And we've been working on getting the right mine plan, the timing for it. But in the context of -- and if you turn to Slide 10, you can see where it's located. It's an ore body that's in a separate mineralization zone from our DOZ, Deep MLZ and the Grasberg pit. It's along the fault line. It may have resources at depth, has some complicated geology and mineralogy, but it's a big mine. I mean a 90,000-tonne a day blockade, you only think of that has not been a huge mine because it's next to the Grasberg blockade, but it's like 60% size of Deep MLZ, 40% the size of Grasberg Block Cave, 350 million tonnes of ore, good copper and gold grades, 90,000 tonnes a day from a block cave, that's big by global standards. And it's going to occur over a number of years. It will help sustain our high level of low-cost production out of Grasberg, 500 million pounds of copper a year, 500,000 ounces of gold when it's ramped up in 2030. Capital expenditure is going to be spent over a number of years, use existing infrastructure. Just ask your gold analysts how they feel if the gold companies were to announce a gold mine that was 500,000 ounces a year, 500 million pounds of copper a year. This is a significant opportunity for us. 
12, I mentioned Lone Star. You can see how we're ramping up the oxide. We got 2P reserves, about 5.5 billion pounds. The real price here is the sulfides underlying it. We've done some drilling to identify it. We're doing preliminary plans on how to process it and so forth. Mineral potential of 50 billion pounds, 50 billion pounds. This is a long-term opportunity, but we're a long-term company. And this is going to be a flagship opportunity for us going forward. Another area that's emerging and our guys on this call are really excited about it is new opportunities to apply technology to leaching. 
Now Freeport predecessors were long leaders in reaching going back to the very start of SXEW leaching. The opportunities globally for traditional SXCW leaching are diminishing because they've been accessed and taken advantage of it. But this opens up a whole new realm of opportunities for us to add production with limited capital and low-carbon emissions. This will range from looking at a series of additives and approaches for existing lead stacks, which would allow us to recover more from those. We're also really getting excited by using these data analytics efforts that we started several years ago to apply those release stacks and know more about what we're doing what the consequences of taking certain actions. So it's a combination of things. There are several alternatives we're looking at. The opportunity is really significant. Our guys estimate we got almost 40 billion pounds of copper in our existing stockpiles. This is not -- this has already been mined, it's not reserves or resources or any production plan. If we could record -- if we're going to cover just a piece of this, it's the size of a new mine, low capital, low operating cost, low carbon footprint. A lot of this is at Morenci, but there are other places. And it could even apply to some old historical mines that have old lead stacks that we can use it for. It's an emerging thing, but we have excitement about it. And our company is particularly well situated to take advantage of that because of the history that we've had with these older mines and what this could mean for it. So this is a stay-tuned deal. We're not building in our plans yet, but it's like a development project, low capital, low cost, low carbon, so it's really good. 
So listen, we're -- we're just feeling great about Freeport. I mean, we've been to the wars together. Our team is -- we're adding some really new resources to our team despite COVID. We're bringing in support. We got young people in our organization stepping up to leadership positions. It's a dynamic company. It's remarkable that through all the trials and tribulations we went through, we had very limited numbers of people to leave us. Our people look at each other, and we're inspired by each other. And it's just great. Strong cash flows. We're going to be responsible. We have this great track record of doing all this. If you look at our success we've had in developing projects all around the world, different kinds of mining, different kinds of processing technology. Market outlook is great. We've got these organic growth opportunities. And really, as a shareholder myself, the prospects of seeing returns on those shareholders coming of significance is just a great feeling. 
So I hope you can sense how we all feel about our company and our outlook and really appreciate your interest. And I'm going to turn it over to Kathleen before we open up for questions."

I'm just going to cover some brief comments on financial and operating matters. And then we'll open up for questions. And just really starting on Slide 16, we provide some additional details on our operating activit",1547,"All right. Great. Thank you, Richard. I'm just going to cover some brief comments on financial and operating matters. And then we'll open up for questions. 
And just really starting on Slide 16, we provide some additional details on our operating activities. Richard mentioned Lone Star, and the performance there has been really strong. Our operations are exceeding our design capacity, which was originally 200 million pounds. We're exceeding that now by 25%, and we're continuing to optimize and planning for the next increment of production from oxide as we study the longer-term opportunities. 
Richard mentioned the leach work that we're doing. It's a major focus at Morenci. We have a big effort underway to enhance recoveries, and we're deploying a variety of initiatives. Some of these have already produced results, and that did enable us to increase expected recovery from some of our leach material in the third quarter. And what this does is get us more volumes, but also allows us to reduce unit costs, having a bigger pool to spread costs over. So that's a really positive thing and more to come there. We've incorporated some of this into our plans, but we're optimistic that additional copper pounds can be added as we go forward. 
At Morenci, we're continuing to work to increase mining rates. We're targeting getting up to 900,000 tonnes of material per day in 2023. That's a major undertaking. It's 30% higher than where we were in 2020. As we reported, we have started -- restarted the historic Morenci mill, which had been idled since the first half of 2020, and that's proceeding. We started the mill in the third quarter. We did experience some delays, but those are largely behind us. We also had, as probably a lot of you've seen, the weather conditions in the Southwest that we experienced this summer. We did experience severe wet weather and some power issues during monsoon season, and we always have monsoon season, but this year was more severe than normal and that did impact some of our some of our operations in the third quarter. And again, that's behind us as well. 
I want to just echo what Richard said about our team in South America. The Cerro Verde team has overcome significant challenges in dealing with the pandemic. We've been operating at about 95% of capacity over the last several months, and that's in the face of still restrictions on movement around  Arequipa, and our team just does great work in managing this and being creative about how to manage it safely. We're optimistic that, as we look forward into 2022, we can -- many of the government restrictions can be lifted safely and we can return to a more normal operating environment there and achieve higher rates at Cerro Verde. 
Elara mine in Chile is making great progress. We're increasing the stacking rate of material. We're restoring production that we had curtailed during 2020. And we're focused on sustaining the level of production at El Abra in the 200 million, 250 million pound per year range as we look to potentially expand that as we go forward. 
Richard talked about the terrific results at Grasberg. Team there is just continuing to deliver results quarter after quarter. We expect to be at our quarterly run rate for metal beginning here in the fourth quarter. And for the next several quarters, we project the mill will run at about 175,000 tonnes per day until 2023 when we install the new SAG mill, which is currently under construction. And that will support higher rates as we continue to ramp up the Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ and then make room for the Kucing Liar project that Richard mentioned. 
A lot of talk right now about inflation. Our team is really focused on cost management and efficiency projects. We're focused on extending equipment lines, ways to improve our energy efficiency, ways to efficiently implement maintenance practices and really use technology in all of this. We have, like everyone else, experienced some cost increases. Those have really principally been associated with the energy price increases. To a lesser extent, we've had some other impacts on our consumables, the impact of steel prices on some of our consumables. We've had higher sulfuric acid costs, freight costs, but we really want to send appreciation to our global supply chain team. They're doing excellent work in keeping our operations stocked with critical supplies and managing in these uncertain times. And they've just done an outstanding job in keeping our business continuity going. I will note that we have seen very strong prices in molybdenum, and those have more than offset some of these inflationary pressures we've had on the cost side. 
Turning to the smelter. On Slide 17, we provide an update of our activities with the greenfield smelter we're developing in East Java and the work we're doing with our partner at PT Smelting to expand the facility there. We were focused on completing this project as efficiently, as timely as possible. We're advancing the engineering and commercial arrangements, and we've commenced preparing the land for construction. You probably have seen press reports that the President of Indonesia recently visited the site in a groundbreaking ceremony, and it just indicates the significance of this project to the country. We've got a $1 billion bank credit facility in place for PT-FI to use to advance the projects, and we are going to plan additional debt financing for the project, which can be obtained at attractive rates to fund the project long term. 
As we previously discussed, the long-term cost of the financing for the smelter will essentially be offset by a phaseout of the 5% export duty. So the economic impact to PT-FI is not material, and this is a project that is shared 51% by our shareholder, PT-FI shareholder, MIND ID, in the balance of FCX. 
Turning to our volumes. And Richard talked about the growth in volumes. We've had great success in execution. We've got our 3-year outlook listed on Slide 18. And this is generally consistent with our previous guidance. We made some relatively minor adjustments to the fourth quarter of 2021, but you'll see here that the execution of our plan is on track. 
We'll show on Slide 19 the strong cash flow generation of this business. We've got very significant free cash flows using our volume and cost estimates and prices ranging from $4 to $5 copper, holding gold flat at $1,800 and molybdenum at current prices around $19 per pound. The real growth in our volumes with low incremental costs show EBITDA ranging from $12.5 billion per annum on average for 2022 and 2023 at $4 copper and $17 billion at $5 copper, as Richard has mentioned. And operating cash flows, and this is net of tax, ranges from $9 billion to over $12 billion, which provides significant cash flows not only to invest in our business and fund programs, grow our business, but also increased capital returns to investors. 
Our capital spending plans are detailed on the next slide, Slide 20. You'll see here that we reduced our outlook for 2021 for capital spending from $2.2 billion previously to 2 point -- $2 billion, and that excludes the smelter investment. But that reflects really timing. We've had really a timing issue in getting these projects going. And so that would just fall -- some of that falling over into 2022. We've also added the -- in our forecast plans to commence development of the Kucing Liar ore body that Richard mentioned previously. So you're talking about $9 billion to $12 billion of operating cash flows and CapEx below $3 billion, very strong free cash flow. We've got growing volumes, strong markets, low capital requirements. And that's really allowed us just over the past 12 months to reduce our debt, our net debt, by nearly $6 billion. And so we're down now to $2 billion in net debt. I know some of you remember a time when it was multiples of this. And so we're in a great situation from a balance sheet standpoint. Our credit metrics are extremely strong, and it positions us well as we go forward to invest in future growth and increase our payouts to shareholders. 
The last slide, 22, refers to our financial policy. It is centered around a strong balance sheet. The combination of the strong balance sheet and the success in growing our volumes will put us in a strong position. Our Board had established earlier this year a policy that provides for up to 50% of free cash flow to be used for shareholder returns with the balance available for growth and further balance sheet improvements. We look forward to the achievement of our net debt targets. We look forward to the implementation of this policy. We expect our Board will determine the structure and size of additional payouts to shareholders with our annual results, and this will be something that we update and gets reviewed periodically. 
So that concludes our remarks. We look forward to reporting our progress and continuing to build on our momentum as we go forward. And operator, we'd now like to turn the call over for questions."

Of course, in Indonesia, their gold is growing, and molybdenum is doing well. And our team has just done a great job in managing these things. We benefit because Freeport manages its Americas business as one business. We operate all the mines that we operate, and we have incredibly good relationships with suppliers. We're a premium customer for all of our major suppliers. So it's something we're watching. And we're -- and some of our costs are correlated to copper prices.

It's at a similar elevation. It is going to benefit from the lessons learned at Deep MLZ. For instance, our plans now would be that we would apply this hydrofracking technology to it in advance, where with Deep MLZ, we ended up having to play a bit of catch-up. So we've got a much better geotechnical knowledge and how to address that part of the drift. It Benefits -- it ties it -- development some of the infrastructure. It shares -- there's common parts of the ortho system ventilation access. We're driving 3 headings starting very big dots off of drifting that goes back to GBC. 
The previous KL reserve had much more complex -- over the last couple of years, we changed our mine planning approach. We focused on what turned out to be much higher value material that was a little bit lower grade, but that the material could be processed through our current mill. So that took away a lot at the previous KL mine plan. We had to change our flotation circuit. We had much more of the environmental management with concentrate that would be generated. So this plan, it's about 0.9% copper, 0.9% per tonne gold. It's -- the tonnes that Richard mentioned are very much driven by this 2041 date that we're working on. And this deposit has a lot of growth, both on the same footprint that we're working out now and at deeper levels. So I feel like this is going to be our chance to take all the lessons learned. We're looking at the potential of applying electrical electric mining equipment there. So I think we get a fresh start with a lot of experience that's going to apply itself, and KL is going to benefit from it."

And it's something that is really underappreciated right now. And we're particularly focused on it within ICMM because here we had the 28 largest mining companies that represent about 1/3 of the global mining industry unanimously making this commitment. And as I said, with Freeport -- because of our limited Scope 3 emissions, it's not as big a challenge as it is for some other miners and resource companies. But we don't know yet what the cost of this is going to be. And it's going to be significant. I mean there's just no way around it. I met with the senior management of Caterpillar to try to think about designing 400-tonne haul trucks that can make the grades up these big pits that we have. The battery in those -- at this current level of technology is changing, but then battery weighs a ton. And its life is very short. So you got to deal with all the recharging and trialing systems and so forth. So there are lots of unknowns here. There's no question it's going to involve a lot of cost. 
And right now, while people are really making these commitments in good faith, they're doing it at a time -- and we talked about this in our final report of where it's going to rely on technology advances. And some of those things, there's more questions than answers with all that right now. We kind of have a good -- I think we got our arms around converting the coal plant in Indonesia. That's one of our big 2 things. But the question of how do you deal with haulage and electrifying shovels and a lot of shovels are already electric, but just light vehicles and so forth. In our underground mines, we have a big electric train helping us deliver ore, but there are going to be some investments there. So it's going to be an unfolding story. And you raised the point that people following us and the companies in our industry ought to really be tracking because, as we sit here today, there's more questions than answers in that area. 
I'll just make one add on to that. That's going to be another factor that's going to be a barrier to supply development and copper business. I mean, low-grade end-of-life mines -- and we've got 30 years or so to have this online, but it's going to affect mine life. It's going to affect the economics of project development. All of those things are going to come into play. So in your list of items that are barriers to supply development, this is a factor that you add to it."

Chile, Chile is separate from Peru, and it's got a really a lot of questions about it right now. It's driven by this widespread feeling within the country of people -- as people are having around the world dealing with income inequalities and social programs versus other government initiatives and so forth. And it's got a complicated election coming up. There's no clear front-runner right now. There's processes going on within the parliament, within issues related to consideration of constitutional changes. And so it's really -- from my perspective, muddy water is there. .
it's not currently nearly as significant as Peru in terms of production is a small part of our production, but it is affecting our consideration of expansion. But we're working with the industry. We're not at the top of the charts in terms of production there, so we're working with others on it. 
In Peru, Peru always consistently has complicated presidential politics. And we've seen the story before where a left-leaning candidate gets into office and runs on platforms that are very much addressing getting more money out of mining companies. And President Castillo ran on that platform. He had the backing of the far left-leaning parties there. I got the medium within this past month. He came to Washington. It was a Sunday before you [indiscernible] and with a small group of mining executives have to enter with him. My first time to meeting -- he comes from a nonpolitical, nonpolitical leader background. He was a teacher in the interior Peru. And when we talked with the -- I found him to be very compelling in his emotional feelings about doing more to help the people from the region where he came from, but also throughout Peru, the poor people in terms of education and so forth. 
And I didn't know what to expect when I went there, I had a better feeling than I had going into it. He listened, had the chance to have exchanges about different issues. We did not get into -- none of us got into details about specific fiscal proposals and so forth, but he emphasized that he recognized the importance that mining plays in Peru. And that's what always happens when people get in office to achieve social programs, they see how much mining contributes to the country financially and that's needed to do other things. 
So I'm having a lot of conversations with other CEOs of countries that operate in Peru. After that meeting, he revamped his cabinet at the very outset of his administration and replaced a very aggressive guy that was Prime Minister. And so it's a really wait-and-see thing. But I'm more encouraged about it. We're working with others in the industry. We need to be responsive to his concerns. And that's what I'm trying to -- we focus all of our -- almost all of our community programs in the regions where we operate. I think we've got to take a broader view and show people in the interior that mining can help their lives. And so that's what I'm working on right now. And so I am more optimistic now than I was during the election. You'll hear different views by different miners there. People are very concerned, rightly so. Our situation is we have a new stability agreement. We're maximizing the operations at Cerro Verde. It's a big producer, a major contributor to our volumes. It's got the world's largest mine site concentrate facilities. We have great relationships with the local community. So we want to build off that and try to reach out and find some common ground work for President to CEO, but it's uncertain. 
Man, what about the U.S.? What can you say? I mean it's just a head scratcher about what is going on in Washington these days. And the current administration I think recognizes the importance of minerals like copper to achieve their goals of climate change. And yet, I don't expect them to lessen up any requirements for permitting environmental management community issues because that just runs against the grain of their political situation. So it's really uncertain. We're all hopeful we'll see some steps towards infrastructure building. The country really needs it. You see it in ports and roads and bridges all over the country, but I just don't have any comment on the political situation other than be distressed about it. And we also need to have a more thoughtful approach to relationships with China and this country, and that's a bipartisan issue. And it's a complicated one. But China is going to be an important part of our world going forward. I mean the country is too big and people are very smart. They work hard, and they create a lot of economic velocity. 
So anyway, I'm focused on staying out of politics and focused on Freeport."

Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.  
Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in FCX's SEC filings.  
On the call with me today are Richard Adkerson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Johnson, our COO of Indonesia; Josh Olmsted, our Chief Operating Officer for the Americas; Steve Higgins, our Chief Administrative Officer; Rick Coleman, who runs our engineering and construction business; and Mike Kendrick, who runs our molybdenum business.  
I'll start by briefly summarizing our financial results, and then we'll turn the call over to Richard, who will go through the materials in our slide presentation materials. After our formal remarks, we'll take your questions.  
Today, FCX reported third quarter 2021 net income attributable to common stock of $1.4 billion, that was $0.94 per share, and adjusted net income attributable to common stock of $1.3 billion or $0.89 per share. The $0.89 per share excludes net credits totaling $0.05 a share, primarily associated with tax credits related to the release of valuation allowances at PT Freeport Indonesia and a gain on the sale of FCX's remaining Cobalt business. The details of our adjusted net income are reflected in our press release on Page VII. We generated adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of roughly $3 billion, and we've got a reconciliation of the EBITDA on Page 37 of our slide deck. 
Favorable results in the third quarter reflect strong execution by our team, growing our production volume safely, efficiently and responsibly. Our sales volumes for the quarter for copper exceeded 1 billion pounds. That approximated our prior estimate in July of 2021 and was above the year ago period. Gold sales of 400,000 ounces were approximately 12% higher than our prior estimate and also significantly above the year ago period. 
We also benefited from positive pricing for copper. Our third quarter average realized copper price was $4.20 per pound. That was substantially above the year ago period. And gold prices were slightly below the year ago period. We also benefited from improved molybdenum prices in the quarter, where prices nearly doubled from the year-ago period.  
Net unit cash costs were $1.24 per pound in the third quarter. That was lower than our estimate going into the period, and we had some good performance from our leach production, which reduced our unit production costs in the period. We generated strong cash flows, and we've been doing that every quarter this year, generating $2 billion of operating cash flow, which exceeded capital spending of roughly $500 million during the quarter.  
Our balance sheet is strong. We ended the quarter with consolidated debt of $9.7 billion and consolidated cash of $7.7 billion, which resulted in net debt of $2 billion. We had no borrowings under our credit facility and have $3.5 billion available. We also announced today some liability management, where we called for redemption our outstanding notes due 2022 that has a total principal amount of $524 million.  
I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to the slide presentation materials. Richard, go ahead."

I'm really pleased to be able to review our strong performance for this quarter. Where we are with the company, it's a special time. Several years ago in the call, I said if we could be fortunate enough to ramp up our underground production at Grasberg at the same time we had a positive copper market, it would be a great time for Freeport, and this is really a great time for us.  
We're going to focus on the future, but just one comment. I was last at job site 2 years ago in October, and we were just completing the mining of the open pit and starting the ramp up of the Grasberg Block Cave. And so during this 2-year period, our progress has been nothing short of remarkable. And I really congratulate our team in the job site but also in the Americas with what we've been able to accomplish even in the face of all the distractions and challenges that COVID brought on. 
I hope you and all your family and your colleagues are staying healthy. This thing is not over. We're keeping our guards up. I encourage you, too, as well. We have, at Freeport, had a successful program to get vaccines to our people internationally. Over 90% of our people in South America are now vaccinated and 85% in Papua and Indonesia are vaccinated. We continue to be challenged in some of our operations in the United States, which is common across our country, unfortunately. But we're encouraging our people and making some progress there. But the news is we've been able to meet the challenge of COVID and accomplished what we are reporting to you today.  
Our copper volumes have grown over 20% from a year ago, and that reflects this really exceptional execution of our business. With these prices that we have today, we're generating very strong margin. Our EBITDA doubled from a year ago. Our strong operating cash flows that Kathleen mentioned in the quarter are really exceptional and particularly when you looked at our capital expenditures, we're only $500 million. Now this is generating cash flows to -- now that we've met our debt target, and we met that at the end of June way ahead of what we anticipated at the beginning of the year, we're now focused on managing these cash flows. And that's a happy time for us looking at investments for our long-term future. At the same time, we've been able to increase returns to shareholders and maintain a really strong balance sheet, which is going to be a real hallmark of our company going forward.  
Everybody is focused on carbon reduction and climate initiatives. And with COP26 coming up next month, it's going to be all over the papers. We published our second report on our climate initiatives. We put a lot more resources into it. We're really focused on it. As a company, compared with other natural resource companies, we have much limited Scope 3 emissions and other natural resources, and we're really focused on our Scope 1 and 2 emissions and have a plan to achieve targets that we believe are realistic and achievable. We and the other 28 members of ICMM, International Council of Mining and Metals, which I chair, have signed a commitment to work towards having zero net carbon emissions by 2050, and everybody is working hard on it.  
We're also continuing to make progress to certify all of our operations with the International Copper Association's Copper Mark. And this just clearly demonstrates our commitment to responsible production.  
You recall that I became Chairman earlier this year. And when that occurred, I made a real commitment to build the kind of board that a company like ours really needs and deserves. We have added 4 new members in 2021. We added 2 this quarter, Marcelo Donadio and Sara Lewis. That brings us to a total of 8 independent directors, which have a broad range of experience. And it's going to be a real strength of our company going forward.  
Underlying all of this is the fundamental outlook for copper is incredibly favorable. Copper's role in the economy and as the economy changes with global investments in infrastructure -- I know we have a controversy here -- but countries around the world are going to build infrastructure. Less developed countries are going to develop. The world is getting increasingly focused on electrification with modern technology, 5G and artificial intelligence. And then a new major element that people are talking about and recognizing now, for demand that's coming, it's not here in real significance now, is all the investments that people are going to be making to reduce carbon. And across the board, those investments are -- result in significant demands for copper.  And then you've got -- and we'll talk about this more, the commodity really supported by supply factors.  
I mentioned our climate report is reported in September. It's on our website. I encourage you all to take a look at it. It really details work in a much more comprehensive way than we did in our first report last year about how our company will work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and how we are approaching climate scenario analysis, and we're reporting in line with recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. We are, as a company and as an organization, firmly committed to this. We see it in our everyday lives with the forest fires in our operations in the West and hurricanes on the Gulf Coast, weather patterns all around the world. We all know we need to do this, and we're committed to do our part for our company. And as I said, as the rest of the world, the rest of the industry focuses on this, it's going to create a lot of copper demand.  
We established a target to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions in Indonesia by 30%, which is a new target for us. We have this aspirational goal of net zero by 2050. Our 2 big issues are: one, the coal-powered power plant in Indonesia, a lot of power required for our massive operations there. We're now investing in a dual fuel-powered plant there. We're looking to a future of power being generated by biodiesel initially, natural gas, looking at hydropower opportunity. So we're working on that. And then the other major issue is how to convert our big-haul truck fleet, massive trucks, diesel-driven to -- how to work with our suppliers and others in the industry to convert that to electrical-powered or hydrogen-powered vehicles. We'll hear a lot more about this in the week. Just know that our company is committed to it, to deal with our own emissions and to work with industry and communities in general to meet the things we need to meet with climate change.  
Copper is essential to that. It's a strategic metal in many respects for the future. The world is getting increasingly electrified, and more than 65% of the world's copper is used to deliver electricity. And when you look at electric vehicles, charging stations, clean power from wind, solar, all of these require significantly more copper to operate than the way that things are currently done now. And so it's a challenging time for us, and we're serious about this challenge, but it is also a great opportunity for us as a responsible global copper producer.  
So we got these rising demand, and supply is a real issue for this industry. Even today, with the economic uncertainties in China and globally, copper inventories are remarkably low. The LME recently hit a 47-year low. Shanghai is lower than it's been since 2009. And while there will be some new projects that were started 4 or 5 years ago delayed by COVID coming on stream in the next couple of years, that will bring some new copper to the market. Beyond that, the cupboard is pretty empty in terms of new supply projects of any significance. 
And the world today, the opportunities are smaller. They're more difficult to develop and produce. Permitting still requires a very long period of time. And so the industry really, one, has an issue with meeting the demand with supply, and that's going to require action across a lot of fronts, more scrap, some substitution. But copper as a commodity is so much better than any alternatives that in whatever environment you can envision for the world going forward, absent some doom's day situation in the global economy, it's just in a situation of where copper prices have to be strong and, in my view, stronger than they are today.  
Turning to Slide 7. What this means for our company is, with all the work we've done today in preparing our business and building our assets, we're going to have really significant margins and cash flow. 6 years ago, our company was facing real challenges, and we worked our way through that very successfully. As we were working so hard in facing, dealing with some real tough problems and dealing with an unsustainable debt level at that time, we all looked at ourselves and talked about the assets that we had in our company, the long-term assets, the quality of the team, our track record, our capabilities. And that's really what inspired us all to work so hard to get to where we are today.  
Copper volumes are 20%. Gold volumes are 50% higher than they were a year ago. And they'll be growing another 15%, 20% next year. It's a great feeling as we were ending the quarter and looking at September particularly to recognize that the capital and execution risk to achieve these higher volumes, which we've been pointing to for a very long period of time, that those risks are behind us. The higher volumes are coming with low incremental cost. At copper prices from $4 to $5, we would generate annual EBITDA for the next couple of years on the order of $12.5 billion to $17 billion per year. And our capital expenditures, and we have a new project that we'll be talking about in Indonesia, including that, our capital expenditures will range in the order of $2 billion to $2.5 billion a year. So that means where we're wanting to be, where we're targeting to be, where we thought we would be. But the important part is, now we've done it, we're just not pointing to it.  
And Slide 8 shows about this ramp-up of the Grasberg mine, man, that was -- this slide looks like this was really a straightforward, easy-to-accomplish deal. There are challenges every day, I say. This is the most complicated mine in the world when it was an open pit mine. And now in the industry, historically -- historic large underground mine, it is truly remarkable. The third quarter was 90% of our target annualized rate. We were at target in September. We're now on track to reach full rates metal production by the end of the year. 
And our team in Indonesia just needs to be congratulated and recognized for meeting all these targets. And it was strategically so important for us, and it was a real matter of concern back in March of 2020 when we had COVID facing us. It's easy on paper, but man, it's a challenge every day. And I had a great meeting with our team in advance of this call. And the excitement, morale and so forth is just exceptional. It's really something special for our company, and we now look forward to taking the steps that we need to take to sustain this for the life of this ore body. 
We're beginning to talk with the government and getting positive initial responses about extending our operating rights beyond 2041. Because of the ramp-up, the limit of the operating rights, we haven't done much exploratory drilling, extension-type core drilling. Our feeling and our confidence is there's a lot more resources beyond what we're developing now. And we're explaining that to the government. As I said, initial reactions are positive. And I'm confident that we will not be facing an end to -- this operation in 2041. That makes no sense for any stakeholder. We need to look at it to take advantage of the long-term resources available to us.  
Slide 9 talks about our growth of our company. A real strength of Freeport is its large reserve base. 30, 35 years of life in its proved and probable reserves, which gives us a sustainable ability of our operations for a very long period of time. And beyond that, we have resources that are even larger than our reserves that are brownfield resources, which is really important in the Americas because that means that we are not trying to permit or gain community approval to build new mines. We have great support for our communities. We've involved them. We share our benefits with them. 
And so as a result, we have these multiple options for long-term, brownfield, low-risk growth. And I'm really encouraged by the opportunities we have in the United States where we have great community support, you have the benefit of strong communities and supporting schools, hospitals, education, a great workforce, great community. We pay our people really well. We make sure they have living wages. And we're sensitive to them. So here, we see, across the board, Bagdad in Northwest Arizona, long reserve life, do a concentrated project, we can double production.  
Lone Star. You're going to hear a lot about Lone Star in Freeport's future. This resource has a long-term opportunity to be a flagship asset. It's just across the ridge from Morenci, the largest mine in North America. We honestly believe this can be another long-term Morenci. And it's got -- right now, we're having real success with our -- the new oxide mine we started this past year. It's expanding. It's got further expansions. We're able to make it economic by using available production facilities at our nearby Safford mine that's  winding down. And then processing this upside is really a stripping operation for this enormous sulfide deposit. 
We have a great project in Chile at our El Abra mine where we're partners with CODELCO. This is a mine where we have a sulfide leaching project going on now. There's a big sulfide resource there. It would be a big-price capital project to build a mill with a desalinization plant. We're looking at a number of alternatives there. Chile is going through a process of the government, the people assessing how they're going to tax and what the fiscal regime is going to be for mining projects. We want to wait to see how that plays out before making any investment decision. But in the meantime, we're getting more -- we're getting prepared, working with communities, working with preparing for permitting and so forth. This will be a project the world will ultimately need going forward. 
We've got a neat project -- it's not very big -- in Europe at our Atlantic Copper smelter, where we're going to be recycling electronic equipment. This responds to people wanting to see this sort of thing happening. It's a way of generating some copper without carbon emissions of significance and investments. And so we're looking for that. We're looking at other opportunities like that. 
And then this Kucing Liar mine in Indonesia is really special. It is a -- I was actually out there in the '90s when -- as we were driving the Amole drift, which was a dewatering drift going underneath the Grasberg open pit -- as we were driving the pit, we found this ore body. The engineers give our geologists a hard time about it because they literally pierced this ore body that we had not seen previously that lies really to the south flank of the Grasberg pit. And we've been working on getting the right mine plan, the timing for it. 
But in the context of -- and if you turn to Slide 10, you can see where it's located. It's an ore body that's in a separate mineralization zone from our DOZ, Deep MLZ and the Grasberg pit. It's along the fault line. It may have resources at depth. It has some complicated geology and mineralogy, but it's a big mine. I mean at 90,000-tonne a day blockade, you only think of that has not been a huge mine because it's next to the Grasberg blockade, but it's like 60% the size of Deep MLZ, 40% the size of Grasberg Block Cave, 350 million tonnes of ore, good copper and gold grades, 90,000 tonnes a day from a block cave, that's big by global standards. And it's going to occur over a number of years. 
It will help sustain our high level of low-cost production out of Grasberg, 500 million pounds of copper a year, 500,000 ounces of gold when it's ramped up in 2030. Capital expenditure is going to be spent over a number of years, use existing infrastructure. Just ask your gold analysts how they feel if gold companies were to announce a gold mine that was $500,000 a year and 500 million pounds of copper a year. This is a significant opportunity for us. 
12, I mentioned Lone Star. You can see how we're ramping up the oxides. We got 2P reserves, about 5.5 billion pounds. The real price here is the sulfides underlying it. We've done some drilling to identify it. We're doing preliminary plans on how to process it and so forth. Mineral potential of 50 billion pounds, 50 billion pounds. This is a long-term opportunity, but we're a long-term company. And this is going to be a flagship opportunity for us going forward. Another area that's emerging and our guys on this call are really excited about it is new opportunities to apply technology to leaching. 
Now tough guys in Freeport predecessors were long leaders in leaching, going back to the very start of SXEW leaching. The opportunities globally for traditional SXEW leaching are diminishing because they've been accessed and taken advantage of it. But this opens up a whole new realm of opportunities for us to add production with limited capital and low carbon emissions. This will range from looking at a series of additives and approaches for existing leach stacks, which would allow us to recover more from those. 
We're also really getting excited by using these data analytics efforts that we started several years ago to apply those to leach stacks and know more about what we're doing with the consequences of taking certain actions. So it's a combination of things. There are several alternatives we're looking at. The opportunity is really significant. Our guys estimate we got almost 40 billion pounds of copper in our existing stockpiles. This is not -- this has already been mined. It's not in reserves or resources or any production plans. If we can record -- if we're going to cover just a piece of this, it's the size of a new mine, low capital, low operating cost, low carbon footprint. 
A lot of this is at Morenci, but there are other places. And it could even apply to some old historical mines that have old leach stacks that we can use it for. It's an emerging thing, but we have excitement about it. And our company is particularly well situated to take advantage of that because of the history that we've had with these older mines and what this could mean for it. So this is a stay-tuned deal. We're not building it in our plans yet, but it's like a development project, low capital, low cost, low carbon, so it's really good. 
So listen, we're -- we're just feeling great about Freeport. I mean, we've been to the wars together. Our team is -- we're adding some really new resources to our team despite COVID. We're bringing in support. We got young people in our organization stepping up to leadership positions. It's a dynamic company. It's remarkable that through all the trials and tribulations we went through, we had very limited numbers of people to leave us. Our people look at each other, and we're inspired by each other. And it's just great. 
Strong cash flows. We're going to be responsible. We have this great track record of doing all this. If you look at our success we've had in developing projects all around the world, different kinds of mining, different kinds of processing technology. Market outlook is great. We've got these organic growth opportunities. And really, as a shareholder myself, the prospects of seeing returns on those shareholders coming of significance is just a great feeling. 
So I hope you can sense how we all feel about our company and our outlook and really appreciate your interest. And I'm going to turn it over to Kathleen before we open up for questions."
273607,1684274659,2409276,"Freeport-McMoRan Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2021",2021-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Freeport-McMoRan Inc.","Executives","All right. Great. Thank you, Richard. I'm just going to cover some brief comments on financial and operating matters. And then we'll open up for questions. And just really starting on Slide 16, we provide some additional details on our operating activit",1546,"All right. Great. Thank you, Richard. I'm just going to cover some brief comments on financial and operating matters. And then we'll open up for questions. 
And just really starting on Slide 16, we provide some additional details on our operating activities. Richard mentioned Lone Star, and the performance there has been really strong. Our operations are exceeding our design capacity, which was originally 200 million pounds. We're exceeding that now by 25%, and we're continuing to optimize and planning for the next increment of production from oxides as we study the longer-term opportunities. 
Richard mentioned the leach work that we're doing. It's a major focus at Morenci. We have a big effort underway to enhance recoveries, and we're deploying a variety of initiatives. Some of these have already produced results, and that did enable us to increase expected recovery from some of our leach material in the third quarter. And what this does is get us more volumes, but also allows us to reduce unit costs, having a bigger pool to spread costs over. So that's a really positive thing and more to come there. We've incorporated some of this into our plans, but we're optimistic that additional copper pounds can be added as we go forward. 
At Morenci, we're continuing to work to increase mining rates. We're targeting getting up to 900,000 tonnes of material per day in 2023. That's a major undertaking. It's 30% higher than where we were in 2020. As we reported, we have started -- restarted the historic Morenci mill, which had been idled since the first half of 2020, and that's proceeding. We started the mill in the third quarter. We did experience some delays, but those are largely behind us. We also had, as probably a lot of you've seen, the weather conditions in the Southwest that we experienced this summer. We did experience severe wet weather and some power issues during monsoon season. And we always have monsoon season, but this year was more severe than normal and that did impact some of our operations in the third quarter. And again, that's behind us as well. 
I want to just echo what Richard said about our team in South America. The Cerro Verde team has overcome significant challenges in dealing with the pandemic. We've been operating at about 95% of capacity over the last several months, and that's in the face of still restrictions on movement around Arequipa, and our team just does great work in managing this and being creative about how to manage it safely. We're optimistic that, as we look forward into 2022, we can -- many of the government restrictions can be lifted safely and we can return to a more normal operating environment there and achieve higher rates at Cerro Verde. 
El Abra mine in Chile is making great progress. We're increasing the stacking rate of material. We're restoring production that we had curtailed during 2020. And we're focused on sustaining the level of production at El Abra in the 200 million, 250 million pound per year range as we look to potentially expand that as we go forward. 
Richard talked about the terrific results at Grasberg. Team there is just continuing to deliver results quarter after quarter. We expect to be at our quarterly run rate for metal beginning here in the fourth quarter. And for the next several quarters, we project the mill will run at about 175,000 tonnes per day until 2023 when we install the new SAG mill, which is currently under construction. And that will support higher rates as we continue to ramp up the Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ and then make room for the Kucing Liar project that Richard mentioned. 
A lot of talk right now about inflation. Our team is really focused on cost management and efficiency projects. We're focused on extending equipment lines, ways to improve our energy efficiency, ways to efficiently implement maintenance practices and really use technology in all of this. We have, like everyone else, experienced some cost increases. Those have really principally been associated with the energy price increases. To a lesser extent, we've had some other impacts on our consumables, the impact of steel prices on some of our consumables. We've had higher sulfuric acid costs, freight costs, but we really want to send appreciation to our global supply chain team. They're doing excellent work in keeping our operations stocked with critical supplies and managing in these uncertain times. And they've just done an outstanding job in keeping our business continuity going. I will note that we have seen very strong prices in molybdenum, and those have more than offset some of these inflationary pressures we've had on the cost side. 
Turning to the smelter. On Slide 17, we provide an update of our activities with the greenfield smelter we're developing in East Java and the work we're doing with our partner at PT Smelting to expand the facility there. We were focused on completing this project as efficiently, as timely as possible. We're advancing the engineering and commercial arrangements, and we've commenced preparing the land for construction. You probably have seen press reports that the President of Indonesia recently visited the site in a groundbreaking ceremony, and it just indicates the significance of this project to the country. We've got a $1 billion bank credit facility in place for PT-FI to use to advance the projects, and we are going to plan additional debt financing for the project, which can be obtained at attractive rates to fund the project long term. 
As we previously discussed, the long-term cost of the financing for the smelter will essentially be offset by a phaseout of the 5% export duty. So the economic impact to PT-FI is not material, and this is a project that is shared 51% by our shareholder -- PT-FI shareholder, MIND ID; and the balance, of FCX. 
Turning to our volumes. And Richard talked about the growth in volumes. We've had great success in execution. We've got our 3-year outlook listed on Slide 18. And this is generally consistent with our previous guidance. We made some relatively minor adjustments to the fourth quarter of 2021, but you'll see here that the execution of our plan is on track. 
We show on Slide 19 the strong cash flow generation of this business. We've got very significant free cash flows using our volume and cost estimates and prices ranging from $4 to $5 copper, holding gold flat at $1,800 and molybdenum at current prices around $19 per pound. The real growth in our volumes with low incremental costs show EBITDA ranging from $12.5 billion per annum on average for 2022 and 2023 at $4 copper and $17 billion at $5 copper, as Richard has mentioned. And operating cash flows, and this is net of tax, ranges from $9 billion to over $12 billion, which provides significant cash flows not only to invest in our business and fund programs, grow our business but also increase capital returns to investors. 
Our capital spending plans are detailed on the next slide, Slide 20. You'll see here that we reduced our outlook for 2021 for capital spending from $2.2 billion previously to 2 point -- $2 billion, and that excludes the smelter investment. But that reflects really timing. We've had really a timing issue in getting these projects going. And so that would just fall -- some of that falling over into 2022. We've also added the -- in our forecast plans to commence development of the Kucing Liar ore body that Richard mentioned previously. So you're talking about $9 billion to $12 billion of operating cash flows and CapEx below $3 billion, very strong free cash flow. 
We've got growing volumes, strong markets, low capital requirements. And that's really allowed us just over the past 12 months to reduce our debt, our net debt, by nearly $6 billion. And so we're down now to $2 billion in net debt. I know some of you remember a time when it was multiples of this. And so we're in a great situation from a balance sheet standpoint. Our credit metrics are extremely strong, and it positions us well as we go forward to invest in future growth and increase our payouts to shareholders. 
The last slide, 22, refers to our financial policy. It is centered around our strong balance sheet. The combination of the strong balance sheet and the success in growing our volumes will put us in a strong position. Our Board had established earlier this year a policy that provides for up to 50% of free cash flow to be used for shareholder returns with the balance available for growth and further balance sheet improvements. We look forward to the achievement of our net debt targets. We look forward to the implementation of this policy. We expect our Board will determine the structure and size of additional payouts to shareholders with our annual results, and this will be something that we update and gets reviewed periodically. 
So that concludes our remarks. We look forward to reporting our progress and continuing to build on our momentum as we go forward. And operator, we'd now like to turn the call over for questions."

Now that you're starting to develop it, I just have 2 questions. First of all, if you could talk about the cadence of the upcoming capital spending over the next 10 years. And then secondly, talk about the primary developmental risk as you see it today. Again, I know it's early days, but you referenced complicated geology, minerology.

But Mark, if you want to give some background about KL, as Richard was saying, this is just a natural progression for us. It gives us really a place to continue to use all -- everything we learned from Deep MLZ and Grasberg Block Cave to extend that to KL.

For instance, our plans now would be that we would apply this hydrofracking technology to it in advance, where with Deep MLZ, we ended up having to play a bit of catch-up. So we've got a much better geotechnical knowledge and how to address that part of the [ risk ]. It does, as Kathleen says, it benefits -- it ties into the GBC development, some of the infrastructure. It shares -- there's common parts of the ore flow system, ventilation, access.  We're driving 3 headings starting very soon. And they all tie off of the development that's either off of the [ Big Dawson ] or off of drifting that goes back to GBC. 
The previous KL reserve had much more complex metallurgy and geology. Over the last couple of years, we changed our mine planning approach. We focused on what turned out to be much higher-value material that was a little bit lower grade, but that the material could be processed through our current mill. So that took away a lot of challenges at the previous KL mine plan. We had to change our flotation circuit. We had much more of the environmental management with pyrite concentrate that would be generated. So this plan, it's about [ 0.9 ] copper, [ 0.9 ] cost per tonne gold. It's -- the tonnes that Richard mentioned are very much driven by this 2041 date that we're working on. And this deposit has a lot of growth, both on the same footprint that we're working out now and at deeper levels. So I feel like this is going to be our chance to take all the lessons learned. We're looking at the potential of applying electrical -- electric mining equipment there. So I think we get a fresh start with a lot of experience that's going to apply itself, and KL is going to benefit from it."

But we don't know yet what the cost of this is going to be. And it's going to be significant. I mean there's just no way around it.

And right now, while people are really making these commitments in good faith, they're doing it at a time -- and we talked about this in our final report of where it's going to rely on technology advances. In some of those things, there's more questions than answers with all that right now. We kind of have a good -- I think we got our arms around converting the coal plant in Indonesia. That's one of our big 2 things. But the question of how do you deal with haulage and electrifying shovels and a lot of shovels are already electric, but just light vehicles and so forth. In our underground mines, we have a big electric train helping us deliver ore, but there are going to be some investments there. So it's going to be an unfolding story. And you raised the point that people following us and the companies in our industry ought to really be tracking because, as we sit here today, there's more questions than answers in that area. 
I'll just make one add-on to that. That's going to be another factor that's going to be a barrier to supply development in the copper business. I mean, low-grade end-of-life mines -- and we've got 30 years or so to have this online, but it's going to affect mine life. It's going to affect the economics of project development.

And when you look at the government's equity position, their 51% share of equity, which we'll step up to that in stages, you look at the high tax rate we have, royalties we pay, if you look at the payments that are made for intercompany transfers, to FCX, government's economic interest in the project exceeds 70%. We were able to retain through the negotiations the interest we had going into it. So this is truly something that all the parties are very happy with. And what a relief it is to be working in Indonesia and not have to deal with the kind of complications we have for so many years."

I've talked with senior government people about it, and our partner, MIND ID, a state-owned company under the auspices of the Minister of State-Owned Enterprises, everybody recognizes the mutual benefits for it. Sure, the government like a bigger interest, but think about the complications of that. Because with an extension, we will want to start -- as Mark said, we've got opportunities with KL and elsewhere to invest, and we'll make those investments in advance of 2041. And so we have to balance out how you share those costs, where we basically have 50% economics of new investments, with what's our interest going to be going forward. So that's early days to be discussed. I tried to raise it earlier, but it was just not possible to get traction on those discussions.

And so we're able to generate higher than the metal price value from molybdenum by processing it as a chemical product. And we run this thing as a business. It obviously ebbs and flows with the price of molybdenum. Today's price look out 3 or 4 years and a lot of cash coming out of that business. But it's strategically important to us. We just got a great team. It's a global team. They work together very well. Colorado is a state where you've got -- all states are -- but you got to be very careful about environmental management.

Chile, Chile is separate from Peru, and it's got a really a lot of questions about it right now. It's driven by this widespread feeling within the country of people -- as people are having around the world dealing with income inequalities and social programs versus other government initiatives and so forth. And it's got a complicated election coming up. There's no clear-cut front-runner right now. There's processes going on within the parliament, within issues related to consideration of constitutional changes. And so it's really, from my perspective, muddy waters there.
It's not currently nearly as significant as Peru in terms of El Abra's production as a small part of our production, but it is affecting our consideration of expansion. But we're working with the industry. We're not at the top of the charts in terms of production there, so we're working with others on it. 
In Peru, Peru always consistently has complicated presidential politics. And we've seen the story before where a left-leaning candidate gets into office and runs on platforms that are very much addressing getting more money out of mining companies. And President Castillo ran on that platform. He had the backing of the far left-leaning parties there. I got to meet him within this past month. He came to Washington. It was the Sunday before you, [ Emily ], and with a small group of mining executives, had dinner with him. My first time to meet him. He comes from a nonpolitical, nonpolitical leader background. He was a teacher in the interior Peru. And when we talked with us that night, he was -- I found him to be very compelling in his emotional feelings about doing more to help the people from the region where he came from, but also throughout Peru, the poor people in terms of education and so forth. 
And I didn't know what to expect when I went there. I had a better feeling than I had going into it. He listened, had the chance to have exchanges about different issues. We did not get into -- none of us got into details about specific fiscal proposals and so forth, but he emphasized that he recognized the importance that mining plays in Peru. And that's what always happens when people get in office to achieve social programs, they see how much mining contributes to the country financially and that's needed to do other things. 
So I'm having a lot of conversations with other CEOs of countries that operate in Peru. After that meeting, he revamped his cabinet at the very outset of his administration and replaced a very aggressive guy that was Prime Minister. And so it's a really wait-and-see thing. But I'm more encouraged about it. We're working with others in the industry. We need to be responsive to his concerns. And that's what I'm trying to -- we focus all of our -- almost all of our community programs in the regions where we operate. I think we've got to take a broader view and show people in the interior that mining can help their lives. 
And so that's what I'm working on right now. And so I am more optimistic now than I was during the election. You'll hear different views by different miners there. People are very concerned, rightly so. Our situation is we have a new stability agreement. We're maximizing the operations at Cerro Verde. It's a big producer, a major contributor to our volumes. It's got the world's largest mine site concentrate facilities. We have great relationships with the local community. So we want to build off that and try to reach out and find some common ground to work for President Castillo, but it's uncertain. 
Man, what about the U.S.? What can you say? I mean it's just a head scratcher about what the hell is going on in Washington these days. And the current administration, I think, recognizes the importance of minerals like copper to achieve their goals of climate change. And yet, I don't expect them to lessen up any requirements for permitting environmental management community issues because that just runs against the grain of their political situation. So it's really uncertain. We're all hopeful we'll see some steps towards infrastructure building. The country really needs it. You see it in ports and roads and bridges all over the country, but I just don't have any comment on the political situation other than be distressed about it. And we also need to have a more thoughtful approach to relationships with China in this country. And that's a bipartisan issue, and it's a complicated one. But China is going to be an important part of our world going forward. I mean the country is too big and people are very smart. They work hard, and they create a lot of economic velocity. 
So anyway, I'm focused on staying out of politics and focused on Freeport."
