First, I'd like to begin our call by again thanking the Regency team. It's hard to believe that almost a year has passed since this pandemic started to meaningfully impact our daily lives. Collectively and individually, we are presented with challenges, and we continue to be that I don't think any of us could have ever imagined. And in the face of that, I'm so proud of how our team has navigated this very different environment with a revised and even more demanding set of expectations.
We have worked harder than ever during this time to serve our tenants our customers, our communities and our shareholders. And while Regency does enjoy the advantages of our size, scale and national presence. It's the people in our 22 offices across the country, that have been the keys to our resiliency. Our local presence provides us close proximity to our properties, which enables us to act small and to take a personalized relationship-driven approach with our tenants. So once again, thank you all.
In the fourth quarter, despite a rise in cases in most markets and increased restrictions in sum, we have been encouraged by continued improvement in our operating results. And this is driven by further meaningful progress on rent collections. The hardest hit categories, however, especially in the more restricted markets are still lagging. Many entertainment, fitness, sit-down restaurants and personal service tenants are still either not allowed to open or are operating with severe capacity restrictions. This has had the greatest impact on our local small shop operators. But even in these categories and markets, we've still seen improvement in collection rates compared to where we were 3 months ago.
We also remain encouraged by momentum in our leasing efforts as execution volumes picked up in the fourth quarter, and our pipelines continue to grow. This is a testament not only to a greater willingness among tenants to do new deals, but also to the strength of our locations, our tenant relationships and our experience team. So despite the setback we saw in the health prices in certain markets in the fourth quarter, Regency still moved forward. And we see green shoots as well. The vaccines helped to at least provide some light at the end of the tunnel, an additional federal stimulus could help to support our local tenants and consumers at the margin. The worst of the restrictions are hopefully behind us, [ not the ] wood, as we've seen some of the most restrictive states like California start to ease up a bit. But with that said, we still have reasons to be cautious, given the meaningful uncertainty that while many businesses may technically be open, the inability to operate at full capacity can be a major obstacle. The vaccines are definitely a positive, but distribution will take time. And the presence of additional variance is certainly a wildcard. The ultimate impact of this on the consumer and, in turn, the resulting impact on tenant fallout remains unknown. And our 2021 outlook reflects that uncertainty. In fact, we've chosen to use a scenario approach rather than a traditional guidance framework, and Mike will discuss that in more detail in just a bit.
In light of the current environment, we firmly believe that being careful and transparent as we always are, is the most prudent approach to setting expectations. While we do have a greater sense of optimism, and that is inherent in our continued improvement scenario, it is still too early in the year to eliminate our reverse-course scenario. As we do move through the year, we will have a lot more clarity and visibility, and we will refine our expectations accordingly.
Today, our team in the field continues to aggressively but thoughtfully pursue recovery of cash flows. As I've discussed previously, we've taken a targeted strategic approach with our tenants throughout the pandemic, especially for our local tenants. Waiting until they're able to reopen and then working with them on a plan for the future. We believe that this approach will help to ensure the long-term success of our tenants, which should, in turn, put Regency in the best position for recovery. The quality and locations of our assets have allowed us to choose our tenants over time to fill our portfolio with great operators. We've already vetted these merchants, and we still want most of them in our centers when this is all over. At the same time, we're not afraid to get space back. We have great space, and we will release it. This is what we do, and we do it really well. But in many cases, when factoring in the economics of retenanting, making this conscious decision to work through it with a proven business operator is often the wisest choice. We always have to keep in perspective that these are people just like us that we're working with.
And importantly, I also want to reemphasize the strength of our balance sheet. This has provided us with the financial flexibility to maintain our quarterly dividend throughout the pandemic, which we are really proud of, given our long-term commitment to driving total shareholder returns. It has also enabled us to continue committing capital to new investments as well as in operating and maintaining our existing centers. While we know that we still have a long road ahead of us, the substantial progress that we've made to recovery thus far really has provided renewed energy among our team members.
As I reflect back on the last year, my confidence in the longer-term trajectory for Regency is only solidified, we are on the right side of a structural growth trend in strong suburban markets. Our high-quality, well-located, geographically diverse portfolio of grocery-anchored open-air centers is well positioned to continue serving the essential needs of our communities. Jim?"

Our people have worked tirelessly over the last year to maintain lines of communication with our tenants. We are doing everything we can to enable them to open and operate safely and successfully. I'm proud of what we've accomplished during a very tough year and of how far we've come since last spring.
As of the end of January, the vast majority of our tenants are open and operating, and that hasn't changed much from a quarter ago. But a subset of our tenants are still operating under government-mandated capacity restrictions and those restrictions increased in certain categories and markets during the fourth quarter given the rise in COVID cases. Despite this, our cash collections continue to show improvement, reaching 92% in the fourth quarter and 89% in January as of Monday. We're still receiving rent payments for January, and the collection trajectory is tracking in line with prior months. In fact, as of today, it's already up to 90%.
Even in our West Coast markets, despite the greater restrictions during the fourth quarter, we still improved our collection rates from a quarter ago. They still meaningfully lag our other regions, but we are encouraged that California appears to be easing some of these restrictions, which should help narrow that gap. As we've seen in markets that are more open and less restrictive, consumers have returned to engaging with our retailers. This is encouraging and is an opportunity for continued improvement.
Lisa discussed our strategic approach with our tenants, and we've designed deferral plans that are realistic. We expect the majority of our deferred rent to be collected in 2021. Beyond those with deferral agreements, tenants are still uncollected, generally fall into 3 categories: there are those we believe in, but are still waiting to engage, predominantly in the West Coast markets operating under closure or capacity restrictions. There are those we are aggressively pursuing for rent. And there are those we are struggling pre-pandemic that we see as closure risk.
We continue to see impact from tenant fallout in the fourth quarter and expect 2021 will likely remain challenged from a tenant fallout perspective. The seasonal dip that we typically see in the first quarter could be more meaningful as a result. Elevated tenant failures are factored into our guidance with the uncertainty around move-outs contributing to the wider range.
I want to provide some added color on our leasing activity in the fourth quarter. We are encouraged by the strength in our leasing volumes, which had continued to show improvement throughout the year. The demand is real, and the retailers are active. We are seeing the greatest new leasing activity in the markets that are more open with the lease restriction. Our future deal pipeline is also strong with categories, including grocery, off-price, banks, medical, auto parts and service users, but also and most encouragingly, fitness and restaurants. So where our tenants can operate, leasing feels closer to normal.
Total rent growth for the quarter was slightly positive, weighed down by renewal activity. For our renewal deals, volumes have remained consistent throughout the pandemic. But in the fourth quarter, we did see some pressure on our renewal leasing spreads. 1/3 of our renewal leases signed during the quarter averaged 18 months in duration. And these deals had negative spreads averaging more than 5%. Our longer-term renewal deals had positive spreads of over 2%. Some of the short-term deals are rent relief negotiations with tenant and bankruptcy, as well as others that have been significantly impacted by the pandemic. And those deals primarily consist of shop tenants because, conversely, we saw positive spreads of nearly 7% for anchor renewal deals in the quarter.
Importantly, our teams are managing this space in the right way. We're being thoughtful when making leasing decisions with an eye towards the longer term. We believe that rents for much of this space will rightsize at higher levels post-pandemic and by signing shorter-term deals, we'll have another bite at the apple in the near future.
To sum up, we remain impressed by the resiliency and creativity of our tenants in this environment and the willingness of consumers to adapt to the new normal and reengage with our merchants. Most importantly, we are encouraged by the improving operating trends as we continue to see a flight to quality and believe our portfolio is well positioned to benefit from this. Mac?"

Throughout 2020, we performed an in-depth review of our in process development and redevelopment projects as well as our extensive future pipeline of value-add opportunities. This evaluation included potential impacts to scope, timing, tenancy and return on investment in order to determine the best direction for each project to align with our long-term growth objectives. Following this process, which we've largely completed, we made the decision not to pursue certain projects or components of projects as they no longer meet our return thresholds. As a result, we wrote off development pursuit costs above our historic average in the fourth quarter. The largest write-off was at Serramonte Center as we reduced our scope. Though the broader multiphase project is proceeding forward, and we added it back into the in-process pipeline in the fourth quarter. This roughly $55 million project will include several stand-alone restaurant pads, a new hotel in a ground lease, the completion of the mall interior renovation and the re-leasing of the former JCPenney Box.
While we have trimmed some of our activity due to COVID, we continue to maintain a healthy pipeline of value add projects. And in fact, this process has given us new confidence in the $300 million of developments and redevelopments in process at the end of 2020. In addition to restarting construction Serramonte, we also commenced construction on a ground-up public anchor development in the Jacksonville market.
In the fourth quarter, successfully completed the village at Hunters Lake, a sprouts anchor development in Tampa, Florida that opened at 100% leased in the middle of a pandemic. Hunters is generating an 8% return on our $21 million investment. We continue to invest in our other large scale, high-value redevelopment projects that we expect to start in the near term. For example, entitlements are finalized at Westbard Square in Bethesda, Maryland, and we plan to commence with the first phase in 2021. We remain confident in the long-term value creation opportunities available in our pipeline.
Moving to dispositions. During the fourth quarter, we sold 5 shopping centers for a combined gross sales price of nearly $78 million, bringing our total dispositions for 2020 to $191 million and a 5.7% cap rate. Additionally, we sold over $18 million of non-income-producing land and out parcels in 2020. Our disposition activity is consistent with our strategy to opportunistically sell nonstrategic low-growth assets to improve portfolio quality and maintain balance sheet strength. For 2021, we anticipate dispositions of approximately $150 million at an average cap rate of 5.5% to 6%. This includes the sale of 2 assets that closed subsequent to year-end. We look forward to providing updates throughout 2021 on the progress of our development projects and our disposition plans. Mike?"

I appreciate you joining us on what we know has been a very busy week. I'll start by addressing fourth quarter results and our balance sheet position before moving to our framework for helping everyone understand what this new Year may bring. Fourth quarter NAREIT FFO of $0.76 per share includes a few onetime charges that were communicated several weeks ago and were detailed again in our release last night. These charges are in addition to a write-off of straight-line rent receivables of nearly $8 million or $0.04 per share and uncollectible lease income of approximately $18 million or $0.10 per share recognized in the fourth quarter.
Uncollectible lease income remains the primary driver of the decline in same-property NOI in the quarter. As evidenced by the additional straight-line rent write-off in the fourth quarter, we did move some additional tenants to cash basis accounting. This was predominantly the result of increased levels of operating restrictions imposed late last year. And this bucket of tenants was concentrated in our West Coast markets, as well as across the more impacted tenant categories, including restaurants, personal service providers and fitness operators. However, at the same time, we continue to see improved collections in our cash basis tenant pool. This is clearly a gratifying trend. In the fourth quarter, we recognized revenue equating to 94% of our pro rata billings. That is up from 90% in the first -- in the third quarter and 86% in the second. We ask that you refer to our updated COVID-19 disclosures in the fourth quarter supplemental, which provide a reconciliation to pro rata billings.
Just a few comments on our balance sheet, where we remain extremely well positioned. Shortly after year-end, we repaid our $265 million term loan, which we indicated we would do if positive trends continued, which they have. With this move, we have completely redeployed the proceeds from our bond issuance last May, and you'll notice this impact in our guidance for interest expense. With ample access to low-cost debt capital, we no longer feel the need to maintain an outsized cash balance out of an abundance of caution, which was dilutive to our earnings in 2020. We now have no significant debt maturities until 2024. In addition, earlier this week, we closed on the recast of our $1.25 billion revolving credit facility through which we have full availability at terms and pricing consistent with pretty coded levels. We are very proud of this execution, reflecting the continued strong support of our lenders in this challenging environment.
Turning to 2021. We provided an initial NAREIT FFO range of $2.96 to $3.14 per share, a much wider range than we've historically offered, reflecting continued uncertainty. We encourage you to refer to our guidance disclosure in our press release and on Page 34 of the supplemental as well as our guidance roll forward on Page 18 of our earnings slide deck. The roll forward should prove to be especially helpful.
As you would expect, the widest per share variance is in our projection for net operating income. Given that much more of our NOI is potentially variable amid the uncertainty that remains in the environment, especially as it relates to uncollectible lease income and potential move out activity. We believe a wide range is prudent. We also feel that it's important for us to communicate a framework for how we are thinking about the different scenarios that could play out this year and what our earnings could like -- look like under those scenarios? So different from past years, our initial 2021 guidance is not driven off of simple deviations from a base-case scenario. Instead, the low end of today's range is representative of what we think our results could look like under a set of circumstances that is distinctly different from the assumptions supporting the high end of the range. Each of these guideposts represent a unique set of potential outcomes. We actually thought about not even calling it guidance. And instead calling a scenario analysis. Because for now, and until we have a bit more clarity on the impacts of the evolving pandemic, this is how we are thinking about this framework internally. From a big picture perspective, the low end, what we call our reverse course scenario is an environment in which the U.S. experiences elevated infection rates and in turn, sees more shutdowns and increased restrictions. In this scenario, we could potentially backtrack on rent collections and full year 2021 could look a lot more like 2020. Under this scenario, we see same-property NOI declining another 100 basis points year-over-year in 2021.
The midpoint of our range represents a status quo scenario where 2021 reflects a continuation of our fourth quarter results. This scenario -- in this scenario, same-property NOI growth is slightly positive year-over-year despite the tougher comp in the first quarter. The high end represents what we've named our continued improvement scenario. This is an environment with continued progress in vaccine rollout, further listing the state and local mandated restrictions on operators and added federal stimulus that helps support local businesses and consumers. Under this scenario, we would experience a positive trajectory from Q4 results as we continue to increase rent paying occupancy as we have through the back half of 2020. In this scenario, same-property NOI growth could increase by up to 250 basis points year-over-year in 2021. We recognize the challenge that such a wide range of outcomes presents, but at this point in time, there is simply too much uncertainty to rule out the downside. At the same time, we also appreciate how difficult it can be to develop expectations without the benefit of the company's outlook.
We sincerely hope that this approach and added transparency is helpful in allowing the market to consider its own views of where we stand in the pandemic and then apply those assumptions to our scenarios. We also expect that with another quarter under our belts, added clarity will allow us to refine our scenarios and tighten our expectations.
I'll touch on a couple of the major drivers of the earnings changes in 2021, using the midpoint scenario as referenced. But we've given a lot of detail on the roll forward, and much of it speaks for itself. One item to note is lease termination income. This is net of expenses, and first quarter 2021 will be impacted by a onetime lease termination expense of close to $2 million associated with the buyout of an anchor lease at Pleasanton Plaza. And secondly, we expect higher net G&A in 2021 and assuming hiring activity and business travel starts to return to more normal levels this year.
As I spoke about on the last call, we are no longer assuming as much of an offset from development overhead capitalization as we had in 2019, given the delays and changes in our pipelines. In closing, we are very much encouraged by the progress that we've made and by where we stand today. But if there's anything we've learned in the last year, aside from confirming how critically important it is to maintain a fortress balance sheet to help quickly and materially, things can change. As such, we remain careful with our expectations.
With that, we'd be happy to take your questions."

The Pacific Coast or our West Coast portfolio, although we have improved our collection rate there, the pace of that improvement from -- it has not been as great. And there's a little bit of a sticky, small shop, restaurant, nonessential categories that continue to just have a hard time performing.

We did take our time to go through our projects, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks,  [ really ] to the caused us to cease moving forward on a couple of projects. One was a project that we had under contract. And unfortunately, with the pandemic the leasing did evolve as we thought, and we dropped the contract. So we had to write-off some pursuit costs, typical A&E type cost, as you can imagine. But in the larger context of looking at our pipeline, really, the biggest impact is time. Some of these projects have taken us longer to put together. I'll give you an example of that. Town & Country is a project that's been in our pipeline. That project has been delayed by about a year. We've had trouble getting our EIR released by the city of Los Angeles because they're impacted by COVID. Just who happens this actual week, it was finally released. So it's taken us some time. The scope of the project really is very similar to how we planned it, but we've had to push it out a year for that reason alone. But when we look at our other projects, they're in locations that we very much believe in. We really believe in the scope. Of course, we're going to challenge ourselves to make sure that what we're proposing is still relevant in a post-COVID world. So I would say we've made some minor changes to them, but not significant wholesale changes to them. Because these projects were pretty conservatively scope to begin with. So we need to make sure we have the right amount of shops, convenience, parking, outdoor dining and not -- the right amount of non-retail uses in those cases where we have it. And we believe that, that's still the case. So is it was very important for us to do that early into pandemic. We were in a more of a capital preservation mode. Now other things look more clear. We are getting ourselves prepared to start some of these projects, including our Bethesda project, which has now been entitled, and I'll give you one more. Our Costa Verde project, which we've been working on for many years, was finally entitled. They got approved in December without any appeal period, and that probably took an extra year longer than what we thought. But we've made some really good progress and gives us a lot of confidence going forward to get these projects started when all the little ingredients come together. But the big ingredients are there."

What we need -- what I'd ask everyone to do is really kind of break down G&A by years and then let's talk about it gross in that. So first, I think it's important to go back to 2019, walk through '20 and then into '20 and what you'll see is that the top line gross revenues, '19 to '20, came down. In the pandemic, there were material savings to the company. Those savings came in the form of T&E, reduced travel expenditures across our entire platform, conference attendance, so on and so forth. We also benefited -- I guess, we benefited from a financial perspective by having fewer receipts filled as it was more challenging to hire in that type of environment. And then varial compensation, other compensation all went in line with that. So -- but what's happened in '20 is those savings have been masked or covered up by our development overhead capitalization. And I spoke about this last quarter probably my fall probably should have spent a little bit more time on it. That change in our development pipeline that Mac just articulated, did result in changes to our overhead capitalization as a result. Those changes are masking the savings in '20. So now fast forward to '21 and in our guidance range, what you're seeing there is a return on the top line, so those savings in '20 should the economy continue to reopen as we hope and suspect it will in a status quo continued improvement scenario, you'll see those savings start to reverse, and that will put pressure on the top line. And then overhead capitalization, however, will take longer to recover with the development pipeline, that is a longer lead time. We have the same phenomenon occur with us in the GSC coming out of that downturn as well. Last point on G&A on the top line. Then if you come back and just think about top line gross G&A, '19 versus '21, it's essentially the same. '21, slightly higher, and that's because we are spending a little bit more money on third-party legal as we work through our tenant negotiations. This is more activity than we've ever had to do in a year. But I think it's good to see that, that top line is relatively consistent."

First, I'd like to begin our call by again thanking the Regency team. It's hard to believe that almost a year has passed since this pandemic started to meaningfully impact our daily lives. Collectively and individually, we are presented with challenges, and we continue to be that I don't think any of us could have ever imagined. And in the face of that, I'm so proud of how our team has navigated this very different environment with a revised and even more demanding set of expectations. 
We have worked harder than ever during this time to serve our tenants our customers, our communities and our shareholders. And while Regency does enjoy the advantages of our size, scale and national presence, it's the people in our 22 offices across the country, that have been the keys to our resiliency. Our local presence provides us close proximity to our properties, which enables us to act small and to take a personalized relationship-driven approach with our tenants. So once again, thank you all. 
In the fourth quarter, despite a rise in cases in most markets and increased restrictions in some, we have been encouraged by continued improvement in our operating results. And this is driven by further meaningful progress on rent collections. The hardest hit categories, however, especially in the more restricted markets are still lagging. Many entertainment, fitness, sit-down restaurants and personal service tenants are still either not allowed to open or are operating with severe capacity restrictions. This has had the greatest impact on our local small shop operators. But even in these categories and markets, we've still seen improvement in collection rates compared to where we were 3 months ago. 
We also remain encouraged by momentum in our leasing efforts as execution volumes picked up in the fourth quarter, and our pipelines continue to grow. This is a testament not only to a greater willingness among tenants to do new deals, but also to the strength of our locations, our tenant relationships and our experience team. 
So despite the setback we saw in the health crisis in certain markets in the fourth quarter, Regency still moved forward. And we see green shoots as well. The vaccines helped to at least provide some light at the end of the tunnel, an additional federal stimulus could help to support our local tenants and consumers at the margin. 
The worst of the restrictions are hopefully behind us, knock on wood, as we've seen some of the most restrictive states like California start to ease up a bit. But with that said, we still have reasons to be cautious, given the meaningful uncertainty that remains. While many businesses may technically be open, the inability to operate at full capacity can be a major obstacle. The vaccines are definitely a positive, but distribution will take time. And the presence of additional variance is certainly a wildcard. The ultimate impact of this on the consumer and, in turn, the resulting impact on tenant fallout remains unknown. And our 2021 outlook reflects that uncertainty. In fact, we've chosen to use a scenario approach rather than a traditional guidance framework, and Mike will discuss that in more detail in just a bit. 
In light of the current environment, we firmly believe that being careful and transparent as we always are, is the most prudent approach to setting expectations. While we do have a greater sense of optimism, and that is inherent in our continued improvement scenario, it is still too early in the year to eliminate our reverse-course scenario. As we do move through the year, we will have a lot more clarity and visibility, and we will refine our expectations accordingly. 
Today, our team in the field continues to aggressively but thoughtfully pursue recovery of cash flows. As I've discussed previously, we've taken a targeted strategic approach with our tenants throughout the pandemic, especially for our local tenants. Waiting until they're able to reopen and then working with them on a plan for the future. We believe that this approach will help to ensure the long-term success of our tenants, which should, in turn, put Regency in the best position for recovery. 
The quality and locations of our assets have allowed us to choose our tenants over time to fill our portfolio with great operators. We've already vetted these merchants, and we still want most of them in our centers when this is all over. 
At the same time, we're not afraid to get space back. We have great space, and we will release it. This is what we do, and we do it really well. But in many cases, when factoring in the economics of re-tenanting, making this conscious decision to work through it with a proven business operator is often the wisest choice. We always have to keep in perspective that these are people just like us that we're working with.  
And importantly, I also want to reemphasize the strength of our balance sheet. This has provided us with the financial flexibility to maintain our quarterly dividend throughout the pandemic, which we are really proud of, given our long-term commitment to driving total shareholder returns. It has also enabled us to continue committing capital to new investments as well as in operating and maintaining our existing centers. While we know that we still have a long road ahead of us, the substantial progress that we've made to recovery thus far really has provided renewed energy among our team members.  
As I reflect back on the last year, my confidence in the longer-term trajectory for Regency has only solidified. We are on the right side of a structural growth trend in strong suburban markets. Our high-quality, well-located, geographically diverse portfolio of grocery-anchored open-air centers is well positioned to continue serving the essential needs of our communities. Jim?"

Our people have worked tirelessly over the last year to maintain lines of communication with our tenants. We are doing everything we can to enable them to open and operate safely and successfully. I'm proud of what we've accomplished during a very tough year and of how far we've come since last spring.  
As of the end of January, the vast majority of our tenants are open and operating, and that hasn't changed much from a quarter ago. But a subset of our tenants are still operating under government-mandated capacity restrictions and those restrictions increased in certain categories and markets during the fourth quarter given the rise in COVID cases. Despite this, our cash collections continued to show improvement, reaching 92% in the fourth quarter and 89% in January as of Monday. We're still receiving rent payments for January, and the collection trajectory is tracking in line with prior months. In fact, as of today, it's already up to 90%.  
Even in our West Coast markets, despite the greater restrictions during the fourth quarter, we still improved our collection rates from a quarter ago. They still meaningfully lag our other regions, but we are encouraged that California appears to be easing some of these restrictions, which should help narrow that gap. As we've seen in markets that are more open and less restrictive, consumers have returned to engaging with our retailers. This is encouraging and is an opportunity for continued improvement.  
Lisa discussed our strategic approach with our tenants, and we've designed deferral plans that are realistic. We expect the majority of our deferred rent to be collected in 2021. Beyond those with deferral agreements, tenants that are still uncollected generally fall into 3 categories: there are those we believe in, but are still waiting to engage, predominantly in the West Coast markets operating under closure or capacity restrictions; there are those we are aggressively pursuing for rent; and there are those who were struggling pre-pandemic that we see as closure risk.  
We continued to see impact from tenant fallout in the fourth quarter and expect 2021 will likely remain challenged from a tenant fallout perspective. The seasonal dip that we typically see in the first quarter could be more meaningful as a result. Elevated tenant failures are factored into our guidance with the uncertainty around move-outs contributing to the wider range.  
I want to provide some added color on our leasing activity in the fourth quarter. We are encouraged by the strength in our leasing volumes, which had continued to show improvement throughout the year. The demand is real, and the retailers are active. We are seeing the greatest new leasing activity in the markets that are more open with the least restriction. Our future deal pipeline is also strong with categories, including grocery, off-price, banks, medical, auto parts and service users, but also and most encouragingly, fitness and restaurants. So where our tenants can operate, leasing feels closer to normal.  
Total rent growth for the quarter was slightly positive, weighed down by renewal activity. For our renewal deals, volumes have remained consistent throughout the pandemic. But in the fourth quarter, we did see some pressure on our renewal leasing spreads. 1/3 of our renewal leases signed during the quarter averaged 18 months in duration. And these deals had negative spreads averaging more than 5%. 
Our longer-term renewal deals had positive spreads of over 2%. Some of the short-term deals are rent relief negotiations with tenant and bankruptcy, as well as others that have been significantly impacted by the pandemic. And those deals primarily consist of shop tenants because, conversely, we saw positive spreads of nearly 7% for anchor renewal deals in the quarter.  
Importantly, our teams are managing this space in the right way. We're being thoughtful when making leasing decisions with an eye towards the longer term. We believe that rents for much of this space will rightsize at higher levels post-pandemic and by signing shorter-term deals, we'll have another bite at the apple in the near future.  
To sum up, we remain impressed by the resiliency and creativity of our tenants in this environment and the willingness of consumers to adapt to the new normal and reengage with our merchants. Most importantly, we are encouraged by the improving operating trends as we continue to see a flight to quality and believe our portfolio is well positioned to benefit from this. Mac?"

Throughout 2020, we performed an in-depth review of our in process development and redevelopment projects as well as our extensive future pipeline of value-add opportunities. This evaluation included potential impacts to scope, timing, tenancy and return on investment in order to determine the best direction for each project to align with our long-term growth objectives. 
Following this process, which we've largely completed, we made the decision not to pursue certain projects or components of projects as they no longer meet our return thresholds. As a result, we wrote off development pursuit costs above our historic average in the fourth quarter. The largest write-off was at Serramonte Center as we reduced our scope. Though the broader multiphase project is proceeding forward, and we added it back into the in-process pipeline in the fourth quarter. This roughly $55 million project will include several stand-alone restaurant pads, a new hotel in a ground lease, the completion of the mall interior renovation and the re-leasing of the former JCPenney box. 
While we have trimmed some of our activity due to COVID, we continue to maintain a healthy pipeline of value add projects. And in fact, this process has given us renewed confidence in the $300 million of developments and redevelopments in process at the end of 2020. In addition to restarting construction at Serramonte, we also commenced construction on a ground-up publics anchor development in the Jacksonville market. 
In the fourth quarter, successfully completed The Village at Hunter's Lake, a Sprouts anchor development in Tampa, Florida that opened at 100% leased in the middle of a pandemic. Hunter's is generating an 8% return on our $21 million investment. We continue to invest in our other large scale, high-value redevelopment projects that we expect to start in the near term. For example, entitlements are finalized at Westbard Square in Bethesda, Maryland, and we plan to commence with the first phase in 2021. We remain confident in the long-term value creation opportunities available in our pipeline.  
Moving to dispositions. During the fourth quarter, we sold 5 shopping centers for a combined gross sales price of nearly $78 million, bringing our total dispositions for 2020 to $191 million and a 5.7% cap rate. Additionally, we sold over $18 million of non-income-producing land and out parcels in 2020. Our disposition activity is consistent with our strategy to opportunistically sell nonstrategic low-growth assets to improve portfolio quality and maintain balance sheet strength. 
For 2021, we anticipate dispositions of approximately $150 million at an average cap rate of 5.5% to 6%. This includes the sale of 2 assets that closed subsequent to year-end. We look forward to providing updates throughout 2021 on the progress of our development projects and our disposition plans. Mike?"

I appreciate you joining us on what we know has been a very busy week. I'll start by addressing fourth quarter results and our balance sheet position before moving to our framework for helping everyone understand what this new year may bring. 
Fourth quarter NAREIT FFO of $0.76 per share includes a few onetime charges that were communicated several weeks ago and were detailed again in our release last night. These charges are in addition to a write-off of straight-line rent receivables of nearly $8 million or $0.04 per share and uncollectible lease income of approximately $18 million or $0.10 per share recognized in the fourth quarter. Uncollectible lease income remains the primary driver of the decline in same-property NOI in the quarter. 
As evidenced by the additional straight-line rent write-off in the fourth quarter, we did move some additional tenants to cash basis accounting. This was predominantly the result of increased levels of operating restrictions imposed late last year and this bucket of tenants was concentrated in our West Coast markets, as well as across the more impacted tenant categories, including restaurants, personal service providers and fitness operators. However, at the same time, we continue to see improved collections in our cash basis tenant pool. This is clearly a gratifying trend. 
In the fourth quarter, we recognized revenue equating to 94% of our pro rata billings. That is up from 90% in the first -- in the third quarter and 86% in the second. We ask that you refer to our updated COVID-19 disclosures in the fourth quarter supplemental, which provide a reconciliation to pro rata billings.  
Just a few comments on our balance sheet, where we remain extremely well positioned. Shortly after year-end, we repaid our $265 million term loan, which we indicated we would do if positive trends continued, which they have. With this move, we have completely redeployed the proceeds from our bond issuance last May, and you'll notice this impact in our guidance for interest expense. With ample access to low-cost debt capital, we no longer feel the need to maintain an outsized cash balance out of an abundance of caution, which was dilutive to our earnings in 2020. We now have no significant debt maturities until 2024.
In addition, earlier this week, we closed on the recast of our $1.25 billion revolving credit facility through which we have full availability at terms and pricing consistent with pre-COVID levels. We are very proud of this execution, reflecting the continued strong support of our lenders in this challenging environment.  
Turning to 2021. We provided an initial NAREIT FFO range of $2.96 to $3.14 per share, a much wider range than we've historically offered, reflecting continued uncertainty. We encourage you to refer to our guidance disclosure in our press release and on Page 34 of the supplemental as well as our guidance roll forward on Page 18 of our earnings slide deck. The roll forward should prove to be especially helpful.
As you would expect, the widest per share variance is in our projection for net operating income. Given that much more of our NOI is potentially variable amid the uncertainty that remains in the environment, especially as it relates to uncollectible lease income and potential move out activity. We believe a wide range is prudent. We also feel that it's important for us to communicate a framework for how we are thinking about the different scenarios that could play out this year and what our earnings could look like under those scenarios. 
So different from past years, our initial 2021 guidance is not driven off of simple deviations from a base-case scenario. Instead, the low end of today's range is representative of what we think our results could look like under a set of circumstances that is distinctly different from the assumptions supporting the high end of the range. Each of these guideposts represent a unique set of potential outcomes. We actually thought about not even calling it guidance. And instead calling it scenario analysis. Because for now, and until we have a bit more clarity on the impacts of the evolving pandemic, this is how we are thinking about this framework internally. 
From a big picture perspective, the low end, what we call our reverse course scenario, is an environment in which the U.S. experiences elevated infection rates and in turn, sees more shutdowns and increased restrictions. In this scenario, we could potentially backtrack on rent collections and full year 2021 could look a lot more like 2020. Under this scenario, we see same-property NOI declining another 100 basis points year-over-year in 2021.
The midpoint of our range represents a status quo scenario where 2021 reflects a continuation of our fourth quarter results. This scenario -- in this scenario, same-property NOI growth is slightly positive year-over-year despite the tougher comp in the first quarter. The high end represents what we've named our continued improvement scenario. This is an environment with continued progress in vaccine rollout, further listing a state and local mandated restrictions on operators and added federal stimulus that helps support local businesses and consumers. 
Under this scenario, we would experience a positive trajectory from Q4 results as we continue to increase rent paying occupancy as we have through the back half of 2020. In this scenario, same-property NOI growth could increase by up to 250 basis points year-over-year in 2021. We recognize the challenge that such a wide range of outcomes presents, but at this point in time, there is simply too much uncertainty to rule out the downside. At the same time, we also appreciate how difficult it can be to develop expectations without the benefit of a company's outlook.  
We sincerely hope that this approach and added transparency is helpful in allowing the market to consider its own views of where we stand in the pandemic and then apply those assumptions to our scenarios. We also expect that with another quarter under our belts, added clarity will allow us to refine our scenarios and tighten our expectations.  
I'll touch on a couple of the major drivers of the earnings changes in 2021, using the midpoint scenario as referenced. But we've given a lot of detail on the roll forward, and much of it speaks for itself. One item to note is lease termination income. This is net of expenses, and first quarter 2021 will be impacted by a onetime lease termination expense of close to $2 million associated with the buyout of an anchor lease at Pleasanton Plaza. And secondly, we expect higher net G&A in 2021, assuming hiring activity and business travel starts to return to more normal levels this year.
As I spoke about on the last call, we are no longer assuming as much of an offset from development overhead capitalization as we had in 2019, given the delays and changes in our pipelines. In closing, we are very much encouraged by the progress that we've made and by where we stand today. But if there's anything we've learned in the last year, aside from confirming how critically important it is to maintain a fortress balance sheet, just how quickly and materially things can change. As such, we remain careful with our expectations.  
With that, we'd be happy to take your questions."

The Pacific Coast or our West Coast portfolio, although we have improved our collection rate there, the pace of that improvement from -- it has not been as great. And there's a little bit of a sticky, small shop, restaurant, nonessential categories that continue to just have a hard time performing.

We're not seeing wholesale change on term negotiation or big divergence on historical rents and those kind of things. I think the folks that have done well and are doing well, are continuing to try to grow their business as there's opportunity in the marketplace today. They're going to take advantage of that. 
We're seeing tenants that are more local in nature. They are finding opportunity in this environment to relocate and fortunately, we are seeing and being the beneficiary of some of that relocation within a marketplace. Under the scenarios, I think the scenarios would be probably more on the low end, the reversal end would be more of the wait and see kind of attitude. Things got shut down, you're going to have more of that, I'm not sure what the future looks like, so I'm not sure I can commit. So you're going to be in that no man's land, where we, quite frankly, we're at some of our categories in California are no man's land. 
And our program has been once we can see light at the end of the tunnel, then we engage and we structure programs that are win-wins for our retailer and for us. So I think that would be the -- probably the biggest change is if we go backwards, it will probably stymie some of those categories that have been, again, the most impacted today."

If you kind of think about where we are at Q4, which again is, I think, is important to growing those sales. And if you were to look through uncollectible lease income and just think about it as effective rent paying occupancy, which is what we talk a lot about internally, we're at 86 plus-or-minus-percent. So that is what we're carrying through in the status quo scenario through that midpoint range at [ 3 21 ]. 
Let me -- and we'll go ahead and say this. What we see today and what Jim's articulated from a leasing activity perspective and a little bit to Rich's question around what we're hearing and seeing from the retailers and the other -- and the service providers and interpreting how they -- what scenario they may be behaving under. Our eyes are focused today on the status quo scenario to the continued improvement scenario. 
However, we've presented this reverse course scenario because it is -- it's February, it is early. The vaccine is just beginning to roll out. There's these variants.

We did take our time to go through our projects, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, really it only caused us to cease moving forward on a couple of projects. One was a project that we had under contract. And unfortunately, with the pandemic, the leasing did evolve as we thought, and we dropped the contract. So we had to write-off some pursuit costs, typical A&E type cost, as you can imagine. 
But in the larger context of looking at our pipeline, really, the biggest impact is time. Some of these projects have taken us longer to put together. I'll give you an example of that. Town and Country is a project that's been in our pipeline. That project has been delayed by about a year. We've had trouble getting our EIR released by the city of Los Angeles because they're impacted by COVID. Just so happens this actual week, it was finally released. So it's taken us some time. The scope of the project really is very similar to how we planned it, but we've had to push it out a year for that reason alone. 
But when we look at our other projects, they're in locations that we very much believe in. We really believe in the scope. Of course, we're going to challenge ourself to make sure that what we're proposing is still relevant in a post-COVID world. So I would say we've made some minor changes to them, but not significant wholesale changes to them. Because these projects were pretty conservatively scoped to begin with. So we need to make sure we have the right amount of shops, convenience, parking, outdoor dining and the right amount of non-retail uses in those cases where we have it. And we believe that, that's still the case. 
So it was very important for us to do that early in the pandemic. We were in a more of a capital preservation mode. The other things look more clear. We are getting ourselves prepared to start some of these projects, including our Bethesda project, which has now been entitled, and I'll give you one more. Our Costa Verde project, which we've been working on for many years, was finally entitled. They got approved in December without any appeal period, and that probably took an extra year longer than what we thought. 
But we've made some really good progress and gives us a lot of confidence going forward to get these projects started when all the little ingredients come together. But the big ingredients are there."

It does deserve at least another minute. What we need -- what I'd ask everyone to do is really kind of break down G&A by years and then let's talk about it gross than net. So first, I think it's important to go back to 2",398,"I appreciate the question, Mike. It does deserve at least another minute. What we need -- what I'd ask everyone to do is really kind of break down G&A by years and then let's talk about it gross than net. 
So first, I think it's important to go back to 2019, walk through '20 and then into '21. And what you'll see is that the top line gross revenues, '19 to '20, came down. In the pandemic, there were material savings to the company. Those savings came in the form of T&E, reduced travel expenditures across our entire platform, conference attendance, so on and so forth. We also benefited -- I guess, we benefited from a financial perspective by having fewer seats filled as it was more challenging to hire in that type of environment. 
And then variable compensation, other compensation, all went in line with that. So -- but what's happened in '20 is those savings have been masked or covered up by our development overhead capitalization. And I spoke about this last quarter, probably my fault, I probably should have spent a little bit more time on it. That change in our development pipeline that Mac just articulated, did result in changes to our overhead capitalization as a result. Those changes are masking the savings in '20. 
So now fast forward to '21 and in our guidance range, what you're seeing there is a return on the top line, so those savings in '20 should the economy continue to reopen as we hope and suspect it will in a status quo/continued improvement scenario, you'll see those savings start to reverse, and that will put pressure on the top line. 
And then overhead capitalization, however, will take longer to recover with the development pipeline, that is a longer lead time. We have the same phenomenon occur with us in the GFC coming out of that downturn as well. Last point on G&A on the top line. Then if you come back and just think about top line gross G&A, '19 versus '21, it's essentially the same. '21, slightly higher, and that's because we are spending a little bit more money on third-party legal as we work through our tenant negotiations. This is more activity than we've ever had to do in a year. But I think it's good to see that, that top line is relatively consistent."

The ability to have easy access to -- for the Starbucks of the world, where they can -- people can get in, get out because it's more pickup than it is sit and stay for a while.

Thank you so much for joining us at the end of what I know has been a long week in earnings season. It's also been a long, and oftentimes, difficult past year. But as a company and an industry, we've really come so far. 
First, as always, I'd like to thank the entire team here at Regency. I'm really proud and appreciative of what we've been able to accomplish over the last year. A quarter ago when we spoke to you, we were facing rising restrictions in parts of the country, contributing to continued uncertainty about the future. We are gaining ground, but still playing deeper. 
As I sit here today, I'm really pleased to report that we've turned a corner over the last 3 months. We are encouraged by continued improvement in the retail environment and in the health of our tenants. And you can see the evidence of that in our first quarter results. As well as in our revised forward earnings guidance. We've seen a continued trend towards easing tenant restrictions, which is especially impactful to our California properties. 
Some categories and geographies still continue to lag. But overall, we are on an improving trajectory. These lifting restrictions that allow our tenants to open and operate are having the waterfall effect of improving foot traffic, and tenant sales as consumers are reengaging when they're able to. And in turn, we are collecting more rent and have seen an improving trend of rent collection. Mike will discuss this in greater detail, but the main drivers of our earnings guidance increase results from this improvement. 
We expect higher collections on cash basis tenants as well as some additional recovery of 2020 rents that we had previously reserved. And we are also encouraged by continued demand with regards to leasing. Thinking a bit longer term, we believe there are clear tailwinds for our company and our sector as the pandemic has shined a spotlight on our business in a positive way. As we all have experienced the world with e-commerce retail sales spiking meaningfully, our tenants will clearly see and appreciate the value of the last-mile distribution capabilities that their stores in our centers offer. 
And after spending months at home facing restrictions on interaction, consumers have a new appreciation for the environment and convenience of our open air neighborhood and community centers. But all of that said, our heads aren't here in the [indiscernible] sand. We acknowledge and appreciate that real challenges in brick-and-mortar retail still exist, and there will continue to be shrinking of retail GLA in the U.S. But well-located well operated centers like we own, will still be a critical component of the retail ecosystem, meeting the demands of retailers, service providers and consumers. 
This renewed appreciation from both sides fortifies the long-term need for physical locations close to consumer zones. And then also the micro migration that's occurring with more people moving into the suburbs, this should provide a long-term benefit to our suburban shopping center portfolio has showed a more permanent shift toward part time, remote work, increasing daytime population foot traffic, close to the consumer's home. 
Finally, as the macroeconomic and retail environment has shifted toward a definitive trajectory of improvement, as a company, we have pivoted from defense to offense. We are on our front foot. We are focusing on growth, not just organically, but putting capital to work externally. We are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities. We continue to have the best balance sheets in the sector with low leverage full revolver capacity and access to low cost capital. 
Additionally, as you know I like to remind you, even with no reduction in our dividend throughout the pandemic, we are generating solid free cash flow, which we expect will only continue to grow with our revised outlook. From this position of strength, we continue to focus on value creation within our development and redevelopment pipeline. Recall that we added 2 new ground up projects to our in process pipeline a quarter ago. And in the near future, we expect to add a couple more. 
With the success we've seen with Phase 1 of Carytown, we plan to move forward with Phase II. We also plan to move our mixed-use multiphase Westbard project in [indiscernible], Maryland, into the in-process pipeline. 
To finish up, we are still on the recovery path back to our 2019 NOI, but the pace on that path feels better. The environment is healthier and more certain today. And as a result, we have greater conviction and are more positive in our outlook. We are pivoting to office. We remain bullish on open air, grocery-anchored neighborhood and community centers. As I've heard several times over the past month or so, today is better than yesterday, and I'm confident that tomorrow will be better than today. Jim?"

I echo Lisa's comments and thank our Regency team for the successes we've been able to achieve during this difficult period. When the vaccine news was first announced last November, we began to see a light at the end of the tunnel in regards to pandemic. Seated here today, the tunnel is shorter and the light is getting brighter. 
We're not completely out of the woods yet. Governmental capacity restrictions remain in some of our markets, particularly on the West Coast. And just last week, we saw row backs announced in Oregon and Washington in response to increasing levels of cases. But overall, we are moving in the right direction. As stay at home orders and restrictions have been lifting on the West Coast in recent months, we are seeing that translate into higher foot traffic and rent collection. 
This is similar to what we saw during 2020 in other markets across the country as they reopened. Speaking of foot traffic, as evidenced in the chart on Page 4 of our slide deck, foot traffic in our portfolio as a whole has recovered to 90% of 2019 levels in April. While in some regions, it's close to 100%. 
Rent collections on current period billings have continued to improve at 93% in the first quarter and 94% for April. The West region still lags on foot traffic and collections, but is gradually catching up to the other regions and remains our greatest opportunity to drive future upside. As we've discussed on prior calls, we've taken a patient approach with deferral agreements, not pushing tenants into an agreement until they are open and operating. 
And that strategy has proved to be the right one financially, and created a lot of goodwill with our retailers. Our goal is, and always has been, to get our tenants back to rent paying [indiscernible] and to avoid space turning into vacancy which leads to downtime and capital to lease it back up. 
As I've stated in the past, we liked our merchandising and tenant mix pre pandemic and working with these savvy operators is the best and quickest way to get their spaces stabilized and generating revenue again at or near pre pandemic levels. Turning to leasing. We are encouraged by the solid interest and activity that we're seeing. Active new leasing categories include grocers, medical, QSRs, health and beauty, fast food, home improvement, fitness and personal services. 
We've also seen increased interest from traditional mall tenants moving to the open-air formats, including home concepts, specialty athletic retailers, eyewear and cosmetic retailers. Our new leasing volume in the first quarter was higher compared to Q1 2020 and in fact, was the highest first quarter new leasing volume we've seen in the last 5 years due to greater economic optimism as well as some likely pent-up demand from 2020. 
Renewal leasing volumes have remained consistent throughout the pandemic, so the first quarter pace was also ahead of historical trends for both shop and acre space. Our leasing pipeline is healthy. And we are seeing this growth in retailer activity across all regions, providing confidence in the sustainability of deal volume. Our recent spreads remain muted, a function of the current environment and the mix of leases we're signing today. We've continued to have success pushing rents higher on essential tenants and QSRs, but we're also making certain shorter-term concessions for nonessential tenants and table service restaurants to help bridge them through this more difficult period, putting pressure on our initial cash spreads. 
We don't see this as the long-term or reflective of the direction of market rents. Our properties have always been able to command market-leading rents over time, and we don't see this changing. Additionally, the strong embedded contractual rent growth that we've consistently achieved over the last several years generally brings our tenants' rents closer to market ahead of lease expiration, compressing those initial spreads. 
Encouragingly, we are still having a lot of success negotiating rent steps in our leases, consistent with historical averages. Lastly, on occupancy. Our commence rate is down 30 basis points sequentially. We normally see this seasonal occupancy decline in the first quarter but move-outs were actually lower than we anticipated. Some of the tenants fall out that we had expected may still occur in coming quarters, but more tenants also renewed their leases than we expected. 
In summary, while this past year has been one of the most difficult and challenging in my career, it has also been incredibly rewarding to see our team rise to the challenge and successfully navigate this unique environment. We're on a definite road to recovery and our visibility and conviction levels have only improved as country continues to open back up. Mike?"

I'll begin by addressing first quarter results and then walk through the changes in our full year guidance. First quarter NAREIT FFO was $0.90 per share. Uncollectible lease income was positive in the quarter, as reserves on current quarter billings of approximately $18 million were more than offset by the collection of over $20 million of prior period reserve revenues from cash basis tenants, including those contractually deferred, you can see the breakout of our uncollectible lease income on our covid disclosure Page 32 of the supplemental, which also shows that excluding prior period collections, we recognized as revenue 94% of our first quarter billings. 
Our cash basis tenant pool stands at 28% of ABR today. That compares to 29% a quarter ago, slightly lower due to move out activity. We've not yet moved any tenants back to accrual basis accounting from cash basis at this stage of our recovery. Our same-property commenced occupancy rate declined 30 basis points sequentially, but more importantly, as we were able to collect as we were able to collect more from our cash basis tenants, our net effective rent paying occupancy, which we've spoken about on previous calls, was actually up over 50 basis points through the first quarter. 
Same-property NOI, excluding lease termination fees, declined 1.6% in the first quarter compared to prior year. As a reminder, the first quarter of 2021 was the last quarter that we will be up against the more difficult preceded comparisons. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. As mentioned a quarter ago, in mid-January, we used cash on hand to pay down our term loan. And in early February, we recast our $1.25 billion line of credit, extending our term by another 4 years. 
We finished the quarter with a more normal cash balance and full revolver capacity. And have no meaningful unsecured debt maturities until 2024. The secured mortgage lending markets, which were tough last year for retail in general, have continued to open back up and showed demand for high-quality grocery-anchored shopping banks. 
Especially those anchored -- those owned by stronger sponsors. Subsequent to quarter end, we closed on a $200 million refinancing of a portfolio of secured mortgage loans on 10 assets held in 1 of our JVs. The blended rate was a very compelling 2.9%. From a leverage perspective, our net debt-to-EBITDA remains at a very comfortable 5.9x, even with the impacts of the pandemic on our trailing earnings. As we -- and we see a clear path back to the low to mid-5x range as our NOI continues to recover. 
Turning to guidance. We point you to Pages 13 through 15 of our earnings investor presentation. Recall that a quarter ago amid continued rollbacks in restrictions in certain markets and general uncertainty in the overall environment, we provided our earnings guidance under 3 distinct macroeconomic scenarios. Reverse course status quo and continued improvement. From a macro perspective, we now feel comfortable and confident that we are firmly in a continued improvement environment. 
And as such, we feel that we can comfortably rule out the first 2 scenarios from our guidance analysis, which supported the lower and midpoint levels of our previous range. We are moving to a more traditional guidance framework around that more positive outlook with a narrower range. 
There are 3 additional -- there are 3 additional major drivers that bridge us from our previous upper end of $3.14 per share for NAREIT FFO to our new range of $3.33 to $3.43 per share. The first 2 drivers directly impact same-property NOI, and I refer you to as a visual on Slide 15 of the presentation to help articulate the change. The first is higher collections of prior period reserve revenue. When we provided guidance back in February, we had already collected almost $9 million of prior period revenues. 
As such, this amount was included in our previous guidance range, impacting our full year same-property NOI growth forecast by about 125 basis points. Our new guidance range now reflects an impact from prior period collections of about 425 basis points at the midpoint, of which we've already collected about 80% through April. 
The remaining 20% is forecast to be collected through the balance of the year. Secondly, we now expect a higher collection rate on current year billings from cash basis tenants. In other words, the conversion of more cash basis tents from non rent paying through rent paying. We saw our cash basis collection rate rise from January through April, and roughly 1/3 of our cash basis tenants are now current on rent. That's up from about 15% a quarter ago. This gives us added confidence in higher collection forecast on current period billings. 
The third major driver is a reduction in G&A forecast, which we have guided lower for the full year by approximately $5 million at the midpoint. With greater certainty and firmer timing around the starts at Westbard and the second phase of Carytown, we now expect higher overhead capitalization. 
Additionally, we've incorporated savings from the first quarter departure of Mac Chandler, a large portion of which was onetime in nature, resulting from the unwind of previously expensed share grants. To wrap it up, we are greatly encouraged by our first quarter results and are pleased to be revising our outlook higher today as we believe we've gained more visibility into the economic environment and the recovery of our cash flows. 
As we look ahead, our priorities continue to be: first, converting nonpaying cash basis tenants back to rent paying; second, backfilling space loss to vacancy; third, returning leverage to pre pandemic levels through organic growth; and fourth, shifting back to an opportunistic mindset from a capital allocation perspective. And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions."

I'll take that one. I appreciate the question. Maybe just -- let me color up some stats around our cash basis pool and collection rate. And I think that will get you where you need to go. So for the first quarter of '21, we collected 78%",531,"Katie, it's Mike. I'll take that one. I appreciate the question. Maybe just -- let me color up some stats around our cash basis pool and collection rate. And I think that will get you where you need to go. So for the first quarter of '21, we collected 78% of rents from our cash basis tenants. That is up from 75% a quarter ago. Interestingly, if you recast the fourth quarter, we have now collected 79%. So kind of flat. What's most interesting to us and what's driving a lot of the improvement in our guidance range is the trajectory in the current year. 
So let me just throw these out actually sequentially month-over-month. January cash pool, 67%, to February, 73%, to March, 77%. And in April, we're at 81%. So it's this it's this reality in the numbers that's not necessarily presenting itself in the Q1 report in the numbers, but it's what's giving us the confidence to increase our cash collection rate going forward. It's really that March and April success as compared to January and February. And the last time we spoke to everyone early February, it wasn't -- the time is little darker than they are today. We were experiencing more rollbacks on the West Coast. All of that has changed and it's the March and April performance that's giving us the confidence to move our numbers forward. 
As you think about our range on a same-property basis, it's really about uncollectible lease income more than it is about move out activity. When you think about the fungibility of those 2 numbers, we can have move-outs but it's already incorporated into our uncollectible lease income projections. So for us, we like to talk about net effective rent pay and occupancy. 
Right now, we're in the mid 86%, 87% range. And as I mentioned on the prepared remarks, that's up 50 basis points sequentially in the first quarter. So for us, we think, from a net effective perspective, we've troughed in our occupancy rate, and we're starting to move forward. We're converting tenants to cash basis from non rent paying status. And that is, again, the tailwind behind that improvement. 
As you think about the ends of the ranges, basically, the midpoint is, we'll call for a gradual improvement through the year from the first quarter. And then more or higher rates of collection on cash basis tenants supporting the upper end and lower percentage of cash basis sets paying us on the bottom end. 
Just a little nugget which I find helpful, and I think you will, 1% collection rate on cash basis tenants is about $3 million of total revenues to Regency. So when you think about the range of our same property growth, that's roughly $10 million up or down from the midpoint. So that will help you frame out that within our guidance range, we don't have to get to 100% collection to hit the upper end of our range. 
It's about roughly a 3% tolerance on either end. Sorry, I threw a lot out at you, Katie. I hope that's helpful. If you have any follow-ups, I'd be happy to take them."

I think the one thing we are seeing from a leasing standpoint is the time from negotiation to RCD. I think permitting is taking longer, decision trees are taking longer. But other than that front-end time extension, deal terms are generally holding. 
The percent rent is a tricky one. That used to be everybody's metric of how well a tenant is performing is based upon their sales and their ability to pay rent, et cetera. But that's become it's become very muddy with the Internet sales. So each tenant does it differently. It's placer data has become a really helpful tool for us to -- in addition to sales compare trips to help us evaluate real volume and potential sales at least at a location. 
We don't do a whole lot of percent rent work. It's generally in our grocers, which is a little cleaner. It has been clear, but now with some of the online. I'm not sure how that is going to get reported. But we just don't -- we don't have that much exposure to percentage rent, but it is a tricky -- that's a tricky area, I think, going forward. In dedicated parking, I think at this point, we're very we're very accommodating to our tenants to help them distribute their product.

And the there are obviously going to be failures, but there are people ready with new capital we stepped in, in those places. 
So overall, again, we're seeing for essential, we're seeing really good activity as well as rent growth, I think, in those more nonessential and more difficult challenge spaces. We're being more creative and selective in helping those folks build back their business with help. As far as overall rent spreads go, as you know, we're heavily dependent on the mix between anchor and shops and anchor releasing is generally where we have our biggest impact to mark-to-market opportunities. But in this particular quarter, we had an outlier anchor deal that was, quite frankly, had -- was driving some negative spreads. But having said that, give you a little color on that deal, it was a well-capitalized fitness franchisee who is moving down from the Northeast, I think, because of COVID. And he backfilled the space in South Florida that had been vacant 4-plus years, it was a previously occupied by an education facility, but we structured a low rent start to helping build this business with a 60% rent bump in year 3, 0 landlord capital for TIR Whitebox. 
Long-term is a great addition to the center because it's going to drive some traffic in that location. It's been vacant, like I said, for over 4 years. And the deal structure from our perspective is extremely appropriate for the long term, go to the center. So we really continue to maintain a very high conviction and our centers have always been able to come out market-leading rents over time, and we don't see that changing. So that's kind of a long way around."

And the fact that we own quality shopping centers close to consumers' homes and in where tenants where our retailers and our service providers know that they're going to have highly productive stores. 
They are willing to pay, as Jim just said, those market-leading rents to be in the best locations, and we're really well positioned to capture that. And there still remains limited new supply and limited new competitive supply. What I mean by that is supply that is equal in terms of the quality of what we offer.

But some of perhaps the more permanent trends that we -- that may -- that we are seeing from the pandemic have influenced how we're thinking about where we may deploy capital. And what I mean by that is a lot of the migration trends in terms of potentially opening or widening the fairway for us with regards to markets where we may invest. 
And I don't necessarily mean that we're going to go to brand-new markets. But if you take a market that we're in like Atlanta, for example, we have been very focused in the way, if you will, like the first string of Atlanta. Now with the more permanent more remote work, people are -- we're seeing migrations pattern of people moving a little bit further away from the city. And so that may open up more opportunities for us in markets that we already know, we are already in, we already have scale, we already have critical mass, where we may be able to kind of expand that reach, if you will. 
That's probably the largest influence in terms of where we're looking to deploy capital. But beyond that, our strategy has not changed. We still are -- will develop, redevelop, acquire high quality, well located, grocery-anchored neighborhood and community shopping centers."

Again, I would say, generally speaking, when -- for the past -- prior to the last 3 months, where we've really seen the transaction market open up a lot more prior to that, the properties that were trading and centers that we're trading were on the much smaller size, so really grocer anchor with small shops that were easier to underwrite because of the essential tenants that were in the shopping centers, just a smaller bite size, with the improved environment, retail environment, the improvement just overall of our economy we have seen the transaction market open more. So now there are properties and we are -- that are trading that wouldn't have even traded before. This goes back to what I said about new capital coming in, looking for higher yields. So those wouldn't even have traded. That's the larger, more unconventional, more entertainment. 
With regards to boxes, there's there is definitely a premium. So cap rates are higher for where there are additional boxes. And while in the short term, you've seen higher collection rates because they're typically occupied by national tenants that are paying rents, they're still the risk that over the long term, there continues to be shrinking GLA and consolidation, especially with the impact from e-commerce. That is where we're going to see the greatest fallout and also what requires the greatest amount of capital to release. So there is a premium or higher cap rates for those types of centers."

Thank you so much for joining us at the end of what I know has been a long week in earnings season. It's also been a long, and oftentimes, difficult past year. But as a company and an industry, we've really come so far. 
First, as always, I'd like to thank the entire team here at Regency. I'm really proud and appreciative of what we've been able to accomplish over the last year. A quarter ago when we spoke to you, we were facing rising restrictions in parts of the country, contributing to continued uncertainty about the future. We are gaining ground, but still playing deeper. 
As I sit here today, I'm really pleased to report that we've turned a corner over the last 3 months. We are encouraged by continued improvement in the retail environment and in the health of our tenants. And you can see the evidence of that in our first quarter results. As well as in our revised forward earnings guidance. We've seen a continued trend towards easing tenant restrictions, which is especially impactful to our California properties. 
Some categories and geographies still continue to lag. But overall, we are on an improving trajectory. These lifting restrictions that allow our tenants to open and operate are having the waterfall effect of improving foot traffic, and tenant sales as consumers are reengaging when they're able to. And in turn, we are collecting more rent and have seen an improving trend of rent collection. Mike will discuss this in greater detail, but the main drivers of our earnings guidance increase results from this improvement. 
We expect higher collections on cash basis tenants as well as some additional recovery of 2020 rents that we had previously reserved. And we are also encouraged by continued demand with regards to leasing. Thinking a bit longer term, we believe there are clear tailwinds for our company and our sector as the pandemic has shined a spotlight on our business in a positive way. As we all have experienced the world with e-commerce retail sales spiking meaningfully, our tenants will clearly see and appreciate the value of the last-mile distribution capabilities that their stores in our centers offer. 
And after spending months at home facing restrictions on interaction, consumers have a new appreciation for the environment and convenience of our open air neighborhood and community centers. But all of that said, our heads aren't here in the [indiscernible] sand. We acknowledge and appreciate that real challenges in brick-and-mortar retail still exist, and there will continue to be shrinking of retail GLA in the U.S. But well-located well operated centers like we own, will still be a critical component of the retail ecosystem, meeting the demands of retailers, service providers and consumers. 
This renewed appreciation from both sides fortifies the long-term need for physical locations close to consumer zones. And then also the micro migration that's occurring with more people moving into the suburbs, this should provide a long-term benefit to our suburban shopping center portfolio has showed a more permanent shift toward part time, remote work, increasing daytime population foot traffic, close to the consumer's home. 
Finally, as the macroeconomic and retail environment has shifted toward a definitive trajectory of improvement, as a company, we have pivoted from defense to offense. We are on our front foot. We are focusing on growth, not just organically, but putting capital to work externally. We are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities. We continue to have the best balance sheets in the sector with low leverage full revolver capacity and access to low cost capital. 
Additionally, as you know I like to remind you, even with no reduction in our dividend throughout the pandemic, we are generating solid free cash flow, which we expect will only continue to grow with our revised outlook. From this position of strength, we continue to focus on value creation within our development and redevelopment pipeline. Recall that we added 2 new ground up projects to our in process pipeline a quarter ago. And in the near future, we expect to add a couple more. 
With the success we've seen with Phase 1 of Carytown, we plan to move forward with Phase II. We also plan to move our mixed-use multiphase Westbard project in [indiscernible], Maryland, into the in-process pipeline. 
To finish up, we are still on the recovery path back to our 2019 NOI, but the pace on that path feels better. The environment is healthier and more certain today. And as a result, we have greater conviction and are more positive in our outlook. We are pivoting to office. We remain bullish on open air, grocery-anchored neighborhood and community centers. As I've heard several times over the past month or so, today is better than yesterday, and I'm confident that tomorrow will be better than today. Jim?"

I echo Lisa's comments and thank our Regency team for the successes we've been able to achieve during this difficult period.

I echo Lisa's comments and thank our Regency team for the successes we've been able to achieve during this difficult period. When the vaccine news was first announced last November, we began to see a light at the end of the tunnel in regards to pandemic. Seated here today, the tunnel is shorter and the light is getting brighter. 
We're not completely out of the woods yet. Governmental capacity restrictions remain in some of our markets, particularly on the West Coast. And just last week, we saw row backs announced in Oregon and Washington in response to increasing levels of cases. But overall, we are moving in the right direction. As stay at home orders and restrictions have been lifting on the West Coast in recent months, we are seeing that translate into higher foot traffic and rent collection. 
This is similar to what we saw during 2020 in other markets across the country as they reopened. Speaking of foot traffic, as evidenced in the chart on Page 4 of our slide deck, foot traffic in our portfolio as a whole has recovered to 90% of 2019 levels in April. While in some regions, it's close to 100%. 
Rent collections on current period billings have continued to improve at 93% in the first quarter and 94% for April. The West region still lags on foot traffic and collections, but is gradually catching up to the other regions and remains our greatest opportunity to drive future upside. As we've discussed on prior calls, we've taken a patient approach with deferral agreements, not pushing tenants into an agreement until they are open and operating. 
And that strategy has proved to be the right one financially, and created a lot of goodwill with our retailers. Our goal is, and always has been, to get our tenants back to rent paying [indiscernible] and to avoid space turning into vacancy which leads to downtime and capital to lease it back up. 
As I've stated in the past, we liked our merchandising and tenant mix pre pandemic and working with these savvy operators is the best and quickest way to get their spaces stabilized and generating revenue again at or near pre pandemic levels. Turning to leasing. We are encouraged by the solid interest and activity that we're seeing. Active new leasing categories include grocers, medical, QSRs, health and beauty, fast food, home improvement, fitness and personal services. 
We've also seen increased interest from traditional mall tenants moving to the open-air formats, including home concepts, specialty athletic retailers, eyewear and cosmetic retailers. Our new leasing volume in the first quarter was higher compared to Q1 2020 and in fact, was the highest first quarter new leasing volume we've seen in the last 5 years due to greater economic optimism as well as some likely pent-up demand from 2020. 
Renewal leasing volumes have remained consistent throughout the pandemic, so the first quarter pace was also ahead of historical trends for both shop and acre space. Our leasing pipeline is healthy. And we are seeing this growth in retailer activity across all regions, providing confidence in the sustainability of deal volume. Our recent spreads remain muted, a function of the current environment and the mix of leases we're signing today. We've continued to have success pushing rents higher on essential tenants and QSRs, but we're also making certain shorter-term concessions for nonessential tenants and table service restaurants to help bridge them through this more difficult period, putting pressure on our initial cash spreads. 
We don't see this as the long-term or reflective of the direction of market rents. Our properties have always been able to command market-leading rents over time, and we don't see this changing. Additionally, the strong embedded contractual rent growth that we've consistently achieved over the last several years generally brings our tenants' rents closer to market ahead of lease expiration, compressing those initial spreads. 
Encouragingly, we are still having a lot of success negotiating rent steps in our leases, consistent with historical averages. Lastly, on occupancy. Our commence rate is down 30 basis points sequentially. We normally see this seasonal occupancy decline in the first quarter but move-outs were actually lower than we anticipated. Some of the tenants fall out that we had expected may still occur in coming quarters, but more tenants also renewed their leases than we expected. 
In summary, while this past year has been one of the most difficult and challenging in my career, it has also been incredibly rewarding to see our team rise to the challenge and successfully navigate this unique environment. We're on a definite road to recovery and our visibility and conviction levels have only improved as country continues to open back up. Mike?"

Good morning, and happy Friday, everyone. I'll begin by addressing first quarter results and then walk through the changes in our full year guidance. First quarter NAREIT FFO was $0.90 per share. Uncollectible lease income was positive in the",972,"Thanks, Jim. Good morning, and happy Friday, everyone. I'll begin by addressing first quarter results and then walk through the changes in our full year guidance. First quarter NAREIT FFO was $0.90 per share. Uncollectible lease income was positive in the quarter, as reserves on current quarter billings of approximately $18 million were more than offset by the collection of over $20 million of prior period reserve revenues from cash basis tenants, including those contractually deferred, you can see the breakout of our uncollectible lease income on our covid disclosure Page 32 of the supplemental, which also shows that excluding prior period collections, we recognized as revenue 94% of our first quarter billings. 
Our cash basis tenant pool stands at 28% of ABR today. That compares to 29% a quarter ago, slightly lower due to move out activity. We've not yet moved any tenants back to accrual basis accounting from cash basis at this stage of our recovery. Our same-property commenced occupancy rate declined 30 basis points sequentially, but more importantly, as we were able to collect as we were able to collect more from our cash basis tenants, our net effective rent paying occupancy, which we've spoken about on previous calls, was actually up over 50 basis points through the first quarter. 
Same-property NOI, excluding lease termination fees, declined 1.6% in the first quarter compared to prior year. As a reminder, the first quarter of 2021 was the last quarter that we will be up against the more difficult preceded comparisons. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. As mentioned a quarter ago, in mid-January, we used cash on hand to pay down our term loan. And in early February, we recast our $1.25 billion line of credit, extending our term by another 4 years. 
We finished the quarter with a more normal cash balance and full revolver capacity. And have no meaningful unsecured debt maturities until 2024. The secured mortgage lending markets, which were tough last year for retail in general, have continued to open back up and showed demand for high-quality grocery-anchored shopping banks. 
Especially those anchored -- those owned by stronger sponsors. Subsequent to quarter end, we closed on a $200 million refinancing of a portfolio of secured mortgage loans on 10 assets held in 1 of our JVs. The blended rate was a very compelling 2.9%. From a leverage perspective, our net debt-to-EBITDA remains at a very comfortable 5.9x, even with the impacts of the pandemic on our trailing earnings. As we -- and we see a clear path back to the low to mid-5x range as our NOI continues to recover. 
Turning to guidance. We point you to Pages 13 through 15 of our earnings investor presentation. Recall that a quarter ago amid continued rollbacks in restrictions in certain markets and general uncertainty in the overall environment, we provided our earnings guidance under 3 distinct macroeconomic scenarios. Reverse course status quo and continued improvement. From a macro perspective, we now feel comfortable and confident that we are firmly in a continued improvement environment. 
And as such, we feel that we can comfortably rule out the first 2 scenarios from our guidance analysis, which supported the lower and midpoint levels of our previous range. We are moving to a more traditional guidance framework around that more positive outlook with a narrower range. 
There are 3 additional -- there are 3 additional major drivers that bridge us from our previous upper end of $3.14 per share for NAREIT FFO to our new range of $3.33 to $3.43 per share. The first 2 drivers directly impact same-property NOI, and I refer you to as a visual on Slide 15 of the presentation to help articulate the change. The first is higher collections of prior period reserve revenue. When we provided guidance back in February, we had already collected almost $9 million of prior period revenues. 
As such, this amount was included in our previous guidance range, impacting our full year same-property NOI growth forecast by about 125 basis points. Our new guidance range now reflects an impact from prior period collections of about 425 basis points at the midpoint, of which we've already collected about 80% through April. 
The remaining 20% is forecast to be collected through the balance of the year. Secondly, we now expect a higher collection rate on current year billings from cash basis tenants. In other words, the conversion of more cash basis tents from non rent paying through rent paying. We saw our cash basis collection rate rise from January through April, and roughly 1/3 of our cash basis tenants are now current on rent. That's up from about 15% a quarter ago. This gives us added confidence in higher collection forecast on current period billings. 
The third major driver is a reduction in G&A forecast, which we have guided lower for the full year by approximately $5 million at the midpoint. With greater certainty and firmer timing around the starts at Westbard and the second phase of Carytown, we now expect higher overhead capitalization. 
Additionally, we've incorporated savings from the first quarter departure of Mac Chandler, a large portion of which was onetime in nature, resulting from the unwind of previously expensed share grants. To wrap it up, we are greatly encouraged by our first quarter results and are pleased to be revising our outlook higher today as we believe we've gained more visibility into the economic environment and the recovery of our cash flows. 
As we look ahead, our priorities continue to be: first, converting nonpaying cash basis tenants back to rent paying; second, backfilling space loss to vacancy; third, returning leverage to pre pandemic levels through organic growth; and fourth, shifting back to an opportunistic mindset from a capital allocation perspective. And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions."

I'll take that one. I appreciate the question. Maybe just -- let me color up some stats around our cash basis pool and collection rate. And I think that will get you where you need to go. So for the first quarter of '21, we collected 78%",531,"Katie, it's Mike. I'll take that one. I appreciate the question. Maybe just -- let me color up some stats around our cash basis pool and collection rate. And I think that will get you where you need to go. So for the first quarter of '21, we collected 78% of rents from our cash basis tenants. That is up from 75% a quarter ago. Interestingly, if you recast the fourth quarter, we have now collected 79%. So kind of flat. What's most interesting to us and what's driving a lot of the improvement in our guidance range is the trajectory in the current year. 
So let me just throw these out actually sequentially month-over-month. January cash pool, 67%, to February, 73%, to March, 77%. And in April, we're at 81%. So it's this it's this reality in the numbers that's not necessarily presenting itself in the Q1 report in the numbers, but it's what's giving us the confidence to increase our cash collection rate going forward. It's really that March and April success as compared to January and February. And the last time we spoke to everyone early February, it wasn't -- the time is little darker than they are today. We were experiencing more rollbacks on the West Coast. All of that has changed and it's the March and April performance that's giving us the confidence to move our numbers forward. 
As you think about our range on a same-property basis, it's really about uncollectible lease income more than it is about move out activity. When you think about the fungibility of those 2 numbers, we can have move-outs but it's already incorporated into our uncollectible lease income projections. So for us, we like to talk about net effective rent pay and occupancy. 
Right now, we're in the mid 86%, 87% range. And as I mentioned on the prepared remarks, that's up 50 basis points sequentially in the first quarter. So for us, we think, from a net effective perspective, we've troughed in our occupancy rate, and we're starting to move forward. We're converting tenants to cash basis from non rent paying status. And that is, again, the tailwind behind that improvement. 
As you think about the ends of the ranges, basically, the midpoint is, we'll call for a gradual improvement through the year from the first quarter. And then more or higher rates of collection on cash basis tenants supporting the upper end and lower percentage of cash basis sets paying us on the bottom end. 
Just a little nugget which I find helpful, and I think you will, 1% collection rate on cash basis tenants is about $3 million of total revenues to Regency. So when you think about the range of our same property growth, that's roughly $10 million up or down from the midpoint. So that will help you frame out that within our guidance range, we don't have to get to 100% collection to hit the upper end of our range. 
It's about roughly a 3% tolerance on either end. Sorry, I threw a lot out at you, Katie. I hope that's helpful. If you have any follow-ups, I'd be happy to take them."

I think the one thing we are seeing from a leasing standpoint is the time from negotiation to RCD. I think permitting is taking longer, decision trees are taking longer. But other than that front-end time extension, deal terms are generally holding. 
The percent rent is a tricky one. That used to be everybody's metric of how well a tenant is performing is based upon their sales and their ability to pay rent, et cetera. But that's become it's become very muddy with the Internet sales. So each tenant does it differently. It's placer data has become a really helpful tool for us to -- in addition to sales compare trips to help us evaluate real volume and potential sales at least at a location. 
We don't do a whole lot of percent rent work. It's generally in our grocers, which is a little cleaner. It has been clear, but now with some of the online. I'm not sure how that is going to get reported. But we just don't -- we don't have that much exposure to percentage rent, but it is a tricky -- that's a tricky area, I think, going forward.

One is just a factual question about same-store NOI, what a -- what would have same-store NOI had been in 1Q? Ex the cash collection benefit? And then number two, could you maybe just talk us through the leasing environment? I fully appreciate how strong the leasing was. 
But if you can maybe give us an idea about what the rents look like relative to 2020 and relative to the past 5 years and how those negotiations are going, I think that would be helpful."

When you see the fitness in personal services, folks, coming back into the marketplace, when they have been the most impacted with new locations, it indicates to me that there is a place for them in the future. And the there are obviously going to be failures, but there are people ready with new capital we stepped in, in those places. 
So overall, again, we're seeing for essential, we're seeing really good activity as well as rent growth, I think, in those more nonessential and more difficult challenge spaces. We're being more creative and selective in helping those folks build back their business with help. As far as overall rent spreads go, as you know, we're heavily dependent on the mix between anchor and shops and anchor releasing is generally where we have our biggest impact to mark-to-market opportunities. But in this particular quarter, we had an outlier anchor deal that was, quite frankly, had -- was driving some negative spreads. But having said that, give you a little color on that deal, it was a well-capitalized fitness franchisee who is moving down from the Northeast, I think, because of COVID. And he backfilled the space in South Florida that had been vacant 4-plus years, it was a previously occupied by an education facility, but we structured a low rent start to helping build this business with a 60% rent bump in year 3, 0 landlord capital for TIR Whitebox. 
Long-term is a great addition to the center because it's going to drive some traffic in that location. It's been vacant, like I said, for over 4 years. And the deal structure from our perspective is extremely appropriate for the long term, go to the center. So we really continue to maintain a very high conviction and our centers have always been able to come out market-leading rents over time, and we don't see that changing. So that's kind of a long way around."

And I know that I spoke to many of you about, we would expect that we would see some decline in market rents I can sit here today and say, we're not seeing that. And that is because, number one, we all performed so much better, I think, than we all feared that we may have. And it also speaks to the tailwinds in our sector. And the fact that we own quality shopping centers close to consumers' homes and in where tenants where our retailers and our service providers know that they're going to have highly productive stores. 
They are willing to pay, as Jim just said, those market-leading rents to be in the best locations, and we're really well positioned to capture that. And there still remains limited new supply and limited new competitive supply. What I mean by that is supply that is equal in terms of the quality of what we offer. And so I like looking forward and believe that we will continue to command those market-leading rents and grow NOI from this point forward."

And then the first quarter of '21 had about $1 million additive related to CAM reconciliations. So there's a bit of a seasonal component to it, right? So we build cameras to cash versus tenants. So that amplifies the bad debt expense. So the apples-to-apples change is really about $1.5 million of improvement. 
So you don't see that on the surface. But then I kind of go back to my earlier comments and really, we're seeing the improvement in our cash basis tenant collection rate so late in the quarter of March and then extending beyond the quarter into April. That's what's giving us the confidence to increase our outlook moving forward. And less, even if you think about it, just big picture collection rate on the top, it's basically unchanged, right, quarter-over-quarter, it's 93%, plus or minus the same.

With regards to boxes, there's there is definitely a premium. So cap rates are higher for where there are additional boxes. And while in the short term, you've seen higher collection rates because they're typically occupied by national tenants that are paying rents, they're still the risk that over the long term, there continues to be shrinking GLA and consolidation, especially with the impact from e-commerce.

Thank you so much for joining us at the end of what I know has been a long week in earnings season. It's also been a long, and oftentimes, difficult past year. But as a company and an industry, we've really come so far. 
First, as always, I'd like to thank the entire team here at Regency. I'm really proud and appreciative of what we've been able to accomplish over the last year. A quarter ago when we spoke to you, we were facing rising restrictions in parts of the country, contributing to continued uncertainty about the future. We are gaining ground, but still playing defense. 
As I sit here today, I'm really pleased to report that we've turned a corner over the last 3 months. We are encouraged by continued improvement in the retail environment and in the health of our tenants. And you can see the evidence of that in our first quarter results. As well as in our revised forward earnings guidance. We've seen a continued trend towards easing tenant restrictions, which is especially impactful to our California properties. 
Some categories and geographies still continue to lag. But overall, we are on an improving trajectory. These lifting restrictions that allow our tenants to open and operate are having the waterfall effect of improving foot traffic, and tenant sales as consumers are reengaging when they're able to. And in turn, we are collecting more rent and have seen an improving trend of rent collection. Mike will discuss this in greater detail, but the main drivers of our earnings guidance increase results from this improvement. 
We expect higher collections on cash basis tenants as well as some additional recovery of 2020 rents that we had previously reserved. And we are also encouraged by continued demand with regards to leasing. Thinking a bit longer term, we believe there are clear tailwinds for our company and our sector as the pandemic has shined a spotlight on our business in a positive way. As we all have experienced the world with e-commerce retail sales spiking meaningfully, our tenants will clearly see and appreciate the value of the last-mile distribution capabilities that their stores in our centers offer. 
And after spending months at home facing restrictions on interaction, consumers have a new appreciation for the environment and convenience of our open-air neighborhood and community centers. But all of that said, our heads aren't here in the Jacksonville sand. We acknowledge and appreciate that real challenges in brick-and-mortar retail still exist, and there will continue to be shrinking of retail GLA in the U.S. But well-located well operated centers like we own, will still be a critical component of the retail ecosystem, meeting the demands of retailers, service providers and consumers. 
This renewed appreciation from both sides fortifies the long-term need for physical locations close to consumer zones. And then also the micro migration that's occurring with more people moving into the suburbs, this should provide a long-term benefit to our suburban shopping center portfolio has showed a more permanent shift toward part time, remote work, increasing daytime population foot traffic, close to the consumer's home. 
Finally, as the macroeconomic and retail environment has shifted toward a definitive trajectory of improvement, as a company, we have pivoted from defense to offense. We are on our front foot. We are focusing on growth, not just organically, but putting capital to work externally. We are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities. We continue to have the best balance sheets in the sector with low leverage full revolver capacity and access to low cost capital. 
Additionally, as you know I like to remind you, even with no reduction in our dividend throughout the pandemic, we are generating solid free cash flow, which we expect will only continue to grow with our revised outlook. From this position of strength, we continue to focus on value creation within our development and redevelopment pipeline. Recall that we added 2 new ground-up projects to our in process pipeline a quarter ago. And in the near future, we expect to add a couple more. 
With the success we've seen with Phase 1 of Carytown, we plan to move forward with Phase II. We also plan to move our mixed-use multiphase Westbard project in Bicester, Maryland, into the in-process pipeline. 
To finish up, we are still on the recovery path back to our 2019 NOI, but the pace on that path feels better. The environment is healthier and more certain today. And as a result, we have greater conviction and are more positive in our outlook. We are pivoting to office. We remain bullish on open air, grocery-anchored neighborhood and community centers. As I've heard several times over the past month or so, today is better than yesterday, and I'm confident that tomorrow will be better than today. Jim?"
816889,709569829,2276353,"Regency Centers Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 07, 2021",2021-05-07,"Earnings Calls","Regency Centers Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. I echo Lisa's comments and thank our Regency team for the successes we've been able to achieve during this difficult period.

I echo Lisa's comments and thank our Regency team for the successes we've been able to achieve during this difficult period. When the vaccine news was first announced last November, we began to see a light at the end of the tunnel in regards to pandemic. Seated here today, the tunnel is shorter, and the light is getting brighter. 
We're not completely out of the woods yet. Governmental capacity restrictions remain in some of our markets, particularly on the West Coast. And just last week, we saw row backs announced in Oregon and Washington in response to increasing levels of cases. But overall, we are moving in the right direction. As stay at home orders and restrictions have been lifting on the West Coast in recent months, we are seeing that translate into higher foot traffic and rent collection. 
This is similar to what we saw during 2020 in other markets across the country as they reopened. Speaking of foot traffic, as evidenced in the chart on Page 4 of our slide deck, foot traffic in our portfolio as a whole has recovered to 90% of 2019 levels in April. While in some regions, it's close to 100%. 
Rent collections on current period billings have continued to improve at 93% in the first quarter and 94% for April. The West region still lags on foot traffic and collections, but is gradually catching up to the other regions and remains our greatest opportunity to drive future upside. As we've discussed on prior calls, we've taken a patient approach with deferral agreements, not pushing tenants into an agreement until they are open and operating. 
And that strategy has proved to be the right one financially, and created a lot of goodwill with our retailers. Our goal is, and always has been, to get our tenants back to rent paying [indiscernible] and to avoid space turning into vacancy which leads to downtime and capital to lease it back up. 
As I've stated in the past, we liked our merchandising and tenant mix pre pandemic and working with these savvy operators is the best and quickest way to get their spaces stabilized and generating revenue again at or near pre pandemic levels. Turning to leasing. We are encouraged by the solid interest and activity that we're seeing. Active new leasing categories include grocers, medical, QSRs, health and beauty, fast food, home improvement, fitness and personal services. 
We've also seen increased interest from traditional mall tenants moving to the open-air formats, including home concepts, specialty athletic retailers, eyewear and cosmetic retailers. Our new leasing volume in the first quarter was higher compared to Q1 2020 and in fact, was the highest first quarter new leasing volume we've seen in the last 5 years due to greater economic optimism as well as some likely pent-up demand from 2020. 
Renewal leasing volumes have remained consistent throughout the pandemic, so the first quarter pace was also ahead of historical trends for both shop and acre space. Our leasing pipeline is healthy. And we are seeing this growth in retailer activity across all regions, providing confidence in the sustainability of deal volume. Our recent spreads remain muted, a function of the current environment and the mix of leases we're signing today. We've continued to have success pushing rents higher on essential tenants and QSRs, but we're also making certain shorter-term concessions for nonessential tenants and table service restaurants to help bridge them through this more difficult period, putting pressure on our initial cash spreads. 
We don't see this as the long-term or reflective of the direction of market rents. Our properties have always been able to command market-leading rents over time, and we don't see this changing. Additionally, the strong embedded contractual rent growth that we've consistently achieved over the last several years generally brings our tenants' rents closer to market ahead of lease expiration, compressing those initial spreads. 
Encouragingly, we are still having a lot of success negotiating rent steps in our leases, consistent with historical averages. Lastly, on occupancy. Our commence rate is down 30 basis points sequentially. We normally see this seasonal occupancy decline in the first quarter but move-outs were actually lower than we anticipated. Some of the tenants fall out that we had expected may still occur in coming quarters, but more tenants also renewed their leases than we expected. 
In summary, while this past year has been one of the most difficult and challenging in my career, it has also been incredibly rewarding to see our team rise to the challenge and successfully navigate this unique environment. We're on a definite road to recovery and our visibility and conviction levels have only improved as country continues to open back up. Mike?"

Good morning, and happy Friday, everyone. I'll begin by addressing first quarter results and then walk through the changes in our full year guidance. First quarter NAREIT FFO was $0.90 per share. Uncollectible lease income was positive in the",970,"Thanks, Jim. Good morning, and happy Friday, everyone. I'll begin by addressing first quarter results and then walk through the changes in our full year guidance. First quarter NAREIT FFO was $0.90 per share. Uncollectible lease income was positive in the quarter, as reserves on current quarter billings of approximately $18 million were more than offset by the collection of over $20 million of prior period reserve revenues from cash basis tenants, including those contractually deferred, you can see the breakout of our uncollectible lease income on our COVID disclosure Page 32 of the supplemental, which also shows that excluding prior period collections, we recognized as revenue 94% of our first quarter billings. 
Our cash basis tenant pool stands at 28% of ABR today. That compares to 29% a quarter ago, slightly lower due to move out activity. We've not yet moved any tenants back to accrual basis accounting from cash basis at this stage of our recovery. Our same-property commenced occupancy rate declined 30 basis points sequentially, but more importantly, as we were able to collect as we were able to collect more from our cash basis tenants, our net effective rent paying occupancy, which we've spoken about on previous calls, was actually up over 50 basis points through the first quarter. 
Same-property NOI, excluding lease termination fees, declined 1.6% in the first quarter compared to prior year. As a reminder, the first quarter of 2021 was the last quarter that we will be up against the more difficult preceded comparisons. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. As mentioned a quarter ago, in mid-January, we used cash on hand to pay down our term loan. And in early February, we recast our $1.25 billion line of credit, extending our term by another 4 years. 
We finished the quarter with a more normal cash balance and full revolver capacity. And have no meaningful unsecured debt maturities until 2024. The secured mortgage lending markets, which were tough last year for retail in general, have continued to open back up and showed demand for high-quality grocery-anchored shopping banks. 
Especially those anchored -- those owned by stronger sponsors. Subsequent to quarter end, we closed on a $200 million refinancing of a portfolio of secured mortgage loans on 10 assets held in 1 of our JVs. The blended rate was a very compelling 2.9%. From a leverage perspective, our net debt-to-EBITDA remains at a very comfortable 5.9x, even with the impacts of the pandemic on our trailing earnings. As we -- and we see a clear path back to the low to mid-5x range as our NOI continues to recover. 
Turning to guidance. We point you to Pages 13 through 15 of our earnings investor presentation. Recall that a quarter ago amid continued rollbacks in restrictions in certain markets and general uncertainty in the overall environment, we provided our earnings guidance under 3 distinct macroeconomic scenarios. Reverse course status quo and continued improvement. From a macro perspective, we now feel comfortable and confident that we are firmly in a continued improvement environment. 
And as such, we feel that we can comfortably rule out the first 2 scenarios from our guidance analysis, which supported the lower and midpoint levels of our previous range. We are moving to a more traditional guidance framework around that more positive outlook with a narrower range. 
There are 3 additional -- there are 3 additional major drivers that bridge us from our previous upper end of $3.14 per share for NAREIT FFO to our new range of $3.33 to $3.43 per share. The first 2 drivers directly impact same-property NOI, and I refer you to as a visual on Slide 15 of the presentation to help articulate the change. The first is higher collections of prior period reserve revenue. When we provided guidance back in February, we had already collected almost $9 million of prior period revenues. 
As such, this amount was included in our previous guidance range, impacting our full year same-property NOI growth forecast by about 125 basis points. Our new guidance range now reflects an impact from prior period collections of about 425 basis points at the midpoint, of which we've already collected about 80% through April. 
The remaining 20% is forecast to be collected through the balance of the year. Secondly, we now expect a higher collection rate on current year billings from cash basis tenants. In other words, the conversion of more cash basis tents from non-rent paying through rent paying. We saw our cash basis collection rate rise from January through April, and roughly 1/3 of our cash basis tenants are now current on rent. That's up from about 15% a quarter ago. This gives us added confidence in higher collection forecast on current period billings. 
The third major driver is a reduction in G&A forecast, which we have guided lower for the full year by approximately $5 million at the midpoint. With greater certainty and firmer timing around the starts at Westbard and the second phase of Carytown, we now expect higher overhead capitalization. 
Additionally, we've incorporated savings from the first quarter departure of Mac Chandler, a large portion of which was onetime in nature, resulting from the unwind of previously expensed share grants. To wrap it up, we are greatly encouraged by our first quarter results and are pleased to be revising our outlook higher today as we believe we've gained more visibility into the economic environment and the recovery of our cash flows. 
As we look ahead, our priorities continue to be: first, converting nonpaying cash basis tenants back to rent paying; second, backfilling space loss to vacancy; third, returning leverage to pre-pandemic levels through organic growth; and fourth, shifting back to an opportunistic mindset from a capital allocation perspective. And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions."

I'll take that one. I appreciate the question. Maybe just -- let me color up some stats around our cash basis pool and collection rate. And I think that will get you where you need to go. So for the first quarter of '21, we collected 78%",530,"Katie, it's Mike. I'll take that one. I appreciate the question. Maybe just -- let me color up some stats around our cash basis pool and collection rate. And I think that will get you where you need to go. So for the first quarter of '21, we collected 78% of rents from our cash basis tenants. That is up from 75% a quarter ago. Interestingly, if you recast the fourth quarter, we have now collected 79%. So kind of flat. What's most interesting to us and what's driving a lot of the improvement in our guidance range is the trajectory in the current year. 
So let me just throw these out actually sequentially month-over-month. January cash pool, 67%, to February, 73%, to March, 77%. And in April, we're at 81%. So it's this it's this reality in the numbers that's not necessarily presenting itself in the Q1 report in the numbers, but it's what's giving us the confidence to increase our cash collection rate going forward. It's really that March and April success as compared to January and February. And the last time we spoke to everyone early February, it wasn't -- the time is little darker than they are today. We were experiencing more rollbacks on the West Coast. All of that has changed and it's the March and April performance that's giving us the confidence to move our numbers forward. 
As you think about our range on a same-property basis, it's really about uncollectible lease income more than it is about move out activity. When you think about the fungibility of those 2 numbers, we can have move-outs but it's already incorporated into our uncollectible lease income projections. So for us, we like to talk about net effective rent pay and occupancy. 
Right now, we're in the mid 86%, 87% range. And as I mentioned on the prepared remarks, that's up 50 basis points sequentially in the first quarter. So for us, we think, from a net effective perspective, we've troughed in our occupancy rate, and we're starting to move forward. We're converting tenants to cash basis from non-rent paying status. And that is, again, the tailwind behind that improvement. 
As you think about the ends of the ranges, basically, the midpoint is, we'll call for a gradual improvement through the year from the first quarter. And then more or higher rates of collection on cash basis tenants supporting the upper end and lower percentage of cash basis sets paying us on the bottom end. 
Just a little nugget which I find helpful, and I think you will, 1% collection rate on cash basis tenants is about $3 million of total revenues to Regency. So when you think about the range of our same property growth, that's roughly $10 million up or down from the midpoint. So that will help you frame out that within our guidance range, we don't have to get to 100% collection to hit the upper end of our range. 
It's about roughly a 3% tolerance on either end. Sorry, I threw a lot out at you, Katie. I hope that's helpful. If you have any follow-ups, I'd be happy to take them."

We're seeing all the major brands look at some form of BOPIS or collection arrangement. So it's clearly here to stay. I think it's an additional leg of getting product to the consumer, driving traffic at the store is still, obviously, getting people in the store is the best method for a grocer, but second best is being able kind of pick up or delivered to the car at curbside. So I think it's definitely a trend that's here to stay."

And I guess, the short answer on changes to lease structure is not on the margin, but really no real change. I think the one thing we are seeing from a leasing standpoint is the time from negotiation to RCD. I think permitting is taking longer, decision trees are taking longer. But other than that front-end time extension, deal terms are generally holding. 
The percent rent is a tricky one. That used to be everybody's metric of how well a tenant is performing is based upon their sales and their ability to pay rent, et cetera. But that's become it's become very muddy with the Internet sales. So each tenant does it differently. Its placer data has become a really helpful tool for us to -- in addition to sales compare trips to help us evaluate real volume and potential sales at least at a location. 
We don't do a whole lot of percent rent work. It's generally in our grocers, which is a little cleaner. It has been clear, but now with some of the online. I'm not sure how that is going to get reported. But we just don't -- we don't have that much exposure to percentage rent, but it is a tricky -- that's a tricky area, I think, going forward. In dedicated parking, I think at this point, we're very we're very accommodating to our tenants to help them distribute their product. 
So we're not looking at that as necessarily a rental stream impact as much as continuing to drive traffic and their ability to be as successful as it can as our anchor."

When you see the fitness in personal services, folks, coming back into the marketplace, when they have been the most impacted with new locations, it indicates to me that there is a place for them in the future. And there are obviously going to be failures, but there are people ready with new capital we stepped in, in those places. 
So overall, again, we're seeing for essential, we're seeing really good activity as well as rent growth, I think, in those more nonessential and more difficult challenge spaces. We're being more creative and selective in helping those folks build back their business with help. As far as overall rent spreads go, as you know, we're heavily dependent on the mix between anchor and shops and anchor releasing is generally where we have our biggest impact to mark-to-market opportunities. But in this particular quarter, we had an outlier anchor deal that was, quite frankly, had -- was driving some negative spreads. But having said that, give you a little color on that deal, it was a well-capitalized fitness franchisee who is moving down from the Northeast, I think, because of COVID. And he backfilled the space in South Florida that had been vacant 4-plus years, it was a previously occupied by an education facility, but we structured a low rent start to helping build this business with a 60% kick in rent bump in year 3, 0 landlord capital for TIR Whitebox. 
Long-term is a great addition to the center because it's going to drive some traffic in that location. It's been vacant, like I said, for over 4 years. And the deal structure from our perspective is extremely appropriate for the long term, go to the center. So we really continue to maintain a very high conviction and our centers have always been able to come out market-leading rents over time, and we don't see that changing. So that's kind of a long way around."

And that is because, number one, we all performed so much better, I think, than we all feared that we may have. And it also speaks to the tailwinds in our sector. And the fact that we own quality shopping centers close to consumers' homes and in where tenants where our retailers and our service providers know that they're going to have highly productive stores. 
They are willing to pay, as Jim just said, those market-leading rents to be in the best locations, and we're really well positioned to capture that. And there still remains limited new supply and limited new competitive supply. What I mean by that is supply that is equal in terms of the quality of what we offer. And so I like looking forward and believe that we will continue to command those market-leading rents and grow NOI from this point forward."

From a forward-looking perspective, you did pick up on the $175 million of forward capital spend really kind of just a placeholder. And our intent has been pretty consistent. We would like to put the work anywhere from plus or minus $1 billion over the next 5 years.

So that amplifies the bad debt expense. So the apples-to-apples change is really about $1.5 million of improvement. 
So you don't see that on the surface. But then I kind of go back to my earlier comments and really, we're seeing the improvement in our cash basis tenant collection rate so late in the quarter of March and then extending beyond the quarter into April.

With regards to boxes, there's there is definitely a premium. So cap rates are higher for where there are additional boxes.

We are pleased to report another quarter of results reflecting strong progress toward recovery. The tide has continued to rise following the removal of most capacity restrictions across the country. Our portfolio of foot traffic is now back to at least 100% of pre-COVID levels in nearly all of our markets, and we've made meaningful progress on rent collections. Retailer demand is healthy. This is reflected in our strong leasing activity, and we're seeing fewer tenant failures and, therefore, lower move-out activity than we expected. 
We acknowledge that we are not completely out of the woods yet. We are all keenly aware of rising virus cases in many cities across the country as we experience another wave of the pandemic. New mask and vaccine restrictions are emerging, with the risk of perhaps even the return of capacity restrictions in some markets. But with the knowledge and experience that we and our tenants have gained over the last 1.5 years, we feel good about where we stand long term and our ability to weather additional storms. 
And importantly, if we do see new restrictions, we believe that, that impact will be short term. Our industry and specifically Regency's portfolio have proven its resiliency, and this is most evident in the meaningful improvement in our West Coast markets in recent months as all of our tenants were finally allowed to fully operate as the market opened up. I've said this before, and I'll say it again, the best shopping center assets will continue to thrive in the post-pandemic world. 
On last quarter's call, we discussed pivoting to office. We are confident in our path to recovery, and our strong balance sheet and access to low-cost capital give us a competitive advantage in developing and acquiring on an earnings and quality accretive basis. We have a really successful track record in that regard. And so with this pivot, we started our multiphase Westbard project in Bethesda, Maryland, and we expanded our existing project in Richmond, Virginia, which I might add is experiencing robust tenant demand. Looking forward, we remain encouraged and excited about additional opportunities in our pipeline. 
Earlier this week, we also purchased our partner's 80% share in our USAA joint venture, a great opportunity to allocate capital on an accretive basis into high-quality assets that we have known and operated for 20 years. We raised equity during the quarter through our ATM on a forward basis, funding this transaction as well as providing additional capacity for future investments. As always, we are active in pursuing and evaluating acquisition opportunities. 
In today's transaction market, however, we do continue to see even greater competition for deals. There's been meaningful capital formation targeting high-quality grocery-anchored neighborhood and community centers as the investment market appreciates the demonstrated performance and resiliency of these high-quality assets. So as a result and as you would expect, we've seen continued compression in cap rates for these types of assets across all of our target markets. 
Before I turn it over to Jim, I'd like to take just a moment to touch on something that's extremely important to Regency and to me. One of the highlights of the second quarter for us was the release of our 2020 Corporate Responsibility Report, which allows us the opportunity each year to showcase our leading ESG practices. We are proud of our accomplishments across all 4 pillars of our strategy, our people, our communities, governance and environmental stewardship. So please allow me this opportunity to share several highlights from this report and our progress over the last year. 
And again, these are just highlights: the development and implementation of a more robust diversity, equity and inclusion strategy; a gender pay gap that is now essentially zero; impressive philanthropic efforts by our team members in what was a really challenging personal environment as well as professional; increased tenant and community engagement during the pandemic, for which we were recently recognized by ICSC with 3 Maxi awards; further progress on Board diversity and refreshment; the introduction of an ESG metric for executive compensation; the issuance of our first TCFD report on climate change risk; and finally, outperformance in our reduction targets for greenhouse gas emissions, energy efficiency and waste diversion. 
Strong corporate responsibility is a foundation of our company. It's ingrained in our culture. And no doubt, it's part of what makes us great. And just as we approach all aspects of our business, we look to continue to improve and evolve our best practices over time. Jim?"

Thanks, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. We remain encouraged by continued improvement in operating trends in our portfolio, including increased foot traffic, higher rent collections and strengthening leasing activity. We took another big step in our recovery during the second quarter as many more operating restrictions were lifted, providing a necessary catalyst to convert many more of our tenants back to rent paying status. While the progress and results are very rewarding, we realize it's not all clear sailing. We continue to monitor the implication of rising COVID case levels and implementation of mask and vaccine mandates in certain geographies around the country. 
But in contrast to earlier periods of the pandemic, vaccines are now widely available. Consumers are resuming more normal behaviors, shopping at stores, eating at restaurants and working out of fitness [indiscernible] As of mid-July, nearly all of our 22 markets are now at or above 100% of 2019 foot traffic levels. And after nearly 1.5 years of operating in this environment, many of our tenants have learned to roll with the punches, demonstrating resiliency and creativity in adapting to an evolving normal. 
Moving to rent collections. We again saw improvement in all regions with Q2 and July collections both at 96% at this point. Our unresolved rent bucket continues to shrink. As tenants have been able to get back to fully operating, our teams have been successfully working to get them rent paying again. Our leased and commenced occupancy rates ticked up this quarter, reflecting reduced move-outs but also strong leasing activity, which I'll touch on. But more importantly, our net effective rent paying occupancy, which we discussed previously, is up over 150 basis points sequentially to north of 88%. We continue to believe this is the best indicator of our recovery progress. 
We also had another strong leasing quarter, exceeding 2019 levels on both new and renewal leasing as our teams are working tirelessly to get vacant space backfilled to accommodate the demand we are seeing. We are pleased to see great activity across all regions, including the harder hit states out west. Our leasing pipelines look healthy for the remainder of the year, with active interest from tenants in categories such as grocery, medical, restaurants, fitness, pet-related uses, off-price health and wellness and some traditional mall retailers like home, athletic, eyewear and cosmetics. 
Although activity is strong, we are seeing some impact from rising material costs, labor shortages and permitting backlogs at local municipalities, all contributing to continued pressure on rent commencement timing. Our tenants are also experiencing inflationary cost pressures and staffing shortages in the normal course of operating their businesses. But we're hearing when we speak with our tenants that they are generally able to pass on many of these higher costs to consumers, especially in the trade areas that we operate in, reflected in strong sales among many of our grocery and restaurant tenants. 
We saw improvement in rent growth in the second quarter as well as we are making fewer short-term pandemic-related concessions to bridge our tenants. We continue to push embedded rent steps to maximize revenue and cash NOI growth over the life of the lease. And our GAAP rent spreads are back above 10% and closer to our 15% historical average levels. As our leasing activities ramp back up, we also remain focused on maintaining a prudent level of CapEx spend. 
Our positive momentum in leasing activity also extends to our end process, ground-up development and redevelopment projects. At our crossing Clarendon redevelopment in Arlington, Virginia, we're very excited to announce that we just signed a new lease with Lifetime. This premier health and wellness club with a co-working component will take over 100,000 square feet of the 4-story Loft building, reducing lease-up risk by bringing the project to over 90% leased from 3% a quarter ago and providing an earlier-than-expected rent commencement date. 
At the Abbot in Cambridge, Massachusetts, we have 4 signed leases and we've seen significant increase in office market tours now that restrictions have lifted, employees are returning to offices in Boston and students are returning to Harvard. 
As mentioned on our last call, in the second quarter, we started Phase 1 of our mixed-use Westbard project in Bethesda, Maryland. The first phase of this project will include a new giant-anchored 120,000 square foot podium-style retail building with structured parking and about 100 senior living units being developed in partnership with a best-in-class senior housing developer operator. Regency's net project cost for this phase will be about $37 million, net of land sale proceeds. We are seeing some modest impacts from higher construction material and labor costs, but our underwriting had cost escalations built in for that. And thus far, the impacts to our rejections have been minimal. 
In summary, we have a lot of good things happening. We're very encouraged by the trends we're seeing and the progress we've made, due in large part to the hard work of our management, leasing and development teams in the field. Mike?"

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll begin by addressing second quarter results and then walk through the changes in our full year guidance as well as the moving parts of the JV portfolio transaction and capital raise. 
Second quarter NAREIT FFO was $0.99 per share, helped by several items. Uncollectible lease income was a positive $7 million in the quarter as reserves on current period billings of approximately $5 million were more than offset by the collection of 2020 reserve revenues associated with cash basis tenants of close to $12 million. You can see this breakout of our uncollectible lease income on our COVID disclosure, Page 33 of the supplemental. 
As you may recall, our previous full year guidance range assumed about $30 million collection of 2020 reserves during '21, while we have already exceeded that as of quarter end. We also benefited from a higher recovery rate in the second quarter following a better-than-anticipated outcome from our annual reconciliation process. We do expect our recovery rate to revert back to more normal levels going forward. Most importantly, we are seeing higher-than-expected collection rates on our cash basis tenants of 86% in the second quarter. That's up from 78% in the first. 
During the quarter, we raised close to $150 million of common equity through our ATM program on a forward basis at an average price of about $64.50 per share. We currently plan to settle in the third quarter roughly $85 million to fund the equity component of our recently completed USAA JV buyout and view the balance of the capital raise as capacity for future funding of investment opportunities. We can settle the remaining shares at any time before June of 2022.
The buyout of our JV partner's 80% interest in the portfolio closed effective August 1. As Lisa mentioned, this was a unique opportunity to invest in high-quality assets on a leverage-neutral and earnings-accretive basis. The cap rate was about 5.5%. In addition to the partial settlement of the forward ATM, funding for the transaction includes our assumption of the partner share of mortgage debt and $13 million of promote income received upon liquidation of the JV. 
Turning to guidance, we point you to the detail in our earnings slide deck posted to our website. We've previously discussed the larger needle movers to our earnings. And they certainly continue to move in the right direction, resulting in another healthy increase to our full year expectations. The most meaningful change that we made was to our same-property NOI forecast, up 725 basis points at the midpoint, and we reconcile the components of these changes in our slide deck. Of this change, 225 basis points is attributable to an increase in our forecast for the collection of rent previously reserved in 2020. Our forecast for the year is now $45 million up from $30 million previously. Of the $45 million, as I mentioned earlier, we have recognized about $32 million through quarter end and have collected another $3 million in July. 
The other 500 basis points of the guidance increase is driven by fundamental current year improvement, supported by higher collection rates from cash basis tenants and lower move-out activity, reflecting the progress we experienced through the second quarter and raised expectations for the balance of the year. Please also note that we've added the $13 million promote income tied to the JV portfolio transaction to our NAREIT FFO forecast, which will be recognized in the third quarter. We will not include this onetime transactional income in our core operating earnings metric. 
While we have not yet moved any tenants back to accrual basis accounting from cash basis, we are continuing with our evaluation and expect a subset of tenants that have remained current on rent to qualify in the second half of this year. While conversions may have a positive impact on straight-line rent and NAREIT FFO, we have not yet included any of this movement into our revised guidance range. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we remain on very solid footing as our free cash flows continue to grow meaningfully. Benefiting from a low payout ratio without having reduced our dividend, our leverage continues on a visible path back to pre-pandemic levels. We have cash on hand, full revolver capacity, no unsecured debt maturities until 2024 and balance sheet capacity remaining from our forward equity raise to be opportunistic. 
As we have discussed previously, we continue to expect our recovery back to 2019 NOI levels by the end of next year on an annualized basis, primarily due to the time it takes for rent to commence on backfilling vacant space. So with every dollar of reserved rent that we are able to recover and with every tenant, we can convert back to rent pain rather than absorb the vacancy, the shallower the trough and the higher the level from which we will continue to grow. With that, we look forward to taking your questions."

So if you think about that buying opportunity, this was a really good opportunity for that consortium to crystallize a return. And we were able to take advantage of that. And as with any JV, whether single asset or portfolio, the partner is likely your best first option as a buyer. And we were there ready for that. We were very happy to buy in these properties.

And I'm going to do the best I can, but it's very difficult to predict the timing of those collections. And we did offer the $3 million in July. So at least we have that kind of larger pop that everyone can put into their models. But I think beyond that, my advice would be to kind of consider it on a straight-line basis as we finish out the year. We do obviously feel confident in that $45 million midpoint number. It can move around within the range. We could collect a little bit more. We may collect a little bit less. It is an unpredictable -- it is a challenging number, obviously, to get our arms around given the changes we had throughout the year. As I think about the same property range, just to bring it up a little bit and maybe these bookends will be helpful for everyone, is we -- the midpoint of the range is essentially assuming that, that net effective rent paying occupancy level, which we described as about 88% today, just continues to grind higher through the balance of the year. So said another way, cash basis tenants, we are anticipating a slow northward trajectory on their collection rates. They're at 86% today. That's 20% higher than they were coming into the year in January. So we've had a remarkable level of increase there. I said this on last quarter's call, I just reiterate it. If you -- to think about that range, 1% collection rate on our cash basis tenants is worth about $3 million on a full year basis of income. So that can also help us -- help everyone think about the tolerances in the range. And I think with that book end of the 1% equals $3 million. I think with the $45 million of which all but $10 million has been accounted for and collected at this point in time, I think with those 2 pieces, we're just trying to be as transparent as possible. That will help everyone think about that full year range that we've offered."

Our philosophy on prudent CapEx spend certainly impacts this metric. And having said that, I'd say our CapEx as a percent of total NOI tends to be at the lower end of the peer group, which does allow us to maximize free cash flow. As we sit there and look at our business and try to make asset management decisions, we look at total rent. And total rent includes, obviously, these initial spreads, embedded rent steps which we continue to be very successful in achieving, growing expense recoveries which we, I think, do very well year in, year out and continue to lease up our space back to historic levels. I think in combination, all those actions are going to result in the larger objective of creating sustainable NOI and earnings growth in the long run."

But I can't -- it's equally hard for me to give you an estimate there. The best we can do is be as transparent as possible, which includes really 2 things. One, is likely that some tenants will flip back to accrual accounting this year. And as I talked about last quarter and then this, there's about 13% of our ABR that's current on rent -- that is currently classified as cash basis tenants. So that would be an indicator of how large that potential population could be. And I'm not saying that all of those will flip in because we are setting pretty high thresholds and standards before we will convert a tenant from cash basis to accrual.

We are pleased to report another quarter of results reflecting strong progress toward recovery. The tide has continued to rise following the removal of most capacity restrictions across the country. Our portfolio of foot traffic is now back to at least 100% of pre-COVID levels in nearly all of our markets, and we've made meaningful progress on rent collections. Retailer demand is healthy. This is reflected in our strong leasing activity, and we're seeing fewer tenant failures and, therefore, lower move-out activity than we expected. 
We acknowledge that we are not completely out of the woods yet. We are all keenly aware of rising virus cases in many cities across the country as we experience another wave of the pandemic. New mask and vaccine restrictions are emerging, with the risk of perhaps even the return of capacity restrictions in some markets. But with the knowledge and experience that we and our tenants have gained over the last 1.5 years, we feel good about where we stand long term and our ability to weather additional storms. 
And importantly, if we do see new restrictions, we believe that, that impact will be short term. Our industry and specifically Regency's portfolio have proven its resiliency, and this is most evident in the meaningful improvement in our West Coast markets in recent months as all of our tenants were finally allowed to fully operate as the market opened up. I've said this before, and I'll say it again, the best shopping center assets will continue to thrive in the post-pandemic world. 
On last quarter's call, we discussed pivoting to office. We are confident in our path to recovery, and our strong balance sheet and access to low-cost capital give us a competitive advantage in developing and acquiring on an earnings and quality accretive basis. We have a really successful track record in that regard. And so with this pivot, we started our multiphase Westbard project in Bethesda, Maryland, and we expanded our existing project in Richmond, Virginia, which I might add is experiencing robust tenant demand. Looking forward, we remain encouraged and excited about additional opportunities in our pipeline. 
Earlier this week, we also purchased our partner's 80% share in our USAA joint venture, a great opportunity to allocate capital on an accretive basis into high-quality assets that we have known and operated for 20 years. We raised equity during the quarter through our ATM on a forward basis, funding this transaction as well as providing additional capacity for future investments. As always, we are active in pursuing and evaluating acquisition opportunities. 
In today's transaction market, however, we do continue to see even greater competition for deals. There's been meaningful capital formation targeting high-quality grocery-anchored neighborhood and community centers as the investment market appreciates the demonstrated performance and resiliency of these high-quality assets. So as a result and as you would expect, we've seen continued compression in cap rates for these types of assets across all of our target markets. 
Before I turn it over to Jim, I'd like to take just a moment to touch on something that's extremely important to Regency and to me. One of the highlights of the second quarter for us was the release of our 2020 Corporate Responsibility Report, which allows us the opportunity each year to showcase our leading ESG practices. We are proud of our accomplishments across all 4 pillars of our strategy, our people, our communities, governance and environmental stewardship. So please allow me this opportunity to share several highlights from this report and our progress over the last year. 
And again, these are just highlights: the development and implementation of a more robust diversity, equity and inclusion strategy; a gender pay gap that is now essentially zero; impressive philanthropic efforts by our team members in what was a really challenging personal environment as well as professional; increased tenant and community engagement during the pandemic, for which we were recently recognized by ICSC with 3 MAXI Awards; further progress on Board diversity and refreshment; the introduction of an ESG metric for executive compensation; the issuance of our first TCFD report on climate change risk; and finally, outperformance in our reduction targets for greenhouse gas emissions, energy efficiency and waste diversion. 
Strong corporate responsibility is a foundation of our company. It's ingrained in our culture. And no doubt, it's part of what makes us great. And just as we approach all aspects of our business, we look to continue to improve and evolve our best practices over time. Jim?"

We remain encouraged by continued improvement in operating trends in our portfolio, including increased foot traffic, higher rent collections and strengthening leasing activity. We took another big step in our recovery during the second quarter as many more operating restrictions were lifted, providing a necessary catalyst to convert many more of our tenants back to rent paying status. 
While the progress and results are very rewarding, we realize it's not all clear sailing. We continue to monitor the implication of rising COVID case levels and implementation of mask and vaccine mandates in certain geographies around the country. 
But in contrast to earlier periods of the pandemic, vaccines are now widely available. Consumers are resuming more normal behaviors, shopping at stores, eating at restaurants and working out at fitness clubs. As of mid-July, nearly all of our 22 markets are now at or above 100% of 2019 foot traffic levels. And after nearly 1.5 years of operating in this environment, many of our tenants have learned to roll with the punches, demonstrating resiliency and creativity in adapting to an evolving normal. 
Moving to rent collections. We again saw improvement in all regions with Q2 and July collections both at 96% at this point. Our unresolved rent bucket continues to shrink. As tenants have been able to get back to fully operating, our teams have been successfully working to get them rent paying again. Our leased and commenced occupancy rates ticked up this quarter, reflecting reduced move-outs but also strong leasing activity, which I'll touch on. But more importantly, our net effective rent paying occupancy, which we discussed previously, is up over 150 basis points sequentially to north of 88%. We continue to believe this is the best indicator of our recovery progress. 
We also had another strong leasing quarter, exceeding 2019 levels on both new and renewal leasing as our teams are working tirelessly to get vacant space backfilled to accommodate the demand we are seeing. We are pleased to see great activity across all regions, including the harder hit states out west. Our leasing pipelines look healthy for the remainder of the year, with active interest from tenants in categories such as grocery, medical, restaurants, fitness, pet-related uses, off-price, health and wellness and some traditional mall retailers like home, athletic, eyewear and cosmetics. 
Although activity is strong, we are seeing some impact from rising material costs, labor shortages and permitting backlogs at local municipalities, all contributing to continued pressure on rent commencement timing. Our tenants are also experiencing inflationary cost pressures and staffing shortages in the normal course of operating their businesses. But we're hearing when we speak with our tenants that they are generally able to pass on many of these higher costs to consumers, especially in the trade areas that we operate in, reflected in strong sales among many of our grocery and restaurant tenants. 
We saw improvement in rent growth in the second quarter as well as we are making fewer short-term pandemic-related concessions to bridge our tenants. We continue to push embedded rent steps to maximize revenue and cash NOI growth over the life of the lease. And our GAAP rent spreads are back above 10% and closer to our 15% historical average levels. As our leasing activities ramp back up, we also remain focused on maintaining a prudent level of CapEx spend. 
Our positive momentum in leasing activity also extends to our end process, ground-up development and redevelopment projects. At our crossing Clarendon redevelopment in Arlington, Virginia, we're very excited to announce that we just signed a new lease with Life Time. This premier health and wellness club with a co-working component will take over 100,000 square feet of the 4-story Loft building, reducing lease-up risk by bringing the project to over 90% leased from 3% a quarter ago and providing an earlier-than-expected rent commencement date. 
At the Abbot in Cambridge, Massachusetts, we have 4 signed leases and we've seen significant increase in office market tours now that restrictions have lifted, employees are returning to offices in Boston and students are returning to Harvard. 
As mentioned on our last call, in the second quarter, we started Phase 1 of our mixed-use Westbard project in Bethesda, Maryland. The first phase of this project will include a new giant-anchored 120,000 square foot podium-style retail building with structured parking and about 100 senior living units being developed in partnership with a best-in-class senior housing developer operator. 
Regency's net project cost for this phase will be about $37 million, net of land sale proceeds. We are seeing some modest impacts from higher construction material and labor costs, but our underwriting had cost escalations built in for that. And thus far, the impacts to our rejections have been minimal. 
In summary, we have a lot of good things happening. We're very encouraged by the trends we're seeing and the progress we've made, due in large part to the hard work of our management, leasing and development teams in the field. Mike?"

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll begin by addressing second quarter results and then walk through the changes in our full year guidance as well as the moving parts of the JV portfolio transaction and capital raise. 
Second quarter NAREIT FFO was $0.99 per share, helped by several items. Uncollectible lease income was a positive $7 million in the quarter as reserves on current period billings of approximately $5 million were more than offset by the collection of 2020 reserve revenues associated with cash basis tenants of close to $12 million. You can see this breakout of our uncollectible lease income on our COVID disclosure, Page 33 of the supplemental. 
As you may recall, our previous full year guidance range assumed about $30 million collection of 2020 reserves during '21, while we have already exceeded that as of quarter end. We also benefited from a higher recovery rate in the second quarter following a better-than-anticipated outcome from our annual reconciliation process. We do expect our recovery rate to revert back to more normal levels going forward. Most importantly, we are seeing higher-than-expected collection rates on our cash basis tenants of 86% in the second quarter. That's up from 78% in the first. 
During the quarter, we raised close to $150 million of common equity through our ATM program on a forward basis at an average price of about $64.50 per share. We currently plan to settle in the third quarter roughly $85 million to fund the equity component of our recently completed USAA JV buyout and view the balance of the capital raise as capacity for future funding of investment opportunities. We can settle the remaining shares at any time before June of 2022.
The buyout of our JV partner's 80% interest in the portfolio closed effective August 1. As Lisa mentioned, this was a unique opportunity to invest in high-quality assets on a leverage-neutral and earnings-accretive basis. The cap rate was about 5.5%. In addition to the partial settlement of the forward ATM, funding for the transaction includes our assumption of the partner share of mortgage debt and $13 million of promote income received upon liquidation of the JV. 
Turning to guidance, we point you to the detail in our earnings slide deck posted to our website. We've previously discussed the larger needle movers to our earnings. And they certainly continue to move in the right direction, resulting in another healthy increase to our full year expectations. The most meaningful change that we made was to our same-property NOI forecast, up 725 basis points at the midpoint, and we reconcile the components of these changes in our slide deck. Of this change, 225 basis points is attributable to an increase in our forecast for the collection of rent previously reserved in 2020. Our forecast for the year is now $45 million up from $30 million previously. Of the $45 million, as I mentioned earlier, we have recognized about $32 million through quarter end and have collected another $3 million in July. 
The other 500 basis points of the guidance increase is driven by fundamental current year improvement, supported by higher collection rates from cash basis tenants and lower move-out activity, reflecting the progress we experienced through the second quarter and raised expectations for the balance of the year. Please also note that we've added the $13 million promote income tied to the JV portfolio transaction to our NAREIT FFO forecast, which will be recognized in the third quarter. We will not include this onetime transactional income in our core operating earnings metric. 
While we have not yet moved any tenants back to accrual basis accounting from cash basis, we are continuing with our evaluation and expect a subset of tenants that have remained current on rent to qualify in the second half of this year. While conversions may have a positive impact on straight-line rent and NAREIT FFO, we have not yet included any of this movement into our revised guidance range. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we remain on very solid footing as our free cash flows continue to grow meaningfully. Benefiting from a low payout ratio without having reduced our dividend, our leverage continues on a visible path back to pre-pandemic levels. We have cash on hand, full revolver capacity, no unsecured debt maturities until 2024 and balance sheet capacity remaining from our forward equity raise to be opportunistic. 
As we have discussed previously, we continue to expect our recovery back to 2019 NOI levels by the end of next year on an annualized basis, primarily due to the time it takes for rent to commence on backfilling vacant space. So with every dollar of reserved rent that we are able to recover and with every tenant, we can convert back to rent pain rather than absorb the vacancy, the shallower the trough and the higher the level from which we will continue to grow. 
With that, we look forward to taking your questions."

So if you think about that buying opportunity, this was a really good opportunity for that consortium to crystallize a return. And we were able to take advantage of that. And as with any JV, whether single asset or portfolio, the partner is likely your best first option as a buyer. And we were there ready for that. We were very happy to buy in these properties.

It's not just the shopping center owners that are speaking. It's their real constituents that own businesses, operate businesses and live in the communities that have the loud voices.

And I'm going to do the best I can, but it's very difficult to predict the timing of those collections. And we did offer the $3 million in July. So at least we have that kind of larger pop that everyone can put into their models. But I think beyond that, my advice would be to kind of consider it on a straight-line basis as we finish out the year. We do obviously feel confident in that $45 million midpoint number. 
It can move around within the range. We could collect a little bit more. We may collect a little bit less. It is an unpredictable -- it is a challenging number, obviously, to get our arms around given the changes we had throughout the year. 
As I think about the same property range, just to bring it up a little bit and maybe these bookends will be helpful for everyone, is we -- the midpoint of the range is essentially assuming that, that net effective rent paying occupancy level, which we described as about 88% today, just continues to grind higher through the balance of the year. So said another way, cash basis tenants, we are anticipating a slow northward trajectory on their collection rates. They're at 86% today. That's 20% higher than they were coming into the year in January. 
So we've had a remarkable level of increase there. I said this on last quarter's call, I just reiterate it. If you -- to think about that range, 1% collection rate on our cash basis tenants is worth about $3 million on a full year basis of income. So that can also help us -- help everyone think about the tolerances in the range. And I think with that book end of the 1% equals $3 million. I think with the $45 million of which all but $10 million has been accounted for and collected at this point in time, I think with those 2 pieces, we're just trying to be as transparent as possible. That will help everyone think about that full year range that we've offered."

And having said that, I'd say our CapEx as a percent of total NOI tends to be at the lower end of the peer group, which does allow us to maximize free cash flow. As we sit there and look at our business and try to make asset management decisions, we look at total rent. And total rent includes, obviously, these initial spreads, embedded rent steps which we continue to be very successful in achieving, growing expense recoveries which we, I think, do very well year in, year out and continue to lease up our space back to historic levels. I think in combination, all those actions are going to result in the larger objective of creating sustainable NOI and earnings growth in the long run."

But I can't -- it's equally hard for me to give you an estimate there. 
The best we can do is be as transparent as possible, which includes really 2 things. One, is likely that some tenants will flip back to accrual accounting this year. And as I talked about last quarter and then this, there's about 13% of our ABR that's current on rent -- that is currently classified as cash basis tenants. So that would be an indicator of how large that potential population could be. 
And I'm not saying that all of those will flip in because we are setting pretty high thresholds and standards before we will convert a tenant from cash basis to accrual. And then lastly, let me just add, this is why we continue to report on and use core operating earnings as an earnings metric. We are eliminating the impact of the noncash. This is how we're running our business. This is how we talk about making decisions internally. This is what we've talked to our Board about.

We feel really good about the progress that we've made toward recovery and also with the improvement we're seeing in our operating trends. Our third quarter results are reflective of a healthy environment for open air, grocery-anchored shopping centers. And not only are we feeling closer to normal, but we're excited about what the future holds. 
I'm also really pleased to report that despite the recent concern about potential impacts from the Delta variant, we've continued to make meaningful progress on rent collections, narrowing the gap further as nearly all of our tenants are in a position to pay us full current rent. 
Steady retailer demand is driving strong leasing activity, which, combined with reduced tenant move-outs, has moved the needle on occupancy. We've also had success maintaining leverage in our lease negotiations, driving contractual rent growth and remaining prudent on CapEx while further improving our rent spreads. Our team has been working really hard to drive deals that will lead to long-term growth and the value of our assets. 
As a result of these positive trends and an increased pace of improvement, we're again raising full year guidance for 2021. In recent quarters, we've discussed that we believe the recovery of NOI back to 2019 levels would likely occur in the second half of 2022 on an annualized basis. But given the rate of progress we've seen in recent months, we are now pulling that forward to the first half of 2022. 
We've also increased our dividend by 5%, a reflection of our confidence in a return to sustained growth over the long term. You'll recall, and I know you're probably sick of this, but I can't possibly remind you enough that we never cut our dividend during the pandemic. We are committed to growing our dividend while also accretively investing our sector-leading free cash flow to drive solid total returns for our shareholders. 
And that's a good segue into our investment and capital allocation strategy where we remain on our front foot. The private transaction markets are competitive. They remain competitive, and we've continued to see downward pressure on cap rates as more buyers have emerged for high-quality, well-located grocery-anchored centers, but our strong balance sheet and access to low-cost capital provide a competitive advantage that allows us to be opportunistic. And we do have a long track record of investing with discipline on a leverage-neutral and earnings-accretive basis. 
Our pipeline is active, and we continue to see good opportunities. With that, we just announced that we're under contract to acquire Blakeney Shopping Center, a dominant grocery-anchored community town center in South Charlotte. This is a high-quality, well-leased center with strong demographics and a tenant mix that fits well with our strategy. Our Southeast team is excited to bring this exceptional asset into the Regency portfolio, and we expect the transaction to close this month. 
The addition of high-quality centers like Blakeney, along with our development and redevelopment program, are important to portfolio enhancement. At the same time, we remain committed to selling centers that are lower growth or nonstrategic or when it's clear to us that maximizing the value of a property involves a predominantly non-retail use. For example, our recent sale of the former Sears box adjacent to our Hancock Center in Austin was in that last bucket where we determined that its highest and best use was medical office. The addition of this office component and the traffic that it will generate to our site will enhance the value of this well-leased center where HEB is currently expanding its highly productive store, but our best risk reward proposition is to invest capital into strong grocery-anchored neighborhood and community retail, which is the bread and butter of Regency strategy. This commitment to portfolio enhancement has proven to and will continue to fortify our future NOI growth. 
In closing, our shopping centers are well positioned to benefit from long-term migration and flexible work trends that favor suburban trade areas, and we are actively positioning our portfolio to thrive today and into the future. If the industry has learned anything over the last 18 months, during which we saw hyper-accelerated digital commerce and fulfillment and distribution challenges, it's that having brick-and-mortar locations close to where consumers live is critical to retailer success.

We remain encouraged by the continued improvement in our portfolio operating trends accelerated by the reopening of the West Coast this summer. Our tenants are generally fully open and operating in all markets, with the lifting of restrictions translating into higher rent collections and continued strong leasing activity. 
Portfolio foot traffic rebounded back to 100% of 2019 foot traffic levels as of late October despite the slight dip in September related to the Delta variant. Many of our tenants are experiencing positive sales trends in 2021, with grocers holding their gains from 2020 and many restaurants reporting record high productivity. 
We continue to see further sequential improvement in rent collections, with Q3 collections at 98%. Notably, our collection rate for deferrals remains high at over 95% year-to-date. Translation, tenants are honoring their commitments. 
Our leased occupancy rate is up 50 basis points over the second quarter after adjusting for the sale of the vacant former Sears building at the Hancock Center Lisa just mentioned. These gains were driven by strong leasing activity and fewer tenant move-outs. Most importantly, our net effective rent-paying occupancy also rose this quarter and is now over 90%. As we've noted previously, this metric is the best indicator of our recovery progress. 
As noted, leasing activity continues to be robust, and we remain encouraged by the strength of our pipeline. Q3 total leasing volumes were 125% of 2019 quarterly averages. Shop renewal rates were 80%, elevated over historical trends. Rent spreads continued to improve to a blended rate of over 5%, while our GAAP rent spreads also continued to get closer to pre-COVID levels at over 12%. We are maintaining contractual rent growth on leasing activity in line with recent years, with embedded rent steps on more than 80% of our leases executed this quarter. Additionally, our weighted average lease term for deals has risen back above pre-COVID levels. 
So to summarize, our leasing trends are moving in the right direction, enabling us to maximize NOI growth for the long term. All of that said, we are fully aware and acknowledge that retailers today are facing challenges related to labor shortages, cost inflation, supply chain disruptions and permitting backlogs. While these issues are impacting build-out costs and tenant rent commencement timing, so far, this has only been on the margin for Regency. That said, we will continue to monitor these issues, and we'll work closely with our tenants to help them manage through them where we can. 
Moving to development activity. We continue to make good progress on our in-process ground-up and redevelopment projects, and we completed a $21 million Bloomingdale Square redevelopment in Tampa this quarter. We reimagine and modernize the center by repurposing a former Walmart box to accommodate an expansion and relocation of a highly productive existing Publix and backfill the former grocery box with a new LA Fitness. We added more visible and functional shop space and made enhancements and renovations to the remaining portions of the center. This successful project helped to cement this center's relevancy and dominance in its trade area while generating a return of over 8%. 
Construction cost inflation and labor shortages are real and are creating some pressures but are not materially impacting the current yields and cost in our in-process projects. We are keeping our finger on the pulse on these trends and are being very thoughtful in our cost projections and delivery timing when underwriting new and potential pipeline projects. 
In summary, we are very pleased with the positive momentum that we continue to experience in our operating portfolio and in our value creation pipeline, driving us closer to full recovery and supporting our future growth.

816889,1683250161,2427733,"Regency Centers Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2021",2021-11-05,"Earnings Calls","Regency Centers Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. I'll provide some color around third quarter results, walk through the changes to full year 2021 guidance and offer some helpful reminders when thinking about next year. Third quarter NAREIT FFO of $1.12 per share wa",962,"Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. I'll provide some color around third quarter results, walk through the changes to full year 2021 guidance and offer some helpful reminders when thinking about next year. 
Third quarter NAREIT FFO of $1.12 per share was helped by several items. Uncollectible lease income was a positive $10 million in the quarter, the details of which we've broken out on Page 33 of our supplemental. We reserved over $4 million on third quarter billings, which is down from over $10 million a quarter ago, associated with uncollected revenues from cash basis tenants. This was more than offset by the collection of nearly $6 million of amounts reserved during the first half of 2021 as well as the collection of close to $9 million of revenues that were originally reserved in 2020. 
Our full year '21 guidance calls for a $46 million positive impact from the collection of 2020 reserves, of which we have recognized $41 million through the third quarter. We also recognized close to $14 million of onetime promote income in the third quarter related to the USAA JV transaction, which positively impacted NAREIT FFO but is not included in our core operating earnings metric. 
Finally, straight-line rent in the third quarter benefited from the reversal of reserves triggered by the conversion of some cash basis tenants back to accrual accounting as reflected in uncollectible straight-line rent at a positive $4 million. This is a noncash accounting impact that contributes to NAREIT FFO but, again, did not impact our core operating earnings. 
Following these conversions, which represent about 5% of ABR, we now have 22% of our ABR remaining on a cash basis of accounting. For this smaller pool, our cash basis collection rate was 91% in the third quarter, a 700 basis point increase from a quarter ago. The collection rate on the old pool before the conversion was 93% in the third quarter, up from the 86% in the second quarter that we disclosed on the last call. 
As Jim mentioned, our net effective rent-paying occupancy now exceeds 90% as we've continued to narrow the spread between rent paying and our commenced occupancy rate due to the progress we've made increasing collections on cash basis tenants. We remain in a great position from a balance sheet perspective as cash flows continue to recover and leverage even after excluding prior year reserve collections has returned to prepandemic levels. We ended the quarter with full capacity on our revolver, and we have no unsecured debt maturities until 2024. 
You'll recall that we issued about $150 million of equity in Q2 through our ATM program on a forward basis. We settled a portion of that during the third quarter to fund the USAA transaction, generating $83 million of net proceeds. The remainder is unsettled, which we view as capacity for future investment opportunities, and we have until June of 2022 to issue the shares. We did not raise any additional equity capital during the third quarter. 
Turning to guidance, we point you to the detail in our business update slide deck posted to our website. A big driver of the $0.12 increase in the midpoint of our core operating earnings range comes from a higher same-property NOI growth forecast as we increased the range by 150 basis points at the midpoint. This increase was driven almost entirely by core improvement, including a higher cash basis collection rate on current year billings and lower move-out activity. As I mentioned, our forecast for the collection of prior year 2020 reserves is up only slightly at $46 million. 
Other drivers of the increase to full year core operating earnings expectations include higher lease termination fees and lower G&A. Our NAREIT FFO range has increased by an additional $0.05 at the midpoint on top of the change I just described, primarily driven by the increase in straight-line rent associated with the conversion of tenants back to accrual from cash basis during the third quarter. While it's possible that we may convert additional tenants back to accrual during the fourth quarter, our guidance does not assume any additional reversal of straight-line rent reserves. 
I'd like to point out that these noncash accounting impacts are a big reason why we provide and guide to core operating earnings in addition to NAREIT FFO. This metric excludes noncash amounts such as straight-line rent and mark-to-market adjustments and can provide a much cleaner picture of our earnings trajectory. 
We will provide 2022 guidance with Q4 results in February as we normally do, but we wanted to remind everyone of some of the bigger nonrecurring moving pieces that have been disclosed and discussed throughout the year when thinking about modeling for next year. First, our $46 million guidance for collection of 2020 reserves is a prior period adjustment, not associated with 2021 billings. Second, we recognized abnormally high expense recoveries of about $3.5 million net of reserves in the second quarter related to the 2020 expense reconciliation process. Third, G&A during the first quarter benefited by about $2 million from the forfeiture of previously expensed share grants related to the departure of our CIO earlier this year. And lastly, although not impacting core operating earnings, we recognized close to $14 million of promote income in the third quarter. We look forward to discussing our 2022 outlook in more detail, together with next quarter's results. 
As Lisa mentioned, given the pace of improvement we have experienced to this point of the year, we now expect the recovery of our NOI back to 2019 levels will occur on an annualized basis at some point during the first half of next year. That's about 6 months earlier than we had previously expected. 
With that, we look forward to taking your questions."

So I just want to make sure we kind of get that out there and explain some of the pieces here. About -- as you have, you've done the math, it's about $0.06 per share at the midpoint. About 1/3 of that -- and again, I'm speaking to core operating earnings, not NAREIT FFO. About 1/3 of that is going to be, as you mentioned, a result of 2020 or prior year collections, decelerating. So that -- the trajectory there, as you can see, is gone from $20 million -- over $20 million in the first quarter to roughly $9 million in the third. We have guided to that number being about $5 million in the fourth. About 1/3 of that deceleration in the fourth quarter comes from other -- what I would call, other NOI line items, percentage rent, settlement and income. We did have a bit of a frothy third quarter. So that should decelerate in the fourth. And then we do -- as you look at the G&A guidance, you'll see that the fourth quarter from a run rate perspective will be slightly higher than the third. So those are the drivers kind of decelerating into the end of this year. 
As we think about next, it's -- uncollectible lease income is going to -- continue to be a story of accelerating our earnings path. We're at about 250 basis points on current year collections through the third quarter as a bad debt charge or an uncollectible lease income charge. If you think about how we finish the year, we -- we're anticipating that our cash basis tenancy continues to climb from a collection rate perspective. I think we might end the year in the plus or minus 170 basis point range as a bad debt expense charge on current year billings. 
And remember, our historical run rates in the 50 basis point range. So we see a tremendous amount of opportunity to continue to close that gap. That's why we keep talking about net effective rent pay and occupancy. We increased that by 200 basis points this quarter. We anticipate that to continue to grind higher into 2022. Much more to come on '22 guidance. I do want to hold that back to February. 
I don't know that we'll get back to our 50 basis point historical run rate by the end of next year, but we do feel pretty confident that we'll just continue to close that gap from that 170 where we think we'll end the current year."

So we did announce the acquisition of Blakeney, which is an exceptional asset. And that -- obviously, the negotiation of that was even prior to last quarter. So the cap rates were already there. 
With the Blakeney acquisition, we are also, if you will, match funding that with very low cap rate dispositions, nonstrategic, in the fourth quarter. And that's what drove the increased guidance for dispositions with that lower cap rate for that. So it's a mix of properties on both the acquisition side and the disposition side specific to Regency. 
Cap rates have compressed all year long. And as I said, quarter-over-quarter, I don't think that there's been much of a change, but there's no question that for the type of property that we already own and, therefore, are looking to add into our portfolio, it's going to be in the 5 -- 4.5 to 5 cap rate range. That's high-quality, grocery-anchored shopping center pricing today. It does not change how we think about acquiring and how we think about adding, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. Portfolio enhancement has always been a really important part of our strategy, and we do believe that continuing to grow with premier high-quality assets like we already own will help fortify our future NOI growth as we dispose of those that perhaps may have a lower growth profile than our average or may be nonstrategic."

Ki, this is Jim. Yes, the velocity has been really good. And as I look at it, I think it's a combination of basically a renewed confidence in the brick-and-mortar business from retailers, certainly pent-up demand from 1.5 years of really not a lot of activity that's opening up. And obviously, we continue to see a nice migration to quality, which we believe we are that answer to migration. But the categories that we're seeing are the ones we've merchandised to for the last 20 years. We're doing a lot of medical deals, pet deals, restaurant, fast casual, banks, personal service. And it -- the demand is really across all regions. It's really -- it's almost imperceptible where there's more demand than others because it's coming from everywhere. 
Like I said, the pipeline -- as we look at our existing pipeline into the 90-day future, if you will, it continues to look very robust. So we have more vacancy than we've had in a long time. So we have product, we have availability, and there appears to be good solid retailer demand for that. And so I'm cautiously optimistic we stay on a nice trajectory."

But in addition to those initial spreads, I think it's important -- which is obviously an important metric. I'd like to step back and kind of take a broader look at what really is going on long term -- to create long-term sustainable NOI. I think one of the components -- contractual rent steps and our ability to manage expense recovery ratios are key contributors. I think appropriate and prudent leasing CapEx, which you touched on, that's a major factor, I think, in long-term earnings growth. Tenant selection, really making sure we're picking the right mix to drive synergy and traffic at our centers but also having a mine coming out of this pandemic environment, make sure we have an eye towards relevancy and survivability of the folks we're dealing with. We want people that are going to be here with us. We don't like the churn space. And all these things matter. 
And in combination with what we're seeing from a GAAP and net effective rent growth at the 12% number I referenced in the remarks, I'm confident that our overall results have us on a very good vector towards the long-term NOI and earnings growth objectives that we're looking for."

So we are anticipating a significant increase, kind of all joking aside, and I appreciate you asking the question, it does give us the opportunity to put this out there. 
2021's run rate on a quarterly basis is in the $19 million range or so. And again, I'll refer to my remarks, recall that we are benefiting this year from that $2 million for future benefit upon Max departure. Next year's run rate is probably going to be closer to -- in the $21 million range on a quarterly basis. What we're capturing in that number is compensation increases together with filling open positions. Some of the benefit we've been incurring in '21 is we've been running a little bit lighter from a headcount plan perspective. 
Increases to T&E, as you mentioned, the entire company is -- we're starting to get back on the road, and there's more conferences being held, businesses being conducted more in-person than on Zoom going forward. And so we're planning for that to return to prepandemic levels. 
And then the last point I'd make is development overhead probably going to be in the flat range to '21 as we continue to build our pipelines. We have the development spend. We'll look a lot in 2022 like it did in '21, and then we anticipate growing that ability to capitalize '23 and beyond."

You got to be current on your rent for an extended period of time. And then I would add to that, there's an overlay of what business are you in? And I'll be frank, some of the labor concerns that we're looking at today are impacting how we think about bringing tenants back to accrual accounting. 
As I look at our AR and our open AR and think about what tenants may or may not qualify, it could be in the 5% of ABR range in the fourth quarter that converts. I don't have a precise number for you on what that could mean from a straight-line rent perspective. But generally speaking, it kind of works pro rata. So every percentage point that we convert is about worth on a pound-for-pound basis, the same.

And what I would say is what's happened over the past 20 months with the disruption, with the hyper-accelerated digital commerce, that's only been validated even further that it is really important to be close to consumers' homes and quality real estate. So I do believe that there has been an increase in demand, maybe a little bit pent-up as people were a little cautious as to how the pandemic would play out. 
But now with hindsight being 2020, the retailers have even more confidence in the importance of being close to the consumer because they do need to be more intentional about last-mile distribution. And the quality of that real estate matters. And I think that, that is -- there's no question, that is what is driving increased healthy demand to Regency shopping centers."

We're really making sure that we are thinking about being proactive to the extent that we can be proactive, whether it be with simply relationships with our retail tenants and our merchants or whether it's what we can do internally. It's all of the above. 
I'm going to try to -- there's no question that the most impactful, because it's -- I believe, it's permanent, is more of the BOPIS, right, and the last-mile distribution. And we have seen that accelerate over the past 24 months. And our retailers and our merchants, as you alluded to, are getting smarter about it and are investing more money in technology. But at the same time, they also -- as I just said in my prior response, they also appreciate in value that last-mile distribution being close to a consumer's home. And I've said it on other calls, and if you had listened to a panel with something that I did -- a conference in September, we had a target real estate representative on the panel, and he said it was like 90% of their orders are fulfilled from the stores. So that is probably the thing that we think about the most and make sure that we're staying as close to and evaluating how can we take advantage of those opportunities, how can we actually play a part in that and play a role in that and partnering with our retailers. And then, of course, supply chain disruption, as Jim talked about, and labor shortages are something that we hope are temporary and transitional. I think that there's probably a little bit more evidence that the labor shortages may be recovering a little bit faster. And that really does impact us and impacts our -- by impacting our tenants so far more than the supply chain has. So it's all of the above. And we use the terms we're on our front foot for investments. We're on our front foot for ensuring that we're staying ahead and evolving with not just changing retailer and merchant preferences, but also changing consumer preferences, really thinking about the next 10 to 12 years."

We feel really good about the progress that we've made toward recovery and also with the improvement we're seeing in our operating trends. Our third quarter results are reflective of a healthy environment for open-air, grocery-anchored shopping centers. And not only are we feeling closer to normal, but we're excited about what the future holds.  
I'm also really pleased to report that despite the recent concern about potential impacts from the Delta variant, we've continued to make meaningful progress on rent collections, narrowing the gap further as nearly all of our tenants are in a position to pay us full current rent.  
Steady retailer demand is driving strong leasing activity, which, combined with reduced tenant move-outs, has moved the needle on occupancy. We've also had success maintaining leverage in our lease negotiations, driving contractual rent growth and remaining prudent on CapEx while further improving our rent spreads. Our team has been working really hard to drive deals that will lead to long-term growth and the value of our assets.  
As a result of these positive trends and an increased pace of improvement, we're again raising full year guidance for 2021. In recent quarters, we've discussed that we believe the recovery of NOI back to 2019 levels would likely occur in the second half of 2022 on an annualized basis. But given the rate of progress we've seen in recent months, we are now pulling that forward to the first half of 2022.  
We've also increased our dividend by 5%, a reflection of our confidence in a return to sustained growth over the long term. You'll recall, and I know you're probably sick of this, but I can't possibly remind you enough that we never cut our dividend during the pandemic. We are committed to growing our dividend while also accretively investing our sector-leading free cash flow to drive solid total returns for our shareholders.  
And that's a good segue into our investment and capital allocation strategy where we remain on our front foot. The private transaction markets are competitive. They remain competitive, and we've continued to see downward pressure on cap rates as more buyers have emerged for high-quality, well-located grocery-anchored centers, but our strong balance sheet and access to low-cost capital provide a competitive advantage that allows us to be opportunistic. And we do have a long track record of investing with discipline on a leverage-neutral and earnings-accretive basis.  Our pipeline is active, and we continue to see good opportunities. 
With that, we just announced that we're under contract to acquire Blakeney Shopping Center, a dominant grocery-anchored community town center in South Charlotte. This is a high-quality, well-leased center with strong demographics and a tenant mix that fits well with our strategy. Our Southeast team is excited to bring this exceptional asset into the Regency portfolio, and we expect the transaction to close this month.  The addition of high-quality centers like Blakeney, along with our development and redevelopment program, are important to portfolio enhancement. 
At the same time, we remain committed to selling centers that are lower growth or nonstrategic or when it's clear to us that maximizing the value of a property involves a predominantly non-retail use. For example, our recent sale of the former Sears box adjacent to our Hancock Center in Austin was in that last bucket where we determined that its highest and best use was medical office. The addition of this office component and the traffic that it will generate to our site will enhance the value of this well-leased center where H-E-B is currently expanding its highly productive store, but our best risk reward proposition is to invest capital into strong grocery-anchored neighborhood and community retail, which is the bread and butter of Regency strategy. This commitment to portfolio enhancement has proven to and will continue to fortify our future NOI growth.  
In closing, our shopping centers are well positioned to benefit from long-term migration and flexible work trends that favor suburban trade areas, and we are actively positioning our portfolio to thrive today and into the future. If the industry has learned anything over the last 18 months, during which we saw hyper-accelerated digital commerce and fulfillment and distribution challenges, it's that having brick-and-mortar locations close to where consumers live is critical to retailer success."

We remain encouraged by the continued improvement in our portfolio operating trends, accelerated by the reopening of the West Coast this summer. Our tenants are generally fully open and operating in all markets with the lifting of restrictions translating into higher rent collections and continued strong leasing activity.  
Portfolio foot traffic rebounded back to 100% of 2019 foot traffic levels as of late October despite the slight dip in September related to the Delta variant. Many of our tenants are experiencing positive sales trends in 2021, with grocers holding their gains from 2020 and many restaurants reporting record high productivity.  
We continue to see further sequential improvement in rent collections, with Q3 collections at 98%. Notably, our collection rate for deferrals remains high at over 95% year-to-date. Translation, tenants are honoring their commitments.  
Our leased occupancy rate is up 50 basis points over the second quarter after adjusting for the sale of the vacant former Sears building at the Hancock Center, Lisa just mentioned. These gains were driven by strong leasing activity and fewer tenant move-outs. Most importantly, our net effective rent-paying occupancy also rose this quarter and is now over 90%. As we've noted previously, this metric is the best indicator of our recovery progress.  
As noted, leasing activity continues to be robust, and we remain encouraged by the strength of our pipeline. Q3 total leasing volumes were 125% of 2019 quarterly averages. Shop renewal rates were 80%, elevated over historical trends. Rent spreads continued to improve to a blended rate of over 5%, while our GAAP rent spreads also continued to get closer to pre-COVID levels at over 12%. We are maintaining contractual rent growth on leasing activity in line with recent years, with embedded rent steps on more than 80% of our leases executed this quarter. Additionally, our weighted average lease term for deals has risen back above pre-COVID levels.  
So to summarize, our leasing trends are moving in the right direction, enabling us to maximize NOI growth for the long term. All of that said, we are fully aware and acknowledge that retailers today are facing challenges related to labor shortages, cost inflation, supply chain disruptions and permitting backlogs. While these issues are impacting build-out costs and tenant rent commencement timing, so far, this has only been on the margin for Regency. That said, we will continue to monitor these issues, and we'll work closely with our tenants to help them manage through them where we can.  
Moving to development activity. We continue to make good progress on our in-process ground-up and redevelopment projects, and we completed a $21 million Bloomingdale Square redevelopment in Tampa this quarter. We reimagine and modernize the center by repurposing a former Walmart box to accommodate an expansion and relocation of a highly productive existing Publix and backfill the former grocery box with a new LA Fitness. We added more visible and functional shop space and made enhancements and renovations to the remaining portions of the center. This successful project helped to cement this center's relevancy and dominance in its trade area while generating a return of over 8%.  
Construction cost inflation and labor shortages are real and are creating some pressures, but are not materially impacting the current yields and cost in our in-process projects. We are keeping our finger on the pulse on these trends and are being very thoughtful in our cost projections and delivery timing when underwriting new and potential pipeline projects.  
In summary, we are very pleased with the positive momentum that we continue to experience in our operating portfolio and in our value creation pipeline, driving us closer to full recovery and supporting our future growth."

Good morning, everyone. I'll provide some color around third quarter results, walk through the changes to full year 2021 guidance and offer some helpful reminders when thinking about next year.  Third quarter NAREIT FFO of $1.12 per share w",962,"Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. I'll provide some color around third quarter results, walk through the changes to full year 2021 guidance and offer some helpful reminders when thinking about next year.  
Third quarter NAREIT FFO of $1.12 per share was helped by several items. Uncollectible lease income was a positive $10 million in the quarter, the details of which we've broken out on Page 33 of our supplemental. We reserved over $4 million on third quarter billings, which is down from over $10 million a quarter ago, associated with uncollected revenues from cash basis tenants. This was more than offset by the collection of nearly $6 million of amounts reserved during the first half of 2021 as well as the collection of close to $9 million of revenues that were originally reserved in 2020.  
Our full year '21 guidance calls for a $46 million positive impact from the collection of 2020 reserves, of which we have recognized $41 million through the third quarter. We also recognized close to $14 million of onetime promote income in the third quarter related to the USAA JV transaction, which positively impacted NAREIT FFO, but is not included in our core operating earnings metric.  
Finally, straight-line rent in the third quarter benefited from the reversal of reserves triggered by the conversion of some cash basis tenants back to accrual accounting as reflected in uncollectible straight-line rent at a positive $4 million. This is a noncash accounting impact that contributes to NAREIT FFO but, again, did not impact our core operating earnings.  
Following these conversions, which represent about 5% of ABR, we now have 22% of our ABR remaining on a cash basis of accounting. For this smaller pool, our cash basis collection rate was 91% in the third quarter, a 700 basis point increase from a quarter ago. The collection rate on the old pool before the conversions was 93% in the third quarter, up from the 86% in the second quarter that we disclosed on the last call.  
As Jim mentioned, our net effective rent-paying occupancy now exceeds 90% as we've continued to narrow the spread between rent paying and our commenced occupancy rate due to the progress we've made increasing collections on cash basis tenants. We remain in a great position from a balance sheet perspective as cash flows continue to recover and leverage even after excluding prior year reserve collections has returned to prepandemic levels. We ended the quarter with full capacity on our revolver, and we have no unsecured debt maturities until 2024.  
You'll recall that we issued about $150 million of equity in Q2 through our ATM program on a forward basis. We settled a portion of that during the third quarter to fund the USAA transaction, generating $83 million of net proceeds. The remainder is unsettled, which we view as capacity for future investment opportunities, and we have until June of 2022 to issue the shares. We did not raise any additional equity capital during the third quarter.  
Turning to guidance, we point you to the detail in our business update slide deck posted to our website. A big driver of the $0.12 increase in the midpoint of our core operating earnings range comes from a higher same-property NOI growth forecast as we increased the range by 150 basis points at the midpoint. This increase was driven almost entirely by core improvement, including a higher cash basis collection rate on current year billings and lower move-out activity. As I mentioned, our forecast for the collection of prior year 2020 reserves is up only slightly at $46 million.  
Other drivers of the increase to full year core operating earnings expectations include higher lease termination fees and lower G&A. Our NAREIT FFO range has increased by an additional $0.05 at the midpoint on top of the change I just described, primarily driven by the increase in straight-line rent associated with the conversion of tenants back to accrual from cash basis during the third quarter. While it's possible that we may convert additional tenants back to accrual during the fourth quarter, our guidance does not assume any additional reversal of straight-line rent reserves.  
I'd like to point out that these noncash accounting impacts are a big reason why we provide and guide to core operating earnings in addition to NAREIT FFO. This metric excludes noncash amounts such as straight-line rent and mark-to-market adjustments and can provide a much cleaner picture of our earnings trajectory. We will provide 2022 guidance with Q4 results in February as we normally do, but we wanted to remind everyone of some of the bigger nonrecurring moving pieces that have been disclosed and discussed throughout the year when thinking about modeling for next year. 
First, our $46 million guidance for collection of 2020 reserves is a prior period adjustment, not associated with 2021 billings. Second, we recognized abnormally high expense recoveries of about $3.5 million net of reserves in the second quarter related to the 2020 expense reconciliation process. Third, G&A during the first quarter benefited by about $2 million from the forfeiture of previously expensed share grants related to the departure of our CIO earlier this year. And lastly, although not impacting core operating earnings, we recognized close to $14 million of promote income in the third quarter. We look forward to discussing our 2022 outlook in more detail, together with next quarter's results.  
As Lisa mentioned, given the pace of improvement we have experienced to this point of the year, we now expect the recovery of our NOI back to 2019 levels will occur on an annualized basis at some point during the first half of next year. That's about 6 months earlier than we had previously expected.  
With that, we look forward to taking your questions."

So I just want to make sure we kind of get that out there and explain some of the pieces here. About -- as you have, you've done the math, it's about $0.06 per share at the midpoint. About 1/3 of that -- and again, I'm speaking to core operating earnings, not NAREIT FFO. About 1/3 of that is going to be, as you mentioned, a result of 2020 or prior year collections, decelerating. So that -- the trajectory there, as you can see, is gone from $20 million -- over $20 million in the first quarter to roughly $9 million in the third. We have guided to that number being about $5 million in the fourth. About 1/3 of that deceleration in the fourth quarter comes from other -- what I would call, other NOI line items, percentage rent, settlement and income. We did have a bit of a frothy third quarter. So that should decelerate in the fourth.  
And then we do -- as you look at the G&A guidance, you'll see that the fourth quarter from a run rate perspective will be slightly higher than the third. So those are the drivers kind of decelerating into the end of this year.  
As we think about next, it's -- uncollectible lease income is going to -- continue to be a story of accelerating our earnings path. We're at about 250 basis points on current year collections through the third quarter as a bad debt charge or an uncollectible lease income charge. If you think about how we finish the year, we -- we're anticipating that our cash basis tenancy continues to climb from a collection rate perspective. I think we might end the year in the plus or minus 170 basis point range as a bad debt expense charge on current year billings.  And remember, our historical run rate is in the 50 basis point range. 
So we see a tremendous amount of opportunity to continue to close that gap. That's why we keep talking about net effective rent pay and occupancy. We increased that by 200 basis points this quarter. We anticipate that to continue to grind higher into 2022, much more to come on '22 guidance. I do want to hold that back to February.  I don't know that we'll get back to our 50 basis point historical run rate by the end of next year, but we do feel pretty confident that we'll just continue to close that gap from that 170 where we think we'll end the current year."

So we did announce the acquisition of Blakeney, which is an exceptional asset. And that -- obviously, the negotiation of that was even prior to last quarter. So the cap rates were already there.  With the Blakeney acquisition, we are also, if you will, match funding that with very low cap rate dispositions, nonstrategic, in the fourth quarter. And that's what drove the increased guidance for dispositions with that lower cap rate for that. So it's a mix of properties on both the acquisition side and the disposition side specific to Regency.  
Cap rates have compressed all year long. And as I said, quarter-over-quarter, I don't think that there's been much of a change, but there's no question that for the type of property that we already own and, therefore, are looking to add into our portfolio, it's going to be in the 5 -- 4.5 to 5 cap rate range. That's high-quality, grocery-anchored shopping center pricing today. It does not change how we think about acquiring and how we think about adding, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. Portfolio enhancement has always been a really important part of our strategy, and we do believe that continuing to grow with premier high-quality assets like we already own will help fortify our future NOI growth as we dispose of those that perhaps may have a lower growth profile than our average or maybe nonstrategic."

Today, as we think about it -- I just said, I believe that if we don't have the best, we certainly are really going close to the best of the team in the business.

And as I look at it, I think it's a combination of basically a renewed confidence in the brick-and-mortar business from retailers, certainly pent-up demand from 1.5 years of really not a lot of activity that's opening up. And obviously, we continue to see a nice migration to quality, which we believe we are that answer to migration. But the categories that we're seeing are the ones we've merchandised to for the last 20 years. We're doing a lot of medical deals, pet deals, restaurant, fast casual, banks, personal service. And it -- the demand is really across all regions. It's really -- it's almost imperceptible where there's more demand than others because it's coming from everywhere.  
Like I said, the pipeline -- as we look at our existing pipeline into the 90-day future, if you will, it continues to look very robust. So we have more vacancy than we've had in a long time. So we have product, we have availability, and there appears to be good solid retailer demand for that. And so I'm cautiously optimistic we stay on a nice trajectory."

I'd like to step back and kind of take a broader look at what really is going on long term -- to create long-term sustainable NOI. I think one of the components, contractual rent steps and our ability to manage expense recovery ratios are key contributors. I think appropriate and prudent leasing CapEx, which you touched on, that's a major factor, I think, in long-term earnings growth. 
Tenant selection, really making sure we're picking the right mix to drive synergy and traffic at our centers but also having a mine coming out of this pandemic environment, make sure we have an eye towards relevancy and survivability of the folks we're dealing with. We want people that are going to be here with us. We don't like the churn space. And all these things matter.  And in combination with what we're seeing from a GAAP and net effective rent growth at the 12% number I referenced in the remarks, I'm confident that our overall results have us on a very good vector towards the long-term NOI and earnings growth objectives that we're looking for."

If that means, thanks to you, Craig. So we are anticipating a significant increase, kind of all joking aside, and I appreciate you asking the question, it does give us the opportunity to put this out there. 
2021's run rate on a quarterly basis is in the $19 million range or so. And again, I'll refer to my remarks, recall that we are benefiting this year from that $2 million for future benefit upon Max departure. Next year's run rate is probably going to be closer to -- in the $21 million range on a quarterly basis. What we're capturing in that number is compensation increases together with filling open positions. Some of the benefit we've been incurring in '21 is we've been running a little bit lighter from a headcount plan perspective. 
Increases to T&E, as you mentioned, the entire company is -- we're starting to get back on the road, and there's more conferences being held, businesses being conducted more in-person than on Zoom going forward. And so we're planning for that to return to prepandemic levels. 
And then the last point I'd make is development overhead probably going to be in the flat range '21 as we continue to build our pipelines. We have the development spend. We'll look a lot in 2022 like it did in '21, and then we anticipate growing that ability to capitalize '23 and beyond."

You got to be current on your rent for an extended period of time. And then I would add to that, there's an overlay of what business are you in? And I'll be frank, some of the labor concerns that we're looking at today are impacting how we think about bringing tenants back to accrual accounting. 
As I look at our AR and our open AR and think about what tenants may or may not qualify, it could be in the 5% of ABR range in the fourth quarter that converts. I don't have a precise number for you on what that could mean from a straight-line rent perspective. But generally speaking, it kind of works pro rata. So every percentage point that we convert is about worth on a pound-for-pound basis, the same.

And there may be an opportunity that Regency has presented with to consider buying in a JV partnership. And we would do that. 
We like the assets equally that are in those portfolios. There is no fundamental kind of qualitative difference between the assets and our JV portfolios and what's on balance sheet. So we'll take it kind of day-to-day and quarter-to-quarter, but it would take a shift in our partners' mentality right now. Today, our partners are committed to the space, very specifically to the grocery-anchored neighborhood shopping center sector."

And what I would say is what's happened over the past 20 months with the disruption, with the hyper-accelerated digital commerce, that's only been validated even further that it is really important to be close to consumers' homes and quality real estate. So I do believe that there has been an increase in demand, maybe a little bit pent-up as people were a little cautious as to how the pandemic would play out. 
But now with hindsight being 2020, the retailers have even more confidence in the importance of being close to the consumer because they do need to be more intentional about last-mile distribution. And the quality of that real estate matters. And I think that, that is -- there's no question, that is what is driving increased healthy demand to Regency shopping centers."

I appreciate the question, Paulina. We're really making sure that we are thinking about being proactive to the extent that we can be proactive, whether it be with simply relationships with our retail tenants and our merchants or whether it's what we can do internally. It's all of the above. 
I'm going to try to -- there's no question that the most impactful, because it's -- I believe, it's permanent, is more of the BOPIS, right, and the last-mile distribution. And we have seen that accelerate over the past 24 months. And our retailers and our merchants, as you alluded to, are getting smarter about it and are investing more money in technology. But at the same time, they also -- as I just said in my prior response, they also appreciate and value that last-mile distribution being close to a consumer's home. And I've said it on other calls, and if you had listened to a panel with something that I did a conference in September, we had a target real estate representative on the panel, and he said it was like 90% of their orders are fulfilled from the stores. 
So that is probably the thing that we think about the most and make sure that we're staying as close to and evaluating how can we take advantage of those opportunities, how can we actually play a part in that and play a role in that and partnering with our retailers. And then, of course, supply chain disruption, as Jim talked about, and labor shortages are something that we hope are temporary and transitional. I think that there's probably a little bit more evidence that the labor shortages may be recovering a little bit faster. And that really does impact us and impacts our -- by impacting our tenants so far more than the supply chain has. So it's all of the above. And we use the terms we're on our front foot for investments. We're on our front foot for ensuring that we're staying ahead and evolving with not just changing retailer and merchant preferences, but also changing consumer preferences, really thinking about the next 10 to 12 years."
