Fourth quarter building increased 20% to $961 million, our secure SD-WAN offering accounted for over 13% of fourth quarter building. Product revenue accelerated quarter-over-quarter to 21%, contributing to a total revenue growth of 21%. 
Operation margin benefit from solid revenue performance, we achieved an all-time company record non-GAAP operating margin of 29.4% for the fourth quarter. Given the many opportunities ahead, we plan to shift our focus more to growth for the -- at least to next few quarters.
Today, we announced FortiOS 7.0, with 300 new feature and updates. With this release, Fortinet is the only leading cybersecurity vendor to offer firewall-based Zero Trust network access, enabling remote access to replace the traditional VPN.
This reduced our tax service while improving the user experience. Fortinet's new trust network solution also simplify management by using the same access policy whether on or off network.
High integration of our SaaS solution with the full os 7.0 give enterprise the flexibility they need to enable their workforce to work for home with consistent enterprise-grade security delivered on-premise or now more cloud-based cases consumption for security as a service.
The FortiOS 7.0 extend network connectivity and security beyond the 1H with innovation in 5G and LTE that improved the wireless network performance and increased resilience.
Our 5G offering enable organization to achieve secure, scalable and highly available network connectivity anywhere. The release of 47.0 expand the Fortinet security fabric delivering on our mission to provide broad, integrated and automated security to any device, any application everywhere.
Cybersecurity is an inflection point and increasingly, organizations are consolidating towards a platform approach and in not just a separate platform for endpoint, network security or cloud security but a holistic platform that is integrated, automated across all this area.
The Fortinet security fabric is a cyber security platform built on a broad and deep set of networking security technology from endpoint to network to cloud, organically built to seamlessly communicate and operate together.
This consolidation with our secure driven networking approach will be key drivers going forward. 
 [Audio Gap] from strong demand for fabric and cloud security solutions. Support and professional services revenue increased 21% to $210 million. The revenue mix shift from A55 to 24/7 support was 12 points, with 24/7 now representing 66% of the mix. Security subscription services and cloud provider revenue increased 21% to $249 million. Moving to the mix of FortiGate and non-FortiGate revenue, network security revenue increased 18%, driven by the high end and entry-level FortiGate product families. Non-FortiGate products and service revenue increased 29% driven by a 34% increase in revenue for Fabric and Cloud security solutions.
Before continuing with the fourth quarter results, I'd like to highlight our 2020 full-year revenue performance. In the midst of a pandemic induced recession, total revenue for the year grew 20% to $2.6 billion. We take great pride in our focus on organic growth. And 2020 represents the third consecutive year with revenue growth of 20%.
This consistent performance speaks to our geographic and customer diversity, the continued success of the integrated platform strategy, and our proprietary ASIC advantage that enables a shared operating system across the platform, drives our cost for Performance advantage, increase the capacity to add features and functions while maintaining price points.
Total non-FortiGate revenue for the year grew over 25% to more than $725 million. In other words, our fabric, cloud and other security products and services are on a pace to be a $1 billion business as we exit 2021. Our non-FortiGate and FortiGate products and solutions include a complete range of form factors and delivery methods, including physical and virtual appliances, cloud, SaaS and perpetual software, as well as hosted and non-hosted solutions.
Together, they provide a range of security solutions and form factors, enabling integrated protection for hybrid environments, and their expanding digital attack surface and edges. Pivoting back to our Q4 results. Let's turn to revenue by Geo. Our geographic revenue performance continued to align with the pandemic's economic path and with it, highlighted the geographic diversification of our business.
As summarized on Slide 7, revenue in Asia Pacific increased 23% as many Asian countries and economies continue to remain largely open. EMEA revenue increased 22%, and the Americas posted revenue growth of 20%.
Let's shift to billings. Total fourth quarter billings were $961 million, up 20%. FortiGate's billings increased 16% and accounted for 71% of total billings. As shown on Slide 9, high end and entry-level FortiGate posted strong billings growth for the quarter. Non-FortiGate billings increased 29 -- to 29% of total billings, driven by demand for fabric and cloud security solutions. As with revenue, Geo buildings performance aligns with the economic path of the pandemic.
In terms of growth, APAC billings outperformed all geos, followed by Europe and the Americas. The Americas reflect the continuing impact of the pandemic, especially in Latin America. Moving to buildings by customer segments. The small enterprise segment posted solid growth across all geos, illustrating the strength of our Engage channel partner program. This segment is driven by new customer acquisitions, customer security fabric expansions, solid execution by our channel partners and the large diverse makeup this multinational customer segment.
Moving to worldwide buildings by industry verticals. The worldwide government sector topped all verticals at 17% of total billings and grew 28% with another strong performance from our international team. 
Service providers and MSSPs accounted for 16% of total billings. Retail accounted for 10% of total billings, up 2 percentage points quarter-over-quarter. And Education continued to rebound with                 growth up 26% year-over-year. 
Looking now at deals by dollar size. We had 68 deals over $1 million in the fourth quarter compared to 64 deals in the fourth quarter of 2019. Secure SD-WAN accounted for 16 deals over $1 million, versus 11 deals in the fourth quarter of 2019.
On a full year basis, SD-WAN accounted for approximately 11% of our total billings and doubled year-over-year. Moving back to the income statement. As shown on Slide 4, gross margin improved 40 basis points to 78.5%. The strong 29% quarter-over-quarter product revenue growth created a mix shift from services to product revenue.
The mix shift was a headwind for quarter-over-quarter gross margin comparisons. Product gross margin improved 130 basis points to 63.2%. Product gross margin continued to benefit from a higher mix of software products and the lower direct cost of our newer generation of Fortigate products.
Operating margin for the fourth quarter increased 210 basis points to 29.4%, benefiting from the gross margin improvement and continued lower travel and marketing program expenses, offset by the addition of new sales team members as we continue to prepare for additional growth.
At the end of the year, the total headcount was 8,238, an increase of 16%. Moving to the statement of cash flow summarized on Slides 10, 11 and 12. Cash flow for the fourth quarter came in at $264 million. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 300,000 shares of our common stock for a total cost of $34 million. For the full year, we repurchased 11.7 million shares for a total cost of $1.1 billion.
At the end of the fourth quarter, the remaining share repurchase authorization was $1 billion, with the authorization set to expire at the end of February in 2022. Throughout the pandemic, we have leveraged the strength of our balance sheet as a competitive advantage to support our partners and customers because they experience geo-specific economic challenges.
As a result, average days sales outstanding increased 8 days to 87 days, in line with our expectations and reflecting our decision to provide geographically targeted extended panel plans. Inventory turns improved to 2.7x from 2.1x in the third quarter and was relatively flat year-over-year.
We expect extended payment terms and higher inventory balances to be in effect as we move through at least the first half of 2021. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $32 million, including $22 million related to construction and other real estate activity.
We estimate capital expenditures for the first quarter to between $50 million and $60 million and for all of 2021 to be between $150 million and $170 million. 2021 CapEx projects include expanding our data center footprint and spending that was moved from 2020 due to delays in the new campus building.
The average contract term in the fourth quarter was approximately 28 months, up less than 2 months from the fourth quarter of 2019. The growth in SD-WAN and other large enterprise deals contributed to the increase. As we look forward, I'd like to review our outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2021, summarized on Slide 13, which is cited to disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call.
For the first quarter, we expect billings in the range of $765 million to $780 million; revenue in the range of $670 million is $685 million. Non-GAAP gross margin of 78.5% to 79.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin of 22.5% to 23.5%, reflecting the typical revenue seasonality associated with the first quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.70 to $0.75, which assumes a share count of between $167 million and $169 million.
We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 21%. Before providing our 2021 guidance, I'd like to congratulate every member of the Fortinet team, for the truly outstanding execution in 2020 and the face of unprecedented challenges and rapidly changing and unpredictable dynamics. The effort and results have been outstanding.
And this is on top of now several years of consistent, predictable performance and continuing improvements in key growth and profitability metrics. Today, we reported our third consecutive year of total revenue growth of 20%, while increasing our non-GAAP operating margin, an average of over 200 basis points a year for the same period.
Our goal remains to balance growth and profitability within the framework we have provided. As Ken mentioned, given the many growth opportunities that lie ahead, we currently plan to tilt our bias within this framework, more towards growth for at least the next several quarters.
The opportunities we see are supported by a strong pipeline heading into 2021, increased sales capacity and our development efforts, which include the NP7 chip and our new 40 OS 7.0 operating system. With that, for 2021, we expect billings in the range of $3.560 billion to $3.640 billion. We took the midpoint represents growth of approximately 17%. 
The revenue in the range of $3.25 billion to $3.75 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 18%. Total service revenue in the range of $2.15 billion to $2.45 billion, which represents growth of approximately 21% and implies product revenue growth of approximately 11% and $1 billion in product revenue for 2021, quite the milestones reporting that.
Non-GAAP gross margin of 78% to 80%, non-GAAP operating margin of 25% to 27%. When backing out the 2020 T&E benefit, the midpoint of guidance represents a 50 to 100 basis point increase in operating margin for 2021. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.60 to $3.75, which assumes a share count of between $170 million and $172 million.
We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 21%. We expect cash taxes to be approximately $80 million. Along with can, I'd like to thank our partners, customers and the Fortinet team for all their support and hard work during these difficult and unique times. I'd also like to offer a special welcome to the Semapa team. And I'll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin a Q&A session."

That's what helping contribute to the additional growth, especially in the Geotrust and SASE environment and also this infrastructure security later this year, but it's so far, I see the product growth, like 21% is a lot of contribution from whether the SD-WAN or we co securitie networking and also in the probably like 1 to 2 years ago, when we released the ISO C4. So that's a little bit towards the low end side of the FortiGate, which you can see nicely growth over there.

And that's actually helping to drive the accelerate, the product revenue growth. And on the other side, we have a little bit different approach for whether the SASE or cloud endpoint. So we will emphasize it integrate together, ultimately together, especially in the OS level, that's -- none of our competitors have not.
And also most of this also organically internally developed, designed to work together, automate together from day 1. That's also different from competitor come from acquisition, which is more difficult to integrate and also difficult to manage long term.

I think over the last year or 2, we've done a very good job of retaining that cost benefit in terms of the structure. You can look back and see what's happened with the gross margin on the product gross margin line. Obviously, you do then also get the benefit in total, when you add into 2/3 of the business that are services that are coming at a much more attractive margin.

So that's where we'll continue to see SD-WAN and keeping growing probably -- by market study, it probably was keeping grown like 30%, 40% year-over-year this year. We do believe we're also keeping gaining market share. And at the same time, the 5G -- the other opportunity come up, we already offered the new FortiOS 7.0, which also could be a pretty good driver for the additional growth we have."

That's where we say, you need to protect all different edge together and automate integrate together instead of have a different product, different kind of a vendor for each part, which is difficult to integrate automate.
So that's where we see the response from like 300 new feature an update in this OS to cover quite a broad area.
And that we do see customers do need some time to gradually like train pick up on this new function, but a lot of them, they see the huge benefit of this new function.

I don't think that -- Ken kind of made a good point earlier to build on a little bit. I think the solar wins event happened so late in the quarter, at least for us and probably for many other security companies. It seems doubtful that activity really had much impact on the last 2 weeks of December in the quarter. I do think, Ken me at this point that it certainly raises awareness of security and events like that, unfortunately, for the world at large, create focus on security that matters and the importance of it that people are going to suffer because of it.
So I don't know that in terms of learning to be cautious, if you will, going back to the beginning of your question and the guidance setting, I do think there was an element of caution, once we came out of the second quarter and saw how the dynamic impact close rates.

Today, we announced FortiOS 7.0, with 300 new feature and updates. With this release, Fortinet is the only leading cybersecurity vendor to offer firewall-based Zero Trust Network Access, enabling remote access to replace the traditional VPN. 
This reduced our tech surface while improving the user experience. Fortinet's Zero Trust Network Access solution also simplify management by using the same access policy whether on or off network. 
Prior to integration of our SASE solution with the  FortiOS 7.0 give enterprise the flexibility they need to enable their workforce to work from home with consistent enterprise-grade security delivered on-premise or now more cloud-based SASE consumption for security as a service. 
The FortiOS 7.0 extend network connectivity and security beyond the WAN Edge with the innovation in 5G and LTE that improved the wireless network performance and increased resilience. 
Our 5G offering enable organization to achieve secure, scalable and highly available network connectivity anywhere. The release of FortiOS 7.0 expand the Fortinet security fabric delivering on our mission to provide broad, integrated and automated security to any device, any application everywhere. 
Cybersecurity is an inflection point and increasingly, organizations are consolidating towards a platform approach and in not just a separate platform for endpoint, network security or cloud security, but a holistic platform that is integrated, automated across all this area. 
The Fortinet Security Fabric is a cybersecurity platform built on a broad and a deep set of networking and security technology from endpoint to network to cloud, organically built to seamlessly communicate and operate together. 
This consolidation with our secure driven networking
Approach will be key drivers going forward. Today, Fortinet is recognized in 8 Gartner Magic Quadrant. Our FortiGate product is a leading -- is a leader in both SD-WAN and the next-gen Firewall Magic Quadrant. We continue to experience excellent adoption of secure SD-WAN and expect our unique solution to become a market share leader within a few years. In addition to our growth drivers, we estimate our total addressable market will grow at an annual compound rate of 10% over the next 4 years to reach $93 billion by 2024. 
The recent SolarWinds security incident and the pandemic elevated the need for a broad, integrated and automated platform, and we expect company to reach the percentage of IT spending used for security as they work to secure their entire infrastructure across multiple edge in a zero trust environment.

Total revenue of $748 million was up 21%. Product revenue was up 21%. Service revenue was up 21%.

While secure SD-WAN use cases continued their dramatic growth, the majority of product revenue was driven by the wide range of other operating system capabilities embedded in FortiGates in their related use cases. Service revenue of $460 million benefited from strong demand for fabric and cloud security solutions. Support and professional services revenue increased 21% to $210 million. The revenue mix shift from 8/5 to 24/7 support was 12 points, with 24/7 now representing 66% of the mix. 
Security subscription services and cloud provider revenue increased 21% to $249 million. Moving to the mix of FortiGate and non-FortiGate revenue, network security revenue increased 18%, driven by the high end and entry-level FortiGate product families. Non-FortiGate products and service revenue increased 29% driven by a 34% increase in revenue for fabric and cloud security solutions. 
Before continuing with the fourth quarter results, I'd like to highlight our 2020 full year revenue performance. In the midst of a pandemic-induced recession, total revenue for the year grew 20% to $2.6 billion. We take great pride in our focus on organic growth. And 2020 represents the third consecutive year with revenue growth of 20%. 
This consistent performance speaks to our geographic and customer diversity, the continued success of the integrated platform strategy, and our proprietary ASIC Advantage that enables a shared operating system across the platform, drives our cost for performance advantage, increase the capacity to add features and functions while maintaining price points. 
Total non-FortiGate revenue for the year grew over 25% to more than $725 million. In other words, our fabric, cloud and other security products and services are on pace to be a $1 billion business as we exit 2021. Our non-FortiGate and FortiGate products and solutions include a complete range of form factors and delivery methods, including physical and virtual appliances, cloud, SaaS and perpetual software, as well as hosted and non-hosted solutions. 
Together, they provide a range of security solutions and form factors, enabling integrated protection for hybrid environments, and their expanding digital attack surface and edges. Pivoting back to our Q4 results. Let's turn to revenue by geo. Our geographic revenue performance continued to align with the pandemic's economic path and with it, highlighted the geographic diversification of our business. 
As summarized on Slide 7, revenue in Asia Pacific increased 23% as many Asian countries and economies continue to remain largely open. EMEA revenue increased 22%, and the Americas posted revenue growth of 20%. 
Let's shift to billings. Total fourth quarter billings were $961 million, up 20%. FortiGate's billings increased 16% and accounted for 71% of total billings. As shown on Slide 9, high end and entry-level FortiGates posted strong billings growth for the quarter. Non-FortiGate billings increased 29 -- to 29% of total billings, driven by demand for fabric and cloud security solutions. As with revenue, geo billings performance aligns with the economic path of the pandemic. 
In terms of growth, APAC billings outperformed all geos, followed by Europe and the Americas. The Americas reflect the continuing impact of the pandemic, especially in Latin America. Moving to billings by customer segments. The small enterprise segment posted solid growth across all geos, illustrating the strength of our engaged channel partner program. This segment is driven by new customer acquisitions, customer security fabric expansions, solid execution by our channel partners and the large diverse make up this multinational customer segment. 
Moving to worldwide billings by industry verticals. The worldwide government sector topped all verticals at 17% of total billings and grew 28% with another strong performance from our international team. Service providers and MSSPs accounted for 16% of total billings. Retail accounted for 10% of total billings, up 2 percentage points quarter-over-quarter. And education continued to rebound with donors growth up 26% year-over-year.  
Looking now at deals by dollar size. We had 68 deals over $1 million in the fourth quarter compared to 64 deals in the fourth quarter of 2019. Secure SD-WAN accounted for 16 deals over $1 million versus 11 deals in the fourth quarter of 2019. On a full year basis, SD-WAN accounted for approximately 11% of our total billings and doubled year-over-year. Moving back to the income statement. As shown on Slide 4, gross margin improved 40 basis points to 78.5%. The strong 29% quarter-over-quarter product revenue growth created a mix shift from services to product revenue. 
The mix shift was a headwind for quarter-over-quarter gross margin comparisons. Product gross margin improved 130 basis points to 63.2%. Product gross margin continued to benefit from a higher mix of software products and the lower direct cost of our newer generation of FortiGate products. 
Operating margin for the fourth quarter increased 210 basis points to 29.4%, benefiting from the gross margin improvement and continued lower travel and marketing program expenses, offset by the addition of new sales team members as we continue to prepare for additional growth.
At the end of the year, the total headcount was 8,238, an increase of 16%. Moving to the statement of cash flow summarized on Slides 10, 11 and 12. Cash flow for the fourth quarter came in at $264 million. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 300,000 shares of our common stock for a total cost of $34 million. For the full year, we repurchased 11.7 million shares for a total cost of $1.1 billion.
At the end of the fourth quarter, the remaining share repurchase authorization was $1 billion, with the authorization set to expire at the end of February in 2022. Throughout the pandemic, we have leveraged the strength of our balance sheet as a competitive advantage to support our partners and customers because they experience geo-specific economic challenges.
As a result, average days sales outstanding increased 8 days to 87 days, in line with our expectations and reflecting our decision to provide geographically targeted extended payment plans. Inventory turns improved to 2.7x from 2.1x in the third quarter and was relatively flat year-over-year.
We expect extended payment terms and higher inventory balances to be in effect as we move through at least the first half of 2021. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $32 million, including $22 million related to construction and other real estate activity.
We estimate capital expenditures for the first quarter to between $50 million and $60 million and for all of 2021 to be between $150 million and $170 million. 2021 CapEx projects include expanding our data center footprint and spending that was moved from 2020 due to delays in the new campus building.
The average contract term in the fourth quarter was approximately 28 months, up less than 2 months from the fourth quarter of 2019. The growth in SD-WAN and other large enterprise deals contributed to the increase. 
As we look forward, I'd like to review our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2021, summarized on Slide 13, which is subject to disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call.
For the first quarter, we expect billings in the range of $765 million to $780 million. Revenue in the range of $670 million to $685 million. Non-GAAP gross margin of 78.5% to 79.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin of 22.5% to 23.5%, reflecting the typical revenue seasonality associated with the first quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.70 to $0.75, which assumes a share count of between 167 million and 169 million.
We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 21%. Before providing our 2021 guidance, I'd like to congratulate every member of the Fortinet team, for the truly outstanding execution in 2020 in the face of unprecedented challenges and rapidly changing and unpredictable dynamics. The effort and results have been outstanding.
And this is on top of now several years of consistent, predictable performance and continuing improvements in key growth and profitability metrics. Today, we reported our third consecutive year of total revenue growth of 20%, while increasing our non-GAAP operating margin, an average of over 200 basis points a year for the same period.
Our goal remains to balance growth and profitability within the framework we have provided. As Ken mentioned, given the many growth opportunities that lie ahead, we currently plan to tilt our bias within this framework, more towards growth for at least the next several quarters.
The opportunities we see are supported by a strong pipeline heading into 2021, increased sales capacity and our development efforts, which include the NP7 chip and our new FortiOS 7.0 operating system. With that, for 2021, we expect billings in the range of $3.560 billion to $3.640 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of approximately 17%. 
Revenue in the range of $3.25 billion to $3.75 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 18%. Total service revenue in the range of $2.15 billion to $2.45 billion, which represents growth of approximately 21% and implies product revenue growth of approximately 11% and $1 billion in product revenue for 2021, quite the milestones for Fortinet.
Non-GAAP gross margin of 78% to 80%. Non-GAAP operating margin of 25% to 27%. When backing out the 2020 T&E benefit, the midpoint of guidance represents a 50 to 100 basis point increase in operating margin for 2021. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.60 to $3.75, which assumes a share count of between 170 million and 172 million.
We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 21%. We expect cash taxes to be approximately $80 million. Along with Ken, I'd like to thank our partners, customers and the Fortinet team for all their support and hard work during these difficult and unique times. 
I'd also like to offer a special welcome to the Panopta team. 
And I'll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin a Q&A session."

And that's actually helping to drive -- to accelerate the product revenue growth. And on the other side, we have a little bit different approach for whether the SASE or cloud or endpoint. So we more emphasize it, integrate together, automate together, especially in the OS level, though that's -- none of our competitors have that.
And also most of this also organically are internal developed, designed to work together, automate together from day 1. That's also different from competitor come from acquisition, which is more difficult to integrate and also difficult to manage long term.

So for us, like this OS level integration of a SASE do leave a lot of flexibility and gradually for the customer to transition, whether they're more service-based or they still want to like have a, we call security infrastructure approach. So that's where we have the flexibility to have customers select their own approach based on own need. And at the same time, we'll make the whole infrastructure secure, like we say.

That our pricing is really -- we're oftentimes, I think, brought into RFPs and opportunities to set the milestone that the competitors are forced to react to as opposed to the other way around. 
If you go back and look at the comments that we've offered throughout 2020 even in the pandemic, more often than not, discounting, if you will, has been a tailwind for us in our ability to execute against it as opposed to a headwind.

I don't think that -- Ken kind of made a good point earlier to build on a little bit. I think the SolarWinds event happened so late in the quarter, at least for us and probably for many other security companies. It seems doubtful that activity really had much impact on the last 2 weeks of December in the quarter. I do think, and Ken made this point, that it certainly raises awareness of security and events like that, unfortunately, for the world at large, create -- focus on security matters and the importance of it that people are going to suffer because of it.
So I don't know that in terms of learning to be cautious, if you will, going back to the beginning of your question and the guidance setting, I do think there was an element of caution, once we came out of the second quarter and saw how the pandemic impact close rates. And you saw that come through in the guidance setting process in both Q3 and Q4."

We are very pleased with the strong first quarter performance. Building increased 27% to $851 million, driven by solid execution across our broad and integrated product and services. Secure SD-WAN contributed 14% to first quarter billing. 
Total revenue grew 23% to $710 million, with product revenue growth of 25% and the highest quarterly product revenue growth in the last 5 years. With strong business momentum and good visibility, we remain focused on growth. In the first quarter, we released FortiOS 7.0, which offer the industry's first OS level with tight integration of broad security and network functions, including SASE, SD-WAN, Ntrust network access, CASB and 5G capability.

Increasingly, organizations are consolidating towards a holistic platform approach, delivering integrated and [indiscernible] security to cover on-premise network, endpoint and cloud secure edge. The Fortinet Security Fabric is a cybersecurity platform organically built on a broad and a deep set of networking and security technology designed to seamlessly operate together. 
The high-profile of security incident that occurred over the past few months, along with the pandemic, has elevated the need for a broad platform that can secure an enterprise and high infrastructure across multiple edge in a zero trust environment. We expect companies to increase the percentage of IT spending used for security in an effort to address their server security needs. 
Our security-driven networking approach is a key growth driver. Additionally, we expect that our significant organic product growth will lead to increased service revenue.

And to add to your comment, we should note that billings growth, product revenue growth and total revenue growth were each at 5-year highs. Okay.

And to add to your comment, we should note that billings growth, product revenue growth and total revenue growth were each at 5-year highs. 
Okay. Let's start the more detailed Q1 discussion with revenue. Total revenue of $710 million was up 23%, driven by industry-leading product revenue growth of 25%. Product revenue growth was broad-based across geographies, security fabric products and use cases, illustrating the market acceptance of our integrated single platform security strategy, customer demand for security across their entire infrastructure and the diversity of our customer base. 
Product revenue growth was over 30% for both infrastructure and cloud fabric products. And all 3 geographic regions increased 20% or more. Demand for security fabric products was strong across all form factors: Hardware, software and virtual machines. The growth we experienced for product revenue was not the result of a few large deals, lower backlog or higher channel partner inventory levels. 
The product revenue growth also enables increases in services billings and future services revenue. In the first quarter, service revenue of $470 million was up 22%. Support and related services revenue increased 23% to $214 million. Security subscription services revenue increased 21% to $255 million, benefiting from outsized growth from our cloud provider and SaaS security offerings. 
Moving to the mix of FortiGate and non-FortiGate platform revenue, the FortiGate segment of the fabric platform saw revenue increased 17%, driven by demand for entry-level and high-end FortiGate products. High end includes 10 new NP7 powered FortiGates that were introduced in the past year, which includes today's announcement of the 71-20 F. These new products now represent approximately 20% of high-end FortiGate shipments. 
Our ASIC-driven FortiGate give customers 5 to 10x more computing power than firewalls that run on common CPUs. The advanced computing power creates not only speed but also the capacity to continue to add functionality to our operating system, driving our price for performance advantage. The non-FortiGate segment saw revenue grow over 40%, and now accounts for 31% of total revenue, up 4 percentage points. The integrated securities fabric solutions consists of the complete range of form factors and delivery methods, including physical and virtual appliances, cloud, SaaS and perpetual software, as well as hosted and nonhosted solutions. Together, they provide a range of security solutions and form factors, enabling integrated protection for hybrid environments and the expanding digital attack surface from the data center to the endpoint to the cloud. 
Given the strong first quarter performance -- excuse me, revenue performance, we believe our non-FortiGate platform is now on a pace to be a $1 billion business this year, representing an acceleration of this milestone. 
Let's turn to revenue by geographies. And a summary is on Slide 5. Revenue in the Asia Pacific area increased 26%, EMEA revenue increased 25%, and the Americas posted revenue growth of 20%. As I mentioned earlier, all 3 regions experienced product revenue growth of 20% or more. 
Moving to billings. The first quarter billings were $851 million, up 27%. We saw strong growth in both the FortiGate and non-FortiGate segments of our security fabric platform. The FortiGate segment delivered billings growth of 20%, accounting for 70% of total billings. As shown on Slide 6, entry-level FortiGates posted very strong billings growth in the quarter. The non-FortiGate segment accounted for 30% of total billings and delivered billings growth of 50%, driving a 4-point year-over-year mix shift to non-FortiGate. 
Taken together, these data points highlight the market acceptance of our single integrated security platform strategy. In terms of billing growth by geos, the APAC outperformed all geos, followed by Europe and the Americas. In the Americas, Canada had a very strong quarter, and Latin America rebounded from the pandemic-induced slowdown posted billings growth in the mid-20% range. 
Moving to billings by customer segments. The small enterprise segment posted solid growth across all geos. This segment is driven by new customer acquisitions, customer security fabric expansions, solid execution by our channel partners and the large diverse makeup of this international customer segment. 
At the same time, we saw strong growth in our larger deals. The number of deals over $1 million grew 74% to 66 deals in the first quarter. The pipeline for deals over $1 million looks good for the remainder of the year. As Ken noted, secure SD-WAN billings were 14% of total billings. SD-WAN is a key functionality in an integrated SASE solution. 
Moving to worldwide billings by industry verticals, with another strong international performance, the worldwide government sector topped all verticals at 19% of total billings and was up 60%. Service providers and MSSPs accounted for 16% of total billings. The rebound for education accelerated with billings growth of 50%. Retail turned in a solid quarter with billings growth of 21%. Our strong and consistent billings and revenue performance over the past several years is testament to our geographic and customer diversity, the growing success with a single integrated security platform strategy, and our ASIC advantage, which enables a shared operating system across the security fabric platform, drives our price performance advantage, increase the capacity to add features and functions while maintaining price points. 
Moving back to the income statement. As shown on Slide 4, total gross margin improved 10 basis points to 78.9%. Product gross margin improved 120 basis points to 62.6%, benefiting from lower direct product costs. The increase in product gross margin offsets the drag on total gross margins from the revenue mix shift driven by the strong product revenue growth and a gross margin FX headwind of about 25 basis points. Operating margin for the first quarter increased 210 basis points to 24.5%, benefiting from the strong revenue performance in the quarter. The benefit from lower travel and marketing program expenses of approximately 100 basis points was more than offset by an operating margin headwind from foreign exchange of about 150 basis points. 
To end the quarter -- we ended the quarter with total headcount of 8,615, an increase of 16%. 
Moving to the statement of cash flow summarized on Slide 7 and 8. Free cash flow for the first quarter came in at $264 million, up $22 million from the first quarter of 2020 despite a $24.5 million year-over-year increase in CapEx spending. We ended the year with total cash and investments of $3.1 billion, an increase of $1.5 billion. The increase includes the proceeds from our $1 billion investment-grade debt issuance during the first quarter. The issuance followed our inaugural strong BBB credit ratings. 
Throughout the pandemic, we have leveraged the strength of our balance sheet as a competitive advantage to support our partners and customers as they experience geo specific economic challenges. As a result, days sales outstanding increased 7 days to 81 days, in line with our expectations and reflecting our earlier decision to provide geographically targeted extended payment terms. 
Compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, DSOs in the first quarter of 2021 decreased 6 days as we saw early progress towards returning to pre-pandemic payment terms. Inventory turns declined to 2.1x from 2.5x, reflecting the efforts we took to mitigate supply chain risk, including increasing our inventory levels starting earlier in 2020. We expect extended payment terms and higher inventory balances to be in effect as we move through 2021. 
Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $52 million, including $38 million related to construction and other real estate activity. We expect to begin moving employees over the new Sunnyvale Campus building in the middle of the year, although the timing will depend on local pandemic protocols and employee safety considerations. We estimate capital expenditures for the second quarter to between $30 million and $40 million. And for all of 2021 to between $150 million and $170 million. The average contract term in the first quarter was approximately 27 months, up less than 2 months from the first quarter of 2020 and down approximately 1 month from the fourth quarter of 2020. 
Secure SD-WAN accounted for 15 deals over $1 million versus 4 in the first quarter of 2020 and contributed to the increase in average contract term. As we look forward, our goal remains to balance growth and profitability. And given the growth opportunities we highlighted during the March Analyst Day and as confirmed in our first quarter results, we have tilted our bias towards growth for at least the next several quarters. The opportunities we see are supported by a strong pipeline, increased sales capacity and our development efforts, which include the NP7 chip and our new FortiOS 7.0 operating system that was recently released. 
Now I'd like to review our outlook for the second quarter guidance, summarized on Slide 9, which is subject to the disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For the second quarter, we expect billings in the range of $860 million to $880 million; revenue in the range of $733 million to $747 million; non-GAAP gross margin of 78.5% to 79.5%; non-GAAP operating margin of 24.5% to 25.5%, which includes an expected 100 to 150 basis point headwind from foreign exchange; non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.83 to $0.88, which assumes a share count of between $168 million and $170 million. 
We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 21%. Before raising our 2021 guidance, I'd like to congratulate every member of the Fortinet team for the truly outstanding start to 2021. With that, for 2021, we expect billings in the range of $3.685 billion to $3.745 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of approximately 20%. The revenue in the range of $3.08 billion to $3.13 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of approximately 20%. total service revenue in the range of $2.020 billion to $2.050 billion, which represents growth of approximately 21% and implies product revenue growth of approximately 17%; non-GAAP gross margin of 78% to 80%; non-GAAP operating margin of 25% to 27%. When backing out the 2020 T&E benefit, the midpoint of the guidance represents a 50 to 100 basis point increase in 2021 operating margin despite an expected headwind from foreign exchange. 
Non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.65 to $3.80, which assumes a share count of between $170 million and $172 million and about $0.07 per share impact from the debt issuance. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 21%. We expect cash taxes to be approximately $80 million. 
And along with Ken, I'd like to thank our partners, our customers and the Fortinet team for all their support and hard work in these difficult and unique times. And I now hand the call back over to Peter, to begin the Q&A."

And let's say it's still early stage, but we do involve a lot of testing trials. And at the same time, I do believe eventually, the service provider business will go back up to the #1. It tends to be like a high 20, like if you go back 4, 5 years ago. But because it's a new kind of shifting. So they are -- they do have some work to do. And also some big investments obviously going forward. So we're working together with them to keeping growing in this business right now."

On the other side, we do believe whether the SASE network, like we said a few years ago, it's the best position probably for the service provider carrier. So we tend to be working with and partner with them, and also offer kind of more tight to the integrated solution, like we said in the FortiOS 7.0 is really integrated to OS level instead of some different vendors using different box, or even kind of a different infrastructure to do that. 
So that's actually working much better with the wider service provider, with the customer directly. So that's why we do see there is some plus growing going forward. But it's just part of the whole infrastructure solution. We'll now replace the traditional approach, but also the [indiscernible] security is part of the dynamic space. There's a new thing come up and also the that [indiscernible] also now goes away. So that's where we try to address this new chain.

So that's -- it's not a simple refresh. It's really changing to the whole infrastructure approach and also working together with traditionally like different vendor cover, whether network endpoint or some other part of security. Now they're looking for some consolidation. And they prefer when to have a multiple cover of different part of infrastructure working together. 
So that you can see the fabric approach we did few years ago started doing quite well. And almost pretty much every quarter, doubled the growth compared to the traditional network security. But on the network security, we also see very healthy growth. And it's very -- not just expanding beyond the traditional border security product, but also because the ASIC advantage, which increased the secure computing power, 5 to 10x compared to the other vendor software load on the traditional CPU. So that's able to add more function and also kind of increase performance, lower the cost and also lower power consumption, more [indiscernible]. 
So that's actually making this like the product growth, like we said, keeping doing better and better. And we do see this whole infrastructure approach will keep going for the next, probably, a few quarters, even to a few years, and the consolidation will keep it going within the industry."

I think the headline that he's talked about previously is that back to work really -- the combination of back to work and as many companies being in the hybrid model, that the attack surface now seems to be permanently expanded for many, many companies. 
In terms of growth and how we see it with new logos and expansion opportunities, we easily add several thousand new customers every quarter. But if you look at the mix of billings, the mix of billings is going to come from our installed base of customers, if you will. 
And I think the simple model to look at is from that initial sale of perhaps a firewall or something else, there's 2 different ways to expand. One is finding more and more use cases inside organizations for firewalls and increasing the displacement opportunities; and then the second is, and this is where Ken was going, is the expansion opportunity with those non-FortiGate fabric partner products. And what we're seeing there with that mix shift from FortiGates to non-FortiGate and now being 30% of our business or 31% of our business, I think it's taking us one affirmation of the strategy and, 2 you're seeing it in the numbers."

It's -- we're keeping gaining market share, like I said, because there's fundamental like a technology architecture difference, which we've factored 10x the computing power compared to our competitor, we can easily add a function performance.

So that's -- also a lot of company also starting to do this kind of expand the branch to the home called the home branch or whatever, to meet working standard like a better networking reliability, security to the home environment. So that also needs business solution. That's also one of the reasons we see some of the low end side keeping growth pretty fast. 
It's work for home actually helping driving some of these [indiscernible] sales.

Keith or Ken, historically the refresh cycle concept used to provide some disruption at times, I would even say, some noise around specifically Fortinet's business. 
It would appear that over the past probably 18 months or so, there's less discussion and focus around it. Do you think that Fortinet is gradually shifting away from it? Or is that there's so many concurrent internal refresh cycles, given the broadening of your platform, that it is becoming less of a relevant issue. What's the thinking about it?"

So is this more kind of expanding? And at the same time, different part of security also need to be more working together. So that's from a company IT side. 
They look if they can consolidate and help them to manage and integrate, automate will be more important. So that's where -- like I said, there's more device, more people connected than like wholesale maybe more in the zero trust environment. 
So this time is a little bit different, and that's why we're making like a very broad integrated approach, I feel is more important. And at the same time supporting whether the new technology, the wider 5G SD-WAN and also kind of maybe service model also will be important. But we also feel once the product get in the customer hand, because of the huge computing power capability, we can also will be add additional service and keeping -- helping customers adopt the new things they need and also [indiscernible] service provider.

Compared to where it was maybe 5 or 6, 7 years ago. For a number of reasons. One, the firewall vendors is simply larger, their footprint is much, much bigger than it was before. Secondly, you have -- some of us that are showing success in the platform strategy. When 30% of your billings are coming from the platform, again, to your point, it's going to get a little harder to discern it. 
And the sheer size, if you will, of the footprint in terms of customers, but also the number of different use cases that are starting to evolve and continue to evolve inside those organizations. I think all that comes together, it's going to get murkier and murkier as you go forward to find a refresh cycle. You may have some individual competitors that maybe have very, very large price points or machines or something like that, where they have their own internal refresh cycle that you may see the noise around.

And I think we provided some metrics there about large deals, deals over $1 million, which we think is a pretty good proxy for the success that we're seeing in the enterprise. 
I do think also the mid-segment is coming online for us, a little bit stronger than maybe we saw in 2020 and continue to believe that 2020 was an unusual year, both geographically and across customer segments. 
In terms of the cadence, in terms of how to sell the enterprise versus SMB, I would say absolutely. You make a large investment, and it plays very well with the channel partners. There's no doubt about that. The MSSPs, the carriers, et cetera. And those channel partners oftentimes, particularly distributors play a role in the enterprise. But to be successful there, you absolutely have to have a direct sales force that is helping to bring deals to those channel partners. 
And I kind of made a comment earlier about incumbency versus challenger. I think that's perhaps even more important in a geography where you're the challenger, and you're trying to get mind share from some of those large key resellers that are linked together with some of the legacy firewall vendors. I mean, you've really got to partner with them to bring deals to them and convince them of that strategy. And I think we're starting to see that traction take hold for us."

So I would expect that the other comment I would offer is, Ken has been quite clear. First setting the goal early on that he wanted SD-WAN to be 5% of billings. When we got there, we moved it to 10%. And we got there and now we're moving to 15%. So it's a little bit of who moved my cheese, I guess, with Ken -- in terms of setting goals for us. But that's fine. We like that.

But as I have to say, it's not many solution to meet, some are requests. Because internal, whether be in the compass of within the data center, the network speed tend to be easily 10 to 100x more faster than the WAN approach. I mean, the WAN connection.

And again, we're selling solutions, so you're typically bundling that with a firewall sale. 
To see the non-FortiGate billings growth at that 50% number and seeing the mix of the business, I think, may obviously makes us very excited. It's actually a little bit counterintuitive in terms of where it sells. For the last several quarters, the Americas has done very, very well with selling the fabric. And I've been on phone calls with very large enterprises that want to know much more about the fabric now that they've become comfortable with the firewall. 
I probably went into those conversations, Saket, with much the same expectation that you perhaps described, which is that may be something that plays more to the SMB part of the business or the mid enterprise. And I do think it does. I do think the enterprise willingness. And in the U.S., to see the enterprise willingness to engage on the fabric, it's probably a sign of a number of things. One is, at the end of the day, everybody's got a budget, and this is a more cost-effective way to go about doing it. You can manage your infrastructure much, much easier perhaps with a single vendor strategy than you might otherwise. 
And I think the common operating system with it running on or being integrated to OS 7 is something that's very exciting. And then you start talking to the vision about a SASE offering that's running on an integrated OS 7 system as well. So I gave you a lot there. But to give color to it, I think the long-winded response would be, it has not shown to be unique to a size of customer or to a geography."

But definitely, from a customer angle, we also asked what's the reason is they really need to be consolidate, make the whole infrastructure, manage working together, all these kind of things, which are working quite well with us because we designed a product optimum working with FortiGate from day 1, and making the whole fabric working together to integrate, automate the security solution there. 
So that's where the -- also we see there's still small percentage customer that has a multiparter still a lot of room to grow. And at the same time, is, there's a new product even come up to working with a FortiGate. So that's where we do see -- we'll probably keep the trend. Non-FortiGate will keeping grow faster and probably eventually, even the business maybe more than FortiGate, maybe within a few years."

We are very pleased with our strong first quarter performance. Billing increased 27% to $851 million, driven by solid execution across our broad and integrated product and services. Secure SD-WAN contributed 14% to first quarter billing.  
Total revenue grew 23% to $710 million, with product revenue growth of 25%, the highest quarterly product revenue growth in the last 5 years. With strong business momentum and good visibility, we remain focused on growth. In the first quarter, we released FortiOS 7.0, which offer the industry's first OS level with tight integration of a broad security and network functions, including SASE, SD-WAN, Zero Trust Network Access, CASB and 5G capability.  
Today, we announced the FortiGate 7121F, the world's fastest next-generation firewall and the only firewall with hyperscale 400-gig interface. The 7121F for 5G mobile network operators to secure multiple hedges within their infrastructure and enable MSPs to build up scalable security offerings.  
Powered by a new MP7 security process unit, the 7121F delivers Security Compute Rating of 2x to 19x greater than competitive solutions. We continue to see momentum and adoption of our SD-WAN SASE and Zero Trust Network Access Solution among the world's largest service providers. Today, we announced British Telecom, a new managed secure SD-WAN service powered by Fortinet. In March, Fortinet and AT&T announced the viability of a new managed SASE solution for enterprise customers.  
Increasingly, organizations are consolidating towards a holistic platform approach, delivering integrated and automated security to cover on-premise network, endpoint and cloud secure edge. The Fortinet Security Fabric is a cybersecurity platform organically built on a broad and a deep set of networking and security technology designed to seamlessly operate together.  
The high profile of security incident that occurred over the past few months, along with the pandemic, has elevated the need for a broad platform that can secure an enterprise and high infrastructure across multiple edge in a zero trust environment. We expect companies to increase the percentage of IT spending used for security in an effort to address their server security needs.  
Our security-driven networking approach is a key growth driver. Additionally, we expect that our significant organic product growth will lead to increased service revenue.

And to add to your comment, we should note that billings growth, product revenue growth and total revenue growth were each at 5-year highs.  Okay.

And to add to your comment, we should note that billings growth, product revenue growth and total revenue growth were each at 5-year highs.  
Okay. Let's start the more detailed Q1 discussion with revenue. Total revenue of $710 million was up 23%, driven by industry-leading product revenue growth of 25%. Product revenue growth was broad-based across geographies, security fabric products and use cases, illustrating the market acceptance of our integrated single platform security strategy, customer demand for security across their entire infrastructure and the diversity of our customer base.  
Product revenue growth was over 30% for both infrastructure and cloud fabric products. And all 3 geographic regions increased 20% or more. Demand for security fabric products was strong across all form factors: hardware, software and virtual machines. The growth we experienced for product revenue was not the result of a few large deals, lower backlog or higher channel partner inventory levels.  
The product revenue growth also enables increases in services billings and future services revenue. In the first quarter, service revenue of $470 million was up 22%. Support and related services revenue increased 23% to $214 million. Security subscription services revenue increased 21% to $255 million, benefiting from outsized growth from our cloud provider and SaaS security offerings.  
Moving to the mix of FortiGate and non-FortiGate platform revenue. The FortiGate segment of the fabric platform saw revenue increase 17%, driven by demand for entry-level and high-end FortiGate products. High end includes 10 new NP7 powered FortiGates that were introduced in the past year, which includes today's announcement of the 7120F. These new products now represent approximately 20% of high-end FortiGate shipments.  
Our ASIC-driven FortiGate gives customers 5 to 10x more computing power than firewalls that run on common CPUs. The advanced computing power creates not only speed but also the capacity to continue to add functionality to our operating system, driving our price for performance advantage. The non-FortiGate segment saw revenue grow over 40%, and now accounts for 31% of total revenue, up 4 percentage points. The integrated securities fabric solutions consists of the complete range of form factors and delivery methods, including physical and virtual appliances, cloud, SaaS and perpetual software as well as hosted and nonhosted solutions. Together, they provide a range of security solutions and form factors, enabling integrated protection for hybrid environments and the expanding digital attack surface from the data center to the endpoint to the cloud.  
Given the strong first quarter performance -- excuse me, revenue performance, we believe our non-FortiGate platform is now on a pace to be a $1 billion business this year, representing an acceleration of this milestone.  
Let's turn to revenue by geographies. A summary is on Slide 5. Revenue in the Asia Pacific area increased 26%, and media revenue increased 25%, and the Americas posted revenue growth of 20%. As I mentioned earlier, all 3 regions experienced product revenue growth of 20% or more.  
Moving to billings. The first quarter billings were $851 million, up 27%. We saw strong growth in both the FortiGate and non-FortiGate segments of our security fabric platform. The FortiGate segment delivered billings growth of 20%, accounting for 70% of total billings. As shown on Slide 6, entry-level FortiGates posted very strong billings growth in the quarter. The non-FortiGate segment accounted for 30% of total billings and delivered billings growth of 50%, driving a 4-point year-over-year mix shift to non-FortiGate.  
Taken together, these data points highlight the market acceptance of our single integrated security platform strategy. In terms of billing growth by geos, the APAC outperformed all geos, followed by Europe and the Americas. In the Americas, Canada had a very strong quarter, and Latin America rebounded from the pandemic-induced slowdown posted billings growth in the mid-20% range.  
Moving to billings by customer segments. The small enterprise segment posted solid growth across all geos. This segment is driven by new customer acquisitions, customer security fabric expansions, solid execution by our channel partners and the large diverse makeup of this international customer segment.  
At the same time, we saw strong growth in our larger deals. The number of deals over $1 million grew 74% to 66 deals in the first quarter. The pipeline for deals over $1 million looks good for the remainder of the year. As Ken noted, secure SD-WAN billings were 14% of total billings. SD-WAN is a key functionality in an integrated SASE solution.  
Moving to worldwide billings by industry verticals. With another strong international performance, the worldwide government sector topped all verticals at 19% of total billings and was up 60%. Service providers and MSSPs accounted for 16% of total billings. The rebound for education accelerated with billings growth of 50%. Retail turned in a solid quarter with billings growth of 21%. Our strong and consistent billings and revenue performance over the past several years is testament to our geographic and customer diversity, the growing success with a single integrated security platform strategy, and our ASIC advantage, which enables a shared operating system across the security fabric platform, drives our price for performance advantage, increase the capacity to add features and functions while maintaining price points.  
Moving back to the income statement. As shown on Slide 4, total gross margin improved 10 basis points to 78.9%. Product gross margin improved 120 basis points to 62.6%, benefiting from lower direct product costs. The increase in product gross margin offsets the drag on total gross margins from the revenue mix shift driven by the strong product revenue growth and a gross margin FX headwind of about 25 basis points. Operating margin for the first quarter increased 210 basis points to 24.5%, benefiting from the strong revenue performance in the quarter. The benefit from lower travel and marketing program expenses of approximately 100 basis points was more than offset by an operating margin headwind from foreign exchange of about 150 basis points.  
To end the quarter -- we ended the quarter with total headcount of 8,615, an increase of 16%.  
Moving to the statement of cash flow summarized on Slide 7 and 8. Free cash flow for the first quarter came in at $264 million, up $22 million from the first quarter of 2020 despite a $24.5 million year-over-year increase in CapEx spending. We ended the year with total cash and investments of $3.1 billion, an increase of $1.5 billion. The increase includes the proceeds from our $1 billion investment-grade debt issuance during the first quarter. The issuance followed our inaugural strong BBB credit ratings.  
Throughout the pandemic, we have leveraged the strength of our balance sheet as a competitive advantage to support our partners and customers as they experience geo-specific economic challenges. As a result, days sales outstanding increased 7 days to 81 days, in line with our expectations and reflecting our earlier decision to provide geographically targeted extended payment terms.  
Compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, DSOs in the first quarter of 2021 decreased 6 days as we saw early progress towards returning to pre-pandemic payment terms. Inventory turns declined to 2.1x from 2.5x, reflecting the efforts we took to mitigate supply chain risk, including increasing our inventory levels starting earlier in 2020. We expect extended payment terms and higher inventory balances to be in effect as we move through 2021.  
Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $52 million, including $38 million related to construction and other real estate activity. We expect to begin moving employees over the new Sunnyvale Campus building in the middle of the year, although the timing will depend on local pandemic protocols and employee safety considerations. We estimate capital expenditures for the second quarter to between $30 million and $40 million. And for all of 2021 to between $150 million and $170 million. The average contract term in the first quarter was approximately 27 months, up less than 2 months from the first quarter of 2020 and down approximately 1 month from the fourth quarter of 2020.  
Secure SD-WAN accounted for 15 deals over $1 million versus 4 in the first quarter of 2020 and contributed to the increase in average contract term. As we look forward, our goal remains to balance growth and profitability. And given the growth opportunities we highlighted during the March Analyst Day and as confirmed in our first quarter results, we have tilted our bias towards growth for at least the next several quarters. The opportunities we see are supported by a strong pipeline, increased sales capacity and our development efforts, which include the NP7 chip and our new FortiOS 7.0 operating system that was recently released.  
Now I'd like to review our outlook for the second quarter guidance, summarized on Slide 9, which is subject to the disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For the second quarter, we expect billings in the range of $860 million to $880 million; revenue in the range of $733 million to $747 million; non-GAAP gross margin of 78.5% to 79.5%; non-GAAP operating margin of 24.5% to 25.5%, which includes an expected 100 to 150 basis point headwind from foreign exchange; non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.83 to $0.88, which assumes a share count of between 168 million and 170 million.  
We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 21%. Before raising our 2021 guidance, I'd like to congratulate every member of the Fortinet team for the truly outstanding start to 2021. With that, for 2021, we expect billings in the range of $3.685 billion to $3.745 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of approximately 20%. The revenue in the range of $3.080 billion to $3.130 billion which at the midpoint represents growth of approximately 20%. Total service revenue in the range of $2.020 billion to $2.050 billion, which represents growth of approximately 21% and implies product revenue growth of approximately 17%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 78% to 80%; non-GAAP operating margin of 25% to 27%. When backing out the 2020 T&E benefit, the midpoint of the guidance represents a 50 to 100 basis point increase in 2021 operating margin despite an expected headwind from foreign exchange.  
Non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.65 to $3.80, which assumes a share count of between 170 million and 172 million and about $0.07 per share impact from the debt issuance. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 21%. We expect cash taxes to be approximately $80 million.  
And along with Ken, I'd like to thank our partners, our customers and the Fortinet team for all their support and hard work in these difficult and unique times. And I now hand the call back over to Peter, to begin the Q&A."

At 2x inventory turns, you're looking at basically 6 months of inventory that we're carrying on our balance sheet. 
I do expect that the supply chain issues will be something, particularly related to chips that will be a constant conversation point throughout 2021 and into 2022. But I think in terms of when we sit down and talk about our expectations for the year, I think we have a pretty good understanding of how to work that in."

And let's say it's still early stage, but we do involve a lot of testing trials. And at the same time, I do believe eventually, the service provider business will go back up to the #1. It tends to be like a high 20, like if you go back 4, 5 years ago but because it's a new kind of shifting. So they are -- they do have some work to do. And also some big investments obviously going forward. So we're working together with them to keeping growing this business right now."

On the other side, we do believe whether the SASE network, like we said a few years ago, it's the best position probably for the service provider carrier. So we tend to be working with and partner with them, and also offer kind of more tightly integrated solution, like we said in the FortiOS 7.0 is really integrated to OS level instead of some different vendors using different box, or even kind of a different infrastructure to do that. 
So that's actually working much better with a wider service provider, with the customer directly. So that's why we do see there is some plus growing going forward. But it's just part of the whole infrastructure solution will now replace the traditional approach. But also the [indiscernible] security is part of that dynamic space. There's a new thing come up and also the that [indiscernible] also now goes away. So that's where we try to address this new chain.

So that's -- it's not a simple refresh. It's really changing to the whole infrastructure approach and also working together with traditionally like different vendor cover, whether network endpoint or some other part of security. Now they're looking for some consolidation. And they prefer when to have a multiple cover of different part of infrastructure working together so that you can see the fabric approach we did few years ago starting doing quite well. 
And almost pretty much every quarter, doubled the growth compared to the traditional network security. But on the network security, we also see very healthy growth. And it's very -- not just expanding beyond the traditional border security product, but also because the ASIC advantage, which increased the secure computing power 5 to 10x compared to the other vendor software load on the traditional CPU. So that's able to add more function and also kind of increase performance, lower the cost and also lower power consumption, more green. 
So that's actually making this -- like the product growth, like we said, keeping us -- keep doing better and better. And we do see this whole infrastructure approach will keeping going for the next, probably, a few quarters, even to a few years, and the consolidation will keep it going within the industry."

In terms of growth and how we see it with new logos, expansion opportunities, we easily add several thousand new customers every quarter. But if you look at the mix of billings, the mix of billings is going to come from our installed base of customers, if you will. 
And I think the simple model to look at is from that initial sale of perhaps a firewall or something else, there's 2 different ways to expand. One is finding more and more use cases inside organizations for firewalls and increasing the displacement opportunities; and then the second is, and this is where Ken was going, is the expansion opportunity with those non-FortiGate fabric partner products. And what we're seeing there with that mix shift from FortiGates to non-FortiGates and now being 30% of our business or 31% of our business, I think it's taking as, one, affirmation of the strategy and; two you're seeing it in the numbers."

It's -- we're keeping -- gaining market share, like I said, because there's fundamental like a technology architecture difference, which we've factored 10x the computing power compared to our competitor, we can easily add a function performance. And even for work from home, it's more like a one single [ Forti bot ] can replace like 3, 4 different bots from an open SaaS security side like all this part and also like a managed home WiFi and the traffic there. 
So that's also -- a lot of company also starting to do, this kind of expand the branch to the home called the home branch or whatever, to meet working standard like a better networking reliability, security to the home environment. So that also needs business solution. That's also one of the reasons we see some of the low end side keeping growth pretty fast. 
It's work for home actually helping driving some of these FortiGate sales. But also going forward, whether the service provider, some other -- I have to say most enterprise, not even  kind of changing much of infrastructure to adopt more work from home yet, and they are still in the early stage.

Your Q1 results clearly say that's working, billings growth in the high 20s at a scale approaching $1 billion. And doing that with healthy profit is pretty unique. 
So for my question, I was just wondering, at this point, if you evaluated whether to lean even more on growth, given the early results that you're seeing. And if you could maybe touch on the logic of why not? Are there diminishing returns above this level? Is this something you'd consider reevaluating as the year progresses?"

I think the level of execution has shown to be very, very high and the level of success with the firewalls and the non-FortiGate products have been -- we're very, very pleased with what's happening there. 
I think we'll see how this year plays out. We felt that there were tailwinds coming into the year for us in a number of different ways, whether it was GDP, whether it was seamless, whether it was the product suite that we had or our sales team's ability to execute.

So once -- especially during the pandemic, IT is pretty high pressured to supporting whether internal or some other need.

And I think we provided some metrics there about large deals, deals over $1 million, which we think is a pretty good proxy for the success that we're seeing in the enterprise. 
I do think also the mid-segment is coming online for us, a little bit stronger than maybe we saw in 2020 and continue to believe that 2020 was an unusual year, both geographically and across customer segments. 
In terms of the cadence, in terms of how to sell the enterprise versus SMB, I would say absolutely. You make a large investment, and it plays very well with the channel partners. There's no doubt about that. The MSSPs, the carriers, et cetera. And those channel partners oftentimes, particularly distributors play a role in the enterprise. But to be successful there, you absolutely have to have a direct sales force that is helping to bring deals to those channel partners. 
And I kind of made a comment earlier about incumbency versus challenger. I think that's perhaps even more important in a geography where you're the challenger, and you're trying to get mind share from some of those large key resellers that are linked together with some of the legacy firewall vendors. I mean, you've really got to partner with them to bring deals to them and convince them of that strategy. And I think we're starting to see that traction take hold for us."

So I would expect that -- the other comment I would offer is, Ken has been quite clear. First setting the goal early on that he wanted SD-WAN to be 5% of billings. When we got there, he moved it to 10%. And we got there and now he's moved it to 15%. So it's a little bit of who moved my cheese, I guess, with Ken in terms of setting goals for us. But that's fine.

That's also the ASIC has more advantage, like 5 to 10x better performance, computing power and costs lower than other software-only approach. So it's a lot of requests. But as I have to say, it's not many solution can meet some of the requests. Because internal, whether be in the compass of within the data center, the network speed tend to be easily 10 to 100x more faster than the WAN approach -- I mean, the WAN connection. 
So that's where we're working with whether the customer or the partner directly and also combine both the WAN security and the LAN security and the [indiscernible] infrastructure is more important.

And again, we're selling solutions, so you're typically bundling that with a firewall sale. 
To see the non-FortiGate billings growth at that 50% number and seeing the mix of the business, I think, obviously makes us very excited. It's actually a little bit counterintuitive in terms of where it sells. For the last several quarters, the Americas has done very, very well with selling the fabric. And I've been on phone calls with very large enterprises that want to know much more about the fabric now that they've become comfortable with the firewall. 
I probably went into those conversations, Saket, with much the same expectation that you perhaps described, which is that may be something that plays more to the SMB part of the business or the mid enterprise. And I do think it does. I do think the enterprise willingness -- and in the U.S., to see the enterprise willingness to engage on the fabric is probably a sign of a number of things. One is, at the end of the day, everybody's got a budget, and this is a more cost-effective way to go about doing it. You can manage your infrastructure much, much easier perhaps with a single vendor strategy than you might otherwise. 
And I think the common operating system with it running on or being integrated to OS 7 is something that's very exciting. And then you start talking to the vision about a SASE offering that's running on an integrated OS 7 system as well. So I gave you a lot there. But to give color to it, I think the long-winded response would be, it has not shown to be unique to a size of customer or to a geography."

Billings increased 35% to $961 million driven by solid execution and was the best it has been since 2015. Secure SMA accounts for 14% of second quarter billings. Total revenue grew 30% to $801 million with product revenue up 41%. Product revenue growth was the highest for nearly 10 years. Free cash flow was $395 million, a quarterly record level.

And to add to your comments, we should note that as in the prior quarter, billings growth, product revenue growth and total revenue growth, all accelerated sequentially.

And to add to your comments, we should note that as in the prior quarter, billings growth, product revenue growth and total revenue growth, all accelerated sequentially. In fact, all 3 growth rates were at 5-year Fortinet highs and product revenue growth was at its highest in over 9 years. 
Okay, let's start with a more detailed Q2 discussion with revenue. Total revenue of $801 million was up 30% driven by industry-leading product revenue growth of 41%. The product revenue growth was broad-based across geographies, FortiGate and non-FortiGate products and across use cases illustrating market acceptance and customer demand for our integrated single platform security fabric strategy across customer infrastructures.
Our financial strategy includes a Rule of 40 target. We target the total of the revenue growth percentage and operating margin to be at least 40. In the second quarter, strong demand and execution drove this actual total to be a Rule of 55.
FortiGate product revenue growth was 40%. While we continue to see robust growth from our secure SD-WAN functionality. The majority of the growth was driven by FortiGate revenue from other capabilities, which are embedded in the FortiGate operating system. Non-FortiGate product revenue growth was over 40% for the second consecutive quarter and was driven by strong growth from our Integrated Security Fabric products.
One additional comment on our product revenue growth. The product revenue growth was a reflection of our continued strong organic growth and not the result of a few large deals, drawing down backlog nor an unusual number of delayed transactions from the prior quarter or pulled into future periods.
Service revenue of $503 million was up 24%. Support and related services revenue of $230 million was up 26%, while security subscription services revenue of $273 million was up 23%.
Moving to the mix of FortiGate and non-FortiGate platform revenue. FortiGate product and services revenue increased 26% driven by very strong demand for both branch and high-end FortiGate products. High-end products included 10 NP7 powered FortiGate models, representing approximately 25% of high-end FortiGate shipments. Our ASIC-driven FortiGates give customers 5x to 10x more computing power than firewalls running on common CPUs. The advanced computing power creates additional speed and capacity to continue to add functionality to our operating system, further driving our price for performance advantage.
The combination of the ASIC Advantage and the common operating system across products, can enable vendor consolidation, lowering total cost of ownership and increasing automation. Non-FortiGate products and services revenue grew 39% and accounted for approximately 30% of total revenue, up over 2 percentage points.
The Integrated Security Fabric consists of a complete range, which closed -- reversal for all our hands meeting later on today. So you've got an inside scoop on what Patrice is going to say. We start again, if I may. Non-FortiGate products and services revenue grew 39% and accounted for approximately 30% of total revenue, up over 2 percentage points. The Integrated Security Fabric consists of a complete range of form factors and delivery methods, including physical and virtual appliances, cloud, SaaS and perpetual software as well as hosted and nonhosted solutions. Together, they provide a range of security solutions and form factors, enabling integrated protection for the hybrid environments and the expanding digital attack surface from network data centers to endpoints to the cloud.
Let's turn to revenue by geo. The summary is on Slide 5. Revenue in EMEA increased 34%. The Americas revenue increased 29% and APAC posted revenue growth of 24%. The Product revenue growth for both the Americas and EMEA regions was over 40%.
Moving to billings. Second quarter billings were $961 million, up 35%. We saw strong growth in both the FortiGate and non-FortiGate segment of the Security Fabric platform. The FortiGate segment delivered billings growth of over 30%, accounting for 71% of total billings. As shown on Slide 6, branch and high-end FortiGates posted very strong billings growth. The non-FortiGate segment accounted for over 29% of total billings and delivered billings growth of over 45%, driving a 2-point mix shift to non-FortiGate products and services. Given the continued strong performance, we believe our non-FortiGate platform is on a pace to be a $1 billion business this year.
Secure SD-WAN billings represented 14% of total billings and is a key functionality for an integrated SASE solution. In terms of billings by geo, EMEA outperformed all geos, followed by the Americas and APAC. Europe had a very good quarter, and growth in the Americas was driven by the United States, which was up sequentially by more than 30 percentage points. Latin America continued to recover from the pandemic-induced slowdown, closing billings growth in the mid-20s for the second consecutive quarter. The average contract term was approximately 28 months, up 2 months from the second quarter of 2020 and 1 month in the first quarter of 2021.
Deals over $1 million increased from 59 to 79, and the pipeline for deals over $1 million continues to look good for the remainder of the year. Secure SD-WAN deals over $1 million increased from 13 to 19.
Moving to worldwide billings by industry verticals. Billings by vertical illustrate diversification in our business model and importantly, suggest the current threat landscape is driving security investments in industries that may have historically shown lower investment levels. For example, the verticals that have historically not been in our top 5 combined for billings growth of over 75%. Service providers accounted for 14% of total billings and were up 25%. 
Moving back to the income statement. Product revenue growth of 41% drove a 3-point shift in the product and services revenue mix. And along with it, a gross margin decrease of 160 basis points to 77.5%. Product gross margin improved 70 basis points to 61.7%. Services gross margin decreased 160 basis points to 86.9% with data center investments in FX accounting for about 100 basis points of the impact.
Operating margin of 25.4% was at the top end of the guidance range despite a 350 basis point headwind from the gross margin decline, a weaker U.S. dollar and increased travel and marketing event costs. We ended the quarter with a total headcount of 9,043, an increase of 17%.
Moving to the statement of cash flow summarized on Slide 7 and 8. Free cash flow for the second quarter came in at a quarterly record of $395 million, benefiting from strong revenue growth, good month 1 linearity and lower capital expenditures. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 455,000 shares of common stock for a total cost of $92 million at an average share price of approximately $201. The remaining share repurchase authorization at the end of the second quarter was 921 million with the authorization set to expire at the end of February 2022. We ended the first half of the year with total cash and investments of $3.4 billion, an increase of $1.7 billion. The increase includes the proceeds from our $1 billion investment-grade debt issuance during the first quarter of 2021. 
DSOs returned to pre-pandemic levels, decreasing 7 days year-over-year and 15 days quarter-over-quarter to 66 days. Inventory turns increased to 2.7x from 2.2x, reflecting strong product sales in the quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $24 million, and we have started to move into the new Sunnyvale building. We estimate third quarter capital expenditures to be between $65 million and $75 million, which includes a $30 million payment for the new campus building. We estimate 2021 capital expenditures to be between $175 million and $200 million.
With the acceleration of the growth and a little more understanding of the post-pandemic work patterns, we're turning our attention to reviewing our facilities footprint and the needed office and warehouse capacity in the U.S. and Canada. As we work through this process, it is possible that our estimated capital expenditures over the next few quarters will increase as we prepare for the next phase of our growth. Looking forward, our goal remains to balance growth and profitability. And given the growth opportunities that we believe lie ahead, we continue to expect to tilt our bias within this framework more towards growth for at least the next several quarters.
The opportunities we see are supported by a strong pipeline, increased sales effectiveness, the growing success with a single integrated security platform strategy and the convergence of security and networking, the response to the current threat environment and our development efforts, which include continuing to invest in our ASIC advantage, which enables a shared operating system across the Security Fabric platform drives our price for performance advantage, increase the capacity to add features and functions while maintaining price points.
And now I can review our outlook for the third quarter, summarized on Slide 9, which is subject to disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For the third quarter, we expect billings in the range of $940 million to $960 million; revenue in the range of $800 million to $815 million. Non-GAAP gross margin of 77.5% to 78.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin of 24.5% to 25.5%, which includes an estimated 200 basis point headwind from foreign exchange and increased travel and marketing costs. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.90 to $0.95, which assumes a share count of between $169 million and $171 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 21%.
With that, we are raising our 2021 guidance and expect billings in the range of $3.87 billion to $3.92 billion, which the midpoint represents growth of approximately 26%. Revenue in the range of $3.210 billion to $3.250 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of approximately 24.5%. Total service revenue in the range of $2.045 billion, $2.075 billion, which represents growth of approximately 23% and it implies full year product revenue growth of approximately 28%.
Non-GAAP gross margin of 77% to 79%. Non-GAAP operating margins of 25% to 27%, which includes an estimated 200 basis point headwind from foreign exchange and increased travel and marketing costs. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.75 to $3.90, which assumes a share count of between 168 million and 170 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 21%. We expect cash taxes to be approximately $90 million. 
Along with Ken, I'd like to thank our partners, customers and the Fortinet team for all their hard work, execution and outstanding success in the first half of 2021. I'll now hand the call back over to Peter for the Q&A session."

I think the industry whether doing pandemid or after the pandemic probably in some kind of a structure changing it's no longer the traditional border kind of firewall will be enough. You have to expand into the 1 side like Secure SD-WAN and also internal has to do like the internal segmentation, replacing the switch with secure switch and the Wi-Fi to prevent all this kind of resin of kind of internal attack. So that's where -- and also a consolidation also going on and also need to have an integrated like a different part of infrastructure to integrate together to protect the whole attack from multi kind of tech service protection there. So that's where we see it's a big change for the whole architecture of how to architect the new protection architecture to protect the whole infrastructure security there. So that's probably different than just refresh the traditional firewall, but it's the new expanded infrastructure need to be -- have all protection there. So that's what we see like the product we announced today sort of 100 is more go inside the high-speed network environment to do all this kind of internal segmentation, within data center protection and all these kind of things. And then also, we see very strong growth, whether the CQS brand and also the 5G world. That's a lot of brand trial face working home solution there.

And also, the product revenue growth like 41% is also where strong we feel that our product is really different than the traditional or some more competitors using the CPU only. So we have the latest CPU for our industry, but also we developed ASIC in the last 21 years. just like the product we announced today, the 3500 based on our calculation, we call secure computing region basis, for the same cost, what's the function performance compared to other competitors or industry average. So we'll have a 6x better performance basically like -- because the computing power vent is huge from our own ASIC. So that's we're changing the landscape of like the product or whether the network security product or some other leveraged ASIC. This huge computing power gave us much more function and better performance that can easily replace a lot of our competitors.
At the same time, we did see the expansion to the addressable market, whether we will or home or kind of a secure internal network inside the company, inside data center, which also drives a lot of high-end product growth. So the high product percentage also, we see probably pretty high, maybe the highest in the last few quarters or even last few years."

You do see us doing tuck-in acquisitions. Sometimes it takes a little bit longer to bring to market perhaps because the technologies are things that we want to work with a little bit more before we bring them out. So I don't think that's a surprise. I don't know that, that precludes us from doing something larger in the future, but we'll look at those opportunities as they come up. The continuing focus will be finding the opportunities to rebalance the balance sheet with a little bit of and deploying some of the cash that we raised with debt offering, perhaps to repurchase some share buyback, if you will. And at the same time, also, as we look out for the next 3 to 5 years, and we anticipate continued growth, perhaps a little more investment, if you will, in our facilities footprint."

The SD-WAN, we still see very, very strong demand and also huge potential.

We see a huge advantage compared to some other competitor, whether using the universal CPE or a mother approach, which is difficult to add any function because the power limitation from a low-cost CPU. So that's where we do believe we will be the leader, the #1 leader in SD-WAN space. If not now, definitely will be soon. And SD-WAN offer kind of had advantage like reliability, the cost saving compared to the traditional networking protocol NPLs or some other part. And also a lot of service provider also starting kind of more focused on the SD-WAN or 5G, some other part, which also kind of see in our kind of long-term bigger picture, we call secure-driven networking, which will be compared to today, all the networking just through the connection and the speed and then the secure network also need to look an application, the content, the device behind the user, behind an even different kind of location there.

There's a quite a broad kind of like a buying pattern compared to before. And that's also we do believe we eventually will drive the additional service because once the product revenue go up and the user service revenue will come in later.

The tailwinds included whether it was SD-WAN or OT, as an example. The refresh opportunity, if you will, is really an opportunity for us to review as an opportunity to displace the incumbents as compared to Fortinet that has 500,000 customers in 70 different firewall models and we even today, we announced a new firewall in our press release. It's not as if historically, you've seen blips with us in terms of spikes from refresh. But on the flip side, some of the competitors, the legacy players have a shorter list of customers and a shorter list of products and maybe you're not doing as well in Gartner Magic Quadrants as we are. So we view that as an opportunity.
I do think that other tailwinds that came into the quarter, we talked about the verticals, Ken mentioned it again. And also when I look at our customer sizes, whether SMB all the way to the Global 2000 did very, very well. I think one thing that stood out for us was the mid-enterprise or the commercial part of the business. That came on very, very strong in the quarter as well. So I think there was a long list of tailwinds for us that worked in our favor on that product revenue growth number."

Billings increased 35% to $961 million driven by solid execution and was the best it has been since 2015. Secure SD-WAN accounts for 14% of second quarter billings. Total revenue grew 30% to $801 million with product revenue up 41%. Product revenue growth was the highest for nearly 10 years. Free cash flow was $395 million, a quarterly record level. With strong business momentum, we remain focused on growth.
Today, we announced expansion of our FortiCare and FortiGuard security services, adding a new security service called FortiTrust. FortiTrust security service offer user-based licensing that follow the user across the operations entire security platform. This enable organizations to easily manage and secure across all networks, endpoint and cloud, which traditionally has been sideloaded. 
Initial service level are being offered for Zero Trust Network Access and identity verification. We enhance the current FortiCare security services, which cover all Fortinet Security Fabric product with 3 level of services, so including 24/7 technical support and timely issue resolution. Additionally, FortiTrust security service has been fine-tuned for different segments with added individual services for enterprise, bundled for commercial and the packages for SMB, leveraging industry-leading threat intelligence from FortiGuard Lab. FortiCare secure service offer market-leading AI-enabled secured capability that regularly adjust protection across the Fortinet Security Fabric. 
Today, we announced a new FortiGate 3500F, the industry's first high-performance next-generation firewall, with integrated Zero Trust Network Access and ransomware protection powered by the Fortinet NP7 ASIC's SPU, the 3500F offers an average 6x more performance than other competitive products based on our security compute reading. This makes the 3500F the best protection for high-speed internal network [ on-base ] centers.
We continue to see the momentum and adoption of our SD-WAN Zero Trust Network Access and cloud solutions among the world's largest service providers. In May, Fortinet was recognized as the winner of the Microsoft Security Customer Impact Award. Last week, Fortinet was named Google Cloud's 2020 Security Partner of the Year, recognized for innovative thinking, outstanding customer service and best-in-class use of our cloud products and services.
Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers and partners worldwide for their continued support and hard work."

And to add to your comments, we should note that as in the prior quarter, billings growth, product revenue growth and total revenue growth, all accelerated sequentially. In fact, all 3 growth rates were at 5-year Fortinet highs and product",1756,"Thank you, Ken. And to add to your comments, we should note that as in the prior quarter, billings growth, product revenue growth and total revenue growth, all accelerated sequentially. In fact, all 3 growth rates were at 5-year Fortinet highs and product revenue growth was at its highest in over 9 years. 
Okay. Let's start with a more detailed Q2 discussion with revenue. Total revenue of $801 million was up 30%, driven by industry-leading product revenue growth of 41%. The product revenue growth was broad-based across geographies, FortiGate and non-FortiGate products and across use cases illustrating market acceptance and customer demand for our integrated single platform Security Fabric strategy across customer infrastructures.
Our financial strategy includes a Rule of 40 target. We target the total of the revenue growth percentage and operating margin to be at least 40. In the second quarter, strong demand and execution drove this actual total to be a Rule of 55.
FortiGate product revenue growth was 40%. While we continue to see robust growth from our secure SD-WAN functionality. The majority of the growth was driven by FortiGate revenue from other capabilities, which are embedded in the FortiGate operating system. Non-FortiGate product revenue growth was over 40% for the second consecutive quarter and was driven by strong growth from our integrated Security Fabric products.
One additional comment on our product revenue growth. The product revenue growth was a reflection of our continued strong organic growth and not the result of a few large deals, drawing down backlog nor an unusual number of delayed transactions from the prior quarter or pulled in from future periods.
Service revenue of $503 million was up 24%. Support and related services revenue of $230 million was up 26%, while security subscription services revenue of $273 million was up 23%.
Moving to the mix of FortiGate and non-FortiGate platform revenue. FortiGate product and services revenue increased 26% driven by very strong demand for both branch and high-end FortiGate products. High-end products included 10 NP7-powered FortiGate models, representing approximately 25% of high-end FortiGate shipments. 
Our ASIC-driven FortiGates give customers 5x to 10x more computing power than firewalls running on common CPUs. The advanced computing power creates additional speed and capacity to continue to add functionality to our operating system, further driving our price for performance advantage.
The combination of the ASIC Advantage and the common operating system across products, can enable vendor consolidation, lowering total cost of ownership and increasing automation. Non-FortiGate product and services revenue grew 39% and accounted for approximately 30% of total revenue, up over 2 percentage points.
The integrated Security Fabric consists of a complete range -- would you close that door? Bit of a rehearsal for our all hands meeting later on today. So you've got an inside scoop on what Patrice is going to say. 
Let me start again, if I may. Non-FortiGate products and services revenue grew 39% and accounted for approximately 30% of total revenue, up over 2 percentage points. The integrated Security Fabric consists of a complete range of form factors and delivery methods, including physical and virtual appliances, cloud, SaaS and perpetual software as well as hosted and non-hosted solutions. Together, they provide a range of security solutions and form factors, enabling integrated protection for the hybrid environments and the expanding digital attack surface from network data centers, to endpoints, to the cloud.
Let's turn to revenue by geo. The summary is on Slide 5. Revenue in EMEA increased 34%. The Americas revenue increased 29% and APAC posted revenue growth of 24%. Product revenue growth for both the Americas and EMEA regions was over 40%.
Moving to billings. Second quarter billings were $961 million, up 35%. We saw strong growth in both the FortiGate and non-FortiGate segment of the Security Fabric platform. The FortiGate segment delivered billings growth of over 30%, accounting for 71% of total billings. 
As shown on Slide 6, branch and high-end FortiGates posted very strong billings growth. The non-FortiGate segment accounted for over 29% of total billings and delivered billings growth of over 45%, driving a 2-point mix shift to non-FortiGate products and services. Given the continued strong performance, we believe our non-FortiGate platform is on a pace to be a $1 billion business this year.
Secure SD-WAN billings represented 14% of total billings and is a key functionality for an integrated SASE solution. In terms of billings by geo, EMEA outperformed all geos, followed by the Americas and APAC. Europe had a very good quarter, and growth in the Americas was driven by the United States, which was up sequentially by more than 30 percentage points. 
Latin America continued to recover from the pandemic-induced slowdown, closing billings growth in the mid-20s for the second consecutive quarter. The average contract term was approximately 28 months, up 2 months from the second quarter of 2020 and 1 month in the first quarter of 2021. Deals over $1 million increased from 59 to 79, and the pipeline for deals over $1 million continues to look good for the remainder of the year. Secure SD-WAN deals over $1 million increased from 13 to 19.
Moving to worldwide billings by industry verticals. Billings by vertical illustrate the diversification in our business model and importantly, suggest the current threat landscape is driving security investments in industries that may have historically shown lower investment levels. 
For example, the verticals that have historically not been in our top 5 combined for billings growth of over 75%. Service providers accounted for 14% of total billings and were up 25%. 
Moving back to the income statement. Product revenue growth of 41% drove a 3-point shift in the product and services revenue mix. And along with it, a gross margin decrease of 160 basis points to 77.5%. Product gross margin improved 70 basis points to 61.7%. Services gross margin decreased 160 basis points to 86.9% with data center investments in FX accounting for about 100 basis points of the impact.
Operating margin of 25.4% was at the top end of the guidance range despite a 350 basis point headwind from the gross margin decline, a weaker U.S. dollar and increased travel and marketing event cost. We ended the quarter with a total headcount of 9,043, an increase of 17%.
Moving to the statement of cash flow summarized on Slide 7 and 8. Free cash flow for the second quarter came in at a quarterly record of $395 million, benefiting from strong revenue growth, good month one linearity and lower capital expenditures. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 455,000 shares of common stock for a total cost of $92 million at an average share price of approximately $201. 
The remaining share repurchase authorization at the end of the second quarter was $921 million with the authorization set to expire at the end of February 2022. We ended the first half of the year with total cash and investments of $3.4 billion, an increase of $1.7 billion. The increase includes the proceeds from our $1 billion investment-grade debt issuance during the first quarter of 2021.
DSOs returned to pre-pandemic levels, decreasing 7 days year-over-year and 15 days quarter-over-quarter to 66 days. Inventory turns increased to 2.7x from 2.2x, reflecting strong product sales in the quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $24 million, and we have started to move into the new Sunnyvale building. 
We estimate third quarter capital expenditures to be between $65 million and $75 million, which includes a $30 million payment for the new campus building. We estimate 2021 capital expenditures to be between $175 million and $200 million.
With the acceleration of the growth and a little more understanding of the post-pandemic work patterns, we're turning our attention to reviewing our facilities footprint and the needed office and warehouse capacity in the U.S. and Canada. As we work through this process, it is possible that our estimated capital expenditures over the next few quarters will increase as we prepare for the next phase of our growth. 
Looking forward, our goal remains to balance growth and profitability. And given the growth opportunities that we believe lie ahead, we continue to expect to tilt our bias within this framework more towards growth for at least the next several quarters.
The opportunities we see are supported by a strong pipeline, increased sales effectiveness, the growing success with a single integrated security platform strategy and the convergence of security and networking, the response to the current threat environment and our development efforts, which include continuing to invest in our ASIC advantage, which enables a shared operating system across the Security Fabric platform, drives our price for performance advantage, increase the capacity to add features and functions while maintaining price points.
And now I can review our outlook for the third quarter, summarized on Slide 9, which is subject to disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For the third quarter, we expect billings in the range of $940 million to $960 million; revenue in the range of $800 million to $815 million; non-GAAP gross margin of 77.5% to 78.5%; non-GAAP operating margin of 24.5% to 25.5%, which includes an estimated 200 basis point headwind from foreign exchange and increased travel and marketing cost. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.90 to $0.95, which assumes a share count of between 169 million and 171 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 21%.
With that, we are raising our 2021 guidance and expect billings in the range of $3.87 billion to $3.92 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of approximately 26%. Revenue in the range of $3.210 billion to $3.250 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of approximately 24.5%. Total service revenue in the range of $2.045 billion, $2.075 billion, which represents growth of approximately 23% and it implies full year of product revenue growth of approximately 28%.
Non-GAAP gross margin of 77% to 79%. Non-GAAP operating margins of 25% to 27%, which includes an estimated 200 basis point headwind from foreign exchange and increased travel and marketing costs. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.75 to $3.90, which assumes a share count of between 168 million and 170 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 21%. We expect cash taxes to be approximately $90 million. 
Along with Ken, I'd like to thank our partners, customers and the Fortinet team for all their hard work, execution and outstanding success in the first half of 2021. I'll now hand the call back over to Peter for the Q&A session."

I think the industry, whether during the pandemic or after the pandemic probably in some kind of a structured changing, it's no longer the traditional border kind of firewall will be enough. You have to expand into the WAN side like Secure SD-WAN or 5G and also internal have to do like the internal segmentation, replacing the switch with secure switch and the WiFi to prevent all this kind of ransomware or kind of internal attack. 
So that's where -- and also a consolidation also going on and also need to have an integrated like a different part of infrastructure that could integrate together to protect the whole attack from multi kind of attack service protection there. So that's where we see it's a big change for the whole architecture of how to architect the new protection architecture to protect the whole infrastructure security there. 
So that's probably different than just refresh the traditional firewall, but it's the new expanded infrastructure need to be -- have all protection there. So that's what we see like the product we announced today 3500F is more go inside the high-speed network environment to do all this kind of internal segmentation, within data center protection and all these kind of things. 
And then also, we see very strong growth, whether the Secure SD-WAN and also the 5G growth. That's driven a lot of brand trial face work-on-home solution there. That's where the unit growth probably even much faster there. So we see the whole infrastructure being changed all because the secure-driven networking started kind of more adopt by both enterprise and also a different kind of vertical."

This quarter grew about 25%. So starting ramp up, like I mentioned, they are kind of building infrastructure, whether for the 5G, SD-WAN, or SASE, which we have a different strategy. Our SASE strategy actually quite a different -- probably very differentiated from other player. 
So we have a dual strategy. We are probably the only one working with service provider to building their SASE. And at the same time, like the service revenue, we kind of lower the margin that will be there, also investing some of our own infrastructure. If some customer don't have a service provider or want to work with that directly, we also have a kind of SASE solution there, which also integrate with the FortiDDoS. 
Inside FortiDDoS, they have a -- building SASE. Their trust network access and some other parts, it's also kind of a different than the competitor. And eventually, we also hope we can use an ASIC or [ salary ] to add additional computing power to our kind of on-site solution there.

Just like the product we announced today, the 3500F, based on our calculation, we call it security computing  region basis, for the same cost, what's the function performance compared to other competitors or industry average. So we'll have a 6x better performance basically like -- because the computing power advantage is huge from our own ASIC. So that's where changing the landscape of like the product or whether the network security product or some other leveraged ASIC. This huge computing power gave us much more function and a better performance that can easily replace a lot of our competitors.

But it's -- but also like among infrastructure, we do see like whether deploy on the WAN side, on the whatever the smart city or some other kind of internal infrastructure within data center or even work-from-home. There's a quite a broad kind of like a buying pattern compared to before. And that's also we do believe we eventually will drive the additional service because once the product revenue go up and the user service revenue will come in later. 
And also plus the introduction of the new FortiTrust a few weeks out also add additional layer of potential self-service for the future. It's definitely not -- definitely the secular -- like I mentioned earlier, we see the change of the security infrastructure. It's not kind of a refresh or replace the traditional firewall, which also, from time to time, need to be upgraded because the network has faster and faster, but also expanding into the new infrastructure part and also kind of a new area will be seen or kind of grow faster than the traditional medical finance service or some other part."

The tailwinds included whether it was SD-WAN or OT, as an example. The refresh opportunity, if you will, is really an opportunity for us to -- we view as an opportunity to displace the incumbents as compared to Fortinet that has 500,000 customers and 70 different firewall models. And we, even today, we announced a new firewall in our press release. 
It's not as if historically, you've seen blips with us in terms of spikes from refresh. But on the flip side, some of the competitors, the legacy players have a shorter list of customers and a shorter list of products and maybe you're not doing as well in Gartner Magic Quadrants as we are. So we view that as an opportunity.
I do think that other tailwinds that came into the quarter, we talked about the verticals, Ken mentioned it again. And also when I look at our customer sizes, whether SMB all the way to the Global 2000 did very, very well. I think one thing that stood out for us was the mid-enterprise or the commercial part of the business. That came on very, very strong in the quarter as well. So I think there was a long list of tailwinds for us that worked in our favor on that product revenue growth number."

According to Gartner, the network parameter is fragmented with many security teams and the tools operating in silos, and integrating best-of-breed solution only add to the complexity. To address this challenge, Gartner is predicting that by 2024 organizations that adopt our cybersecurity NASH architecture will reduce the financial impact of individual security incidents by an average of 90%. In a recent report, Gartner called Fortinet secured fabric as a platform that offers cybersecurity mesh architecture approach. Fortinet is helping customers solve the issue of capacity through our security-driven networking and security fabric platform approach. Fortinet is unrivaled for the ASIC offers 5 to 10x more security computing power, this result in title immigrate functionality with better performance, lower cost and consumption compared with the general view. Organically developed Fortinet solution like e-mail, web and endpoint together with Fortinet firewall offers much broader protection, both integration and better automation than other competitive solutions.  
As operations continue to consolidate towards a platform approach and as network security expand to local and wide area network to the work from anywhere environment and to the cloud, Fortinet is strongly positioned to significantly capture market share of a projected total addressable market of more than $174 billion by 2025. We are confident that this trend, together with the relentless focus on organic innovation, will drive better-than-industry average long-term growth for Fortinet. 
Work from Anywhere is here to stay The COVID-19 dynamic has greatly expanded the Work from Anywhere bundle. According to Gartner, organizations are facing a hybrid future with 75% working their expectation for working and flexibility has increased. Today, Fortinet announced the industry's most complete solution to enable organization to secure and connect from anywhere, and unified Fortinet's broad portfolio of [indiscernible] trust, endpoint and network security solution within the Fortinet Security Fabric, Fortinet delivers security not only for user whether on the road and home or in office to provide enterprise grid protection and productivity. 
In the 2021, Gartner Quadrant for 1H infrastructure just announced, Fortinet once again as the leader, placed highest in the ability to execute and ranked #1 for remote worker in critical capability. During our leadership in SD-WAN, ultimate and Verizon recently announced the expansion of the Verizon global offering with Fortinet SD-WAN.

Okay, let's start the more detailed Q3 discussion with revenue and the drivers for our record-setting product revenue growth. Clearly, demand is strong.

Okay, let's start the more detailed Q3 discussion with revenue and the drivers for our record-setting product revenue growth. Clearly, demand is strong. Total revenue of $867 million was up 33%, driven by industry-leading product revenue growth of 51%. Looking closer to 51% product revenue growth, our highest quarterly product growth rate in 12 years as a public company, we can point to 3 drivers: First, the convergence of security and networking, or what we call security-driven networking; second, strong customer demand for vendor consolidation on platforms; and third, a heightened awareness of today's elevated threat landscape across a broader set of entities. 
Fortinet is proud to be an innovative leader in security-driven networking with the convergence of security and networking functionality incorporated into our broad, integrated and automated security fabric platform. Our security-driven networking investments in Wi-Fi, switching, WAN, data center cloud, 5G and OT enable us to provide integrated security at networking speeds from the data center to endpoints and to the cloud and with our secure SD-WAN solution, Security at the Edges. 
Today, we announced a unified solution, enabling organizations to secure and connect Work from Anywhere. By unifying our Zero Trust, endpoint and network security solutions, we can deliver enterprise-grade security services and threat intelligence that seamlessly follows users on the road, at home and in the office. As for consolidation, customers are increasingly focused on vendor consolidation, automation, and platform strategies that provide a broad, integrated and single platform approach to security that effectively protects from the wide range of attack vectors. Our Security Fabric platform provides a broad range of security products integrated on a single operating system. 
Gartner recently called out Fortinet Security Fabric as a platform to provide the cybersecurity mesh architecture approach, or CSMA. The cornerstone of Fortinet CSMA approach is our ASIC-driven FortiGates, which provide on average 5 to 10x more computing power than competitors' firewalls running on common CPUs. The greater computing power allows our software engineers to embed additional security functionality and integration into the operating system, enhancing our price for performance advantage. 
The integration extends across our suite of security fabric solutions and consists of a complete range of form factors and delivery methods, including physical and virtual appliances, cloud, SaaS and perpetual software, as well as hosted and nonhosted solutions. 
And lastly, turning to awareness. The explosion of ransomware attacks has led to a greater awareness of the need for cybersecurity technologies.  According to the latest global threat landscape report published by our FortiGuard Labs, the number of unique ransomware detections per week increased more than 10x from July of 2020 to June of 2021. The increase in attacks is across entities of all sizes, geographies and industries. These 3 factors: The convergence of security and networking; the adoption of a cybersecurity mesh architecture; and a greater awareness of the threat landscape, drove record-setting product revenue growth contributing to market share gains for Fortinet. 
The dramatic product revenue growth was broad-based, with FortiGate and non-FortiGate both posting product revenue growth rates of approximately 50%, while tilting our current revenue mix 450 basis points from higher-margin services revenue to product revenue. FortiGate product revenues were driven by entry-level in high-end FortiGate product revenue growth of 60% and 57%, respectively. Non-FortiGate product revenue growth was driven by several platform products, including mail, sandbox, SIM, switches and virtual firewalls. 
Rounding out our revenues, we saw service revenue of $530 million, up 24%. Support and related services revenue was up 26% to $243 million, while security subscription services revenue was up 22% to $287 million. 
Turning to revenue by geos, we summarize on Slide 5. Revenue in EMEA increased 33%. In the Americas revenue increased 29%, and APAC posted revenue growth of 43%. Moving to billings. Quarterly billings crossed the $1 billion threshold for the first time in our history. At $1.064 billion, billings were up 42% as enterprises responded to the expanding threat landscape, favoring costs with performance leaders and integrated platform for CSMA strategies. 
This is especially evident across the enterprise segments. For example, in the large enterprise sector, Global 2000 billings were up 52%, with growth accelerating over the last 3 consecutive quarters. And for the second consecutive quarter, we added over 6,000 new logos across all customer segments. FortiGate billings were up 39% and accounted for 70% of total billings. 
As shown on Slide 6, entry-level and high-end FortiGates posted very strong billings growth. Non-FortiGate billings were up 29%, driving a 1-point billings mix shift to non-FortiGate. The top 10 solutions accounted for 68% of non-FortiGate billings and were up 48%. The number of deals over $1 million increased over 70% to 83 deals, and saw secure SD-WAN deals more than double to 19. Average contract term increased 3 months year-over-year and 1 month quarter-over-quarter to 29 months. The increase in contract term was driven by the significant increase in G2000 and other large enterprise deals. SD-WAN billings were up 52%, outpacing the company's billings growth and accounted for approximately 14% of total billings and continue to receive industry accolades. 
For the second consecutive year, Fortinet was named the leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for WAN Edge infrastructure and positioned #1 for ability to execute. For critical capabilities, Fortinet's SD-WAN ranked first in the small branch WAN, security sensitive and remote work use cases. And consistent with the elevated threat environment and the breadth of ransomware and other attacks, OT billings were up 77%. 
Moving to worldwide billings by industry verticals. Among the top 5 verticals, worldwide government grabbed the largest share with a mix of 17% and saw billings growth of 22%. We've made investments to expand our presence and engagement with the government sector. For example, in the U.S., we recently added retired 4-star Admiral Stavridis to our Board of Directors. And yesterday, Fortinet's Federal announced Department of Defense certification approval for an additional 26 security fabric solutions. 
Internationally, we are set to open Fortinet's Federal Government Integration Innovation Center in Australia before the end of the year. Utilities, manufacturing, transportation, construction, and other verticals that have not consistently been in our top 5 combined for billings growth of 68%. We believe the growth of these verticals is another indicator of the broadening nature of the threat landscape and is driving security investments in industries that may have shown less affluent security budgets and lower internal labor resource levels. 
On August 31, Fortinet acquired a controlling stake in Alexa Networks, a Japan-based networking company for approximately $64 million. Alexa provides high-performance network switches and routers in their local market. The investment increases our total addressable market and reflects our leadership on the convergence of networking and security. 
Moving back to the income statement. Product gross margin declined 220 basis points to 60.7%, reflecting the consolidation of Alexa's results and a change in our product mix. Product cost increases associated with supply chain constraints were largely offset by our pricing actions. Services gross margins decreased 150 basis points to 86.6% due to Alexa and costs associated with the expansion of our data center footprint. The 25.8% operating margin was 30 basis points above the top end of our guidance. Despite pressure from lower gross margins and higher marketing expenses, primarily from the Fortinet Championship, PGA Tour event. Headcount increased 20% to 9,700. 
Moving to the statement cash flow summarized on Slide 7 and 8. Free cash flow was $330 million, representing a margin of 38%. Free cash flow benefited from strong billings growth and good billings linearity. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow margin was 41.5%. We repurchased approximately 370,000 shares of our common stock for a total cost of $109 million at an average price per share of $2.94. The Board increased the share repurchase authorization by $1.25 billion and extended the expiration date to February 2023. The remaining repurchase authorization is approximately $2 billion. We ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $3.4 billion. 
Inventory turns increased to 2.9x from 2.7x in the second -- from the second quarter of 2021, reflecting strong product sales in the quarter and some supply chain pressure.  DSOs at 63 days returned to pre-pandemic levels. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $69 million, including a payment for the new campus building of $13 million. As we noted in our last earnings call, we pivoted our capital expenditure strategy to include building out our facilities and operations infrastructure to support our accelerating growth. We estimate fourth quarter capital expenditures to be between $170 million and $190 million, investments in our future facilities and operations infrastructure account for the sequential increase in CapEx. 
Before providing guidance, I'd like to comment on the supply chain because we widely publicized that the rapidly changing macroeconomic environment is causing disruption in global supply chains for companies of all sizes and industries. We expect the worldwide supply chain constraints will present evolving challenges in the fourth quarter and into 2022. The supply chain issues have proven to be extremely dynamic, and I'd like to pause here to acknowledge and thank each member of our operations team for their truly outstanding performance. 
With regards to pricing, we believe we entered this phase with a hard-earned reputation of being able to provide customers excellent price for performance or value. We believe we can leverage this reputation to largely offset our increased cost. We believe our pricing actions have been met with understanding by our customers as evidenced by our Q3 results and strong pipeline growth. We view the current situation as a supply challenge, not a demand challenge. 
Now I'd like to review our outlook for the fourth quarter, summarized on Slide 9, which is subject to disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. The following guidance reflects our best effort to estimate the supply chain impact. For the fourth quarter, we expect billings in the range of $1.165 billion to $1.215 billion; revenue in the range of $940 million to $970 million; non-GAAP gross margin of 75% to 76%; non-GAAP operating margin of 27% to 28%, which includes an estimated 200 basis point headwind from acquisitions, foreign exchange and increased travel and marketing costs; non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.10 to $1.15, which assumes a share count of between $168 million and $170 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 21%. 
Based on our very strong third quarter performance and the upside I just provided to the fourth quarter expectations, we are once again raising our 2021 guidance. We expect billings in the range of $4.04 billion to $4.09 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of approximately 31.5%; revenue in the range of $3.32 billion to $3.35 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 28.5%; total service revenue in the range of $2.08 billion to $2.09 billion. which represents growth of 24% and implies a full year product revenue growth of 36%; non-GAAP gross margin of 76.5% to 77.5% and non-GAAP operating margin of 25.5% to 26.5%; non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.85 to $3.95, which assumes a share count of between $167 million and $169 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 21%. We expect cash taxes to be approximately $130 million, which includes a $47 million tax payment made in the fourth quarter. 
Along with Ken, I'd like to thank our partners, our customers and all members of the Fortinet team for all their hard work, execution and outstanding success. I'll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A."

And I don't know that anybody knows all the answers to the questions that you kind of articulated all.
I'll give you some color, if you will. I think we saw a little bit of supply chain pressure in the second -- in the third quarter, as I alluded to, but obviously, the number is nothing new that was terribly noteworthy. 
I do think the guidance that we've given for the fourth quarter is appropriately conservative, if you will, in terms of what we see for supply chain and what we would call backlog in the fourth quarter. I think we feel good about the guidance that we've given. 
I think the -- if you look at kind of the general tone and what we're hearing from our operations team, I think there is some time in the third quarter where every day was very dynamic with them, with people calling and then having to scramble about component matters and contract manufacturing commitments or what have you. I'm hearing less about that at this point. That's probably very early on. 
I would also offer that the backlog or supply chain first appears for us in some of the fabric products, the non-FortiGate. And I think that will continue on a little bit into the fourth quarter, and probably also get to the FortiGate to some extent in the fourth quarter as well. Getting out to 2022, I think everybody is kind of in the same boat and trying to understand when we're actually going to see something that's a real market improvement -- marked improvement. And I think we'll probably kind of hold back commenting on that for the next several months until we get closer to providing guidance for the next year."

And also, we manage all this more directly compared to our competitor local suite of third-party. So that does give us better visibility and also can act quickly earlier. 
Second, we have quite a broad product line, both in the FortiGate and also non-FortiGate. It's more easy for a customer to really go to the next line of product, have a similar performance and outrunning the FortiOS and non-FortiOS. So it's more easy to using some different product to [indiscernible] some of the product shortage. And also, we have a great team operation side. And at the same time, we have a culture more invested in the long term, both on the inventory, some other things compared to our competitor to me, some even like 5, 10, 15 years ago, we tend to keep some more inventory to  meet some customer urgent needs. So that's actually benefited in this supply chain issue."

And then I think we've continued to invest in both the sales and the marketing, we knew all along for several years now that we needed to improve our coverage in terms of the number of accounts that were assigned to reps, and the people that we're bringing in from outside that maybe had more of an enterprise experience and less of a channel experience, et cetera. So I do think that all those things have combined and are demonstrating the success. As you point out, G2000 growth at over 52% and accelerated for the last 3 quarters."

And you can imagine them taking certain actions to get orders in the first month of the quarter, if you will. So it gets a little bit distorted that way. 
But we do look at our ASPs and wanting to make sure in our discounting that we're not giving back that price increase, if you will. And overall, I think the headline is that we think we were on the direct product line, I think it was accretive to the margin in the quarter. And I emphasize it direct because, as volatile as it is, predicting things like expedite fees and sometimes freight as well, can come into that line.

And as I said earlier in the conversation that I think they -- We've been appropriately conservative, I hope, in terms of how we guided to it. 
To unpack that just a little bit, we do with our sales team and we manage things on a bookings basis with them. And then we put that up against what we have the ability to ship. If I look at just the bookings number, and we had a long internal conversation about whether or not that's a metric that we should provide at this time and decided not to. 
But if we look at just the bookings number, I would say that it's a very strong indicator that the business is extremely healthy, if you will.  In terms of customer buying behavior, there's always somebody getting in line early, if you will. They have longer-term deployment or what have you. That's not new. And maybe a little bit of it in the third quarter. 
No deals over $10 million. I think the largest deal was probably $7 million or $8 million or something like that in the quarter. We have seen in the fourth quarter, things where customers -- I'd say they're getting line orders. They've got deployments where -- our plans are deploying in 2022, and they want to make sure that they're trying to time when they're actually going to need the product and when the product is going to be available.

Billing increased 42% to $1.064 billion, exceeding $1 billion in quarterly billing for the first time in Fortinet history. Global G2000",547,"Thanks, Peter, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call to review our outstanding third quarter 2021 results. Billing increased 42% to $1.064 billion, exceeding $1 billion in quarterly billing for the first time in Fortinet history. Global G2000 billing growth accelerated to over 50%; total revenue growth, 33% to $867 million, with product revenue up 51%, our highest quarterly product revenue growth since going public in November 2009. With very strong business momentum, we remain focused on growth.
According to Gartner, the network parameter is fragmented with many security teams and tools operating in silos, and integrating best-of-breed solution only add to the complexity. To address this challenge, Gartner is predicting that by 2024, organizations that adopt our cybersecurity mesh architecture will reduce the financial impact of individual security incidents by an average of 90%. In a recent report, Gartner called out Fortinet Security Fabric as a platform that offers cybersecurity mesh architecture approach.
Fortinet is helping customers solve the issue of complexity through our security-driven networking and Security Fabric platform approach. Fortinet's unrivaled FortiASIC offers 5 to 10x more security computing power. This results in tightly integrated functionality with better performance, lower cost and power consumption compared with a general CPU. Our organically developed [ Forti Fabric ] solution like e-mail, web and endpoint together with FortiGate firewall offers much broader protection, more integration and better automation than other competitive solutions.
As organizations continue to consolidate towards a platform approach and as network security expand to local and wide area network to the work-from-anywhere environment and to the cloud, Fortinet is strongly positioned to significantly capture market share of a projected total addressable market of more than $174 billion by 2025. We are confident that this trend, together with the relentless focus on organic innovation, will drive better-than-industry average long-term growth for Fortinet.
Work-from-anywhere is here to stay. The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly expanded the work-from-anywhere model. According to Gartner, organizations are facing a hybrid future, with 75% workers saying their expectation for working and flexibility has increased. Today, Fortinet announced the industry's most complete solution to enable organizations to secure and connect work-from-anywhere by unifying Fortinet's broad portfolio of zero trust, endpoint and network security solution within the Fortinet Security Fabric. Fortinet delivers security that follows user whether on the road, at home or in office to provide enterprise-grade protection and productivity.
In the 2021, Gartner Magic Quadrant for WAN Edge Infrastructure just announced, Fortinet was once again named the leader, placed highest in the ability to execute and ranked #1 for Remote Worker in Critical Capabilities. [ Claiming ] our leadership in SD-WAN, Fortinet and Verizon recently announced the expansion of the Verizon global offering with Fortinet Secure SD-WAN. The solution is designed to provide enterprise and the business market customer with a converged networking and security solution in-a-box to secure and connect work-from-anywhere.
We continue to see momentum and adoption of our Secure SD-WAN, 5G hybrid SD-Branch and cloud delivered SASE solution among the world's largest service providers. Internet providers including AT&T, British Telecom, Telefónica and others, we plan to announce in the coming months.
Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers and partners worldwide for their continued support and hard work. Keith?"
2689126,1684267415,2426534,"Fortinet, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Fortinet, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ken. Okay, let's start the more detailed Q3 discussion with revenue and the drivers for our record-setting product revenue growth. Clearly, demand is strong.Total revenue of $867 million was up 33%, driven by industry-leading product revenue",1923,"Thank you, Ken. Okay, let's start the more detailed Q3 discussion with revenue and the drivers for our record-setting product revenue growth. Clearly, demand is strong.
Total revenue of $867 million was up 33%, driven by industry-leading product revenue growth of 51%. Looking closer to 51% product revenue growth, our highest quarterly product growth rate in 12 years as a public company, we can point to 3 drivers: First, the convergence of security and networking or what we call security-driven networking; second, strong customer demand for vendor consolidation on platforms; and third, a heightened awareness of today's elevated threat landscape across a broader set of entities.
Fortinet is proud to be an innovative leader in security-driven networking with the convergence of security and networking functionality incorporated into our broad, integrated and automated Security Fabric platform. Our security-driven networking investments in Wi-Fi, switching, WAN, data center cloud, 5G and OT enable us to provide integrated security at networking speeds from the data center to endpoints and to the cloud; and with our Secure SD-WAN solution, security at the edges.
Today, we announced a unified solution, enabling organizations to secure and connect work-from-anywhere. By unifying our zero trust, endpoint and network security solutions, we can deliver enterprise-grade security services and threat intelligence that seamlessly follows users on the road, at home and in the office.
As for consolidation, customers are increasingly focused on vendor consolidation, automation and platform strategies that provide a broad, integrated and single platform approach to security that effectively protects from a wide range of attack vectors. Our Security Fabric platform provides a broad range of security products integrated on a single operating system.
Gartner recently called out Fortinet Security Fabric as a platform to provide the cybersecurity mesh architecture approach, or CSMA. The cornerstone of Fortinet CSMA approach is our ASIC-driven FortiGates, which provide on average 5 to 10x more computing power than competitors' firewalls running on common CPUs. The greater computing power allows our software engineers to embed additional security functionality and integration into the operating system, enhancing our price-for-performance advantage.
The integration extends across our suite of Security Fabric solutions and consists of a complete range of form factors and delivery methods, including physical and virtual appliances, cloud, SaaS and perpetual software as well as hosted and nonhosted solutions.
And lastly, turning to awareness. The explosion of ransomware attacks has led to a greater awareness of the need for cybersecurity technologies.  According to the latest global threat landscape report published by our FortiGuard Labs, the number of unique ransomware detections per week increased more than 10x from July of 2020 to June of 2021. The increase in attacks is across entities of all sizes, geographies and industries.
These 3 factors: the convergence of security and networking, the adoption of a cybersecurity mesh architecture, and a greater awareness of threat landscape drove record-setting product revenue growth, contributing to market share gains for Fortinet.
The dramatic product revenue growth was broad-based, with FortiGate and non-FortiGate both posting product revenue growth rates of approximately 50%, while tilting our current revenue mix 450 basis points from higher-margin services revenue to product revenue. FortiGate product revenues were driven by entry-level and high-end FortiGate product revenue growth of 60% and 57%, respectively. Non-FortiGate product revenue growth was driven by several platform products, including mail, sandbox, SIM, switches and virtual firewalls.
Rounding out our revenues, we saw service revenue of $530 million, up 24%. Support and related services revenue was up 26% to $243 million, while security subscription services revenue was up 22% to $287 million.
Turning to revenue by geos that's summarized on Slide 5. Revenue in EMEA increased 33%. In the Americas, revenue increased 29%. And APAC posted revenue growth of 43%.
Moving to billings. Quarterly billings crossed the $1 billion threshold for the first time in our history. At $1.064 billion, billings were up 42% as enterprises responded to the expanding threat landscape, favoring cost-for-performance leaders and integrated platform for CSMA strategies.
This is especially evident across the enterprise segments. For example, in the large enterprise sector, Global 2000 billings were up 52%, with growth accelerating over the last 3 consecutive quarters. And for the second consecutive quarter, we added over 6,000 new logos across all customer segments. FortiGate billings were up 39% and accounted for 70% of total billings.
As shown on Slide 6, entry-level and high-end FortiGates posted very strong billings growth. Non-FortiGate billings were up 49%, driving a 1-point billings mix shift to non-FortiGate. The top 10 solutions accounted for 68% of non-FortiGate billings and were up 48%. The number of deals over $1 million increased over 70% to 83 deals and saw Secure SD-WAN deals more than double to 19.
Average contract term increased 3 months year-over-year and 1 month quarter-over-quarter to 29 months. The increase in contract term was driven by the significant increase in G2000 and other large enterprise deals. SD-WAN billings were up 52%, outpacing the company's billings growth and accounted for approximately 14% of total billings and continue to receive industry accolades.
For the second consecutive year, Fortinet was named the leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for WAN Edge Infrastructure and positioned #1 for ability to execute. For Critical Capabilities, Fortinet's SD-WAN ranked first in the Small Branch WAN, Security Sensitive and remote work use cases. And consistent with the elevated threat environment and the breadth of ransomware and other attacks, OT billings were up 77%.
Moving to worldwide billings by industry verticals. Among the top 5 verticals, worldwide government grabbed the largest share with a mix of 17% and saw billings growth of 22%. We've made investments to expand our presence and engagement with the government sector. For example, in the U.S., we recently added retired 4-star Admiral Stavridis to our Board of Directors. And yesterday, Fortinet's Federal announced Department of Defense certification approval for an additional 26 Security Fabric solutions.
Internationally, we are set to open Fortinet's Federal Government Integration and Innovation Centre in Australia before the end of the year. Utilities, manufacturing, transportation, construction and other verticals that have not consistently been in our top 5 combined for billings growth of 68%. We believe the growth of these verticals is another indicator of the broadening nature of the threat landscape and is driving security investments in industries that may have shown less affluent security budgets and lower internal labor resource levels.
On August 31, Fortinet acquired a controlling stake in ALAXALA Networks, a Japan-based networking company, for approximately $64 million. ALAXALA provides high-performance network switches and routers in their local market. The investment increases our total addressable market and reflects our leadership on the convergence of networking and security.
Moving back to the income statement. Product gross margin declined 220 basis points to 60.7%, reflecting the consolidation of ALAXALA's results and a change in our product mix. Product cost increases associated with supply chain constraints were largely offset by our pricing actions.
Services gross margins decreased [ 150 ] basis points to 86.6% due to ALAXALA and costs associated with the expansion of our data center footprint. The 25.8% operating margin was 30 basis points above the top end of our guidance. Despite pressure from lower gross margins and higher marketing expenses, primarily from the Fortinet Championship, PGA Tour event. Headcount increased 20% to 9,700.
Moving to the statement of cash flows summarized on Slide 7 and 8. Free cash flow was $330 million, representing a margin of 38%. Free cash flow benefited from strong billings growth and good billings linearity. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow margin was 41.5%. We repurchased approximately 370,000 shares of our common stock for a total cost of $109 million at an average price per share of $2.94. The Board increased the share repurchase authorization by $1.25 billion and extended the expiration date to February 2023. The remaining repurchase authorization is approximately $2 billion. We ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $3.4 billion.
Inventory turns increased to 2.9x from 2.7x in the second -- from the second quarter of 2021, reflecting strong product sales in the quarter and some supply chain pressure. DSOs at 63 days returned to pre-pandemic levels. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $69 million, including a payment for the new campus building of $13 million.
As we noted in our last earnings call, we pivoted our capital expenditure strategy to include building out our facilities and operations infrastructure to support our accelerating growth. We estimate fourth quarter capital expenditures to be between $170 million and $190 million. Investments in our future facilities and operations infrastructure account for the sequential increase in CapEx.
Before providing guidance, I'd like to comment on the supply chain because we widely publicized that the rapidly changing macroeconomic environment is causing disruption in global supply chains for companies of all sizes and industries. We expect the worldwide supply chain constraints will present evolving challenges in the fourth quarter and into 2022. The supply chain issues have proven to be extremely dynamic, and I'd like to pause here to acknowledge and thank each member of our operations team for their truly outstanding performance.
With regards to pricing, we believe we entered this phase with a hard-earned reputation of being able to provide customers excellent price-for-performance or value. We believe we can leverage this reputation to largely offset our increased cost. We believe our pricing actions have been met with understanding by our customers, as evidenced by our Q3 results and strong pipeline growth. We view the current situation as a supply challenge, not a demand challenge.
Now I'd like to review our outlook for the fourth quarter summarized on Slide 9, which is subject to disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. The following guidance reflects our best effort to estimate the supply chain impact.
For the fourth quarter, we expect billings in the range of $1.165 billion to $1.215 billion; revenue in the range of $940 million to $970 million; non-GAAP gross margin of 75% to 76%; non-GAAP operating margin of 27% to 28%, which includes an estimated 200 basis point headwind from acquisitions, foreign exchange and increased travel and marketing costs; non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.10 to $1.15, which assumes a share count of between 168 million and 170 million. We expect the non-GAAP tax rate of 21%. Based on our very strong third quarter performance and the upside I just provided to the fourth quarter expectations, we are once again raising our 2021 guidance.
We expect billings in the range of $4.04 billion to $4.09 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of approximately 31.5%; revenue in the range of $3.32 billion to $3.35 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 28.5%; total service revenue in the range of $2.08 billion to $2.09 billion, which represents growth of 24% and implies a full year product revenue growth of 36%; non-GAAP gross margin of 76.5% to 77.5%; non-GAAP operating margin of 25.5% to 26.5%; non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.85 to $3.95, which assumes a share count of between 167 million and 169 million.
We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 21%. We expect cash taxes to be approximately $130 million, which includes a $47 million tax payment made in the fourth quarter.
Along with Ken, I'd like to thank our partners, our customers and all members of the Fortinet team for all their hard work, execution and outstanding success. I'll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A."

And I don't know that anybody knows all the answers to the questions that you've kind of articulated. I'll give you some color, if you will. I think we saw a little bit of supply chain pressure in the second -- in the third quarter, as I alluded to, but obviously, the number is nothing that was terribly noteworthy. I do think the guidance that we've given for the fourth quarter is appropriately conservative, if you will, in terms of what we see for supply chain and what we would call backlog in the fourth quarter.
I think we feel good about the guidance that we've given. I think the -- if you look at kind of the general tone and what we're hearing from our operations team, I think there is some time in the third quarter where every day was very dynamic for them, with people calling and then having to scramble about component matters and contract manufacturing commitments or what have you. I'm hearing less about that at this point. That's probably very early on.
I would also offer that the backlog or supply chain first appears for us in some of the Fabric products, the non-FortiGate. And I think that will continue on a little bit into the fourth quarter and probably also get to the FortiGate to some extent in the fourth quarter as well. Getting out to 2022, I think everybody is kind of in the same boat and trying to understand when we're actually going to see something that's a real marked improvement. And I think we'll probably kind of hold back commenting on that for the next several months until we get closer to providing guidance for the next year."

I think we are a little bit better positioned compared to competitors. First, it's really -- we have the quantity much larger than a competitor, like we're probably like 3x compared to the Cisco in unit shipment, maybe probably 10x than Palo Alto and some other, which give us better negotiation power with some of the supply. And also, we manage all this more directly compared to our competitor who go through some third-party. So that does give us better visibility and also can act quick earlier.
Second, we have quite a broad product line, both in the FortiGate and also non-FortiGate. It's more easy for a customer to really go to the next line of product, have a similar performance and [ outrunning ] the FortiOS in FortiOS. So it's more easy to using some different product to [indiscernible] some of the product shortage.
And also, we have a great team operation side. And at the same time, we have a culture more invested in the long term, both on the inventory, some other things compared to a competitor to me, some -- even like 5, 10, 15 years ago, we tend to keep some more inventory to  meet some customer urgent needs. So that actually benefit us in this supply chain issue."

I can hear in them the confidence when it comes to displacements. There's certainly no competitor that they're afraid of. I can hear them articulate back the platform strategy, the land-and-expand strategy. I can see them using some of the tools and products and technologies that we've invested in and invested in them, and they're leveraging them, I think, very successfully.
So it was a question going back, I think, that Tal had asked about, and we used this term before, rising tide lifting all boats. And I think we saw that in the quarter. There wasn't a weak geography. There wasn't a weak product suite. I think everybody performed very strongly."

Keith, as you think about the billings guide, what you're suggesting, even at the high end, the billing sequential growth would be about 13%. And in the past 2 years, you've grown billings sequentially about 28%. So obviously, a little less on the guidance. And I'm just wondering if you could just give us some color or thoughts around that. And in particular, is that a reflection of -- was there any kind of pull-in that you think about on the billings where customers are concerned about not getting product?
And/or is it reflecting some of the concerns you previously mentioned about are we going to have enough of the supply chain availability or product availability, I should say? And therefore, we might need to temp down a little bit in Q4? And then I had a follow-up, if I could, because Peter told me I'm allowed to ask a follow-up."

And as I said earlier in the conversation that I think they -- we've been appropriately conservative, I hope, in terms of how we guided to it. To unpack that just a little bit, we do with our sales team and we manage things on a bookings basis with them. And then we put that up against what we have, the ability to ship. If I look at just the bookings number -- and we had a long internal conversation about whether or not that's a metric that we should provide at this time and decided not to. But if we look at just the bookings number, I would say that it's a very strong indicator that the business is extremely healthy, if you will.
In terms of customer buying behavior, there's always somebody getting in line early, if you will. Either they have longer-term deployment or what have you. That's not new. And maybe a little bit of it in the third quarter. No deals over $10 million. I think the largest deal was probably $7 million or $8 million or something like that in the quarter. We have seen in the fourth quarter things where customers are, I'd say, they're get-in-line orders.
They've got deployments where our plans are deploying in 2022, and they want to make sure that -- they're trying to time when they're actually going to need the product and when the product is going to be available. So I have seen early in the quarter a few companies exhibiting that behavior."

We're hearing that a little bit from the channel about the lead times because they're getting out, customers are ordering early and more.

I think there's a fair amount of internal work around that, if you will.
Now, on the other side, it does give us more predictability as we come into 2022 if this behavior continues than we've had in the past. Backlog or bookings has not been something that Fortinet as a company has really had reason or cause to talk about. And I don't know that as of today that we do, but as we get further into the fourth quarter and then moving into 2022, that may be something that because of the predictability that it helps with, we may be talking about that next year."
