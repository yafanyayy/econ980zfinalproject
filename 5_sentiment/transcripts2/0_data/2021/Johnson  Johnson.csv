This is Chris DelOrefice, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our company's review of business results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2020 and our financial outlook for 2021. 
Joining me on today's call are Alex Gorsky, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer; and Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. 
A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com, where you can also find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules. 
Please note that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review the cautionary statement included in today's presentation which identifies certain risks and factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. In particular, there is significant uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This means the results could change at any time, and the contemplated impact of COVID-19 on the company's business results and outlook is a best estimate based on the information available as of today's date. A further description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2019 Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Qs, along with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures are also available at investor.jnj.com. 
Several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. 
Moving to today's agenda. Alex will provide perspective on our overall results and business highlights for the year. I will review the fourth quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and the 3 business segments. Joe will conclude by providing insights about our cash position, capital allocation deployment and our guidance for 2021. The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last up to 90 minutes. 
I will now turn the call over to Alex to share our overall results and business highlights."

At the start of last year, no one could have imagined just how drastically our lives were about to change because of a virus that would impact billions of people around the world. By any measure, 2020 was a year dominated by uncertainty, yet the pandemic also helped to clarify both our priorities and our values. And within Johnson & Johnson, it has illustrated the power and importance of our credo in guiding our actions to meet the needs of all our stakeholders. Now because of COVID-19, we now have a deeper appreciation of just how pivotal good health is to our safety, security and prosperity of the society. We have a profound respect and gratitude for all the doctors, nurses and hospital staff serving on the front lines of care for the everyday heroism of the essential workers who show up every day to keep the world's critical infrastructure up and running, and expectations that companies can and should help drive positive change in the society are higher than ever. 
As the world's largest and most broadly based global health care company, Johnson & Johnson was built for times like these. We've been leading to the world's biggest public health challenges for over a century. And today, our diversified businesses that show many parts of people's lives, we have both the ability and the responsibility to act when the COVID-19 outbreak turned into a global pandemic. 
Within weeks of the DNA sequencing of the COVID-19 virus, Janssen scientists were working 24/7 to identify the most promising lead candidate for a vaccine. I'm proud of the progress of our COVID-19 vaccine candidate and the fact that we moved so quickly while maintaining the highest level of science and safety standards. This is truly a remarkable accomplishment and a testament to the ingenuity and determination of our vaccine and supply chain teams. We look forward to sharing further details from our Phase III study by early next week. 
Additionally, I'm just as proud of the ways that each of my Johnson & Johnson colleagues have gone above and beyond the call of duty to -- uninterrupted access to our medicines, embrace radically new ways of working and use the full breadth and depth of our expertise to deliver our important medicines and products to patients and consumers and support health care systems that have been overwhelmed by the pandemic. 
The fact that we've been able not just to weather this crisis but bring our broad-based capabilities to support this crisis and deliver on our shorter-term top and bottom line business goals while increasing our investments in innovation at record levels is a remarkable testament to our purpose-driven culture, the core strengths that characterize our company for over a century: execution, innovation and people. 
Our relentless focus on excellence and execution is key to meeting the needs of all our stakeholders today and tomorrow. The performance of our business in 2020 reflects the continued confidence from patients, physicians, customers and consumers in our life-saving medicines and products. 
Our Pharmaceutical business performed well above market, kept pipeline submissions and approvals on track and exceeded patient enrollment in clinical trials compared to 2019. Our Consumer Health business also performed above market for the year, and our Medical Devices business demonstrated resiliency and agility, leading to a strong second half recovery. 
Our unparalleled scientific expertise allows us to create life enhancing innovation. Our R&D colleagues across Johnson & Johnson have continued to advance our robust pipeline of innovative and transformational new products. Of note, we initiated our U.S. filing for BCMA CAR-T in multiple myeloma in December. In addition, we filed amivantamab for the treatment of exon 20 mutations in non-small cell lung cancer in the U.S. and Europe. 
Our medical device business has made strong progress advancing our pipeline despite the pandemic, achieving and even accelerating certain key milestones throughout the year. As you heard from Ashley, Dr. Moll and the team at the medical device update in November, we are developing an end-to-end digital ecosystem across 3 robotics platforms, and we achieved a significant milestone this month, receiving FDA clearance for our VELYS robotic-assisted solutions. We believe the industry is just starting to unlock the full potential and benefits of robotic and digital technologies. Johnson & Johnson is well positioned to bring innovative, differentiated solutions to the surgery suite over the next 10, 20 and 30 years. 
I'm also very proud of the great work from our supply chain colleagues in driving improvements and efficiencies over the past year. Gartner even honored Johnson & Johnson with a #3 ranking across all industries on its annual 2020 Supply Chain top 25 Index. That's up 5 spots from our 2019 ranking. Gartner also awarded Johnson & Johnson the #1 spot on its 2020 Healthcare Supply Chain Top 25, citing our commitment to continuous improvement while putting innovation into practice, particularly in our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
And finally, we are powered by our people, purpose and value system. More than 75 years since it was authored, our credo continues to guide all 135,000 of us at Johnson & Johnson. And with that in mind, I want to highlight a recent appointment to our Board of Directors, an incredibly high honor awarded to one of our own directors. In December, Johnson & Johnson appointed retired U.S. Army Lieutenant-General and former U.S. Army Surgeon General, Dr. Nadja West, to our Board of Directors. Dr. West accomplished health care background, in addition to their deep strategic leadership experience, our strong additions to our Board of Directors. 
In October, Johnson & Johnson Board Director, Dr. Jennifer Doudna, along with her colleague, Dr. Emmanuel Charpentier, was awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the revolutionary discovery of CRISPR/CAS9 gene-editing technology, considered to be one of the most significant breakthroughs in molecular biology in the past decade. We are truly proud of our recognition for this incredible work. 
Our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion in both our workforce and the communities in which we serve has always been an important part of our culture. However, the past year has also shown a spotlight on the fact that we can all do more. To that end, I am proud of our race to health equity platform launched in November. Our race to health equity aims to help improve racial equity by eliminating health inequities for people of color and our $100 million commitment to invest in and promote health equity. I'm excited to be part of this progress and for Johnson & Johnson to play a part in impactful lasting change. 
And most importantly, the talented and committed people of Johnson & Johnson drive our success by putting the patients and consumers we serve around the world at the forefront of all we do. We think and rely on them to continue to innovate, execute and focus on our shared purpose to deliver better help for everyone, everywhere. 
I look forward to addressing your questions during the Q&A portion of the webcast. Right now, I'll turn the call over to Chris to share details related to our performance for the quarter. Thank you. Chris?"

Worldwide sales were $22.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of 8.3% versus the fourth quarter of 2019. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 7.1% as currency had a positive impact of 1.2 points. In the U.S., sales increased 9.6%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported growth was 7%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 4.3% with currency positively impacting our reported OUS results by 2.7 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 7.3% worldwide, 9.6% in the U.S. and 4.8% outside the U.S. 
As referenced on prior calls, I would like to remind everyone that our 2020 fiscal year included an additional week. Since this week occurred during a holiday period, it does not represent a full week of sales but rather a few more shipping days with these additional shipping days adding approximately 4 points to the quarterly sales growth rate and 1 point to the annual growth rate. This can be roughly applied across all segments. The additional sales were more heavily skewed to the U.S. For the enterprise, offsetting this sales benefit was the estimated negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Lastly, while these few shipping days added to sales, we also had a full week's worth of operating costs. Therefore, the impact to earnings was negligible. 
Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $1.7 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $0.65 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.50 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $5 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.86, representing decreases of 1.2% and 1.1%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share declined 3.2%. 
For the full year 2020, consolidated sales were $82.6 billion, an increase of 0.6% compared to the full year of 2019. Operationally, full year sales grew 1.2% with currency having a negative impact of 0.6 points. Sales growth in the U.S. was 2.5%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported year-over-year change was negative 1.3%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. declined by 0.2% with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 1.1 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 1.5% worldwide, 2.8% in the U.S. and 0.2% outside the U.S. 
Net earnings for the full year 2020 were $14.7 billion and diluted earnings per share was $5.51 versus diluted earnings per share of $5.63 a year ago. 2020 adjusted net earnings were $21.4 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $8.03, representing decreases of 8.1% and 7.5%, respectively, versus full year 2019. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased by 7.8%. 
Beginning with Consumer Health, I will now comment on business segment sales performance for the fourth quarter, highlighting items that build upon the slides you have in front of you. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2019 and, therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation. 
While not part of the prepared remarks for today's call, we have provided additional commentary on our website for the full year 2020 sales by segment to assist you in updating your models. 
Worldwide Consumer Health sales totaled $3.6 billion and grew 2% with growth in the U.S. of 2.7% and 1.5% outside of the U.S. Consumer Health delivered strong above-market growth due to our Oral Care, Wound Care and OUS Skin Health/Beauty businesses partially offset by the negative impact of COVID-19 primarily in our OTC business and the SKU rationalization program, which predominantly impacted baby and Skin Health/Beauty outside the U.S. e-commerce growth continues to be strong across regions and franchises. 
Over-the-counter medicines had a decline of 1.5%. In the U.S., OTC sales were flat and the OUS declined by 2.9%. Globally, results were negatively impacted by COVID-19 restrictions, resulting in lower cough, cold and flu incidences, impacting children's Tylenol, global cough and cold and digestive products. Offsetting these declines was strong adult Tylenol market and share growth attributed to elevated demand driven by COVID-19, ZYRTEC share growth partially due to competitive out of stock and strong market growth in anti-smoking aids in. 
The Skin Health/Beauty franchise experienced recovery with a 2.6% increase, driven by strong performance of OGX due to share gains and OUS growth for Dr.Ci:Labo partially offset by Neutrogena declines as retailers carry less inventory, coupled with market declines, primarily in the makeup category due to fewer use occasions driven by COVID-19 restrictions and SKU rationalization. 
As consumers continue to focus on products related to personal health and hygiene, oral Care grew by 12% on continued growth of LISTERINE mouthwash due to new flavor and product innovations and the increased demand globally related to COVID-19. Wound Care grew 12.2%, primarily due to strong performance across NEOSPORIN and BAND-AID brand adhesive bandages in the U.S. and Asia Pacific. In the baby franchise, we saw AVEENO baby strength, offset by our planned SKU rationalization program primarily outside the U.S. 
Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide pharmaceutical sales of $12.3 billion grew 14.6%, enabled by strength in all regions, with U.S. sales increasing by 15.3% and OUS sales increasing by 13.5%. The business realized double-digit growth in 8 key products across our portfolio, supporting growth in all therapeutic areas except for cardiovascular metabolism, other, which experienced a decline of 1% primarily driven by continued biosimilar competition for PROCRIT. Our strong portfolio of products and commercial capabilities has enabled us to deliver our ninth consecutive year of global adjusted operational growth at above-market levels. 
Our oncology portfolio delivered another robust quarter with worldwide growth of 23.7%. DARZALEX continued its strong performance, growing 49% led by share gains globally with the U.S. market share up about 4 points across all lines of therapy. Furthermore, the U.S. and European markets continue to exhibit increased adoption of the subcutaneous formulation launched in the second quarter as feedback continues to be very positive on the ease and reduced time to administer the new formulation. Also, we continue to advance the DARZALEX innovation pipeline with the recent U.S. approval of DARZALEX FASPRO for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed light chain amyloidosis. 
IMBRUVICA grew 25.3% globally mainly driven by market growth and our strong leadership position in all key indications. We continue to progress the development of IMBRUVICA to further differentiate this BTK inhibitor, as evidenced by the robust data presentation at the American Society of Hematology Conference in December. 
ERLEADA continued its strong growth momentum with sales of just over $240 million in the quarter driven by market share and penetration gains, especially in the metastatic indication. Our immunology therapeutic area delivered global sales growth of 15.3%, driven by strong double-digit performance of STELARA and TREMFYA. STELARA grew 30.3%, driven by global demand increase in Crohn's disease with over a 5 point share increase in the U.S. and continued growth in ulcerative colitis. TREMFYA grew 39.3% and is up about 3 points of share from the fourth quarter of 2019 in the psoriasis market in the U.S. TREMFYA continues to strengthen its leadership position as the most prescribed IL-23 inhibitor for patients worldwide through its differentiated data package in both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. We also continued to advance TREMFYA pipeline as evidenced by Phase II Crohn's disease data that was presented earlier this year. 
In neuroscience, our paliperidone long-acting portfolio performed well, growing 9%, driven by market and share growth due to increased new patient starts and strong persistency. In 2020, we filed submissions in the U.S. and EU for paliperidone palmitate 6-month formulation for the treatment of adults diagnosed with schizophrenia. And if approved, it will be the first and only long-acting injectable medication with a twice-yearly dosing regimen. 
Our total pulmonary hypertension portfolio achieved strong growth of 37.4% with OPSUMIT growth of 36.7% and  UPTRAVI growth of 44.1%, both driven by market penetration and share growth, as well as a onetime benefit of about 10 points each resulting from the U.S. distributor model change we communicated in Q4 2019. 
I'll now turn your attention to the Medical Devices segment. Worldwide Medical Devices sales were $6.6 billion, declining 2.2%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, primarily the divestiture of ASP, adjusted operational sales decline was 1.5% worldwide. Onetime items positively impacted the current quarter by about 200 basis points. The net benefit from these onetime items is comprised of the benefit of the extra shipping days associated with the 53rd week partially offset by the anticipated inventory contractions in China across our portfolio, and in our U.S. contact lens business, as communicated last quarter. Adjusting for the impact of these onetime items, Q4 results were in line with Q3 2020 performance. 
COVID-19 remains a dynamic variable within the medical device market. In Q4, COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations reached their highest levels in certain parts of the world while cases remain relatively stable in others. This did lead to some softening in recovery trends late in the quarter. However, impacts varied across geographies and procedure types. 
Looking geographically, China where COVID-19 cases have continued to remain more stable, delivered double-digit growth within the quarter. Excluding the benefit of the additional shipping days, the U.S. declined low single digits, due to COVID-19-related restrictions occurring late in the quarter. Sales also declined in Europe, where some of the strictest restrictions were deployed to curb the increases in COVID-19 cases. 
As we have noted previously, health care systems continue to demonstrate their resiliency and dedication to treating both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, resulting in significantly less disruption during this recent surge of cases versus the impact seen earlier this year. 
Interventional Solutions continue to demonstrate strong performance, delivering another quarter of double-digit growth. Electrophysiology grew 12.7% globally led by market recovery and share gains from new products. CERENOVUS returned to double-digit growth with strong sales in China. Worldwide Orthopedics declined 5.3% versus prior year driven by the negative impact of COVID-19 where procedures seem to be more elective in nature. Worldwide trauma delivered growth of 3.6% globally. U.S. growth of 10% for the quarter reflects market recovery as well as success of our new products, such as the cannulated compression headless screws. Declines of about 6% outside the U.S. reflects slower procedural volumes due to COVID-19 restrictions as well as contractions in inventory in China worth around 400 basis points. Worldwide hips declined 2.7%, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 on the market. U.S. declined 0.7% versus prior year and continues to benefit from our leadership position in an interior approach and strong demand for the active stem and enabling technologies helping to partially offset the negative COVID-19 impact. 
We continue to introduce innovation in this space, and in December, we entered the modular dual mobility market with the first implant of pinnacle for mobility, which is planned for a full U.S. market launch this year. These declined 13.9% globally as we continue to see procedures in this space highly impacted by COVID-19, especially revision procedures, where we have a higher share than primary. The 20.6% decline outside of the U.S. reflects the impacts of COVID-19 on procedures, especially in markets like the U.K. and India, where we hold higher share positions. 
We are very excited about the FDA clearance of our VELYS orthopedic robotic system and bringing this to the U.S. market in 2021. The combination of the differentiated robotic system with our 2 knee platform are expected to drive enhanced performance in this segment. 
Worldwide decline in spine of 7.1% reflects the impact of COVID-19 on the market as well as inventory reductions in China impacting global performance by about 350 basis points. Offsetting this decline is the growth we continue to see from the success of recent launches of new products such as SYMPHONY and CONDUIT. For the quarter, U.S. price remained consistent with historical levels, down low single digits. 
Moving to the results for the surgery business. Advanced surgery returned to growth with a 2% increase versus prior year led by strong performance in U.S. biosurgery, which grew 12.1% in the quarter. U.S. biosurgery growth is due to the strength of SURGIFLO and the continued recovery from the previously disclosed 2019 stop shipment. 
Endocutters delivered 1.6% growth mainly driven by the success of new products in China, offsetting impacts from COVID-19. Energy declined by 3.1% and reflecting the negative impact of COVID-19 and competitive pressures in the U.S. partially offset by the strength of new products outside the U.S. This month, we received FDA 510(k) clearances for both the NCLX 1 curved and straight jaw tissue sealer instruments, which will further strengthen our portfolio of advanced energy devices. 
Global wound closure grew by 1.5% through the strength of STRATAFIX barb suture and PRINEO topical skin adhesive products in both the U.S. and OUS markets. Inventory dynamics in the quarter added about 350 basis points to the U.S. growth of 8.5% and negatively impacted the OUS decline of 2.9% by about 150 basis points. 
The vision business declined 6.6% globally. U.S. contact lens declined 7.1% and however, after adjusting for the impact of both the additional shipping days this quarter and the impact of the anticipated channel inventory correction communicated last quarter worth about 9 points, the underlying U.S. contact lens business grew and continues to deliver competitive performance. While surgical vision declined 10.1% globally, this represents an improvement from Q3 where the business declined 16.4% with the most notable improvement in the U.S. This improvement is due to both improvement in the cataract and refractive markets as well as new products like TECNIS Toric II IOL for astigmatism. 
Now regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2020. Please direct your attention to the box section of the schedule. You will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items.  As reported earlier, our adjusted EPS of $1.86 reflects a reported decrease of 1.1% and an operational decrease of 3.2%. 
I'd like to now highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed on the statement of earnings compared to the same quarter last year. Cost of products sold delevered slightly primarily driven by COVID-19 period costs and fixed cost impacting the medical device business, partially offset by favorable enterprise portfolio mix and portfolio mix within the Pharmaceutical business. Selling, marketing and administrative margins improved for the quarter as a result of favorable segment mix and expense leveraging in the Pharmaceutical and consumer businesses, partially offset by the negative COVID-19 impact on Medical Devices sales. 
We continue to invest in research and development at competitive levels, investing 17.9% of sales this quarter. This was higher than the fourth quarter of 2019 by 230 basis points, driven by portfolio progression, including the COVID-19 vaccine in the Pharmaceutical business. The other income and expense line showed net expense of $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to net expense of $16 million last year. This was primarily driven by higher litigation expenses related to a Missouri Supreme Court verdict on talc in the fourth quarter of 2020, which was previously disclosed in our November 3 8-K filing and we intend to seek review of that decision by the United States Supreme Court. 
Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate decreased from 4.9% in the fourth quarter of 2019 to a 5.5% benefit in the fourth quarter of 2020. This decline was primarily driven by the tax benefit associated with the fourth quarter 2020 litigation expenses. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 11.4% versus 10.7% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our 10-K for further details on specific tax matters. 
Let's now look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the fourth quarter of 2020, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales decreased from 27.1% to 24.9%, primarily driven by the COVID-19 impact this quarter. 
The following are the main drivers of adjusted income before tax by segment. Medical devices declined by 900 basis points driven by COVID-19 impacts on the business, including fixed cost deleveraging associated with sales declines. Consumer margins improved by 430 basis points, primarily driven by portfolio and investment optimization, including execution of our SKU rationalization program. The decline in Pharmaceutical margins of 90 basis points was primarily driven by investment in R&D associated with portfolio progression, including the COVID-19 vaccine. 
This slide provides our full year consolidated statement of earnings. Please direct your attention to the box section at the bottom of the schedule, where, again, you will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. 
As reported today, our full year 2020 adjusted EPS of $8.03 reflects a reported decrease of 7.5% and an operational decrease of 7.8%. The decline is primarily related to COVID-19 impacts realized predominantly in our medical device business, along with increased R&D investment, including the investment associated with our COVID-19 vaccine candidate. 
Moving to the next slide. Our full year 2020 adjusted income before tax for the enterprise decreased by 360 basis points versus 2019. Looking at the adjusted pretax income by segment, Medical Devices declined from 35.4% in the previous year to 17%, primarily driven by COVID-19 impacts on the business, including fixed cost deleveraging associated with sales declines. 2019 also includes approximately $2 billion related to the divestiture of the Advanced Sterilization Products business. Pharmaceutical margins improved by 200 basis points to 42% driven by favorable product mix and sales, marketing and administrative expense leveraging. Consumer margins improved by 240 basis points to 23.8% driven by portfolio and investment optimization, including the execution of our SKU rationalization program. 
Moving on to important developments. For your reference, here is a slide summarizing notable developments occurring in the fourth quarter, some of which were mentioned in my comments. For your planning purposes, we plan to host a business review featuring our Pharmaceutical business on November 18 of this year. The format and location will be announced at a later date, but we hope that you're able to join us for this event, where we look forward to sharing the details about our robust pipeline and differentiated capabilities that gives us the confidence in our ability to sustain growth in pharmaceuticals at above-market levels. 
That concludes the sales and P&L highlights for Johnson & Johnson's fourth quarter and full year 2020. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk."
139677,695370007,2181450,"Johnson & Johnson, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2021",2021-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Johnson & Johnson","Executives","Thank you, Chris, and thanks to everyone joining today's call.

The unwaveri",2005,"Thank you, Chris, and thanks to everyone joining today's call. As you heard, Johnson & Johnson's results reflect the strength and resilience of an agile, broad-based business predicated on innovation despite unique challenges throughout 2020. The unwavering commitment of our 135,000 global colleagues was on full display, delivering trusted, life-saving, life-enhancing products to patients and consumers around the world. Their efforts resulted in sound shareholder returns while advancing value-creating opportunities that benefit all of our stakeholders now and over the long term. 
Alex stated on this call and really throughout 2020, and that Johnson & Johnson is built for times like this. Our disciplined, long-term focus yields a financial strength that affords us the ability to quickly act to address the COVID-19 pandemic in many ways most notably on our ongoing vaccine development, but to also continue investing in innovative solutions to better the future of health care even when short-term uncertainty exists. I am very pleased today to share our financial guidance for 2021, which reflects these principles. But first, let me review our cash position and capital allocation priorities. 
We generated free cash flow for the year of $20 billion, surpassing last year's record high. We did benefit by having our fiscal year-end lapse into 2021, as Chris noted, and we are now planning for a payment related to the anticipated final opioid litigation agreement in principle in 2021 versus the previous planned 2020 payment. In terms of our cash position at the end of 2020, we had approximately $10 billion of net debt, comprised of approximately $25 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $35 billion of debt. 
One element of our business that we're particularly proud of that despite the challenges that 2020 offered, we maintained our long-term approach to drive growth and value creation across the enterprise. From an innovation standpoint, the development of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine was certainly a top priority throughout the year. Yet, as I said earlier, we continue to make other strategic investments that fortified our pipeline and further enhanced our competitive advantage even during the pandemic. Our level of R&D investment reached an all-time high of $12.1 billion, $800 million more than our 2019 R&D investment. 
On the transaction front, we continue to evaluate opportunities that strategically complement our portfolio and where our scientific expertise or commercial capabilities can create unique value. Over the course of 2020, we invested over $7 billion in such opportunities. 
As discussed on our third quarter earnings call in October, we acquired Momenta Pharmaceuticals and a lead therapeutic candidate, nipocalimab, which is in Phase II and Phase III clinical development for the treatment of rare autoantibody driven diseases. We believe nipocalimab encompasses a pipeline and a product opportunity that can treat a broad range of devastating autoantibody-driven diseases. 
In December, we expanded our retina pipeline by acquiring the rights to Hemera Biosciences investigational gene therapy, HMR 59 and a onetime outpatient intravitreal injection to help preserve vision in patients with geographic atrophy, a severe form of age-related macular degeneration, where currently, there are no other approved therapies. And as shareholders in Johnson & Johnson have come to expect, we continue to prioritize our dividend by announcing last April a 6.3% increase. This translated in returning $10.5 billion to investors in 2020, approximately 50% of our free cash flow. 
Let's now turn to our full year 2021 guidance. Given our full year 2020 performance in this unprecedented environment and the underlying strength of our broad-based business, we are well positioned to continue delivering long-term value to our stakeholders. We continue to monitor and work with health care systems around the globe as they balance surges in COVID-19 cases with treatment for non-COVID-19 patients. 
I would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge the tremendous efforts of health care providers around the world that have society in a much better place today with improved treatment protocols and resource allocation compared to the start of the pandemic. We are also encouraged by the recent availability of COVID-19 vaccines that will provide added reassurance to people in need of medical procedures. From a macroeconomic perspective, our outlook assumes stabilizing employment levels and a reduction in social restrictions as the year progresses. From a legislative standpoint, we are not assuming significant changes in current tax policy, and consistent with the past 4 years in our Pharmaceuticals business, we expect net price decreases at similar levels. We will continue to focus on providing access to more patients for our innovative products, resulting in growth being volume-driven. 
So let's get into the details for full year 2021 guidance for you to consider in updating your models. I'd like to note up front that our guidance excludes the financial impact from the potential distribution of our COVID-19 vaccine candidate. As Alex noted, we remain committed to provide a safe and effective vaccine. Being in the final stages of a robust 45,000-person study, analytics will be completed, and we plan to report out the results by early next week. Therefore, it would be premature to speculate. We will let the science play out. Once we have the data, obtain regulatory authorization and finalize agreements to supply, we will provide financial updates as warranted, likely during our first quarter earnings call in April. 
Starting with sales. We expect adjusted operational sales growth for the full year 2021 of between 8.0% and 9.5%. This adjusted operational sales growth is on a constant currency basis, reflecting how we manage our business performance. We estimate the negative impact from net acquisitions and divestitures of approximately 50 basis points and, as such, are comfortable with your models reflecting operational sales growth in the range of 7.5% to 9.0% or $88.8 to $90.0 billion. 
As you know, we do not predict the impact of currency movement. But for some context, utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.21, there is an estimated positive impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 200 basis points resulting in an estimated reported sales growth of between 9.5% and 11.0% or 10.3% at the midpoint compared to 2020 or $90.5 billion to $91.7 billion. 
Let's now turn to earnings per share. This slide illustrates the components of our 2021 EPS guidance. Roughly half of our EPS growth is attributed to the robust operational sales growth and the other half is attributable to strong net income margin improvement driven by expected operating margin improvement of more than 200 basis points versus 2020. The medical device COVID-19 recovery and other cost improvement initiatives are planned to more than offset our continued investment to accelerate our business and further strengthen our pipeline of new products for the long term. 
As a reminder, included in our 2021 guidance is the dilution from the recent acquisition of Momenta, negatively impacting EPS by about $0.15 or $0.10 versus 2020. Considering these items results in adjusted operational EPS in a range of $9.25 to $9.45 or $9.35 at the midpoint, reflecting a 16.4% year-over-year increase. While not predicting the impact of currency movements, assuming recent exchange rates, our reported adjusted EPS would be positively impacted by approximately $0.15 per share, resulting in adjusted reported earnings per share of $9.5 at the midpoint reflecting growth of 18.3% versus the prior year. 
Continuing with EPS guidance. This slide provides a summary of what I just shared, along with some additional P&L items, to give you more insight into the drivers of our full year guidance. Beginning with other income and expense, the line on the P&L where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses related to the items such as investments by our Johnson & Johnson Development Corporation, litigation and write-offs. As I discussed on previous earnings calls, we will continue to be rigorous regarding portfolio management, but going forward, we will not include the impact of significant divestiture gains in adjusted EPS. Given those considerations, we would be comfortable with your models for 2021 reflecting net other income and expense, excluding special items, as net income ranging from between $600 million and $700 million. 
We continue to actively evaluate external value-creating opportunities, but for purposes of your financial models, we are not assuming any major acquisitions or other major uses of cash at this time. Therefore, we are comfortable with you modeling net interest expense of between $150 million and $250 million. We are also projecting a higher effective tax rate for 2021 in the range of 16.5% to 17.5% or a midpoint of 17% due to beneficial onetime items in 2020 related to the closeout of audits in several jurisdictions that will not repeat in 2021. 
Let me spend a few minutes providing some qualitative context about 2021, although not intended to specifically provide segment or quarterly guidance. Given variability that occurred due primarily to COVID-related dynamics, this slide, while not to scale and meant to be illustrative, offers some perspectives on the quarterly phasing across our businesses. 
From a sales perspective, as Chris noted earlier, we benefited from additional selling days in 2020 that will not repeat in 2021. That should be applied to both the full year and the fourth quarter for the enterprise and by segment. 
I'll address each segment starting with Pharmaceuticals, where we anticipate another strong year of above-market growth. Throughout 2020, we saw COVID-19-driven fluctuations, and most pronounced was the first quarter when, as we noted, we benefited from longer script durations. We continue to invest in COVID-19 vaccine development impacting the first quarter while we pursue authorization. For 2021, we expect more balanced quarter-to-quarter growth. Lastly, while we expect to continue to face pricing pressures and the ongoing negative impact of generic and biosimilar competition, we do not expect any significant new generic or biosimilar entrants in 2021. 
Turning to our medical device segment. As mentioned earlier, we observed instances of nonemergency procedure postponements late in the fourth quarter, but health care systems continue to meet the needs of both COVID and non-COVID patients resulting in less COVID-19 market disruption as we progressed through 2020. While macro market dynamics such as vaccine deployment, unemployment and health care coverage remain fluid, we are anticipating some moderate procedural disruption to carry into the first quarter but expect continued medical device market improvement throughout 2021 fluctuating by quarter. 
As you heard during our medical device update in November, our core platforms continue to strengthen, driven by enhanced execution and improved cadence of innovation and filling critical portfolio gaps, including and, most notably, advancing our future digital surgery offerings. We believe the combination of the expected market recovery and the actions taken to strengthen our device business positions us to drive revenue growth each quarter versus 2020 with some continued headwinds due to COVID-19 tempering growth in the first quarter and the highest growth rate expected in the second quarter, given the significant market disruption realized in the second quarter of 2020. 
Our Consumer Health segment yielded solid performance throughout the pandemic, resulting in above-market growth. But as noted on our third quarter earnings call, that performance is likely to yield negative COVID-related sales comparisons in the first quarter of 2021 primarily in over-the-counter products. We also plan that our continued SKU rationalization program will have a negative impact on sales in the first half of 2021 while we continue progressing our margin expansion. For the second half, we would anticipate more normalized growth as consumers return to more typical usage patterns for products in areas like Skin Health/Beauty. Therefore, although not linear, for the full year, we anticipate growing competitively with the markets in which we compete. 
We are confident in the strength of our broad-based business and its underlying fundamentals. We are positioned to deliver meaningful value to all of our stakeholders, not just in 2021, but over the long term. Alex and I look forward to addressing your questions. So I'm now pleased to turn the call back over to Chris to initiate the Q&A session. Chris?"

Look, maybe before I answer this -- your question, let me just back up for a higher level. And once again, not what I think has just been the tremendous contributions and performance of our 150,000 approximate associates around the world, 50,000 of whom have been going to work every day in our factories and our laboratories to ensure the products and services could continue to flow to patients and hospital systems around the world, let alone the important work that we're doing on the vaccine. 
Next, I also just think it's very important to reflect on the tremendous impact that COVID-19 has had around the world. You've heard some of the numbers that we mentioned earlier today, whether it's almost 100 million cases around the world, let alone 2 million deaths globally, or right here in the United States, almost 25 million people and over 400,000 deaths, that's taken a tremendous cost on, certainly, families, individuals, businesses, our economy on just so many different aspects of our life that all the more important for us to be doing everything we can to make a difference during this pandemic. 
Last but not least, I'm just very proud of the performance that we had, not only in the fourth quarter but throughout 2020. If you look at the various segments, in almost each of our sectors, all of our major platforms, what you saw is us ending the year in a better position than where we started. And that wasn't only for what I would call the near-term financial performance where we saw things like market share gains and position improvements. But also if you look at the investment that we made in research and development in sales and marketing, preparing for the future, not only 2021, but that and beyond, again, we think we're well positioned and stronger as we finish the year than even when we begin. 
Now getting back to your specific question regarding the breakouts, we're going to have much more information in the coming days. We think it's very important to follow the data, to follow the science. At that time, we think it will be more appropriate to provide you with all of the various cuts of the data that we anticipate having. Consistent with the statements that we made from the very beginning, we want to ensure that we've got a very robust program, not only geographically, but also by ethnicity, gender as well as a number of other different parameters, all as part of an effort to give us the best possible understanding of the efficacy and safety profile of our vaccine. So stay tuned. As Joe alluded to in his earlier comments, and Chris, we expect to have these results in the coming days. And our scientists - and Dr. Paul Stoffels and others will be providing much more detail once we have those results."

We won't know for certain. But look, we remain optimistic, and we're going to remain very diligent as we go through this final review. I'll hand it over to Joe to take the second part of that question."

And I think what we're seeing happening with a little bit of confusion is people are trying to parse this down into weeks. I think the definitive statement here is that we are very comfortable in meeting our commitments to those respective countries or organizations that I just outlined. 
In terms of financial implications and pricing, as you can imagine, once countries get a chance to see the data, we're in active negotiations for other countries and other organizations, and the volume will impact the selling price. So it's somewhat of a fluid situation, and that's why we're kind of projecting or leading folks to think about the April first quarter earnings call as a good time when many of those pieces will be in place, and we can give you some credible information to bank on for the balance of 2021."

Regarding some of the variants, obviously, we're watching that closely based upon some of the regional, the geographical differences that we've seen. And look, our scientists are already anticipating, as you've heard from some of the other companies, about what are our potential scenarios to ensure that we're prepared. But look, I think it starts with taking a look at the data that we currently have, that we should have shortly.

We certainly want to keep the flexibility that we've had even during 2021 and all that uncertainty to continue to invest in innovative ideas that really fortify, not just this year, but well beyond. 
In terms of some of the programs we have that are improving our operating margins, I'd point you to this consumer SKU rationalization. That is certainly something that will have an impact on consumer sales in the first half of the year but again, with this objective of improving profit margins, and that team has done a great job under leadership with respect to improving the margin profile over the last 2 years. You may also recall a few years back made significant investments in our supply chain infrastructure. Some of those are starting to pay off in 2021 as well. And then like it or not, we are working differently, and there are efficiencies that correlate to some of this working differently. I'm not suggesting that we found a steady state in terms of the balance between virtual work in the office, but there are some efficiencies that are being realized that I think will actually sustain long term as we move forward. So those are some of the factors that are going into our bullish call of above 200 basis points margin improvement."

We are pleased with not only the antibody response that we saw but also some of the cellular level response that would be in T cells. But again, more information will be available once we have our other final results. 
Secondly, more broadly, about health care, I do think that -- and we do feel that COVID-19 has had a very profound effect on health care systems, both near term and short -- and longer term. I think in the near term, what we've learned is, frankly, the importance of innovation and science. And if you reflect back on where we were, just 11 or 12 months ago at the beginning of COVID-19 and where we are now in the number, not only of very innovative vaccine candidates, but therapeutics and the differences that they made. If you take a look at the way hospital protocols very rapidly and quickly started using data sciences and information to better understand what was going on with patients entering those facilities, how they should be treated, what led to better outcomes, how that's impacted the reduction in morbidity, I think clearly, another example. Third, we've seen a rapid expansion in telehealth, and that's in primary care offices but also specialty offices. The way that companies like ours actually communicate and engage and educate physicians and health care systems, we would see that lasting for some time as well. And clearly, on the public health side, we think that's also a very important dynamic for us to consider going forward. I mean I think it's clear from this that the world now has a much better understanding of the importance of well-established, well-funded global public health programs, without which we're at significant risk around the world, whether it's our economies, society just at a number of different levels. So those are perhaps some of the longer-term trends. 
And last but not least, I'd like to do a -- just a shout-out for the partnership and collaboration that we've seen with not only within industry and across industry but also with regulators around the world. And it's certainly our hope that we can take some of that and apply it to other advancements, whether it's cures for cancer, neuroscience, other conditions. If we can take some of those same paradigms and accelerations and apply them there, that would be great news not only for patients, certainly in health care systems, but for the industry as well."

Maybe a little bit more color there in terms of the sustainability of growth you see as we just think about that franchise evolving over time."

And I think we saw very good signs of that actually over the course of 2020, where we saw the medical device market drop anywhere from 30% to up to 70%, depending on which category you're looking at, to return to mid-single-digit drops in the third quarter as we went through the rest of the year. As Joe and I believe Chris alluded to earlier in some of their commentary, we would expect see continued impact certainly in the first quarter of 2021, although the early signs, we're encouraged by what we're seeing in hospitals' ability to manage through some of the current patient demands. There are certainly regions and hospitals around, let alone in the United States, where you see a tremendous strain on the systems. But overall, we're seeing hospital volumes decrease no more than about 10% or 15% in areas such, for example, in the U.K., a couple of other places in Europe. But overall, the resiliency and the ability of the hospital systems that continue with elective surgeries has improved quite significantly. And as you -- as I'm sure you would project, if we look at second quarter, in particular, the year-on-year comparison should return. 
As we look at our team's performance and consider 2021, we're actually looking at 2019 as more of a benchmark to -- and to use that as an indicator more of what a baseline or normal would be. But again, we can -- we would expect to continue to see expansion over the course of 2021. And beyond that, again, see a return to a market that was growing in the mid-single digits previously, and we would expect that to continue going forward as well."

It is a competitive category. There are a number of new agents, but we also know that this is an area of significant unmet medical need, again, particularly in the Crohn space and the rest of the GI category.

Joanne, regarding VELYS, look, we were very excited about the approval with the FDA. As we were able to share with you during our innovation day with our medical device group, if we look at the flexibility, the accuracy, the reduced footprint that it provides the surgeon and surgical teams, we think that it just has tremendous potential. Again, this is a market that is still -- we think, has a significant opportunity for growth in terms of penetration. We also think it will be a nice complement to our ATTUNE fixed-bearing cementless knee. And remember, we also have plans to expand VELYS significantly beyond just knee replacement but to other areas as well. So when you combine that, we think it will be very competitive. And more importantly, we think it will be a great new option for physicians, for orthopedic surgeons and, ultimately, for patients and their families. I'm not going to get into all of the launch plans. But what I will tell you is the team has got an aggressive agenda lined up, and they're completing all the other associated testing as we speak. But we look forward to launching that over the course of 2021 and, again, expanding our overall position. 
Regarding Vision Care, you're right, there are a lot of dynamics that we certainly saw in the past year, in the contact lens market, significant contraction as well as in the surgery market. We believe that our position overall in the contact lens has continued to strengthen. And we did see improvement as we went quarter-to-quarter and ended the year, and we think we'll be well positioned as we enter 2021. We've also made a number of changes regarding our surgical business. We're excited in 2021 about the Tecnis SYMPHONY launch with a depth of focus lens. It's got improved near-term focus, and we have -- also have a Tecnis synergy IOL, a first-in-class product combining a number of different technologies, to really deliver a great range with high contrast. We expect that in '21. So again, we remain very confident and optimistic about the potential overall in our Vision Care business."

It was worth almost 9 points. And we do view our growth is still competitive versus the market.

Look, we were -- I think it's important to put made perhaps some additional perspective on it. If we really go back to 2017, where I believe the growth rate of our medical device division was about 1.5 points, and if you look at the expansion as we went through 2019 to where it was growing at almost a 4% rate. And as we've articulated a number of times, our goal is to grow at or faster than the markets where we compete. We believe the markets where we compete overall in surgery and orthopedics and vision care and others, cardiovascular, are in the 4% to 5% range. And that's the goal for our businesses. As we -- of course, with 2019 or 2020, excuse me, and the effect of COVID, that had a very significant impact. But again, here, too, if we normalize out our trends for third and fourth quarter, we think that overall, those quarters were pretty consistent, down about 3.5% after you pull everything else out, and will put us on a good rate, as we mentioned earlier, over the course of 2021 and beyond. 
Regarding VELYS, as I mentioned earlier, we think it does offer a number of unique advantages. We think it can enhance the surgeon's ability to really personalize total knee arthroscopy. At the same time, it has certain features that will make it easier for use potentially in the operating room. And again, we think it's going to be a great complement not only our ATTUNE system, but further down the line to our hip procedures and others as well. We do feel that the overall knee market will recover in 2021. It will take place over the course of the year as hospitals are able to continue to get their capacity back, as patients get increasingly confident. The knee market was perhaps hit more than others because many of those procedures can be delayed, perhaps versus a hip procedure. But we would expect that to return over the course of this year as we see the pandemic dealt with in a more effective way and things hopefully return to a more normal state. And by the way, we think the outlook for that longer term, given some of the pent-up demand that we're likely to see, will be quite significant. 
As you saw in our review back in November, we're very excited about  Ottava. We truly think it's going to offer a next-generation digital and robotic surgery. As you just mentioned, the team made great progress over the last 12 months. As we brought the various technologies together, we continue to do the build-outs and when we remain on track with all the time lines that we have previously committed to, and we're confident that here too is a market that we think is very -- has very low penetration, less than 5% or 10%, certainly on a global basis, more so in certain categories here in the United States. But whether it's penetration or the ability just to expand those kind of options to surgeons here in the United States around the world, based upon the technology that we'll be bringing, we think it will offer significant upside on the time lines that you just mentioned."

If you look at what we shared in Q4 ahead of this earnings, we'd anticipated that we could be anywhere from down 10% or flat versus our original thinking, which would have contemplated some growth year-over-year, plus a 53rd week. If you look at where we landed, we basically landed at the low end of that range, given some of the additional softness that the market experienced in the December time frame where procedures were probably down more around that 10% range. So overall, in line with expectations, but more towards the low end, given some of the surge we saw at the very end."

And  again, there were regions around the country, where we saw a differential impact, but I think it's fair to say that we were pleased to see the ability of the majority of systems in the United States be able to continue to provide elective procedures even in spite of some of the later surges where we saw even more significant impacts were in Europe and LatAm during that period and because of our stronger position in certain places in Europe that had a differential impact on us. And again, so -- as hopefully, we see improving trends with the virus in Europe over the course of 2021, we would expect to see that return. And so regarding your questions on volumes in the back end, look, it's hard to predict based upon where we currently are. As we said earlier, we think the most significant impact this year will be certainly in Q1. As we continue to deal with some of the ongoing surge, we would expect the year-on-year comparisons to change pretty significantly in Q2 and Q3. And again, assuming much improved vaccine distribution, better overall control of COVID-19, we would then expect to see volumes come back to more normalized levels as we finish the year. But obviously, there's a lot of moving parts. There's a lot of assumptions, a lot of dynamics that we'll have to watch closely.

Please note that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review the cautionary statement included in today's presentation which identifies certain risks and factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. In particular, there is significant uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This means the results could change at any time, and the contemplated impact of COVID-19 on the company's business results and outlook is a best estimate based on the information available as of today's date. A further description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2019 Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Qs, along with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures are also available at investor.jnj.com.  
Several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships.

And thank you, everyone, for taking time to join us today to discuss our full year 2020 results and outlook for 2021. 
At the start of last year, no one could have imagined just how drastically our lives were about to change because of a virus that would impact billions of people around the world. By any measure, 2020 was a year dominated by uncertainty, yet the pandemic also helped to clarify both our priorities and our values. And within Johnson & Johnson, it has illustrated the power and importance of our credo in guiding our actions to meet the needs of all our stakeholders. 
Now because of COVID-19, we now have a deeper appreciation of just how pivotal good health is to our safety, security and prosperity as a society. We have a profound respect and gratitude for all the doctors, nurses and hospital staff serving on the front lines of care, for the everyday heroism of the essential workers who show up every day to keep the world's critical infrastructure up and running. And expectations that companies can and should help drive positive change in the society are higher than ever.  
As the world's largest and most broadly based global health care company, Johnson & Johnson was built for times like this. We've been leading through the world's biggest public health challenges for over a century. And today, our diversified businesses touch so many parts of people's lives we have both the ability and the responsibility to act when the COVID-19 outbreak turned into a global pandemic.  
Within weeks of the DNA sequencing of the COVID-19 virus, Janssen scientists were working 24/7 to identify the most promising lead candidate for a vaccine. I'm proud of the progress of our COVID-19 vaccine candidate and the fact that we moved so quickly while maintaining the highest level of science and safety standards. This is truly a remarkable accomplishment and a testament to the ingenuity and determination of our vaccine and supply chain teams. We look forward to sharing further details from our Phase III study by early next week.  
Additionally, I'm just as proud of the ways that each of my Johnson & Johnson colleagues have gone above and beyond the call of duty to provide uninterrupted access to our medicines, embrace radically new ways of working and use the full breadth and depth of our expertise to deliver our important medicines and products to patients and consumers and support health care systems that have been overwhelmed by the pandemic. The fact that we've been able not just to weather this crisis but bring our broad-based capabilities to support this crisis and deliver on our shorter-term top and bottom line business goals while increasing our investments in innovation at record levels is a remarkable testament to our purpose-driven culture and core strengths that characterize our company for over a century: execution, innovation and people.  
Our relentless focus on excellence and execution is key to meeting the needs of all our stakeholders today and tomorrow. 
The performance of our business 2020 reflects the continued confidence from patients, physicians, customers and consumers in our life-saving medicines and products. Our Pharmaceutical business performed well above market, kept pipeline submissions and approvals on track and exceeded patient enrollment in clinical trials compared to 2019. Our Consumer Health business also performed above market for the year, and our Medical Devices business demonstrated resiliency and agility, leading to a strong second half recovery.  
Our unparalleled scientific expertise allows us to create life-enhancing innovation. Our R&D colleagues across Johnson & Johnson have continued to advance our robust pipeline of innovative and transformational new products. Of note, we initiated our U.S. filing for BCMA CAR-T in multiple myeloma in December. In addition, we filed amivantamab for the treatment of exon 20 mutations in non-small cell lung cancer in the U.S. and Europe.  
Our Medical Device business has made strong progress advancing our pipeline despite the pandemic, achieving and even accelerating certain key milestones throughout the year. As you heard from Ashley, Dr. Moll and the team at the medical device update in November, we are developing an end-to-end digital ecosystem across 3 robotics platforms, and we achieved a significant milestone this month, receiving FDA clearance for our VELYS robotic-assisted solutions. We believe the industry is just starting to unlock the full potential and benefits of robotic and digital technologies. Johnson & Johnson is well positioned to bring innovative, differentiated solutions to the surgery suite over the next 10, 20 and 30 years.  
I'm also very proud of the great work from our supply chain colleagues in driving improvements and efficiencies over the past year. Gartner even honored Johnson & Johnson with a #3 ranking across all industries on its annual 2020 supply chain top 25 index. That's up 5 spots from our 2019 ranking. Gartner also awarded Johnson & Johnson the #1 spot on its 2020 healthcare supply chain Top 25, citing our commitment to continuous improvement while putting innovation into practice, particularly in our response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  
And finally, we are powered by our people, purpose and value system. More than 75 years since it was authored, our credo continues to guide all 135,000 of us at Johnson & Johnson. And with that in mind, I want to highlight a recent appointment to our Board of Directors, an incredibly high honor awarded to one of our own directors. In December, Johnson & Johnson appointed retired U.S. Army Lieutenant General and former U.S. Army Surgeon General, Dr. Nadja West, to our Board of Directors. Dr. West's accomplished health care background in addition to her deep strategic leadership experience are strong additions to our Board of Directors.  
In October, Johnson & Johnson Board Director, Dr. Jennifer Doudna, along with her colleague, Dr.Emmanuelle Charpentier, was awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the revolutionary discovery of CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology, considered to be one of the most significant breakthroughs in molecular biology in the past decade. We are truly proud of her recognition for this incredible work.  
Our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion in both our workforce and the communities in which we serve has always been an important part of our culture. However, the past year has also shown a spotlight on the fact that we can all do more. To that end, I am proud of our Race to Health Equity platform launched in November. Our Race to Health Equity aims to help improve racial equity by eliminating health inequities for people of color and our $100 million commitment to invest in and promote health equity. I'm excited to be part of this progress and for Johnson & Johnson to play a part in impactful lasting change.  
And most importantly, the talented and committed people of Johnson & Johnson drive our success by putting the patients and consumers we serve around the world at the forefront of all we do. We thank and rely on them to continue to innovate, execute and focus on our shared purpose to deliver better health for everyone everywhere.  
I look forward to addressing your questions during the Q&A portion of the webcast. Right now, I'll turn the call over to Chris to share details related to our performance for the quarter. Thank you. Chris?"

Worldwide sales were $22.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of 8.3% versus the fourth quarter of 2019. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 7.1% as currency had a positive impact of 1.2 points. 
In the U.S., sales increased 9.6%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported growth was 7%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 4.3% with currency positively impacting our reported OUS results by 2.7 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 7.3% worldwide, 9.6% in the U.S. and 4.8% outside the U.S.  
As referenced on prior calls, I would like to remind everyone that our 2020 fiscal year included an additional week. Since this week occurred during a holiday period, it does not represent a full week of sales but rather a few more shipping days with these additional shipping days adding approximately 4 points to the quarterly sales growth rate and 1 point to the annual growth rate. This can be roughly applied across all segments. The additional sales were more heavily skewed to the U.S.  
For the enterprise, offsetting this sales benefit was the estimated negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Lastly, while these few shipping days added to sales, we also had a full week's worth of operating costs. Therefore, the impact to earnings was negligible.  
Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $1.7 billion and diluted earnings per share was $0.65 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.50 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $5 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.86, representing decreases of 1.2% and 1.1%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share declined 3.2%.  
For the full year 2020, consolidated sales were $82.6 billion, an increase of 0.6% compared to the full year of 2019. Operationally, full year sales grew 1.2% with currency having a negative impact of 0.6 points. 
Sales growth in the U.S. was 2.5%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported year-over-year change was negative 1.3%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. declined by 0.2% with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 1.1 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 1.5% worldwide, 2.8% in the U.S. and 0.2% outside the U.S.  
Net earnings for the full year 2020 were $14.7 billion and diluted earnings per share was $5.51 versus diluted earnings per share of $5.63 a year ago. 2020 adjusted net earnings were $21.4 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $8.03, representing decreases of 8.1% and 7.5%, respectively, versus full year 2019. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased by 7.8%.  
Beginning with Consumer Health, I will now comment on business segment sales performance for the fourth quarter, highlighting items that build upon the slides you have in front of you. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2019 and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. While not part of the prepared remarks for today's call, we have provided additional commentary on our website for the full year 2020 sales by segment to assist you in updating your models.  
Worldwide Consumer Health sales totaled $3.6 billion and grew 2%, with growth in the U.S. of 2.7% and 1.5% outside of the U.S. Consumer Health delivered strong above-market growth due to our Oral Care, Wound Care and OUS skin health/beauty businesses partially offset by the negative impact of COVID-19 primarily in our OTC business and the SKU rationalization program which predominantly impacted baby and skin health/beauty outside the U.S. E-commerce growth continues to be strong across regions and franchises.  
Over-the-counter medicines had a decline of 1.5%. In the U.S., OTC sales were flat, and the OUS declined by 2.9%. Globally, results were negatively impacted by COVID-19 restrictions resulting in lower cough, cold and flu incidences, impacting Children's TYLENOL, global cough and cold and digestive products. Offsetting these declines was strong Adult TYLENOL market and share growth attributed to elevated demand driven by COVID-19, ZYRTEC share growth partially due to competitive out-of-stock and strong market growth in anti-smoking aids in EMEA.  
The skin health and beauty franchise experienced recovery with a 2.6% increase, driven by strong performance of OGX due to share gains and OUS growth for Dr.Ci:Labo, partially offset by NEUTROGENA declines as retailers carry less inventory, coupled with market declines primarily in the makeup category due to fewer use occasions driven by COVID-19 restrictions and SKU rationalization. As consumers continue to focus on products related to personal health and hygiene, Oral Care grew by 12% on continued growth of LISTERINE mouthwash due to new flavor and product innovations and the increased demand globally related to COVID-19. 
Wound Care grew 12.2% primarily due to strong performance across NEOSPORIN and BAND-AID brand adhesive bandages in the U.S. and Asia Pacific. In the baby franchise, we saw AVEENO Baby strength, offset by our planned SKU rationalization program primarily outside the U.S.  
Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $12.3 billion grew 14.6%, enabled by strength in all regions, with U.S. sales increasing by 15.3% and OUS sales increasing by 13.5%. The business realized double-digit growth in 8 key products across our portfolio, supporting growth in all therapeutic areas except for cardiovascular/metabolism/other, which experienced a decline of 1% primarily driven by continued biosimilar competition for PROCRIT. Our strong portfolio of products and commercial capabilities has enabled us to deliver our ninth consecutive year of global adjusted operational growth at above-market levels.  
Our oncology portfolio delivered another robust quarter with worldwide growth of 23.7%. DARZALEX continued its strong performance, growing 49%, led by share gains globally, with the U.S. market share up about 4 points across all lines of therapy. Furthermore, the U.S. and European markets continue to exhibit increased adoption of the subcutaneous formulation launched in the second quarter as feedback continues to be very positive on the ease and reduced time to administer the new formulation. Also, we continue to advance the DARZALEX innovation pipeline with the recent U.S. approval of DARZALEX FASPRO for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed light chain amyloidosis.  
IMBRUVICA grew 25.3% globally mainly driven by market growth and our strong leadership position in all key indications. We continue to progress the development of IMBRUVICA to further differentiate this BTK inhibitor, as evidenced by the robust data presentation at The American Society of Hematology conference in December. ERLEADA continued its strong growth momentum with sales of just over $240 million in the quarter driven by market share and penetration gains, especially in the metastatic indication. 
Our immunology therapeutic area delivered global sales growth of 15.3%, driven by strong double-digit performance of STELARA and TREMFYA. STELARA grew 30.3%, driven by global demand increase in Crohn's disease with over a 5 point share increase in the U.S. and continued growth in ulcerative colitis. TREMFYA grew 39.3% and is up about 3 points of share from the fourth quarter of 2019 in the psoriasis market in the U.S. TREMFYA continues to strengthen its leadership position as the most prescribed IL-23 inhibitor for patients worldwide through its differentiated data package in both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. We also continued to advance TREMFYA's pipeline as evidenced by Phase II Crohn's disease data that was presented earlier this year.  
In neuroscience, our paliperidone long-acting portfolio performed well, growing 9%, driven by market and share growth due to increased new patient starts and strong persistency. In 2020, we filed submissions in the U.S. and EU for paliperidone palmitate 6-month formulation for the treatment of adults diagnosed with schizophrenia. And if approved, it will be the first and only long-acting injectable medication with a twice-yearly dosing regimen.  
Our total Pulmonary Hypertension portfolio achieved strong growth of 37.4% with OPSUMIT growth of 36.7% and UPTRAVI growth of 44.1%, both driven by market penetration and share growth as well as a onetime benefit of about 10 points each resulting from the U.S. distributor model change we communicated in Q4 2019.  
I'll now turn your attention to the Medical Devices segment. Worldwide Medical Devices sales were $6.6 billion, declining 2.2%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, primarily the divestiture of ASP, adjusted operational sales decline was 1.5% worldwide. Onetime items positively impacted the current quarter by about 200 basis points. The net benefit from these onetime items is comprised of the benefit of the extra shipping days associated with the 53rd week partially offset by the anticipated inventory contractions in China across our portfolio and in our U.S. contact lens business as communicated last quarter. Adjusting for the impact of these onetime items, Q4 results were in line with Q3 2020 performance.  
COVID-19 remains a dynamic variable within the medical device market. In Q4, COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations reached their highest levels in certain parts of the world while cases remained relatively stable in others. This did lead to some softening in recovery trends late in the quarter. However, impacts varied across geographies and procedure types.  
Looking geographically. China, where COVID-19 cases have continued to remain more stable, delivered double-digit growth within the quarter. Excluding the benefit of the additional shipping days, the U.S. declined low single digits due to COVID-19-related restrictions occurring late in the quarter. Sales also declined in Europe, where some of the strictest restrictions were deployed to curb the increases in COVID-19 cases. As we have noted previously, health care systems continue to demonstrate their resiliency and dedication to treating both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, resulting in significantly less disruption during this recent surge of cases versus the impact seen earlier this year.  
Interventional Solutions continue to demonstrate strong performance, delivering another quarter of double-digit growth. Electrophysiology grew 12.7% globally, led by market recovery and share gains from new products. CERENOVUS returned to double-digit growth with strong sales in China. Worldwide orthopedics declined 5.3% versus prior year driven by the negative impact of COVID-19 on procedures deemed to be more elective in nature. 
Worldwide trauma delivered growth of 3.6% globally. U.S. growth of 10% for the quarter reflects market recovery as well as success of our new products such as the Cannulated Compression Headless Screws. Declines of about 6% outside the U.S. reflects slower procedural volumes due to COVID-19 restrictions as well as contractions in inventory in China worth around 400 basis points. 
Worldwide hips declined 2.7% primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 on the market. U.S. declined 0.7% versus prior year and continues to benefit from our leadership position in Anterior Approach and strong demand for the Actis stem and enabling technologies helping to partially offset the negative COVID-19 impact. We continue to introduce innovation in this space, and in December, we entered the modular dual mobility market with the first implant of PINNACLE dual mobility, which is planned for a full U.S. market launch this year. 
Knees declined 13.9% globally as we continue to see procedures in this space highly impacted by COVID-19, especially revision procedures where we have a higher share than primary. The 20.6% decline outside of the U.S. reflects the impacts of COVID-19 on procedures, especially in markets like the U.K. and India, where we hold higher share positions. 
We are very excited about the FDA clearance of our VELYS orthopedic robotic system and bringing this to the U.S. market in 2021. The combination of the differentiated robotic system with our ATTUNE Knee platform are expected to drive enhanced performance in this segment.  
Worldwide decline in spine of 7.1% reflects the impact of COVID-19 on the market as well as inventory reductions in China, impacting global performance by about 350 basis points. Offsetting this decline is the growth we continue to see from the success of recent launches of new products such as SYMPHONY and CONDUIT. For the quarter, U.S. price remained consistent with historical levels, down low single digits.  
Moving to the results for the Surgery business. Advanced surgery returned to growth with a 2% increase versus prior year led by strong performance in U.S. biosurgery, which grew 12.1% in the quarter. U.S. biosurgery growth is due to the strength of SURGIFLO and the continued recovery from the previously disclosed 2019 stop shipment.  
Endocutters delivered 1.6% growth, mainly driven by the success of new products in China offsetting impacts from COVID-19. Energy declined by 3.1%, reflecting the negative impact of COVID-19 and competitive pressures in the U.S. partially offset by the strength of new products outside the U.S. This month, we received FDA 510(k) clearances for both the ENSEAL X1 curved and straight jaw tissue sealer instruments, which will further strengthen our portfolio of advanced energy devices.  
Global wound closure grew by 1.5% through the strength of STRATAFIX barbed suture and PRINEO topical skin adhesive products in both the U.S. and OUS markets. Inventory dynamics in the quarter added about 350 basis points to the U.S. growth of 8.5% and negatively impacted the OUS decline of 2.9% by about 150 basis points.  
The Vision business declined 6.6% globally. U.S. contact lens declined 7.1%. However, after adjusting for the impact of both the additional shipping days this quarter and the impact of the anticipated channel inventory correction communicated last quarter worth about 9 points, the underlying U.S. contact lens business grew and continues to deliver competitive performance. While surgical vision declined 10.1% globally, this represents an improvement from Q3 where the business declined 16.4%, with the most notable improvement in the U.S. This improvement is due to both improvement in the cataract and refractive markets as well as new products like TECNIS Toric II IOL for astigmatism.  
Now regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2020, please direct your attention to the boxed section of the schedule. You will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. As reported earlier, our adjusted EPS of $1.86 reflects a reported decrease of 1.1% and an operational decrease of 3.2%. 
I'd like to now highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed on the statement of earnings compared to the same quarter last year. Cost of products sold delevered slightly, primarily driven by COVID-19 period costs and fixed costs impacting the Medical Device business partially offset by favorable enterprise portfolio mix and portfolio mix within the Pharmaceutical business. Selling, marketing and administrative margins improved for the quarter as a result of favorable segment mix and expense leveraging in the Pharmaceutical and Consumer businesses partially offset by the negative COVID-19 impact on Medical Devices sales.  
We continue to invest in research and development at competitive levels, investing 17.9% of sales this quarter. This was higher than the fourth quarter of 2019 by 230 basis points, driven by portfolio progression, including the COVID-19 vaccine in the Pharmaceutical business. 
The other income and expense line showed net expense of $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to net expense of $16 million last year. This was primarily driven by higher litigation expenses related to a Missouri Supreme Court verdict on talc in the fourth quarter of 2020, which was previously disclosed in our November 3 8-K filing, and we intend to seek review of that decision by the United States Supreme Court.  
Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate decreased from 4.9% in the fourth quarter of 2019 to a 5.5% benefit in the fourth quarter of 2020. This decline was primarily driven by the tax benefit associated with the fourth quarter 2020 litigation expenses. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 11.4% versus 10.7% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our 10-K for further details on specific tax matters.  
Let's now look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the fourth quarter of 2020, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales decreased from 27.1% to 24.9%, primarily driven by the COVID-19 impact this quarter.  
The following are the main drivers of adjusted income before tax by segment. Medical Devices declined by 900 basis points, driven by COVID-19 impacts on the business, including fixed cost deleveraging associated with sales declines. Consumer margins improved by 430 basis points, primarily driven by portfolio and investment optimization, including execution of our SKU rationalization program. The decline in Pharmaceutical margins of 90 basis points was primarily driven by investment in R&D associated with portfolio progression, including the COVID-19 vaccine.  
This slide provides our full year consolidated statement of earnings. Please direct your attention to the boxed section at the bottom of the schedule, where, again, you will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items.  
As reported today, our full year 2020 adjusted EPS of $8.03 reflects a reported decrease of 7.5% and an operational decrease of 7.8%. The decline is primarily related to COVID-19 impacts realized predominantly in our Medical Device business, along with increased R&D investment, including the investment associated with our COVID-19 vaccine candidate.  
Moving to the next slide. Our full year 2020 adjusted income before tax for the enterprise decreased by 360 basis points versus 2019. Looking at the adjusted pretax income by segment, Medical Devices declined from 35.4% in the previous year to 17%, primarily driven by COVID-19 impacts on the business, including fixed cost deleveraging associated with sales declines. 2019 also includes approximately $2 billion related to the divestiture of the Advanced Sterilization Products business. Pharmaceutical margins improved by 200 basis points to 42%, driven by favorable product mix and sales, marketing and administrative expense leveraging. Consumer margins improved by 240 basis points to 23.8%, driven by portfolio and investment optimization, including the execution of our SKU rationalization program.  
Moving on to important developments. For your reference, here is a slide summarizing notable developments occurring in the fourth quarter, some of which were mentioned in my comments. 
For your planning purposes, we plan to host a business review featuring our Pharmaceutical business on November 18 of this year. The format and location will be announced at a later date, but we hope that you're able to join us for this event, where we look forward to sharing the details about our robust pipeline and differentiated capabilities that gives us the confidence in our ability to sustain growth in Pharmaceuticals at above-market levels.  
That concludes the sales and P&L highlights for Johnson & Johnson's fourth quarter and full year 2020. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk."
139677,695370007,2181547,"Johnson & Johnson, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2021",2021-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Johnson & Johnson","Executives","Thank you, Chris, and thanks to everyone joining today's call. As you heard, Johnson & Johnson's results reflect the strength and resilience of an agile, broad-based business predicated on innovation despite unique challenges throughout 2020. The unwaveri",2003,"Thank you, Chris, and thanks to everyone joining today's call. As you heard, Johnson & Johnson's results reflect the strength and resilience of an agile, broad-based business predicated on innovation despite unique challenges throughout 2020. The unwavering commitment of our 135,000 global colleagues was on full display, delivering trusted, life-saving, life-enhancing products to patients and consumers around the world. Their efforts resulted in sound shareholder returns while advancing value-creating opportunities that benefit all of our stakeholders now and over the long term. 
Alex stated on this call and really throughout 2020 that Johnson & Johnson is built for times like this. Our disciplined, long-term focus yields a financial strength that affords us the ability to quickly act to address the COVID-19 pandemic in many ways, most notably on our ongoing vaccine development, but to also continue investing in innovative solutions to better the future of health care even when short-term uncertainty exists. I am very pleased today to share our financial guidance for 2021, which reflects these principles. 
But first, let me review our cash position and capital allocation priorities. We generated free flow for the year of $20 billion, surpassing last year's record high. We did benefit by having our fiscal year-end lapse into 2021, as Chris noted, and we are now planning for a payment related to the anticipated final opioid litigation agreement in principle in 2021 versus the previous planned 2020 payment. In terms of our cash position, at the end of 2020, we had approximately $10 billion of net debt, comprised of approximately $25 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $35 billion of debt. 
One element of our business that we're particularly proud of is that despite the challenges that 2020 offered, we maintained our long-term approach to drive growth and value creation across the enterprise. From an innovation standpoint, the development of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine was certainly a top priority throughout the year. Yet, as I said earlier, we continued to make other strategic investments that fortified our pipeline and further enhanced our competitive advantage even during the pandemic. Our level of R&D investment reached an all-time high of $12.1 billion, $800 million more than our 2019 R&D investment. 
On the transaction front, we continue to evaluate opportunities that strategically complement our portfolio and where our scientific expertise or commercial capabilities can create unique value. Over the course of 2020, we invested over $7 billion in such opportunities. As discussed on our third quarter earnings call in October, we acquired Momenta Pharmaceuticals and a lead therapeutic candidate, nipocalimab, which is in Phase II and Phase III clinical development for the treatment of rare autoantibody-driven diseases. We believe nipocalimab encompasses a pipeline and a product opportunity that can treat a broad range of devastating autoantibody-driven diseases. In December, we expanded our retina pipeline by acquiring the rights to Hemera Biosciences' investigational gene therapy, HMR59, a onetime outpatient intravitreal injection to help preserve vision in patients with geographic atrophy, a severe form of age-related macular degeneration where, currently, there are no other approved therapies. 
And as shareholders in Johnson & Johnson have come to expect, we continue to prioritize our dividend by announcing last April a 6.3% increase. This translated in returning $10.5 billion to investors in 2020, approximately 50% of our free cash flow. 
Let's now turn to our full year 2021 guidance. Given our full year 2020 performance in this unprecedented environment and the underlying strength of our broad-based business, we are well positioned to continue delivering long-term value to our stakeholders. We continue to monitor and work with health care systems around the globe as they balance surges in COVID-19 cases with treatment for non-COVID-19 patients. I would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge the tremendous efforts of health care providers around the world that have society in a much better place today with improved treatment protocols and resource allocation compared to the start of the pandemic. 
We are also encouraged by the recent availability of COVID-19 vaccines that will provide added reassurance to people in need of medical procedures. From a macroeconomic perspective, our outlook assumes stabilizing employment levels and a reduction in social restrictions as the year progresses. From a legislative standpoint, we are not assuming significant changes in current tax policy, and consistent with the past 4 years in our Pharmaceuticals business, we expect net price decreases at similar levels. We will continue to focus on providing access to more patients for our innovative products, resulting in growth being volume driven. 
So let's get into the details for full year 2021 guidance for you to consider in updating your models. I'd like to note upfront that our guidance excludes the financial impact from the potential distribution of our COVID-19 vaccine candidate. 
As Alex noted, we remain committed to provide a safe and effective vaccine. Being in the final stages of a robust 45,000-person study, analytics will be completed, and we plan to report out the results by early next week. Therefore, it would be premature to speculate. We will let the science play out. Once we have the data, obtain regulatory authorization and finalize agreements to supply, we will provide financial updates as warranted, likely during our first quarter earnings call in April.  
Starting with sales. We expect adjusted operational sales growth for the full year 2021 of between 8.0% and 9.5%. This adjusted operational sales growth is on a constant-currency basis, reflecting how we manage our business performance. We estimate the negative impact from net acquisitions and divestitures of approximately 50 basis points and, as such, are comfortable with your models reflecting operational sales growth in the range of 7.5% to 9.0% or $88.8 billion to $90.0 billion. 
As you know, we do not predict the impact of currency movement. But for some context, utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.21, there is an estimated positive impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 200 basis points, resulting in an estimated reported sales growth of between 9.5% and 11.0% or 10.3% at the midpoint compared to 2020 or $90.5 billion to $91.7 billion. 
Let's now turn to earnings per share. This slide illustrates the components of our 2021 EPS guidance. Roughly half of our EPS growth is attributed to the robust operational sales growth, and the other half is attributable to strong net income margin improvement driven by expected operating margin improvement of more than 200 basis points versus 2020. The Medical Device COVID-19 recovery and other cost improvement initiatives are planned to more than offset our continued investment to accelerate our business and further strengthen our pipeline of new products for the long term. 
As a reminder, included in our 2021 guidance is the dilution from the recent acquisition of Momenta, negatively impacting EPS by about $0.15 or $0.10 versus 2020.  Considering these items results in adjusted operational EPS in a range of $9.25 to $9.45 or $9.35 at the midpoint, reflecting a 16.4% year-over-year increase. While not predicting the impact of currency movements, assuming recent exchange rates, our reported adjusted EPS would be positively impacted by approximately $0.15 per share, resulting in adjusted reported earnings per share of $9.50 at the midpoint, reflecting growth of 18.3% versus the prior year. 
Continuing with EPS guidance. This slide provides a summary of what I just shared along with some additional P&L items to give you more insight into the drivers of our full year guidance. Beginning with other income and expense, the line on the P&L where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses related to the items such as investments by our Johnson & Johnson Development Corporation, litigation and write-offs. 
As I discussed on previous earnings calls, we will continue to be rigorous regarding portfolio management, but going forward, we will not include the impact of significant divestiture gains in adjusted EPS. Given those considerations, we would be comfortable with your models for 2021 reflecting net other income and expense, excluding special items, as net income ranging from between $600 million and $700 million. 
We continue to actively evaluate external value-creating opportunities, but for purposes of your financial models, we are not assuming any major acquisitions or other major uses of cash at this time. Therefore, we are comfortable with you modeling net interest expense of between $150 million and $250 million. We are also projecting a higher effective tax rate for 2021 in the range of 16.5% to 17.5% or a midpoint of 17% due to beneficial onetime items in 2020 related to the closeout of audits in several jurisdictions that will not repeat in 2021. 
Let me spend a few minutes providing some qualitative context about 2021, although not intended to specifically provide segment or quarterly guidance. Given variability that occurred due primarily to COVID-related dynamics, this slide, while not to scale and meant to be illustrative, offers some perspectives on the quarterly phasing across our businesses. From a sales perspective, as Chris noted earlier, we benefited from additional selling days in 2020 that will not repeat in 2021. That should be applied to both the full year and the fourth quarter for the enterprise and by segment. 
I'll address each segment, starting with Pharmaceuticals, where we anticipate another strong year of above-market growth. Throughout 2020, we saw COVID-19-driven fluctuations, and most pronounced was the first quarter when, as we noted, we benefited from longer script durations. We continue to invest in COVID-19 vaccine development impacting the first quarter while we pursue authorization. For 2021, we expect more balanced quarter-to-quarter growth. Lastly, while we expect to continue to face pricing pressures and the ongoing negative impact of generic and biosimilar competition, we do not expect any significant new generic or biosimilar entrants in 2021. 
Turning to our Medical Device segment. As mentioned earlier, we observed instances of nonemergency procedure postponements late in the fourth quarter, but health care systems continue to meet the needs of both COVID and non-COVID patients resulting in less COVID-19 market disruption as we progressed through 2020. While macro market dynamics such as vaccine deployment, unemployment and health care coverage remain fluid, we are anticipating some moderate procedural disruption to carry into the first quarter but expect continued medical device market improvement throughout 2021 fluctuating by quarter. 
As you heard during our medical device update in November, our core platforms continue to strengthen, driven by enhanced execution and improved cadence of innovation and filling critical portfolio gaps, including and most notably, advancing our future digital surgery offerings. We believe the combination of the expected market recovery and the actions taken to strengthen our device business positions us to drive revenue growth each quarter versus 2020 with some continued headwinds due to COVID-19 tempering growth in the first quarter and the highest growth rate expected in the second quarter, given the significant market disruption realized in the second quarter of 2020. 
Our Consumer Health segment yielded solid performance throughout the pandemic, resulting in above-market growth. But as noted on our third quarter earnings call, that performance is likely to yield negative COVID-related sales comparisons in the first quarter of 2021 primarily in over-the-counter products. We also plan that our continued SKU rationalization program will have a negative impact on sales in the first half of 2021 while we continue progressing our margin expansion. 
For the second half, we would anticipate more normalized growth as consumers return to more typical usage patterns for products in areas like skin health and beauty. Therefore, although not linear, for the full year, we anticipate growing competitively with the markets in which we compete. 
We are confident in the strength of our broad-based business and its underlying fundamentals. We are positioned to deliver meaningful value to all of our stakeholders not just in 2021 but over the long term. Alex and I look forward to addressing your questions. 
So I'm now pleased to turn the call back over to Chris to initiate the Q&A session. Chris?"

Thank you very much for your question. Look, maybe before I answer this -- your question, let me just back up for a higher level and, once again, what I think has been -- just been the tremendous contributions and performance of our 150,000, approximate, associates around the world, 50,000 of whom have been going to work every day in our factories and our laboratories to ensure the products and services could continue to flow to patients and hospital systems around the world, let alone the important work that we're doing on the vaccine. 
Next, I also just think it's very important to reflect on the tremendous impact that COVID-19 has had around the world. You've heard some of the numbers that we've mentioned earlier today, whether it's the almost 100 million cases around the world, let alone 2 million deaths globally or right here in the United States, almost 25 million people and over 400,000 deaths. That's taken a tremendous cost on, certainly, families, individuals, businesses, our economy, I mean just so many different aspects of our life, that all the more important for us to be doing everything we can to make a difference during this pandemic. 
Last but not least, I'm just very proud of the performance that we had, not only in the fourth quarter but throughout 2020. If you look at the various segments, in almost each of our sectors, all of our major platforms, what you saw is us ending the year in a better position than where we started. And that wasn't only for what I would call the near-term financial performance where we saw things like market share gains and position improvements, but also if you look at the investments that we made in research and development, in sales and marketing, preparing for the future, not only 2021 but that and beyond. Again, we think we're well positioned and stronger as we finished the year than even when we began. 
Now getting back to your specific question regarding the breakouts, we're going to have much more information in the coming days. We think it's very important to follow the data, to follow the science. At that time, we think it will be more appropriate to provide you with all of the various cuts of the data that we anticipate having. 
Consistent with the statements that we made from the very beginning, we want to ensure that we've got a very robust program, not only geographically but also by ethnicity, gender as well as a number of other different parameters, all as part of an effort to give us the best possible understanding of the efficacy and safety profile of our vaccine. So stay tuned. As Joe alluded to in his earlier comments and Chris, we expect to have these results in the coming days. And our scientists, Dr. Mathai Mammen, Dr. Paul Stoffels and others will be providing much more detail once we have those results. Thank you."

I think the Phase I and IIa results, particularly those that were recently published, we are hopeful that that's a good precursor to the kind of efficacy and safety that we'll see in the larger population, of course, until we see this final data. We won't know for certain, but look, we remain optimistic and we're going to remain very diligent as we go through this final review.

And right now, we're well on track to do that. 
As Alex alluded to, there's still some fluidity with respect to time lines. And I think what we're seeing happening with a little bit of confusion is people are trying to parse this down into weeks. I think the definitive statement here is that we are very comfortable in meeting our commitments to those respective countries or organizations that I just outlined. 
In terms of financial implications and pricing, as you can imagine, once countries get a chance to see the data, we're in active negotiations for other countries and other organizations, and the volume will impact the selling price. So it's somewhat of a fluid situation. And that's why we're kind of projecting or leading folks to think about the April first quarter earnings call as a good time when many of those pieces will be in place and we can give you some credible information to bank on for the balance of 2021."

And then, I guess, just on earnings strength for next year, '21, Joe. Just I note the 200 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion. It just seems like given the earnings upside relative to consensus estimates, you probably need a margin number that is maybe closer to 300 basis points of year-on-year upside versus 200. So just give us any sense of what's driving margin strength. 
Some of that's Medical Device recovery. I'm sure some of that's pharma strength as well. It would be super helpful just to give us a sense of the earnings momentum into '21."

And again, as we -- just as we try to be very transparent and very thorough in the disclosure that we're releasing, we certainly will plan to follow that course with that trial as well. And yes, we'll get out the information as soon as we can. 
Regarding some of the variants, obviously, we're watching that closely based upon some of the regional, the geographical differences that we've seen. And look, our scientists are already anticipating, as you've heard from some of the other companies, about what are potential scenarios to ensure that we're prepared. But look, I think it starts with taking a look at the data that we currently have, that we should have shortly.

And not to get cute, but the words were actually greater than 200 basis points. So that could gravitate upward. We certainly want to keep the flexibility that we've had even during 2021 and all that uncertainty to continue to invest in innovative ideas that really fortify not just this year but well beyond. 
In terms of some of the programs we have that are improving our operating margins, I'd point you to this Consumer SKU rationalization. That is certainly something that will have an impact on Consumer sales in the first half of the year but again, with this objective of improving profit margins. And that team has done a great job under Thibaut's leadership with respect to improving the margin profile over the last 2 years.  
You may also recall, a few years back, we made significant investments in our supply chain infrastructure. Those -- some of those are starting to pay off in 2021 as well. And then like it or not, we are working differently, and there are efficiencies that correlate to some of this working differently. I'm not suggesting that we found a steady state in terms of the balance between virtual work and work in the office, but there are some efficiencies that are being realized that I think will actually sustain long term as we move forward. So those are some of the factors that are going into our bullish call of above 200 basis points margin improvement."

We have seen that in other programs that we run, so we're hopeful that we'll see it here. 
But we would expect that to play out. We are pleased with not only the antibody response that we saw but also some of the cellular level response that would be in T cells. But again, more information will be available once we have our final results. 
Secondly, more broadly about health care, I do think that -- and we do feel that COVID-19 has had a very profound effect on health care systems, both near term and short -- and longer term. I think in the near term, what we've learned is, frankly, the importance of innovation and science and if you reflect back on where we were just 11 or 12 months ago at the beginning of COVID-19 and where we are now and the number not only of very innovative vaccine candidates but therapeutics and the differences that they made. If you take a look at the way hospital protocols very rapidly and quickly started using data sciences and information to better understand what was going on with patients entering those facilities, how they should be treated, what led to better outcomes, how that's impacted the reduction in morbidity, I think, clearly another example. 
Third, we've seen a rapid expansion in telehealth, and that's in primary care offices but also specialty offices. The way that companies like ours actually communicate and engage and educate physicians and health care systems, we would see that lasting for some time as well. 
And clearly, on the public health side, we think that's also a very important dynamic for us to consider going forward. I mean, I think it's clear from this that the world now has a much better understanding of the importance of well-established, well-funded global public health programs, without which we're at significant risk around the world, whether it's our economies and society, just at a number of different levels. So those are perhaps some of the longer-term trends. 
And last but not least, I'd like to do a -- just a shout-out for the partnership and collaboration that we've seen with -- not only within industry and across industry but also with regulators around the world. And it's certainly our hope that we can take some of that and apply it to other advancements, whether it's cures for cancer, neuroscience, other conditions. If we can take some of those same paradigms and accelerations and apply them there, that would be great news not only for patients, certainly, and health care systems but for the industry as well."

We're going to continue to do what we do best, and that's to innovate. And if I look at our pharmaceutical portfolio, the great performance that they delivered in 2020 was once again met with, for the fourth consecutive year, price decreases overall in the portfolio.

As Joe and, I believe, Chris alluded to earlier in some of their commentary, we would expect to see continued impact certainly in the first quarter of 2021, although the early signs -- we're encouraged by what we're seeing in hospitals' ability to manage through some of the current patient demands. 
There are certainly regions and hospitals around the world, let alone in the United States, where you see a tremendous strain on the systems. But overall, we're seeing hospital volumes decrease no more than about 10% or 15% in areas such -- for example, in the U.K., a couple of other places in Europe. But overall, the resiliency and the ability of the hospital systems that continue with elective surgeries has improved quite significantly. And as you -- as I'm sure you would project, if we look at second quarter in particular, the year-on-year comparison should return. 
As we look at our team's performance and consider 2021, we're actually looking at 2019 as more of a benchmark to -- and to use that as an indicator more of what a baseline or normal would be. But again, we can -- we would expect to continue to see expansion over the course of 2021 and beyond that, again, see a return to a market that was growing in the mid-single digits previously, and we would expect that to continue going forward as well."

It is a competitive category.

With the VELYS approval, can you sort of give us an update on how you're thinking about rolling that out and whether or not those plans change in the current environment? 
And then in Vision Care, there are a couple of different pushes and pulls going on, both in contact lenses as well as in vision surgery. Could you tease that out a little bit as we think about SKU rationalization versus competitive pressures?"

Joanne, regarding VELYS, look, we were very excited about the approval with the FDA. As we were able to share with you during our innovation day with our Medical Device group, if we look at the flexibility, the accuracy, the reduced footprint that it provides the surgeon and surgical teams, we think that it just has tremendous potential. Again, this is a market that is still -- we think, has a significant opportunity for growth in terms of penetration. 
We also think it will be a nice complement to our ATTUNE fixed bearing cementless knee. And remember, we also have plans to expand VELYS significantly beyond just knee replacement but to other areas as well. So when you combine that, we think it will be very competitive. And more importantly, we think it will be a great new option for physicians, for orthopedic surgeons and ultimately, for patients and their families. 
I'm not going to get into all of the launch plans, but what I will tell you is the team has got an aggressive agenda lined up, and they're completing all the other associated testing as we speak. But we look forward to launching that over the course of 2021 and again, expanding our overall position. 
Regarding Vision Care, you're right, there are a lot of dynamics that we certainly saw in the past year in the contact lens market, significant contraction, as well as in the surgery market. We believe that our position overall in the contact lens has continued to strengthen, and we did see improvement as we went quarter-to-quarter and ended the year. And we think we'll be well positioned as we enter 2021. 
We've also made a number of changes regarding our surgical business. We're excited in 2021 about the Tecnis Symfony launch with a depth of focus lens. It's got improved near-term focus. And we have -- also have a Tecnis Synergy IOL, a first-in-class product combining a number of different technologies to really deliver a great range with high contrast. We expect that in '21. So again, we remain very confident and optimistic about the potential overall in our Vision Care business."

Adjusting for that, contact lens did grow. It was worth almost 9 points. And we do view our growth is still competitive versus the market. 
And then on the surgical side, it was actually good. We did see some recovery in the market there. So it's good to see the trend. While we're still declining, it's improving sequentially, and we remain optimistic, including the innovation that Alex mentioned. Thanks, Joanne."

139677,695370007,2181547,"Johnson & Johnson, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2021",2021-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Johnson & Johnson","Executives","Sure, Matt. Thank you very much. Look, we were -- I think it's important to put perhaps some additional perspective on it. If we really go back to 2017, where I believe the growth rate of our Medical Device division was about 1.5 points, and if you look a",553,"Sure, Matt. Thank you very much. Look, we were -- I think it's important to put perhaps some additional perspective on it. If we really go back to 2017, where I believe the growth rate of our Medical Device division was about 1.5 points, and if you look at the expansion as we went through 2019 to where it was growing at almost a 4% rate. And as we've articulated a number of times, our goal is to grow at or faster than the markets where we compete. We believe the markets where we compete overall in surgery and orthopedics and Vision Care and others, cardiovascular are in the 4% to 5% range, and that's the goal for our businesses. 
As we -- of course, with 2019 -- or 2020, excuse me, and the effect of COVID, that had a very significant impact. But again, here, too, if we normalize out our trends for third and fourth quarter, we think that overall, those quarters were pretty consistent, down about 3.5% after you pull everything else out, and will put us on a good rate, as we mentioned earlier, over the course of 2021 and beyond. 
Regarding VELYS, as I mentioned earlier, we think it does offer a number of unique advantages. We think it can enhance the surgeon's ability to really personalize total knee arthroscopy. At the same time, it has certain features that will make it easier for use potentially in the operating room. And again, we think it's going to be a great complement to not only our ATTUNE system but further down the line to our hip procedures and others as well. 
We do feel that the overall knee market will recover in 2021. It will take place over the course of the year as hospitals are able to continue to get their capacity back as patients get increasingly confident. The knee market was perhaps hit more than others just because many of those procedures can be delayed perhaps versus a hip procedure. But we would expect that to return over the course of this year as we see the pandemic dealt with in a more effective way and things hopefully return to a more normal state. And by the way, we think the outlook for that longer term, given some of the pent-up demand that we're likely to see, will be quite significant. 
As you saw in our review back in November, we're very excited about Ottava. We truly think it's going to offer a next-generation digital and robotic surgery. As you just mentioned, the team made great progress over the last 12 months. As we brought the various technologies together, we continue to do the build-outs, and we remain on track with all the time lines that we have previously committed to. 
And we're confident that here too is a market that we think is very -- has very low penetration, less than 5% or 10%, certainly on a global basis, more so in certain categories here in the United States. But whether it's penetration or the ability just to expand those kind of options to surgeons here in the United States around the world, based upon the technology that we'll be bringing, we think it will offer significant upside on the time lines that you just mentioned."

And then what we did was, as we provided guidance throughout the year, we kind of gave you a range of expected impact by quarter based on what our original guidance would have been at the beginning of the year. 
If you look at what we shared in Q4 ahead of this earnings, we'd anticipated that we could be anywhere from down 10% or flat versus our original thinking, which would have contemplated some growth year-over-year plus a 53rd week. If you look at where we landed, we basically landed at the low end of that range given some of the additional softness that the market experienced in the December time frame where procedures were probably down more around that 10% range. So overall, in line with expectations but more towards the low end given some of the surge we saw at the very end.

And again, there were regions around the country where we saw a differential impact. But I think it's fair to say that we were pleased to see the ability of the majority of systems in the United States be able to continue to provide elective procedures even in spite of some of the later surges. 
Where we saw even more significant impacts were in Europe and LatAm during that period. And because of our stronger position in certain places in Europe, that had a differential impact on us. And again -- so as, hopefully, we see improving trends with the virus in Europe over the course of 2021, we would expect to see that return. 
And so regarding your questions on volumes in the back end, look, it's hard to predict based upon where we currently are. As we said earlier, we think the most significant impact this year will be certainly in Q1. As we continue to deal with some of the ongoing surge, we would expect the year-on-year comparisons to change pretty significantly in Q2 and Q3. 
And again, assuming much improved vaccine distribution, better overall control of COVID-19, we would then expect to see volumes come back to more normalized levels as we finish the year. But obviously, there's a lot of moving parts. There's a lot of assumptions, a lot of dynamics that we'll have to watch closely. But our current plans would take those kind of projections into consideration."

A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com, where you can also find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules. Please note that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review the cautionary statement included in today's presentation, which identifies certain risks and factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. In particular, there is uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This means that the results could change at any time, and the contemplated impact of COVID-19 on the company's business results and outlook is the best estimate based on the information available as of today's date. A further description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2020 Form 10-K, along with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures are also available at investor.jnj.com. 
Several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. 
Moving to today's agenda. I will review first quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and the 3 business segments. Joe will provide insights about our cash position, capital allocation deployment and will spend some time on 2021 qualitative commentary and will outline our updated guidance for 2021. The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last up to 75 minutes. Now let's move to the first quarter results. 
Worldwide sales were $22.3 billion for the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 7.9% versus the first quarter of 2020. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 5.5% as currency had a positive impact of 2.4 points. In the U.S., sales increased 3.9%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported growth was 12.2%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 7.3%, with currency positively impacting our reported OUS results by 4.9 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 6% worldwide, 3.9% in the U.S. and 8.2% outside the U.S. 
Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $6.2 billion and diluted earnings per share was $2.32 versus diluted earnings per share of $2.17 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.9 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.59, representing increases of 12.5% and 12.6%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2020. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 8.3%. 
I will now comment on business segment sales performance, highlighting items that build upon the slides you have in front of you. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the first quarter of 2020 and therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation. Beginning with Consumer Health, Worldwide Consumer Health sales totaled $3.5 billion and declined 3.3%, with declines in the U.S. of 7.4% and modest growth of 0.5% outside of the U.S. The consumer health results reflect negative comparisons due to prior year pantry loading and increased COVID-19 demand, particularly in over-the-counter medicines. Excluding the prior year COVID-19 comparison, the Consumer Health segment grew low single digits in the quarter. 
Over-the-counter medicines declined 14.8%. Globally, results were negatively impacted by the prior year comparisons I previously mentioned, coupled with continued impacts of social distancing restrictions resulting in lower cough, cold and flu incidences. Partially offsetting declines were U.S. share gains, primarily in Tylenol, Zyrtec and PEPCID as well as strong performance of NICORETTE outside the U.S. The Skin Health Beauty franchise grew by 2.8%, driven by strong performance outside the U.S. for NEUTROGENA and Avino due to new product innovations and strength in e-commerce. Results were partially offset by U.S. COVID-19-related market contraction in makeup removal wipes. 
Consumers continue to focus on products related to personal health and hygiene, including Oral Care, which grew 4.5% from continued growth of LISTERINE mouthwash due to category growth and strong promotions, partially offset by divestitures. Worldwide growth, excluding divestitures, was approximately 8%. Additionally, the Baby Care franchise grew by 9.5% as a result of strength in Johnson's outside the U.S., primarily in the Latin America and Asia Pacific regions across all categories, coupled with Avino Baby growth in e-commerce globally. 
Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $12.2 billion grew 7.1%, with strength in both the U.S. increasing by 6.4% and OUS with sales increasing by 7.9%. Sales in the quarter included a small contribution in the U.S. from Janssen's COVID-19 vaccine, following its Emergency Use Authorization in February. Our strong portfolio of products and commercial capabilities continues to enable us to deliver strong adjusted operational growth at above market levels with 7 key products realizing double-digit growth in the first quarter. 
Our immunology therapeutic area delivered global sales growth of 5.5%, driven by strong double-digit performance of STELARA and TREMFYA, offset by continued declines in REMICADE due to biosimilar competition. STELARA continued to show strength in all regions growing at 15.4%, driven by increased market growth and share gains. U.S. share increased roughly 4 points in Crohn's Disease and nearly 10 points in ulcerative colitis. STELARA growth was partially offset by an unfavorable comparison to a prior period pricing adjustment in Q1 2020 and an unfavorable comparison to increased sales in Q1 2020, resulting from COVID-19-related longer script durations in the U.S. and Europe. 
TREMFYA grew 37.8%, with strong double-digit growth in both the U.S. and OUS driven by share gains in psoriasis of 2.7 points in the U.S., continued global expansion into new markets and continued penetration into the psoriatic arthritis indication that was approved in 2020. 
Our oncology portfolio delivered another strong quarter with worldwide growth of 14.6%. DARZALEX continued its strong performance, growing 42.2%, driven by share growth across all lines of therapy and increased penetration of the subcutaneous formulation in the U.S. and EU. DARZALEX continues to penetrate the frontline setting, aided by recently approved line extensions that penetrate new patient populations posting nearly 3 points of share growth in Line 1 in the U.S. this quarter. 
ERLEADA continued its global momentum with growth of 79.7% in the quarter, driven by market share and penetration gains, especially in the metastatic indication. 
IMBRUVICA grew 5.6% globally with increased volume growth, driven by our market-leading share and increased persistency as patients extend the duration of therapy. However, this was partially offset by the market contraction due to temporary COVID-19 impacts on new patient starts. Growth was also negatively impacted by onetime items, including the increased demand in Q1 of 2020 related to longer-term script durations in anticipation of pandemic-related restrictions and higher levels of clinical trial volume in the same quarter last year. Excluding the impact of these onetime events, global growth for IMBRUVICA would have been double digits. 
In neuroscience, our paliperidone long-acting portfolio grew 6.9%, driven by market and share growth due to increased new patient starts and strong persistency. Cardiovascular metabolism other declined 4.1% this quarter, driven by continued biosimilar competition for PROCRIT and competitive pressures in INVOKANA, which was partially offset by growth of 11.7% in XARELTO, driven by continued demand and a onetime favorable prior period pricing adjustment in the current quarter, which contributed over half of XARELTO's growth in the quarter. 
Lastly, our total pulmonary hypertension portfolio achieved strong growth of 13.7% with [indiscernible] a of 13.5% and UPTRAVI growth of 20.9%, both driven by market penetration and share gains. 
I'll now turn your attention to the Medical Devices segment. Worldwide Medical Devices sales were $6.6 billion, growing 8%. Growth versus prior year was primarily driven by market recovery from procedures impacted by COVID-19, along with continued momentum driven by commercial initiatives and our recently launched new products that are further enhancing our competitiveness across several areas of the business. Additionally, selling days positively impacted worldwide growth by 190 basis points. We expect the full year impact from selling days, excluding the impact of the 53rd week in 2020, will be minimal. 
While recovery dynamics continue to vary across procedure type and geography, our results reflect continued momentum with 9 of our 11 priority platforms delivering global growth in Q1, with 6 of these delivering double-digit worldwide growth. As you consider regional dynamics, Asia Pacific was the first region to be impacted by COVID-19 and experienced the most significant sales declines in the first quarter last year. Asia Pacific realized strong market recovery, primarily in China, against this low sales base from the prior year. So that, coupled with our commercial efforts to expand into Tier 2 and Tier 3 hospitals in China, resulted in strong double-digit growth in this region. 
COVID-19 remains a dynamic variable in the U.S. However, the market has been resilient and continues to recover, resulting in growth of 5.4% in the U.S. Sales declined in Europe and Latin America where there continues to be a higher level of COVID-19-related mobility restrictions and procedure deferrals. 
Looking at results for each of our platforms. Interventional Solutions delivered another quarter of strong double-digit growth. Electrophysiology grew 25.7% in the quarter, primarily driven by recovery in the market, coupled with the strength of our broad-based portfolio, focus on commercial execution and introduction of new products such as an update to our Carto 3 System and the Carto Prime mapping module, which further enhanced our market position globally. These new product introductions support improved mapping capabilities and reduce ablation times during atrial fibrillation procedures. 
Worldwide orthopedics grew 1.2% versus the prior year with continued COVID-19 impacts on procedure recovery. Worldwide trauma delivered growth of 9.5%, reflecting market recovery and success of our newer product introductions that continue to support our market-leading position in trauma, such as the most comprehensive cannulated compression headless screw system on the market and the RIA 2 system designed for long bone grafts. 
Hips returned to worldwide growth this quarter increasing 3.2%, driven by market recovery and our continued leadership position in the anterior approach and demand for the active stent aided by our other enabling technologies in hip navigation. 
Knees declined 9.9% globally, primarily due to slower market recovery in these more deferrable procedures in addition to some softness stemming from business mix dynamics. We are on track for commercialization of our VELYS robotic-assisted solution for total knee procedures in the U.S. We believe the combination of this launch, along with our differentiated VELYS digital solutions and a 2-knee platform, including cementless offerings, will enhance our portfolio and support improved performance as procedures continue to recover. 
Spine declined 0.6%, reflecting the continued impact of COVID-19 on this market, coupled with some onetime stocking reductions in China resulting from the consolidation to a national distribution model worth about 250 basis points globally. The decline was partially offset by success of recently launched products such as SYMPHONY, CONDUIT and fiber graft as well as partnerships, which further enhance our offerings, such as the [ XPAC ] expandable cage. 
Advanced Surgery grew 14.3% versus prior year with double-digit growth globally in endocutters, biosurgery and energy, primarily from robust growth in Asia, driven by market recovery and market share gains due to new product launches; globalization of our portfolio, including biosurgeries, SURGIFLO Plus thrombin launch in Japan; and commercial investments to expand our coverage in China. 
In General Surgery, wound closure grew 12% globally with growth of 6.6% in the U.S. and 15.7% OUS. Results were driven by recovery in the markets as well as continued strength of our market-leading suture portfolio, including the STRATAFIX Barb Suture family. 
U.S. contact lens growth of 7.2% reflects the strength of our commercial execution and our market-leading ACUVUE portfolio, including the recent launch of ACUVUE Oasis multifocal lenses, which were designed to provide clear vision at all distances. 
Channel inventory increases related to continued COVID-19 volatility and support of this new product launch contributed about 400 basis points to growth. Growth outside the U.S. of 0.9% reflects slower market recovery in Japan and Europe. 
Global Surgical Vision grew 11.2% due to a combination of recovery in both cataract and refractive procedures as well as continued strength of recent product introductions, including TECNIS Toric II and early success of TECNIS Eyhance, driving improved share momentum in both the U.S. and OUS markets. 
Now regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the first quarter of 2021. Please direct your attention to the box section of the schedule. You will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. As reported this morning, our adjusted EPS of $2.59 reflects a reported increase of 12.6% and an operational increase of 8.3%. I'd like to now highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed on the statement of earnings compared to the same quarter last year. 
Cost of products sold improved versus 2020 as a percent of sales due to favorable product mix in the Pharmaceutical business and favorable volume and mix in the Medical Devices business. Additionally, the first quarter 2020 Medical Devices results included the establishment of a COVID-19 inventory reserve, which did not repeat in 2021. 
Selling, marketing and administrative margins improved due to leveraging in the Medical Devices business, resulting from the recovery of sales from the prior year's negative COVID-19 impact. We continue to invest in research and development at competitive levels, investing 14.2% of sales this quarter. This was higher than the first quarter of 2020 by 170 basis points driven by portfolio progression in the Pharmaceutical business. 
The other income and expense line showed net income of $882 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to net income of $679 million in the first quarter of 2020, primarily due to higher acquisition, integration and divestiture-related activity. However, as a reminder, we treat significant divestiture gains as a special item, and these gains are therefore excluded from adjusted earnings. 
Regarding taxes in the quarter. Our effective tax rate increased from 11% in the first quarter of 2020 to 16.6% in the first quarter of 2021. This increase is driven primarily by the impact of onetime items in 2020 that did not repeat. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 16.5% versus 15% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our 10-Q for further details on specific tax matters. 
Let's now look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the first quarter of 2021, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales increased from 35% to 37.1%. The following are the main drivers of change to the adjusted income before tax by segment. Medical Devices margin improved by 640 basis points, driven by inventory reserves recorded in 2020 associated with the impact of COVID-19, which did not repeat in the current quarter, and overall expense leveraging in 2021, resulting from the Medical Devices sales recovery. 
Consumer Health margins improved by 150 basis points, primarily driven by supply chain efficiencies, including the benefit from our SKU rationalization program. Pharmaceutical margins improved by 30 basis points, primarily driven by favorable product mix, partially offset by increased investment in research and development. 
That concludes the sales and P&L highlights for Johnson & Johnson's first quarter. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk."

When we spoke with you this time last year, we updated our full year 2020 outlook with perhaps the highest level of uncertainty Johnson & Johnson had ever faced, much like every ot",1463,"Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. When we spoke with you this time last year, we updated our full year 2020 outlook with perhaps the highest level of uncertainty Johnson & Johnson had ever faced, much like every other company in every other industry. COVID-19 cases were on the rise. Worldwide lockdowns were in effect and most were adapting to new ways of working while maintaining productivity. No one knew how long the pandemic would last, and demand forecasts were ambiguous at best. However, what was crystal clear, what we did know was that the resilience of our business, the strength of our financial position and an unrelenting long-term focus to develop and deliver our life-saving medicines and products to patients and customers around the globe would likely lead to a better future. We are stronger as a business than before the pandemic, and our first quarter 2021 results give us even more confidence in our ability to continue delivering compelling performance in the future. 
Let me begin with our cash position and capital allocation priorities. We ended the first quarter of 2021 with approximately $9 billion of net debt consisting of approximately $25 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $34 billion of debt. While our capital allocation priorities remain intact, the past year has reinforced the importance of managing our business for the long term through a disciplined approach and a focus on investments for innovation to further enhance our competitive positioning. In addition to disproportionately investing competitively in our R&D pipelines, we continue to evaluate and capitalize on acquisition opportunities, when appropriate, to create value over the long term. 
Paying our dividend and increasing it annually remains a key priority. Earlier this morning, we announced that the Board of Directors approved an increase of the quarterly dividend for the 59th consecutive year by 5%. The dividend increase to $1.06 per share per quarter reflects our recent performance, strong financial position and confidence in the future of Johnson & Johnson. An indication that our capital deployment is fortifying the foundation for our future is in part illustrated on this next slide, which details pipeline developments that have occurred since our last call. I'll highlight a few, starting with our Pharmaceutical business. 
First, we received U.S. approval and a positive opinion from the CHMP in the EU for PONVORY in multiple sclerosis, our first NME approval this year. In addition, we completed our BLA filing for [ Citicel ], a BCMA CAR-T for the treatment of multiple myeloma, and we anticipate U.S. approval later this year. 
As you know, we are rigorous in focusing on differentiated transformational medical innovation. Despite showing proof of concept in initial phases of the study, we decided to discontinue the Phase II development of [ test inotuzumab ], an anti-NKG2D monoclonal antibody for Crohn's disease based on insufficient efficacy in the trial. 
Within our Medical Devices portfolio, the FDA granted approval for TECNIS Eyhance, a next-generation intraocular lens. This represents the first significant innovation in monofocal technology in over 20 years. 
Johnson & Johnson Vision also announced a collaboration with Menicon to deliver therapeutic contact lenses that manage the progression of myopia in children. We expect commercialization of this product by the end of 2021 under the brand name ACUVUE Ability, pending Health Authority approval. We are excited to accelerate our entry into this growing and important space for patients while we continue to advance our myopia pipeline. 
As Chris commented to earlier, we are pleased by the enterprise's first quarter results. I'll now provide some insights into how we are thinking about the remainder of 2021. So let's start simply with, we remain confident in our business. Our Pharmaceuticals segment is on track with our expectations. And in 2021, we expect to deliver a tenth consecutive year of operational above-market growth. Importantly, this growth is volume-driven, not dependent on price. You may have noticed that we issued our fifth Annual Janssen U.S. Transparency Report last week. While I'm admittedly biased, this is a very informative read, and you'll not only see the average price for our products declined by nearly 6% in 2020, but how more than $29 billion of rebates and discounts were allocated. 
In Consumer Health, prior year comparisons will be choppy by quarter throughout this year due to the COVID-19 pantry loading and demand surges experienced in 2020. However, we continue to expect to grow with the market for the year in those areas in which we compete, driven by our strong iconic brands that consumers rely on every day. We will also continue to focus on maintaining our enhanced margin profile, driven by our SKU rationalization and investment optimization programs. 
In Medical Devices, better execution, new innovative offerings and market recovery led to growth in the first quarter. However, market variables such as patient willingness to seek care, insurance coverage and unemployment rates, along with the easing of mobility restrictions, will influence the rate of recovery as we progress through the year. Despite those uncertain dynamics, we remain confident in the full year outlook we had in January. 
Let me say a few words related to our COVID-19 vaccine. Our goal has always been to bring our scientific capabilities and resources to develop a safe, effective vaccine that would complement other measures to end the global pandemic. To ensure broad access, we announced early on that we would supply the vaccine on a not-for-profit basis during the crisis period. Given the not-for-profit commitment, as previously stated, we never anticipated COVID-19 vaccine revenue would have a significant upside impact to 2021 adjusted EPS, already projected to grow at 18% or 1.8x greater than sales growth. Paul will say a few words at the conclusion of my remarks on our COVID-19 vaccine. Regarding vaccine financials, please note that we commit to providing timely updates to actual results and guidance as warranted. 
Considering the qualitative factors I just referenced, here's what we expect for the full year 2021. Starting with sales. On an adjusted operational basis, we are increasing our guidance and tightening our range to reflect the ongoing confidence in the business to a range of growth to 8.7% to 9.9%. This adjusted operational sales growth is on a constant currency basis, consistent with how we manage our business performance. We are maintaining our estimate for the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of approximately 50 basis points, resulting in operational sales of $89.3 billion to $90.3 billion or 8.2% to 9.4%. While we don't offer predictions on currency movement, utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.19 results in a still favorable but, to a lesser degree, currency impact of $1.3 billion or a year-over-year increase of 150 basis points, resulting in estimated reported sales in the range of $90.6 billion to $91.6 billion, an increase of 9.7% to 10.9% or 10.3% at that midpoint versus 2020. 
Regarding the balance of the P&L, we are maintaining the guidance we offered in January for all other items for which we routinely provide guidance. We are, however, comfortable tightening our range by raising the lower end, resulting in increasing the midpoint of our adjusted operational EPS by $0.03. Therefore, our new adjusted earnings per share guidance range is $9.30 to $9.45 on a constant currency basis. While not predicting currency movement but to provide some direction on the impact of currency fluctuations on our reported adjusted EPS, the estimated benefit is now $0.12 versus $0.15 for the full year. Accounting for that, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting reported adjusted EPS ranging from $9.42 to $9.57 or a midpoint of $9.50 to a range of 17.3% to 19.2%. We don't provide quarterly guidance, but do appreciate that you find value in us providing some qualitative considerations to keep in mind as you update your models. 
This slide looks rather similar to what we shared in January, with the most noteworthy callout being the negative impact of COVID-19 experienced in the second quarter of 2020, particularly in Medical Devices. It is reasonable to infer that the second quarter of 2021 should have highly favorable comparisons in medical devices. 
Let me close our prepared remarks by acknowledging the Johnson & Johnson colleagues and all they have overcome, but more importantly, accomplished over the last year. Driven by our credo, their unrelenting dedication to continue meeting our commitments to all stakeholders has been inspiring. On behalf of the entire executive team, to all 135,000 employees around the world, thank you. 
Paul, Chris and I are pleased to be joined by Alex and Joaquin to address your questions. But before we begin the Q&A, let me turn the call over to Paul."

And I'm pleased to provide an update on our COVID-19 vaccine and our efforts to address the ongoing pandemic, which today has taken the lives of more than 3 million people globally. 
From the very beginning, we have worked to develop and deliver a single-shot easy-transportable COVID-19 vaccine to help protect the health of people everywhere and reach communities in need globally. We are committed to equitable access and to bringing an affordable COVID-19 vaccine to the public on a not-for-profit basis for the emerging pandemic use. 
In the last quarter, we announced results from our multi-country Phase III ENSEMBLE study that demonstrate the vaccine was 85% effective in preventing severe disease across all regions studied and showed protection against COVID-19-related hospitalization and death beginning day 28 after vaccination. The vaccine has demonstrated protection across all countries studied and with multiple variants of the virus, including the B1.351 variant. Based on the robust data, we submitted to health authorities, we received Emergency Use Authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, a conditional marketing authorization from the European Medicines Agency and emergency use listing from the World Health Organization. We began U.S. distribution in March, with plans to begin shipping to Europe in April. 
In addition, given the threat of variants, we collaborated with the South African Medical Research Council on the [indiscernible] study, an open-labeled Phase IIIb vaccine implementation study among 500,000 frontline health care workers in South Africa, where the B1.351 variant has become dominant and where there is a limited supportive care of -- or wide availability of COVID vaccines. This variant now makes up more than 60% of cases across this African continent and has been detected in more than 60 countries globally. A single-shot vaccine with demonstrated protection against COVID-19-related hospitalization and death can be critical to for fighting the global pandemic, particularly with protection across countries with different variants. 
Last Tuesday, the U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, reviewed the reports of an extremely rare disorder involving blood clots in combination with low platelets observed in a small number of individuals following vaccination with the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine. Out of an abundance of caution, the CDC and FDA recommended a pause in the use of the vaccine in the U.S. ACIP will reconvene this Friday, and we look forward to their review and the outcome of the meeting. 
Johnson & Johnson made the decision to proactively delay the rollout of our vaccine in Europe and pause vaccinations in all COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials while we updated guidance for investigators and participants. The safety and well-being of the people who use our product is our #1 priority, and we strongly support awareness of the signs and symptoms of this extremely rare event to ensure the correct diagnosis, appropriate treatment and report by health care professionals. We continue to believe in the positive benefit-risk profile of our vaccine and in view of the raging pandemic that continues to devastate communities around the world, continue to collaborate with medical experts and global health authorities, including the CDC, FDA, EMA, the WHO and the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority, SAHPRA, as we work towards continuing vaccination to enter global pandemic. 
We welcome the recent recommendation of SAHPRA to lift the pause in the investigator-led collaborative study provided that specific conditions are met. SAHPRA based this decision on a review of the availability -- available safety data from [ SIOC ] study as well as adverse event reports in the United States. We look forward to partnering with the South African Ministry of Health to resume vaccinations of health care workers in South Africa soon. 
We are looking forward to the outcome of from today's meeting of the European Medicines Agency Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee, the PRAC as is called, and are looking forward to working with [ EMA ] to ensure appropriate awareness of this extremely rare event and guidance on diagnosis and treatment of this condition. 
Johnson & Johnson stands ready to resume shipment of its COVID-19 vaccine in Europe. In addition, we will work with member states to resume vaccinations in all Janssen COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials in Europe. We remain committed to supplying 200 million doses of our COVID-19 vaccine to the European Union plus Norway and Iceland. 
Moving on to manufacturing. The quality and safety of our COVID-19 vaccine is paramount. On April 3, we announced we would increase our oversight of drug substance manufacturing at the Emergent Biosolutions Bayview facility. Since then, we have worked closely with the U.S. government and with the FDA, including during the ongoing FDA inspection at Emergent Bayview. We will work closely with Emergent and the FDA to address any inspection findings. 
Our goal remains ensuring all drug substance for COVID-19 vaccine meets a high-quality standard and securing Emergency Use Authorization for the drug substance manufactured at Emergent Bayview. We remain committed to delivering 100 million single shots doses of our COVID-19 vaccine to the U.S. government and helping to bring an end to this global pandemic. 
In conclusion, I want to note that COVID-19 is the most severe global health challenge we have seen in our lifetimes. Johnson & Johnson is committed to help the world win the fight against COVID-19 and be even better prepared for possible future pandemics. 
Now I will turn it over to Chris to start the Q&A."

This is Alex. Why don't I go first? And look, before I respond directly to your question, I just want to give a special shout out to all of our frontline heroes, especially the 50,000 plus-or-minus associates to Johnson & Johnson, who have been consistently going to work, putting on their masks on the supply room floor, on the shop floor, manufacturing and really enabling us to continue to serve patients and consumers around the world throughout this pandemic; to a very special recognition to the doctors, the scientists, the engineers, who have not only been working diligently on our approach to COVID-19, but also to keep our ongoing innovation portfolio on track. And we're very thankful to them. And last but not least, all of our associates who really worked in a very agile, flexible and dedicated way throughout this period. 
I think our results overall today demonstrate that in spite of a lot of variability, unpredictability, the Johnson & Johnson remains a very consistent and, in fact, stronger performer today than we were even a year ago. 
If you look at our competitive position, whether it's market share on all of our major $28 billion-plus platforms, if you look at our pipeline progress and development, we clearly have continued to make progress in spite of a lot of other dynamics. So giving specifically your question on medical device marketplace, we would say is we're seeing continued improvement through the first quarter. 
If we look at the last couple of weeks of March in the United States, most of the major systems were somewhere in the range of 90% to 105% of their performance back in 2019. If we look across Europe, of course, there's a bit more variability. Markets in Italy, for example, have lagged given the outbreak of COVID-19 in the U.K., where you've seen other markets return more in the 90% to 100% range, although we have continued to see month-to-month and even week-to-week progression across those major markets. 
As we alluded to in the earlier comments, we would expect that to begin to change in a pretty significant way in the second quarter, not only as we see more vaccinations, but of course, the year-on-year comparisons. And again, what I'd like to highlight is the strong performance across almost all of our medical device platforms. 
If you take a look at Vision Surgery, up 11%. If you take a look at our EP business, up 26%. Our surgery business was well up into double digits across whether it was energy, biosurgery or into mechanical. Orthopedics, particularly large joints, we saw lag slightly, but we know that these are more elective procedures. We feel we remain competitive, and we're quite excited about our VELYS launch as well as our fixed-bearing cementless options as well. So we remain confident and actually quite optimistic for our ongoing improvement in performance in our Medical Device sector as we head through the remainder of the year. 
Joe, I'll hand it over to you for the question on EPS phasing."

So I'd much rather hold back $0.05 today and hopes of giving $0.10 or $0.15 next year or the year after. And that's really how we're looking at it. As we have many great opportunities and hopefully, you noticed in our P&L, the increase in R&D investment year-over-year by $600 [ million ]. You saw the same trend last year for the full year. We're going to look to see that those opportunities, given we already started the year with very strong expectations.

Look, in Vision Care overall, we think our performance was solid. We have seen the contact lens business in the surgery business be significantly impacted over the course of 2020. We have seen gradual improvement back end of last year and as we started out the first part of this year. We think our Vision Care, our contact loans business is in very good shape. our share position is stable to increasing. And we think we've seen that definitely an improving position in our vision surgery business, part of that being comps, but also part of it due to new innovation launches that were mentioned earlier in Chris and Joe's comment. And we believe that our lineup for new lenses, whether it's our anti-allergy lens or focal in contact lenses and the improvement that we're seeing in our surgery business, will continue to bear out in stronger performance and share gains through the year. 
Regarding Orthopedics, as noted in our comments, we saw a very strong performance, for example, in our trauma growing in excess of 9%. We saw good rollout in our Hip business at about 3.5%. And as I mentioned in my comments, knees, which we think are perhaps most elective of the procedures in terms of being able to delay, were lagging somewhat. But the indicators are that we would expect and based upon some of the surgical planning reports that we saw, especially through the end of first quarter, that looks as though performance for second quarter and third quarter should be on good trends. And we expect that to improve as patients gain confidence to go back into the hospitals and we see systems work their way through backlogs. And of course, in our business, being global, as we see Europe come more back online as well following vaccinations as we move through the second and third quarters."

You have consumer is up about 8% this quarter versus first quarter of 2019. So again, that suggests other strong underlying business. Pharmaceuticals is up about 17.5%, and Medical Devices is approaching 4% on that same comparison. But I would say that's a very strong 4% when you consider we still have, as you heard in our commentary, many delayed procedures or paused elective procedures in the marketplace, which simply didn't exist in the first quarter of 2019. 
So across all 3 parts of our business, I think there's a real good takeaway there that the business is healthy and strong.

Then I'll turn it over to Joaquin and Paul for your other questions. 
With respect to tax reform, we've shared a lot of rhetoric about a race to a bottom. I don't know why folks are anxious to have a race to the top in terms of rates either. And I can give you one example in 1 industry, and that's Johnson & Johnson, where when tax reform was passed in 2017, we committed to increasing our investment in the U.S. by 15% over the upcoming 4 years versus the preceding 4 years. We are on track to actually invest about 25% more in the U.S. over that 4-year period. And that's more than $30 billion. 
Now what does that mean in terms of the U.S. economy? It means more jobs. I mean we -- as Johnson & Johnson employ 3,000 more people today than we did before the passage of the 2017 Act. So I think when you look at where the U.S. sits with respect to OECD countries, right now, we're at the middle of the pack, maybe even skewing a little bit towards the bottom in terms of competitiveness. If we were to raise rates even to 25% and you include tax from states, we become the highest-rated developed country in the world with respect to tax rates. So I think it's something that we need a little more effect dialogue on and making sure that we remain competitive that the U.S. becomes a source of innovation across all industries. And we [ don't floor ] the innovation and competitive spirit that has been successful over the recent times, even in addressing many of the concerns and solutions with respect to COVID-19 we've seen in the past year where many U.S.-based companies have stepped up. Joaquin, let me turn it to you to -- just the other end."

So with regards to pricing reforms in the U.S., that was your question, Louise. So we continue to expect that there will be pressure to do something to reduce patient out-of-pocket costs, and in that context, the industry could potentially be seen again as a pay for in another butter reconciliation package for ACA reform or infrastructure legislation. We believe that the negotiations in that regard could be collaborative and that the overall value, that innovation, it's bringing to society, as highlighted by our contributions in COVID-19, will be understood. So that's the way we see it. 
Now we think that the most important thing in any price bill or any price reform is to be sure that patients experience and reduction in the out-of-pocket costs and Johnson & Johnson will be a constructive partner in that regard. We think that also that patient cost setting should be based on the net price of medicines. And in that sense, we continue to support that type of reform. 
I also want to take a step back and look at our Pharmaceutical business in the context of pricing reform. I believe that the type of portfolio and growth that we have plays out very well in this situation. Our growth has been based on volume. Our net price declined in 2020 5.7%, and this is the fourth consecutive year that we have net price declines. And we are able and ready to grow in that environment based on having a very broad-based portfolio with 11 products of more than $1 billion and an R&D-based model that allow us to have a very differentiated pipeline in the -- in 2020. We invested $9.6 billion in R&D, which is about 2x what we invest in sales and marketing. So we believe that these negotiations could be collaborative that in that context, the Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical business is especially well positioned based on our ability to drive growth based on volume and in our broadly diversified portfolio. 
So about our BCMA CAR-T that we filed the first quarter of 2020, that was an important milestone in our pipeline. Our initial indication, it's going to be for patients with multiple myeloma that have progress on available established therapies. Over time, we see BCMA CAR-T and our BCMA CAR-T specifically progressing into earlier lines of therapy. You could see a moment in which young and feed patients may have CAR-T as a fair line therapy in an intent to build regimens that are curative.

And we're optimistic about the progress that, that team has been making to ensure that we've got a platform that, one, can truly make a difference for patients in surgery; that, two, that's differentiated; and three, that also allows us to integrate not only the robotics aspect, but also the digital component that we think long term can truly help show very significant differences in surgical outcomes. 
And also, just to give you one example of an application. We mentioned this before, but in Johnson & Johnson right now, and I think this exemplifies the unique nature of our diverse portfolio. Several years ago, we embarked on something that we call the lung cancer initiative. And as we know, unfortunately, lung cancer continues to kill more people than just about any other type of cancer. And we know that all too often, patients are diagnosed far too late in the process. And we are quite excited about an early application with Monarch, where we're not only able to go out and potentially do a diagnostic procedure through bronchoscopy to identify, for example, lung nodules, but we're working right now on how can we deliver oncolytic agents, viruses and other immune type agents locally. And how could we really think about the treatment paradigm being shifted in the way that we fundamentally think about lung cancer by combining pharma, medical device, some of these technologies in very new, unique and innovative ways. So still much more work to be done, but we're very excited about some of the early prospects that we've seen thus far. And again, I think it exemplifies kind of our unique position to bring these different clinical development, discovery as well as regulatory capabilities and eventually commercial together."

Look, I'm not going to comment on the safety of the oral JAK inhibitors. What I can tell you is that we have a very strong and robust pipeline in immunology driven by our 3 existing assets, SYMPHONY, STELARA and TREMFYA. STELARA and TREMFYA had very strong quarters with close to 40% growth in TREMFYA and 15% in STELARA. In STELARA, we continue to grow share in GI, both in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. And TREMFYA is the first and only IL-23 that does have both indications, PSA and PSO, and it's continued to gain share in both areas. 
Moving forward, we are excited about our possibilities in immunology with our oral agents. As you mentioned, one, we have 2 in Phase II. One of them is a pan-JAK oral that we think could be important. We'll have to see the data. And broadly in immunology, we also are excited about the possibilities of nipocalimab, which is our FcRn antibody in pathways that are auto antibody mediated with very rare diseases that create a pipeline in a product. So for us, immunology remains a core area of growth and focus, and we believe we are in a very strong position to continue to drive growth in the coming years, but even beyond 2025, too."

Also joining Joe and myself during the Q&A portion of the call will be Alex Gorsky, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer; Joaquin Duato, Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee; and Dr. Paul Stoffels, Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee and Chief Scientific Officer.  
A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com, where you can also find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules. 
Please note that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review the cautionary statement included in today's presentation, which identifies certain risks and factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. In particular, there is uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This means that the results could change at any time, and the contemplated impact of COVID-19 on the company's business results and outlook is the best estimate based on the information available as of today's date. 
A further description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2020 Form 10-K, along with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures are also available at investor.jnj.com.  
Several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships.  
Moving to today's agenda. I will review first quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and the 3 business segments. Joe will provide insights about our cash position, capital allocation deployment and will spend some time on 2021 qualitative commentary and will outline our updated guidance for 2021. 
The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last up to 75 minutes. 
Now let's move to the first quarter results. Worldwide sales were $22.3 billion for the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 7.9% versus the first quarter of 2020. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 5.5% as currency had a positive impact of 2.4 points. 
In the U.S., sales increased to 3.9%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported growth was 12.2%. 
Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 7.3%, with currency positively impacting our reported OUS results by 4.9 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 6% worldwide, 3.9% in the U.S. and 8.2% outside the U.S.  
Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $6.2 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $2.32 versus diluted earnings per share of $2.17 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.9 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.59, representing increases of 12.5% and 12.6%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2020. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 8.3%.  
I will now comment on business segment sales performance, highlighting items that build upon the slides you have in front of you. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the first quarter of 2020 and, therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation. 
Beginning with Consumer Health, Worldwide Consumer Health sales totaled $3.5 billion and declined 3.3%, with declines in the U.S. of 7.4% and modest growth of 0.5% outside of the U.S. The Consumer Health results reflect negative comparisons due to prior year pantry loading and increased COVID-19 demand, particularly in over-the-counter medicines. Excluding the prior year COVID-19 comparison, the Consumer Health segment grew low single digits in the quarter.  
Over-the-counter medicines declined 14.8%. Globally, results were negatively impacted by the prior year comparisons I previously mentioned, coupled with continued impacts of social distancing restrictions resulting in lower cough, cold and flu incidences. Partially offsetting declines were U.S. share gains, primarily in Tylenol, Zyrtec and PEPCID as well as strong performance of Nicorette outside the U.S. 
The skin health/beauty franchise grew by 2.8% driven by strong performance outside the U.S. for NEUTROGENA and AVEENO due to new product innovations and strength in e-commerce. Results were partially offset by U.S. COVID-19-related market contraction in makeup removal wipes.
Consumers continue to focus on products related to personal health and hygiene, including Oral Care, which grew 4.5% from continued growth of LISTERINE mouthwash due to category growth and strong promotions, partially offset by divestitures. Worldwide growth, excluding divestitures, was approximately 8%. Additionally, the Baby Care franchise grew by 9.5% as a result of strength in Johnson's outside the U.S., primarily in the Latin America and Asia Pacific regions across all categories, coupled with AVEENO Baby growth in e-commerce globally.  
Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $12.2 billion grew 7.1%, with strength in both the U.S. increasing by 6.4% and OUS with sales increasing by 7.9%. Sales in the quarter included a small contribution in the U.S. from Janssen's COVID-19 vaccine, following its Emergency Use Authorization in February. 
Our strong portfolio of products and commercial capabilities continues to enable us to deliver strong adjusted operational growth at above-market levels, with 7 key products realizing double-digit growth in the first quarter.  
Our immunology therapeutic area delivered global sales growth of 5.5% driven by strong double-digit performance of STELARA and TREMFYA, offset by continued declines in REMICADE due to biosimilar competition. STELARA continued to show strength in all regions, growing at 15.4%, driven by increased market growth and share gains. U.S. share increased roughly 4 points in Crohn's disease and nearly 10 points in ulcerative colitis. 
STELARA growth was partially offset by an unfavorable comparison to a prior period pricing adjustment in Q1 2020 and an unfavorable comparison to increased sales in Q1 2020, resulting from COVID-19-related longer script durations in the U.S. and Europe.  
TREMFYA grew 37.8%, with strong double-digit growth in both the U.S. and OUS, driven by share gains in psoriasis of 2.7 points in the U.S., continued global expansion into new markets and continued penetration into the psoriatic arthritis indication that was approved in 2020.  
Our oncology portfolio delivered another strong quarter, with worldwide growth of 14.6%. DARZALEX continued its strong performance, growing 42.2%, driven by share growth across all lines of therapy and increased penetration of the subcutaneous formulation in the U.S. and EU. DARZALEX continues to penetrate the frontline setting, aided by recently approved line extensions that penetrate new patient populations, posting nearly 3 points of share growth in Line 1 in the U.S. this quarter.  
ERLEADA continued its global momentum, with growth of 79.7% in the quarter, driven by market share and penetration gains, especially in the metastatic indication.  
IMBRUVICA grew 5.6% globally, with increased volume growth, driven by our market-leading share and increased persistency as patients extend the duration of therapy. However, this was partially offset by the market contraction due to temporary COVID-19 impacts on new patient starts. 
Growth was also negatively impacted by onetime items, including the increased demand in Q1 of 2020 related to longer-term script durations in anticipation of pandemic-related restrictions and higher levels of clinical trial volume in the same quarter last year. Excluding the impact of these onetime events, global growth for IMBRUVICA would have been double digits.  
In neuroscience, our paliperidone long-acting portfolio grew 6.9% driven by market and share growth due to increased new patient starts and strong persistency. Cardiovascular/metabolism/other declined 4.1% this quarter driven by continued biosimilar competition for PROCRIT and competitive pressures in INVOKANA, which was partially offset by growth of 11.7% in XARELTO, driven by continued demand and a onetime favorable prior period pricing adjustment in the current quarter, which contributed over half of XARELTO's growth in the quarter.  
Lastly, our total pulmonary hypertension portfolio achieved strong growth of 13.7%, with OPSUMIT growth of 13.5% and UPTRAVI growth of 20.9%, both driven by market penetration and share gains.  
I'll now turn your attention to the Medical Devices segment. Worldwide Medical Devices sales were $6.6 billion, growing 8%. Growth versus prior year was primarily driven by market recovery from procedures impacted by COVID-19, along with continued momentum driven by commercial initiatives and our recently launched new products that are further enhancing our competitiveness across several areas of the business. 
Additionally, selling days positively impacted worldwide growth by 190 basis points. We expect the full year impact from selling days, excluding the impact of the 53rd week in 2020, will be minimal.  
While recovery dynamics continue to vary across procedure type and geography, our results reflect continued momentum with 9 of our 11 priority platforms delivering global growth in Q1, with 6 of these delivering double-digit worldwide growth. 
As you consider regional dynamics, Asia Pacific was the first region to be impacted by COVID-19 and experienced the most significant sales declines in the first quarter last year. Asia Pacific realized strong market recovery, primarily in China, against this low sales base from the prior year. So that, coupled with our commercial efforts to expand into Tier 2 and Tier 3 hospitals in China, resulted in strong double-digit growth in this region.  
COVID-19 remains a dynamic variable in the U.S. However, the market has been resilient and continues to recover, resulting in growth of 5.4% in the U.S. Sales declined in Europe and Latin America where there continues to be a higher level of COVID-19-related mobility restrictions and procedure deferrals.  
Looking at results for each of our platforms. Interventional Solutions delivered another quarter of strong double-digit growth. Electrophysiology grew 25.7% in the quarter, primarily driven by recovery in the market, coupled with the strength of our broad-based portfolio, focus on commercial execution and introduction of new products, such as an update to our CARTO 3 System and the CARTO PRIME Mapping Module, which further enhanced our market position globally. These new product introductions support improved mapping capabilities and reduce ablation times during atrial fibrillation procedures.  
Worldwide orthopedics grew 1.2% versus the prior year, with continued COVID-19 impacts on procedure recovery. Worldwide trauma delivered growth of 9.5%, reflecting market recovery and success of our newer product introductions that continue to support our market-leading position in trauma, such as the most comprehensive Cannulated Compression Headless Screw system on the market and the RIA 2 system designed for long bone grafts. 
Hips returned to worldwide growth this quarter, increasing 3.2%, driven by market recovery and our continued leadership position in the anterior approach and demand for the ACTIS stem needed by our other enabling technologies in hip navigation.  
Knees declined 9.9% globally primarily due to slower market recovery in these more deferrable procedures, in addition to some softness stemming from business mix dynamics. We are on track for commercialization of our VELYS robotic-assisted solution for total knee procedures in the U.S. We believe the combination of this launch, along with our differentiated VELYS digital solutions and ATTUNE Knee platform, including cementless offerings, will enhance our portfolio and support improved performance as procedures continue to recover.  
Spine declined 0.6%, reflecting the continued impact of COVID-19 on this market, coupled with some onetime stocking reductions in China, resulting from the consolidation to a national distribution model worth about 250 basis points globally. The decline was partially offset by success of recently launched products such as SYMPHONY, CONDUIT and FIBERGRAFT as well as partnerships, which further enhance our offerings, such as the X-Pac expandable cage.  
Advanced Surgery grew 14.3% versus prior year, with double-digit growth globally in endocutters, biosurgery and energy, primarily from robust growth in Asia, driven by market recovery and market share gains due to new product launches; globalization of our portfolio, including biosurgeries, SURGIFLO plus thrombin launch in Japan; and commercial investments to expand our coverage in China.  
In General Surgery, wound closure grew 12% globally, with growth of 6.6% in the U.S. and 15.7% OUS. Results were driven by recovery in the markets as well as continued strength of our market-leading suture portfolio, including the STRATAFIX barbed suture family.  
U.S. contact lens growth of 7.2% reflects the strength of our commercial execution and our market-leading ACUVUE portfolio, including the recent launch of ACUVUE OASYS multifocal lenses, which were designed to provide clear vision at all distances.  
Channel inventory increases related to continued COVID-19 volatility and support of this new product launch contributed about 400 basis points to growth. Growth outside the U.S. of 0.9% reflects slower market recovery in Japan and Europe.  
Global surgical vision grew 11.2% due to a combination of recovery in both cataract and refractive procedures as well as continued strength of recent product introductions, including TECNIS Toric II and early success of TECNIS Eyhance, driving improved share momentum in both the U.S. and OUS markets.  
Now regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the first quarter of 2021. Please direct your attention to the box section of the schedule. You will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. 
As reported this morning, our adjusted EPS of $2.59 reflects a reported increase of 12.6% and an operational increase of 8.3%. 
I'd like to now highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed on the statement of earnings compared to the same quarter last year. Cost of products sold improved versus 2020 as a percent of sales due to favorable product mix in the Pharmaceutical business and favorable volume and mix in the Medical Devices business. Additionally, the first quarter 2020 Medical Devices results included the establishment of a COVID-19 inventory reserve, which did not repeat in 2021.  
Selling, marketing and administrative margins improved due to leveraging in the Medical Devices business, resulting from the recovery of sales from the prior year's negative COVID-19 impact. We continue to invest in research and development at competitive levels, investing 14.2% of sales this quarter. This was higher than the first quarter of 2020 by 170 basis points driven by portfolio progression in the Pharmaceutical business.  
The other income and expense line showed net income of $882 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to net income of $679 million in the first quarter of 2020, primarily due to higher acquisition, integration and divestiture-related activity. However, as a reminder, we treat significant divestiture gains as a special item, and these gains are therefore excluded from adjusted earnings.  
Regarding taxes in the quarter. Our effective tax rate increased from 11% in the first quarter of 2020 to 16.6% in the first quarter of 2021. This increase is driven primarily by the impact of onetime items in 2020 that did not repeat. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 16.5% versus 15% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our 10-Q for further details on specific tax matters.  
Let's now look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the first quarter of 2021, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales increased from 35% to 37.1%. 
The following are the main drivers of change to the adjusted income before tax by segment. Medical Devices margin improved by 640 basis points driven by inventory reserves recorded in 2020, associated with the impact of COVID-19, which did not repeat in the current quarter, and overall expense leveraging in 2021 resulting from the Medical Devices sales recovery.  
Consumer Health margins improved by 150 basis points primarily driven by supply chain efficiencies, including the benefit from our SKU rationalization program. 
Pharmaceutical margins improved by 30 basis points primarily driven by favorable product mix, partially offset by increased investment in research and development.  
That concludes the sales and P&L highlights for Johnson & Johnson's first quarter. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk."
139677,695370700,2253888,"Johnson & Johnson, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2021",2021-04-20,"Earnings Calls","Johnson & Johnson","Executives","Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. When we spoke with you this time last year, we updated our full year 2020 outlook with perhaps the highest level of uncertainty Johnson & Johnson had ever faced, much like every ot",1459,"Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. When we spoke with you this time last year, we updated our full year 2020 outlook with perhaps the highest level of uncertainty Johnson & Johnson had ever faced, much like every other company in every other industry. 
COVID-19 cases were on the rise, worldwide lockdowns were in effect, and most were adapting to new ways of working while maintaining productivity. No one knew how long the pandemic would last, and demand forecasts were ambiguous at best. 
However, what was crystal clear, what we did know was that the resilience of our business, the strength of our financial position and an unrelenting long-term focus to develop and deliver our life-saving medicines and products to patients and customers around the globe would likely lead to a better future. We are stronger as a business than before the pandemic, and our first quarter 2021 results give us even more confidence in our ability to continue delivering compelling performance in the future.  
Let me begin with our cash position and capital allocation priorities. We ended the first quarter of 2021 with approximately $9 billion of net debt, consisting of approximately $25 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $34 billion of debt. While our capital allocation priorities remain intact, the past year has reinforced the importance of managing our business for the long term through a disciplined approach and a focus on investments for innovation to further enhance our competitive positioning. 
In addition to disproportionately investing competitively in our R&D pipelines, we continue to evaluate and capitalize on acquisition opportunities, when appropriate, to create value over the long term.  
Paying our dividend and increasing it annually remains a key priority. Earlier this morning, we announced that the Board of Directors approved an increase of the quarterly dividend for the 59th consecutive year by 5%. The dividend increase to $1.06 per share per quarter reflects our recent performance, strong financial position and confidence in the future of Johnson & Johnson. 
An indication that our capital deployment is fortifying the foundation for our future is in part illustrated on this next slide, which details pipeline developments that have occurred since our last call. I'll highlight a few, starting with our Pharmaceutical business.  
First, we received the U.S. approval and a positive opinion from the CHMP in the EU for Ponvory in multiple sclerosis, our first NME approval this year. In addition, we completed our BLA filing for Cilta-cel, a BCMA CAR-T for the treatment of multiple myeloma, and we anticipate U.S. approval later this year.  
As you know, we are rigorous in focusing on differentiated transformational medical innovation. Despite showing proof of concept in initial phases of the study, we decided to discontinue the Phase II development of tesnatilimab, an anti-NKG2D monoclonal antibody for Crohn's disease based on insufficient efficacy in the trial.  
Within our Medical Devices portfolio, the FDA granted approval for TECNIS Eyhance, a next-generation intraocular lens. This represents the first significant innovation in monofocal technology in over 20 years.  
Johnson & Johnson Vision also announced a collaboration with Menicon to deliver therapeutic contact lenses that manage the progression of myopia in children. We expect commercialization of this product by the end of 2021 under the brand name ACUVUE Ability, pending health authority approval. We are excited to accelerate our entry into this growing and important space for patients, while we continue to advance our myopia pipeline.  
As Chris commented, too, earlier, we are pleased by the enterprise's first quarter results. I'll now provide some insights into how we are thinking about the remainder of 2021. So let's start simply with, we remain confident in our business. 
Our Pharmaceuticals segment is on track with our expectations. And in 2021, we expect to deliver a 10th consecutive year of operational above-market growth. Importantly, this growth is volume-driven, not dependent on price. 
You may have noticed that we issued our fifth Annual Janssen U.S. Transparency Report last week. While I'm admittedly biased, this is a very informative read, and you'll not only see the average price for our products declined by nearly 6% in 2020, but how more than $29 billion of rebates and discounts were allocated.  
In Consumer Health, prior year comparisons will be choppy by quarter throughout this year due to the COVID-19 pantry loading and demand surges experienced in 2020. However, we continue to expect to grow with the market for the year in those areas in which we compete, driven by our strong iconic brands that consumers rely on every day. 
We will also continue to focus on maintaining our enhanced margin profile driven by our SKU rationalization and investment optimization programs.  
In Medical Devices, better execution, new innovative offerings and market recovery led to growth in the first quarter. However, market variables such as patient willingness to seek care, insurance coverage and unemployment rates, along with the easing of mobility restrictions, will influence the rate of recovery as we progress through the year. Despite those uncertain dynamics, we remain confident in the full year outlook we had in January.  
Let me say a few words related to our COVID-19 vaccine. Our goal has always been to bring our scientific capabilities and resources to develop a safe, effective vaccine that would complement other measures to end the global pandemic. To ensure broad access, we announced early on that we would supply the vaccine on a not-for-profit basis during the crisis period. Given the not-for-profit commitment, as previously stated, we never anticipated COVID-19 vaccine revenue would have a significant upside impact to 2021 adjusted EPS already projected to grow at 18% or 1.8x greater than sales growth. 
Paul will say a few words at the conclusion of my remarks on our COVID-19 vaccine. Regarding vaccine financials, please note that we commit to providing timely updates to actual results and guidance as warranted.  
Considering the qualitative factors I just referenced, here's what we expect for the full year 2021. Starting with sales, on an adjusted operational basis, we are increasing our guidance and tightening our range to reflect the ongoing confidence in the business to a range of growth to 8.7% to 9.9%. This adjusted operational sales growth is on a constant currency basis, consistent with how we manage our business performance. 
We are maintaining our estimate for the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of approximately 50 basis points, resulting in operational sales of $89.3 billion to $90.3 billion or 8.2% to 9.4%. 
While we don't offer predictions on currency movement, utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at $1.19 results in a still favorable but, to a lesser degree, currency impact of $1.3 billion or a year-over-year increase of 150 basis points, resulting in estimated reported sales in the range of $90.6 billion to $91.6 billion, an increase of 9.7% to 10.9% or 10.3% at that midpoint versus 2020.  
Regarding the balance of the P&L, we are maintaining the guidance we offered in January for all other items for which we routinely provide guidance. We are, however, comfortable tightening our range by raising the lower end, resulting in increasing the midpoint of our adjusted operational EPS by $0.03. Therefore, our new adjusted earnings per share guidance range is $9.30 to $9.45 on a constant currency basis. 
While not predicting currency movement, but to provide some direction on the impact of currency fluctuations on our reported adjusted EPS, the estimated benefit is now $0.12 versus $0.15 for the full year. Accounting for that, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting reported adjusted EPS ranging from $9.42 to $9.57, or a midpoint of $9.50 to a range of 17.3% to 19.2%. We don't provide quarterly guidance, but do appreciate that you find value in us providing some qualitative considerations to keep in mind as you update your models.  
This slide looks rather similar to what we shared in January, with the most noteworthy callout being the negative impact of COVID-19 experienced in the second quarter of 2020, particularly in Medical Devices. It is reasonable to infer that the second quarter of 2021 should have highly favorable comparisons in Medical Devices. 
Let me close our prepared remarks by acknowledging the Johnson & Johnson colleagues and all they have overcome but, more importantly, accomplished over the last year. Driven by our credo, their unrelenting dedication to continue meeting our commitments to all stakeholders has been inspiring. On behalf of the entire executive team, to all 135,000 employees around the world, thank you. 
Paul, Chris and I are pleased to be joined by Alex and Joaquin to address your questions. But before we begin the Q&A, let me turn the call over to Paul."

From the very beginning, we have worked to develop and",911,"Thank you, Joe, and I'm pleased to provide an update on our COVID-19 vaccine and our efforts to address the ongoing pandemic, which today has taken the lives of more than 3 million people globally. 
From the very beginning, we have worked to develop and deliver a single shot, easy transportable COVID-19 vaccine to help protect the health of people everywhere and reach communities in need globally. We are committed to equitable access and to bringing an affordable COVID-19 vaccine to the public on a not-for-profit basis for the emerging pandemic use. 
In the last quarter, we announced results from our multi-country Phase III ENSEMBLE study that demonstrate the vaccine was 85% effective in preventing severe disease across all regions studied and showed protection against COVID-19-related hospitalization and death beginning day 28 after vaccination. The vaccine has demonstrated protection across all countries studied and with multiple variants of the virus, including the B.1.351 variant. Based on the robust data we submitted to health authorities, we received Emergency Use Authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, a conditional marketing authorization from the European Medicines Agency and Emergency Use Listing from the World Health Organization. We began U.S. distribution in March, with plans to begin shipping to Europe in April. 
In addition, given the threat of variants, we collaborated with the South African Medical Research Council on the Sisonke study, an open-labeled Phase IIIb vaccine implementation study among 500,000 frontline health care workers in South Africa, where the B.1.351 variant has become dominant and where there is limited supportive care of -- or wide availability of COVID vaccines. 
This variant now makes up more than 60% of cases across this African continent and has been detected in more than 60 countries globally. A single shot vaccine with demonstrated protection against COVID-19-related hospitalization and death can be critical to for fighting the global pandemic, particularly with protection across countries with different variants. 
Last Tuesday, the U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, reviewed the reports of an extremely rare disorder involving blood clots in combination with low platelets observed in a small number of individuals following vaccination with the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine. Out of an abundance of caution, the CDC and FDA recommended a pause in the use of our vaccine in the U.S. ACIP will reconvene this Friday, and we look forward to their review and the outcome of the meeting. 
Johnson & Johnson made the decision to proactively delay the rollout of our vaccine in Europe and pause vaccinations in all COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials, while we updated guidance for investigators and participants. The safety and well-being of the people who use our product is our #1 priority, and we strongly support awareness of the signs and symptoms of this extremely rare event to ensure the correct diagnosis, appropriate treatment and expedited report by health care professionals. 
We continue to believe in the positive benefit-risk profile of our vaccine and in view of the raging pandemic that continues to devastate communities around the world, continue to collaborate with medical experts and global health authorities, including the CDC, FDA, EMA, the WHO and the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority, SAHPRA, as we work towards continuing vaccination to end the global pandemic. 
We welcome the recent recommendation of SAHPRA to lift the pause in the investigator-led collaborative Sisonke study, provided that specific conditions are met. SAHPRA based this decision on a review of the availability -- available safety data from Sisonke study as well as adverse event reports in the United States. We look forward to partnering with the South African Ministry of Health to resume vaccinations of health care workers in South Africa soon. 
We are looking forward to the outcome of from today's meeting of the European Medicines Agency Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee, the PRAC as it is called, and are looking forward to working with EMA to ensure appropriate awareness of this extremely rare event and guidance on diagnosis and treatment of this condition. 
Johnson & Johnson stands ready to resume shipment of its COVID-19 vaccine in Europe. In addition, we will work with member states to resume vaccinations in all Janssen COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials in Europe. We remain committed to supplying 200 million doses of our COVID-19 vaccine to the European Union, plus Norway and Iceland. 
Moving on to manufacturing. The quality and safety of our COVID-19 vaccine is paramount. On April 3, we announced we would increase our oversight of drug substance manufacturing at the Emergent BioSolutions Bayview facility. Since then, we have worked closely with U.S. government and with the FDA, including during the ongoing FDA inspection at Emergent Bayview. We will work closely with Emergent and the FDA to address any inspection findings. 
Our goal remains ensuring all drug substance for our COVID-19 vaccine meets a high-quality standard and securing Emergency Use Authorization for the drug substance manufactured at Emergent Bayview. We remain committed to delivering 100 million single shots doses of our COVID-19 vaccine to the U.S. government and helping to bring an end to this global pandemic. 
In conclusion, I want to note that COVID-19 is the most severe global health challenge we have seen in our lifetimes. Johnson & Johnson is committed to help the world win the fight against COVID-19 and be even better prepared for possible future pandemics. 
Now I will turn it over to Chris to start the Q&A."

This is Alex. Why don't I go first? And look, before I respond directly to your question, I just want to give a special shout out to all of our frontline heroes, especially the 50,000 plus-or-minus associates",520,"Larry, thank you very much for your question. This is Alex. Why don't I go first? And look, before I respond directly to your question, I just want to give a special shout out to all of our frontline heroes, especially the 50,000 plus-or-minus associates of Johnson & Johnson who have been consistently going to work, putting on their masks on the supply room floor, on the shop floor, manufacturing and really enabling us to continue to serve patients and consumers around the world throughout this pandemic; two, a very special recognition to the doctors, the scientists, the engineers, who have not only been working diligently on our approach to COVID-19, but also to keep our ongoing innovation portfolio on track, and we're very thankful to them; and last but not least, all of our associates who really worked in a very agile, flexible and dedicated way throughout this period. 
I think our results overall today demonstrate that in spite of a lot of variability, unpredictability, the Johnson & Johnson remained a very consistent and, in fact, stronger performer today than we were even a year ago. If you look at our competitive position, whether it's market share on all of our major $28 billion-plus platforms, if you look at our pipeline progress and development, we clearly have continued to make progress, in spite of a lot of other dynamics. 
So getting specifically to your question on Medical Device marketplace, what we would say is we're seeing continued improvement through the first quarter. If we look at the last couple of weeks of March in the United States, most of the major systems were somewhere in the range of 90% to 105% of their performance back in 2019. 
If we look across Europe, of course, there's a bit more variability. Markets in Italy, for example, have lagged given the outbreak of COVID-19; in the U.K., where you've seen other markets return more in the 90% to 100% range, although we have continued to see month-to-month and even week-to-week progression across those major markets. 
As was alluded to in the earlier comments, we would expect that to begin to change in a pretty significant way in the second quarter, not only as we see more vaccinations but, of course, the year-on-year comparisons. And again, what I'd like to highlight is the strong performance across almost all of our Medical Device platforms. 
If you take a look at Vision Surgery, up 11%; if you take a look at our EP business, up 26%; our surgery business was well up into double digits across whether it was energy, biosurgery or into mechanical. Orthopedics, particularly large joints, we saw lag slightly, but we know that these are more elective procedures. We feel we remain competitive, and we're quite excited about our VELYS launch as well as our fixed bearing cementless options as well. 
So we remain confident and actually quite optimistic for our ongoing improvement in performance in our Medical Device sector as we head through the remainder of the year. 
Joe, I'll hand it over to you for the question on EPS phasing."

And as usual, you have all the numbers at the ready there, so I think I got them all down. But I think the real short story here is that I would say on 10% sales growth, we're going to grow earnings about 18%. 
And so given the early nature of the year, we challenged our leadership teams in each of our segments and across our functions to see what we can invest today to benefit the future. So I'd much rather hold back $0.05 today in hopes of giving $0.10 or $0.15 next year or the year after, and that's really how we're looking at it. 
As we have many great opportunities and hopefully, you noticed in our P&L, the increase in R&D investment year-over-year by $600 billion. You saw the same trend last year for the full year. We're going to look to see that those opportunities, given we already started the year with very strong expectations, if some of those opportunities don't come to fruition, we'll certainly be happy to revise guidance upward later on this year.

We have seen gradual improvement in the back end of last year and as we started out the first part of this year. 
We think our Vision Care, our contact lens business is in very good shape. We think our share position is stable to increasing, and we think we've seen that definitely an improving position in our vision surgery business, part of that being comps, but also part of it due to new innovation launches that were mentioned earlier in Chris and Joe's comment. 
And we believe that our lineup for new lenses, whether it's our anti-allergy lens or multifocal in contact lenses, in the improvement that we're seeing in our surgery business will continue to bear out in stronger performance and in share gains through the year. 
Regarding Orthopedics, as noted in our comments, we saw very strong performance, for example, in our trauma business growing in excess of 9%. We saw good rollout in our hip business at about 3.5%. And as I mentioned in my comments, knees, which we think are perhaps the most elective of the procedures in terms of being able to delay, were lagging somewhat. 
But the indicators are that we would expect and based upon some of the surgical planning reports that we saw, especially through the end of first quarter, that it looks as though performance for second quarter and third quarter should be on good trends. And we would expect that to improve as patients gain confidence to go back into the hospitals, and we see systems work their way through backlogs. And of course, in our business, being global, as we see Europe come more back online as well following vaccinations as we move through the second and third quarters. Thank you."

And I think this is going to be a choppy year, so we have to look selectively at year-on-year comps. And if you just look at, let's call, what was a normal quarter, at least as we knew it, back in the first quarter of 2019, you look at our respective businesses. You have Consumer is up about 8% this quarter versus first quarter of 2019. So again, that suggests other strong underlying business. 
Pharmaceuticals is up about 17.5%, and Medical Devices is approaching 4% on that same comparison, but I would say that's a very strong 4% when you consider we still have, as you heard in our commentary, many delayed procedures or paused elective procedures in the marketplace, which simply didn't exist in the first quarter of 2019. 
So across all 3 parts of our business, I think there's a real good takeaway there that the business is healthy and strong. You couple that with the investment we continue to make in R&D at elevated levels, I would hope folks feel really good about not just our performance of today, but our future performance on the horizon."

Then I'll turn it over to Joaquin and Paul for your other questions. 
With respect to tax reform, we've shared a lot of rhetoric about a race to a bottom. I don't know why folks are anxious to have a race to the top in terms of rates either, and I can give you 1 example in 1 industry, and that's Johnson & Johnson, where when tax reform was passed in 2017, we committed to increasing our investment in the U.S. by 15% over the upcoming 4 years versus the preceding 4 years. 
We are on track to actually invest about 25% more in the U.S. over that 4-year period, and that's more than $30 billion. Now what does that mean in terms of the U.S. economy? It means more jobs. I mean, we -- as Johnson & Johnson employ 3,000 more people today than we did before the passage of the 2017 Act. 
So I think when you look at where the U.S. sits with respect to OECD countries, right now, we're at the middle of the pack, maybe even skewing a little bit towards the bottom in terms of competitiveness. If we were to raise rates even to 25% and you include tax from states, we become the highest-rated developed country in the world with respect to tax rates. 
So I think it's something that we need a little more fact-based dialogue on and making sure that we remain competitive that the U.S. becomes a source of innovation across all industries, and we don't floor the innovation and competitive spirit that has been successful over the recent times, even in addressing many of the concerns and solutions with respect to COVID-19 we've seen in the past year, where many U.S.-based companies have stepped up. 
Joaquin, let me turn it to you to address the other items."

So with regards to pricing reforms in the U.S., that was your question, Louise, so we continue to expect that there will be pressure to do something to reduce patient out-of-pocket costs. And in that context, the industry could potentially be seen again as a favor in another budget reconciliation package for ACA reform or infrastructure legislation. 
We believe that the negotiations in that regard could be collaborative and that the overall value, that innovation it's bringing to society, as highlighted by our contributions in COVID-19, will be understood. So that's the way we see it. 
Now we think that the most important thing in any price bill or any price reform is to be sure that patients experience a reduction in the out-of-pocket costs, and Johnson & Johnson will be a constructive partner in that regard. We think that also that patient cost setting should be based on the net price of medicines. And in that sense, we continue to support that type of reform. 
I also want to take a step back and look at our Pharmaceutical business in the context of pricing reform. I believe that the type of portfolio and growth that we have plays out very well in this situation. 
Our growth has been based on volume. Our net price declined in 2020, 5.7%, and this is the fourth consecutive year that we have net price declines. And we are able and ready to grow in that environment based on having a very broad-based portfolio, with 11 products of more than $1 billion and an R&D-based model that allow us to have a very differentiated pipeline in the -- in 2020. We invested $9.6 billion in R&D, which is about 2x what we invest in sales and marketing. 
So we believe that these negotiations could be collaborative, and that in that context, the Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical business is especially well positioned based on our ability to drive growth based on volume and in our very broadly diversified portfolio. 
So about our BCMA CAR-T that we filed in the first quarter of 2020, that was an important milestone in our pipeline. Our initial indication, it's going to be for patients with multiple myeloma that have progressed on available established therapies. Over time, we see BCMA CAR-T and our BCMA CAR-T specifically progressing into earlier lines of therapy. You could see a moment in which young, healthy patients may have BCMA CAR-T as a third-line therapy in an intent to build regimens that are curative.

I mean, we remain very committed and optimistic about the underlying unmet need and demand across our surgical portfolio, our Orthopedics portfolio and our Vision Care portfolio. 
But as we alluded to earlier, there are some procedures that in terms of your ability to defer and how electable they truly are that may have a near-term impact on timing. So look, overall, if we look at our underlying trends, not only versus 2020, but as was noted earlier, also versus 2019, we're seeing growth rates consistent overall with what we see for this market. 
We think this market has the opportunity to grow at about the 5% range over the long term. And we've been very explicit in our goal to grow at or faster than the markets where we compete. That's number one. 
Number two, we're actually very excited about some of the opportunities that we have for launches. I think, in total, we have more than 21 major launches lined up in our Medical Device business for this year. We mentioned specifically in the knee area, VELYS as well as ATTUNE, cementless fixed bearing, which we think will offer us a real competitive opportunity to generate additional growth in that area. The QDOT MICRO is another great add-on in our EP business that is already growing in excess of 20%. And if you look across our endo-mec, our energy business, here, too, we've got really nice add-on innovations as well as throughout our Vision Care portfolio.

And so we think if you consider the overall trends of how technology can be utilized in some of these procedures, if you take a look at our global footprint, we think we will be well positioned there in the long term. 
As you mentioned, our team has continued to make good progress. We said from the very beginning, look, we're building this for the decades. We're not just building this for the next quarter. And we're optimistic about the progress that, that team has been making to ensure that we've got a platform that, one, can truly make a difference for patients in surgery; that, two, that's differentiated; and three, that also allows us to integrate not only the robotics aspect, but also the digital component that we think, long term, can truly help show very significant differences in surgical outcomes. 
And also just to give you one example of an application. We mentioned this before, but in Johnson & Johnson right now, I think this exemplifies the unique nature of our diverse portfolio. Several years ago, we embarked on something that we call the lung cancer initiative. As we know, unfortunately, lung cancer continues to kill more people than just about any other type of cancer. And we know that, all too often, patients are diagnosed far too late in the process. And we are quite excited about an early application with Monarch, where we're not only able to go out and potentially do a diagnostic procedure through bronchoscopy to identify, for example, lung nodules, but we're working right now on how can we deliver oncolytic agents, viruses and other immune type agents locally, and how could we really think about the treatment paradigm being shifted in the way that we fundamentally think about lung cancer by combining Pharma, Medical Device, some of these technologies in very new, unique and innovative ways. 
So still much more work to be done, but we're very excited about some of the early prospects that we've seen thus far. And again, I think it exemplifies kind of our unique position to bring these different clinical development, discovery as well as regulatory capabilities and eventually commercial together."

This is Chris DelOrefice, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our company's review of business results for the first quarter and our updated financial outlook for 2021.  Joining me on today's call is Joe",2679,"Good morning. This is Chris DelOrefice, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our company's review of business results for the first quarter and our updated financial outlook for 2021.  
Joining me on today's call is Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining Joe and myself during the Q&A portion of the call will be Alex Gorsky, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer; Joaquin Duato, Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee; and Dr. Paul Stoffels, Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee and Chief Scientific Officer.  
A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com, where you can also find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules. 
Please note that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review the cautionary statement included in today's presentation, which identifies certain risks and factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. In particular, there is uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This means that the results could change at any time, and the contemplated impact of COVID-19 on the company's business results and outlook is the best estimate based on the information available as of today's date. 
A further description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2020 Form 10-K, along with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures are also available at investor.jnj.com.  
Several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships.  
Moving to today's agenda. I will review first quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and the 3 business segments. Joe will provide insights about our cash position, capital allocation deployment and will spend some time on 2021 qualitative commentary and will outline our updated guidance for 2021. 
The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last up to 75 minutes. 
Now let's move to the first quarter results. Worldwide sales were $22.3 billion for the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 7.9% versus the first quarter of 2020. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 5.5% as currency had a positive impact of 2.4 points. 
In the U.S., sales increased to 3.9%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported growth was 12.2%. 
Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 7.3%, with currency positively impacting our reported OUS results by 4.9 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 6% worldwide, 3.9% in the U.S. and 8.2% outside the U.S.  
Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $6.2 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $2.32 versus diluted earnings per share of $2.17 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.9 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.59, representing increases of 12.5% and 12.6%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2020. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 8.3%.  
I will now comment on business segment sales performance, highlighting items that build upon the slides you have in front of you. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the first quarter of 2020 and, therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation. 
Beginning with Consumer Health, Worldwide Consumer Health sales totaled $3.5 billion and declined 3.3%, with declines in the U.S. of 7.4% and modest growth of 0.5% outside of the U.S. The Consumer Health results reflect negative comparisons due to prior year pantry loading and increased COVID-19 demand, particularly in over-the-counter medicines. Excluding the prior year COVID-19 comparison, the Consumer Health segment grew low single digits in the quarter.  
Over-the-counter medicines declined 14.8%. Globally, results were negatively impacted by the prior year comparisons I previously mentioned, coupled with continued impacts of social distancing restrictions resulting in lower cough, cold and flu incidences. Partially offsetting declines were U.S. share gains, primarily in Tylenol, Zyrtec and PEPCID as well as strong performance of Nicorette outside the U.S. 
The skin health/beauty franchise grew by 2.8% driven by strong performance outside the U.S. for NEUTROGENA and AVEENO due to new product innovations and strength in e-commerce. Results were partially offset by U.S. COVID-19-related market contraction in makeup removal wipes.
Consumers continue to focus on products related to personal health and hygiene, including Oral Care, which grew 4.5% from continued growth of LISTERINE mouthwash due to category growth and strong promotions, partially offset by divestitures. Worldwide growth, excluding divestitures, was approximately 8%. Additionally, the Baby Care franchise grew by 9.5% as a result of strength in Johnson's outside the U.S., primarily in the Latin America and Asia Pacific regions across all categories, coupled with AVEENO Baby growth in e-commerce globally.  
Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $12.2 billion grew 7.1%, with strength in both the U.S. increasing by 6.4% and OUS with sales increasing by 7.9%. Sales in the quarter included a small contribution in the U.S. from Janssen's COVID-19 vaccine, following its Emergency Use Authorization in February. 
Our strong portfolio of products and commercial capabilities continues to enable us to deliver strong adjusted operational growth at above-market levels, with 7 key products realizing double-digit growth in the first quarter.  
Our immunology therapeutic area delivered global sales growth of 5.5% driven by strong double-digit performance of STELARA and TREMFYA, offset by continued declines in REMICADE due to biosimilar competition. STELARA continued to show strength in all regions, growing at 15.4%, driven by increased market growth and share gains. U.S. share increased roughly 4 points in Crohn's disease and nearly 10 points in ulcerative colitis. 
STELARA growth was partially offset by an unfavorable comparison to a prior period pricing adjustment in Q1 2020 and an unfavorable comparison to increased sales in Q1 2020, resulting from COVID-19-related longer script durations in the U.S. and Europe.  
TREMFYA grew 37.8%, with strong double-digit growth in both the U.S. and OUS, driven by share gains in psoriasis of 2.7 points in the U.S., continued global expansion into new markets and continued penetration into the psoriatic arthritis indication that was approved in 2020.  
Our oncology portfolio delivered another strong quarter, with worldwide growth of 14.6%. DARZALEX continued its strong performance, growing 42.2%, driven by share growth across all lines of therapy and increased penetration of the subcutaneous formulation in the U.S. and EU. DARZALEX continues to penetrate the frontline setting, aided by recently approved line extensions that penetrate new patient populations, posting nearly 3 points of share growth in Line 1 in the U.S. this quarter.  
ERLEADA continued its global momentum, with growth of 79.7% in the quarter, driven by market share and penetration gains, especially in the metastatic indication.  
IMBRUVICA grew 5.6% globally, with increased volume growth, driven by our market-leading share and increased persistency as patients extend the duration of therapy. However, this was partially offset by the market contraction due to temporary COVID-19 impacts on new patient starts. 
Growth was also negatively impacted by onetime items, including the increased demand in Q1 of 2020 related to longer-term script durations in anticipation of pandemic-related restrictions and higher levels of clinical trial volume in the same quarter last year. Excluding the impact of these onetime events, global growth for IMBRUVICA would have been double digits.  
In neuroscience, our paliperidone long-acting portfolio grew 6.9% driven by market and share growth due to increased new patient starts and strong persistency. Cardiovascular/metabolism/other declined 4.1% this quarter driven by continued biosimilar competition for PROCRIT and competitive pressures in INVOKANA, which was partially offset by growth of 11.7% in XARELTO, driven by continued demand and a onetime favorable prior period pricing adjustment in the current quarter, which contributed over half of XARELTO's growth in the quarter.  
Lastly, our total pulmonary hypertension portfolio achieved strong growth of 13.7%, with OPSUMIT growth of 13.5% and UPTRAVI growth of 20.9%, both driven by market penetration and share gains.  
I'll now turn your attention to the Medical Devices segment. Worldwide Medical Devices sales were $6.6 billion, growing 8%. Growth versus prior year was primarily driven by market recovery from procedures impacted by COVID-19, along with continued momentum driven by commercial initiatives and our recently launched new products that are further enhancing our competitiveness across several areas of the business. 
Additionally, selling days positively impacted worldwide growth by 190 basis points. We expect the full year impact from selling days, excluding the impact of the 53rd week in 2020, will be minimal.  
While recovery dynamics continue to vary across procedure type and geography, our results reflect continued momentum with 9 of our 11 priority platforms delivering global growth in Q1, with 6 of these delivering double-digit worldwide growth. 
As you consider regional dynamics, Asia Pacific was the first region to be impacted by COVID-19 and experienced the most significant sales declines in the first quarter last year. Asia Pacific realized strong market recovery, primarily in China, against this low sales base from the prior year. So that, coupled with our commercial efforts to expand into Tier 2 and Tier 3 hospitals in China, resulted in strong double-digit growth in this region.  
COVID-19 remains a dynamic variable in the U.S. However, the market has been resilient and continues to recover, resulting in growth of 5.4% in the U.S. Sales declined in Europe and Latin America where there continues to be a higher level of COVID-19-related mobility restrictions and procedure deferrals.  
Looking at results for each of our platforms. Interventional Solutions delivered another quarter of strong double-digit growth. Electrophysiology grew 25.7% in the quarter, primarily driven by recovery in the market, coupled with the strength of our broad-based portfolio, focus on commercial execution and introduction of new products, such as an update to our CARTO 3 System and the CARTO PRIME Mapping Module, which further enhanced our market position globally. These new product introductions support improved mapping capabilities and reduce ablation times during atrial fibrillation procedures.  
Worldwide orthopedics grew 1.2% versus the prior year, with continued COVID-19 impacts on procedure recovery. Worldwide trauma delivered growth of 9.5%, reflecting market recovery and success of our newer product introductions that continue to support our market-leading position in trauma, such as the most comprehensive Cannulated Compression Headless Screw system on the market and the RIA 2 system designed for long bone grafts. 
Hips returned to worldwide growth this quarter, increasing 3.2%, driven by market recovery and our continued leadership position in the anterior approach and demand for the ACTIS stem needed by our other enabling technologies in hip navigation.  
Knees declined 9.9% globally primarily due to slower market recovery in these more deferrable procedures, in addition to some softness stemming from business mix dynamics. We are on track for commercialization of our VELYS robotic-assisted solution for total knee procedures in the U.S. We believe the combination of this launch, along with our differentiated VELYS digital solutions and ATTUNE Knee platform, including cementless offerings, will enhance our portfolio and support improved performance as procedures continue to recover.  
Spine declined 0.6%, reflecting the continued impact of COVID-19 on this market, coupled with some onetime stocking reductions in China, resulting from the consolidation to a national distribution model worth about 250 basis points globally. The decline was partially offset by success of recently launched products such as SYMPHONY, CONDUIT and FIBERGRAFT as well as partnerships, which further enhance our offerings, such as the X-Pac expandable cage.  
Advanced Surgery grew 14.3% versus prior year, with double-digit growth globally in endocutters, biosurgery and energy, primarily from robust growth in Asia, driven by market recovery and market share gains due to new product launches; globalization of our portfolio, including biosurgeries, SURGIFLO plus thrombin launch in Japan; and commercial investments to expand our coverage in China.  
In General Surgery, wound closure grew 12% globally, with growth of 6.6% in the U.S. and 15.7% OUS. Results were driven by recovery in the markets as well as continued strength of our market-leading suture portfolio, including the STRATAFIX barbed suture family.  
U.S. contact lens growth of 7.2% reflects the strength of our commercial execution and our market-leading ACUVUE portfolio, including the recent launch of ACUVUE OASYS multifocal lenses, which were designed to provide clear vision at all distances.  
Channel inventory increases related to continued COVID-19 volatility and support of this new product launch contributed about 400 basis points to growth. Growth outside the U.S. of 0.9% reflects slower market recovery in Japan and Europe.  
Global surgical vision grew 11.2% due to a combination of recovery in both cataract and refractive procedures as well as continued strength of recent product introductions, including TECNIS Toric II and early success of TECNIS Eyhance, driving improved share momentum in both the U.S. and OUS markets.  
Now regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the first quarter of 2021. Please direct your attention to the box section of the schedule. You will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. 
As reported this morning, our adjusted EPS of $2.59 reflects a reported increase of 12.6% and an operational increase of 8.3%. 
I'd like to now highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed on the statement of earnings compared to the same quarter last year. Cost of products sold improved versus 2020 as a percent of sales due to favorable product mix in the Pharmaceutical business and favorable volume and mix in the Medical Devices business. Additionally, the first quarter 2020 Medical Devices results included the establishment of a COVID-19 inventory reserve, which did not repeat in 2021.  
Selling, marketing and administrative margins improved due to leveraging in the Medical Devices business, resulting from the recovery of sales from the prior year's negative COVID-19 impact. We continue to invest in research and development at competitive levels, investing 14.2% of sales this quarter. This was higher than the first quarter of 2020 by 170 basis points driven by portfolio progression in the Pharmaceutical business.  
The other income and expense line showed net income of $882 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to net income of $679 million in the first quarter of 2020, primarily due to higher acquisition, integration and divestiture-related activity. However, as a reminder, we treat significant divestiture gains as a special item, and these gains are therefore excluded from adjusted earnings.  
Regarding taxes in the quarter. Our effective tax rate increased from 11% in the first quarter of 2020 to 16.6% in the first quarter of 2021. This increase is driven primarily by the impact of onetime items in 2020 that did not repeat. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 16.5% versus 15% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our 10-Q for further details on specific tax matters.  
Let's now look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the first quarter of 2021, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales increased from 35% to 37.1%. 
The following are the main drivers of change to the adjusted income before tax by segment. Medical Devices margin improved by 640 basis points driven by inventory reserves recorded in 2020, associated with the impact of COVID-19, which did not repeat in the current quarter, and overall expense leveraging in 2021 resulting from the Medical Devices sales recovery.  
Consumer Health margins improved by 150 basis points primarily driven by supply chain efficiencies, including the benefit from our SKU rationalization program. 
Pharmaceutical margins improved by 30 basis points primarily driven by favorable product mix, partially offset by increased investment in research and development.  
That concludes the sales and P&L highlights for Johnson & Johnson's first quarter. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. When we spoke with you this time last year, we updated our full year 2020 outlook with perhaps the highest level of uncertainty Johnson & Johnson had ever faced, much like every ot",1459,"Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. When we spoke with you this time last year, we updated our full year 2020 outlook with perhaps the highest level of uncertainty Johnson & Johnson had ever faced, much like every other company in every other industry. 
COVID-19 cases were on the rise, worldwide lockdowns were in effect, and most were adapting to new ways of working while maintaining productivity. No one knew how long the pandemic would last, and demand forecasts were ambiguous at best. 
However, what was crystal clear, what we did know was that the resilience of our business, the strength of our financial position and an unrelenting long-term focus to develop and deliver our life-saving medicines and products to patients and customers around the globe would likely lead to a better future. We are stronger as a business than before the pandemic, and our first quarter 2021 results give us even more confidence in our ability to continue delivering compelling performance in the future.  
Let me begin with our cash position and capital allocation priorities. We ended the first quarter of 2021 with approximately $9 billion of net debt, consisting of approximately $25 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $34 billion of debt. While our capital allocation priorities remain intact, the past year has reinforced the importance of managing our business for the long term through a disciplined approach and a focus on investments for innovation to further enhance our competitive positioning. 
In addition to disproportionately investing competitively in our R&D pipelines, we continue to evaluate and capitalize on acquisition opportunities, when appropriate, to create value over the long term.  
Paying our dividend and increasing it annually remains a key priority. Earlier this morning, we announced that the Board of Directors approved an increase of the quarterly dividend for the 59th consecutive year by 5%. The dividend increase to $1.06 per share per quarter reflects our recent performance, strong financial position and confidence in the future of Johnson & Johnson. 
An indication that our capital deployment is fortifying the foundation for our future is in part illustrated on this next slide, which details pipeline developments that have occurred since our last call. I'll highlight a few, starting with our Pharmaceutical business.  
First, we received the U.S. approval and a positive opinion from the CHMP in the EU for Ponvory in multiple sclerosis, our first NME approval this year. In addition, we completed our BLA filing for Cilta-cel, a BCMA CAR-T for the treatment of multiple myeloma, and we anticipate U.S. approval later this year.  
As you know, we are rigorous in focusing on differentiated transformational medical innovation. Despite showing proof of concept in initial phases of the study, we decided to discontinue the Phase II development of tesnatilimab, an anti-NKG2D monoclonal antibody for Crohn's disease based on insufficient efficacy in the trial.  
Within our Medical Devices portfolio, the FDA granted approval for TECNIS Eyhance, a next-generation intraocular lens. This represents the first significant innovation in monofocal technology in over 20 years.  
Johnson & Johnson Vision also announced a collaboration with Menicon to deliver therapeutic contact lenses that manage the progression of myopia in children. We expect commercialization of this product by the end of 2021 under the brand name ACUVUE Ability, pending health authority approval. We are excited to accelerate our entry into this growing and important space for patients, while we continue to advance our myopia pipeline.  
As Chris commented, too, earlier, we are pleased by the enterprise's first quarter results. I'll now provide some insights into how we are thinking about the remainder of 2021. So let's start simply with, we remain confident in our business. 
Our Pharmaceuticals segment is on track with our expectations. And in 2021, we expect to deliver a 10th consecutive year of operational above-market growth. Importantly, this growth is volume-driven, not dependent on price. 
You may have noticed that we issued our fifth Annual Janssen U.S. Transparency Report last week. While I'm admittedly biased, this is a very informative read, and you'll not only see the average price for our products declined by nearly 6% in 2020, but how more than $29 billion of rebates and discounts were allocated.  
In Consumer Health, prior year comparisons will be choppy by quarter throughout this year due to the COVID-19 pantry loading and demand surges experienced in 2020. However, we continue to expect to grow with the market for the year in those areas in which we compete, driven by our strong iconic brands that consumers rely on every day. 
We will also continue to focus on maintaining our enhanced margin profile driven by our SKU rationalization and investment optimization programs.  
In Medical Devices, better execution, new innovative offerings and market recovery led to growth in the first quarter. However, market variables such as patient willingness to seek care, insurance coverage and unemployment rates, along with the easing of mobility restrictions, will influence the rate of recovery as we progress through the year. Despite those uncertain dynamics, we remain confident in the full year outlook we had in January.  
Let me say a few words related to our COVID-19 vaccine. Our goal has always been to bring our scientific capabilities and resources to develop a safe, effective vaccine that would complement other measures to end the global pandemic. To ensure broad access, we announced early on that we would supply the vaccine on a not-for-profit basis during the crisis period. Given the not-for-profit commitment, as previously stated, we never anticipated COVID-19 vaccine revenue would have a significant upside impact to 2021 adjusted EPS already projected to grow at 18% or 1.8x greater than sales growth. 
Paul will say a few words at the conclusion of my remarks on our COVID-19 vaccine. Regarding vaccine financials, please note that we commit to providing timely updates to actual results and guidance as warranted.  
Considering the qualitative factors I just referenced, here's what we expect for the full year 2021. Starting with sales, on an adjusted operational basis, we are increasing our guidance and tightening our range to reflect the ongoing confidence in the business to a range of growth to 8.7% to 9.9%. This adjusted operational sales growth is on a constant currency basis, consistent with how we manage our business performance. 
We are maintaining our estimate for the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of approximately 50 basis points, resulting in operational sales of $89.3 billion to $90.3 billion or 8.2% to 9.4%. 
While we don't offer predictions on currency movement, utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at $1.19 results in a still favorable but, to a lesser degree, currency impact of $1.3 billion or a year-over-year increase of 150 basis points, resulting in estimated reported sales in the range of $90.6 billion to $91.6 billion, an increase of 9.7% to 10.9% or 10.3% at that midpoint versus 2020.  
Regarding the balance of the P&L, we are maintaining the guidance we offered in January for all other items for which we routinely provide guidance. We are, however, comfortable tightening our range by raising the lower end, resulting in increasing the midpoint of our adjusted operational EPS by $0.03. Therefore, our new adjusted earnings per share guidance range is $9.30 to $9.45 on a constant currency basis. 
While not predicting currency movement, but to provide some direction on the impact of currency fluctuations on our reported adjusted EPS, the estimated benefit is now $0.12 versus $0.15 for the full year. Accounting for that, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting reported adjusted EPS ranging from $9.42 to $9.57, or a midpoint of $9.50 to a range of 17.3% to 19.2%. We don't provide quarterly guidance, but do appreciate that you find value in us providing some qualitative considerations to keep in mind as you update your models.  
This slide looks rather similar to what we shared in January, with the most noteworthy callout being the negative impact of COVID-19 experienced in the second quarter of 2020, particularly in Medical Devices. It is reasonable to infer that the second quarter of 2021 should have highly favorable comparisons in Medical Devices. 
Let me close our prepared remarks by acknowledging the Johnson & Johnson colleagues and all they have overcome but, more importantly, accomplished over the last year. Driven by our credo, their unrelenting dedication to continue meeting our commitments to all stakeholders has been inspiring. On behalf of the entire executive team, to all 135,000 employees around the world, thank you. 
Paul, Chris and I are pleased to be joined by Alex and Joaquin to address your questions. But before we begin the Q&A, let me turn the call over to Paul."
139677,695370700,2254075,"Johnson & Johnson, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2021",2021-04-20,"Earnings Calls","Johnson & Johnson","Executives","Thank you, Joe, and I'm pleased to provide an update on our COVID-19 vaccine and our efforts to address the ongoing pandemic, which today has taken the lives of more than 3 million people globally. From the very beginning, we have worked to develop and",911,"Thank you, Joe, and I'm pleased to provide an update on our COVID-19 vaccine and our efforts to address the ongoing pandemic, which today has taken the lives of more than 3 million people globally. 
From the very beginning, we have worked to develop and deliver a single shot, easy transportable COVID-19 vaccine to help protect the health of people everywhere and reach communities in need globally. We are committed to equitable access and to bringing an affordable COVID-19 vaccine to the public on a not-for-profit basis for the emerging pandemic use. 
In the last quarter, we announced results from our multi-country Phase III ENSEMBLE study that demonstrate the vaccine was 85% effective in preventing severe disease across all regions studied and showed protection against COVID-19-related hospitalization and death beginning day 28 after vaccination. The vaccine has demonstrated protection across all countries studied and with multiple variants of the virus, including the B.1.351 variant. Based on the robust data we submitted to health authorities, we received Emergency Use Authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, a conditional marketing authorization from the European Medicines Agency and Emergency Use Listing from the World Health Organization. We began U.S. distribution in March, with plans to begin shipping to Europe in April. 
In addition, given the threat of variants, we collaborated with the South African Medical Research Council on the Sisonke study, an open-labeled Phase IIIb vaccine implementation study among 500,000 frontline health care workers in South Africa, where the B.1.351 variant has become dominant and where there is limited supportive care of -- or wide availability of COVID vaccines. 
This variant now makes up more than 60% of cases across this African continent and has been detected in more than 60 countries globally. A single shot vaccine with demonstrated protection against COVID-19-related hospitalization and death can be critical to for fighting the global pandemic, particularly with protection across countries with different variants. 
Last Tuesday, the U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, reviewed the reports of an extremely rare disorder involving blood clots in combination with low platelets observed in a small number of individuals following vaccination with the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine. Out of an abundance of caution, the CDC and FDA recommended a pause in the use of our vaccine in the U.S. ACIP will reconvene this Friday, and we look forward to their review and the outcome of the meeting. 
Johnson & Johnson made the decision to proactively delay the rollout of our vaccine in Europe and pause vaccinations in all COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials, while we updated guidance for investigators and participants. The safety and well-being of the people who use our product is our #1 priority, and we strongly support awareness of the signs and symptoms of this extremely rare event to ensure the correct diagnosis, appropriate treatment and expedited report by health care professionals. 
We continue to believe in the positive benefit-risk profile of our vaccine and in view of the raging pandemic that continues to devastate communities around the world, continue to collaborate with medical experts and global health authorities, including the CDC, FDA, EMA, the WHO and the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority, SAHPRA, as we work towards continuing vaccination to end the global pandemic. 
We welcome the recent recommendation of SAHPRA to lift the pause in the investigator-led collaborative Sisonke study, provided that specific conditions are met. SAHPRA based this decision on a review of the availability -- available safety data from Sisonke study as well as adverse event reports in the United States. We look forward to partnering with the South African Ministry of Health to resume vaccinations of health care workers in South Africa soon. 
We are looking forward to the outcome of from today's meeting of the European Medicines Agency Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee, the PRAC as it is called, and are looking forward to working with EMA to ensure appropriate awareness of this extremely rare event and guidance on diagnosis and treatment of this condition. 
Johnson & Johnson stands ready to resume shipment of its COVID-19 vaccine in Europe. In addition, we will work with member states to resume vaccinations in all Janssen COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials in Europe. We remain committed to supplying 200 million doses of our COVID-19 vaccine to the European Union, plus Norway and Iceland. 
Moving on to manufacturing. The quality and safety of our COVID-19 vaccine is paramount. On April 3, we announced we would increase our oversight of drug substance manufacturing at the Emergent BioSolutions Bayview facility. Since then, we have worked closely with U.S. government and with the FDA, including during the ongoing FDA inspection at Emergent Bayview. We will work closely with Emergent and the FDA to address any inspection findings. 
Our goal remains ensuring all drug substance for our COVID-19 vaccine meets a high-quality standard and securing Emergency Use Authorization for the drug substance manufactured at Emergent Bayview. We remain committed to delivering 100 million single shots doses of our COVID-19 vaccine to the U.S. government and helping to bring an end to this global pandemic. 
In conclusion, I want to note that COVID-19 is the most severe global health challenge we have seen in our lifetimes. Johnson & Johnson is committed to help the world win the fight against COVID-19 and be even better prepared for possible future pandemics. 
Now I will turn it over to Chris to start the Q&A."

If I could just slip another quick one on vaccines in there. I just want to make sure I'm clear as well. On the guidance for 2021, are there vaccine sales beyond Q1 reflected in that guidance? Or just given some of the uncertainty, has that not been included in the updated guidance?"

And look, before I respond directly to your question, I just want to give a special shout out to all of our frontline heroes, especially the 50,000 plus-or-minus associates",520,"Larry, thank you very much for your question. This is Alex. Why don't I go first? And look, before I respond directly to your question, I just want to give a special shout out to all of our frontline heroes, especially the 50,000 plus-or-minus associates of Johnson & Johnson who have been consistently going to work, putting on their masks on the supply room floor, on the shop floor, manufacturing and really enabling us to continue to serve patients and consumers around the world throughout this pandemic; two, a very special recognition to the doctors, the scientists, the engineers, who have not only been working diligently on our approach to COVID-19, but also to keep our ongoing innovation portfolio on track, and we're very thankful to them; and last but not least, all of our associates who really worked in a very agile, flexible and dedicated way throughout this period. 
I think our results overall today demonstrate that in spite of a lot of variability, unpredictability, the Johnson & Johnson remained a very consistent and, in fact, stronger performer today than we were even a year ago. If you look at our competitive position, whether it's market share on all of our major $28 billion-plus platforms, if you look at our pipeline progress and development, we clearly have continued to make progress, in spite of a lot of other dynamics. 
So getting specifically to your question on Medical Device marketplace, what we would say is we're seeing continued improvement through the first quarter. If we look at the last couple of weeks of March in the United States, most of the major systems were somewhere in the range of 90% to 105% of their performance back in 2019. 
If we look across Europe, of course, there's a bit more variability. Markets in Italy, for example, have lagged given the outbreak of COVID-19; in the U.K., where you've seen other markets return more in the 90% to 100% range, although we have continued to see month-to-month and even week-to-week progression across those major markets. 
As was alluded to in the earlier comments, we would expect that to begin to change in a pretty significant way in the second quarter, not only as we see more vaccinations but, of course, the year-on-year comparisons. And again, what I'd like to highlight is the strong performance across almost all of our Medical Device platforms. 
If you take a look at Vision Surgery, up 11%; if you take a look at our EP business, up 26%; our surgery business was well up into double digits across whether it was energy, biosurgery or into mechanical. Orthopedics, particularly large joints, we saw lag slightly, but we know that these are more elective procedures. We feel we remain competitive, and we're quite excited about our VELYS launch as well as our fixed bearing cementless options as well. 
So we remain confident and actually quite optimistic for our ongoing improvement in performance in our Medical Device sector as we head through the remainder of the year. 
Joe, I'll hand it over to you for the question on EPS phasing."

And as usual, you have all the numbers at the ready there, so I think I got them all down. But I think the real short story here is that I would say on 10% sales growth, we're going to grow earnings about 18%. 
And so given the early nature of the year, we challenged our leadership teams in each of our segments and across our functions to see what we can invest today to benefit the future. So I'd much rather hold back $0.05 today in hopes of giving $0.10 or $0.15 next year or the year after, and that's really how we're looking at it. 
As we have many great opportunities and hopefully, you noticed in our P&L, the increase in R&D investment year-over-year by $600 billion. You saw the same trend last year for the full year. We're going to look to see that those opportunities, given we already started the year with very strong expectations, if some of those opportunities don't come to fruition, we'll certainly be happy to revise guidance upward later on this year.

We have seen gradual improvement in the back end of last year and as we started out the first part of this year. 
We think our Vision Care, our contact lens business is in very good shape. We think our share position is stable to increasing, and we think we've seen that definitely an improving position in our vision surgery business, part of that being comps, but also part of it due to new innovation launches that were mentioned earlier in Chris and Joe's comment. 
And we believe that our lineup for new lenses, whether it's our anti-allergy lens or multifocal in contact lenses, in the improvement that we're seeing in our surgery business will continue to bear out in stronger performance and in share gains through the year. 
Regarding Orthopedics, as noted in our comments, we saw very strong performance, for example, in our trauma business growing in excess of 9%. We saw good rollout in our hip business at about 3.5%. And as I mentioned in my comments, knees, which we think are perhaps the most elective of the procedures in terms of being able to delay, were lagging somewhat. 
But the indicators are that we would expect and based upon some of the surgical planning reports that we saw, especially through the end of first quarter, that it looks as though performance for second quarter and third quarter should be on good trends. And we would expect that to improve as patients gain confidence to go back into the hospitals, and we see systems work their way through backlogs. And of course, in our business, being global, as we see Europe come more back online as well following vaccinations as we move through the second and third quarters. Thank you."

Pharmaceuticals is up about 17.5%, and Medical Devices is approaching 4% on that same comparison, but I would say that's a very strong 4% when you consider we still have, as you heard in our commentary, many delayed procedures or paused elective procedures in the marketplace, which simply didn't exist in the first quarter of 2019. 
So across all 3 parts of our business, I think there's a real good takeaway there that the business is healthy and strong. You couple that with the investment we continue to make in R&D at elevated levels, I would hope folks feel really good about not just our performance of today, but our future performance on the horizon."

Then I'll turn it over to Joaquin and Paul for your other questions. 
With respect to tax reform, we've shared a lot of rhetoric about a race to a bottom. I don't know why folks are anxious to have a race to the top in terms of rates either, and I can give you 1 example in 1 industry, and that's Johnson & Johnson, where when tax reform was passed in 2017, we committed to increasing our investment in the U.S. by 15% over the upcoming 4 years versus the preceding 4 years. 
We are on track to actually invest about 25% more in the U.S. over that 4-year period, and that's more than $30 billion. Now what does that mean in terms of the U.S. economy? It means more jobs. I mean, we -- as Johnson & Johnson employ 3,000 more people today than we did before the passage of the 2017 Act. 
So I think when you look at where the U.S. sits with respect to OECD countries, right now, we're at the middle of the pack, maybe even skewing a little bit towards the bottom in terms of competitiveness. If we were to raise rates even to 25% and you include tax from states, we become the highest-rated developed country in the world with respect to tax rates. 
So I think it's something that we need a little more fact-based dialogue on and making sure that we remain competitive that the U.S. becomes a source of innovation across all industries, and we don't floor the innovation and competitive spirit that has been successful over the recent times, even in addressing many of the concerns and solutions with respect to COVID-19 we've seen in the past year, where many U.S.-based companies have stepped up. 
Joaquin, let me turn it to you to address the other items."

So with regards to pricing reforms in the U.S., that was your question, Louise, so we continue to expect that there will be pressure to do something to reduce patient out-of-pocket costs. And in that context, the industry could potentially be seen again as a favor in another budget reconciliation package for ACA reform or infrastructure legislation. 
We believe that the negotiations in that regard could be collaborative and that the overall value, that innovation it's bringing to society, as highlighted by our contributions in COVID-19, will be understood. So that's the way we see it. 
Now we think that the most important thing in any price bill or any price reform is to be sure that patients experience a reduction in the out-of-pocket costs, and Johnson & Johnson will be a constructive partner in that regard. We think that also that patient cost setting should be based on the net price of medicines. And in that sense, we continue to support that type of reform. 
I also want to take a step back and look at our Pharmaceutical business in the context of pricing reform. I believe that the type of portfolio and growth that we have plays out very well in this situation. 
Our growth has been based on volume. Our net price declined in 2020, 5.7%, and this is the fourth consecutive year that we have net price declines. And we are able and ready to grow in that environment based on having a very broad-based portfolio, with 11 products of more than $1 billion and an R&D-based model that allow us to have a very differentiated pipeline in the -- in 2020. We invested $9.6 billion in R&D, which is about 2x what we invest in sales and marketing. 
So we believe that these negotiations could be collaborative, and that in that context, the Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical business is especially well positioned based on our ability to drive growth based on volume and in our very broadly diversified portfolio. 
So about our BCMA CAR-T that we filed in the first quarter of 2020, that was an important milestone in our pipeline. Our initial indication, it's going to be for patients with multiple myeloma that have progressed on available established therapies. Over time, we see BCMA CAR-T and our BCMA CAR-T specifically progressing into earlier lines of therapy. You could see a moment in which young, healthy patients may have BCMA CAR-T as a third-line therapy in an intent to build regimens that are curative.

It's almost in line with where we were pre-pandemic, so that's a positive sign, although the situation, of course, remains fluid. And then many important procedures, such as colorectal, again, sequentially improved through the quarter and actually grew year-over-year. 
So again, we're seeing positive signs across. And I think you saw that in our results and pockets of our businesses, as Advanced Surgery, for example, growing over 14%. So we're continuing to look at everything. The situation remains fluid, but there's definitely positive signs on the trends that we're seeing.

Look, Matt, overall, I wouldn't read too much into just these recent results regarding a significant shift overall in our portfolio. I mean, we remain very committed and optimistic about the underlying unmet need and demand across our surgical portfolio, our Orthopedics portfolio and our Vision Care portfolio. 
But as we alluded to earlier, there are some procedures that in terms of your ability to defer and how electable they truly are that may have a near-term impact on timing. So look, overall, if we look at our underlying trends, not only versus 2020, but as was noted earlier, also versus 2019, we're seeing growth rates consistent overall with what we see for this market. 
We think this market has the opportunity to grow at about the 5% range over the long term. And we've been very explicit in our goal to grow at or faster than the markets where we compete. That's number one. 
Number two, we're actually very excited about some of the opportunities that we have for launches. I think, in total, we have more than 21 major launches lined up in our Medical Device business for this year. We mentioned specifically in the knee area, VELYS as well as ATTUNE, cementless fixed bearing, which we think will offer us a real competitive opportunity to generate additional growth in that area. The QDOT MICRO is another great add-on in our EP business that is already growing in excess of 20%. And if you look across our endo-mec, our energy business, here, too, we've got really nice add-on innovations as well as throughout our Vision Care portfolio. 
And of course, longer term, the significant opportunity that we see in digital surgery, that team has continued to make very solid progress. And we're excited about the long-term prospects there as well. So no, overall, we see a lot of opportunity across our Medical Device portfolio."

And first of all, if we just look at the overall penetration rate of digital surgery, it's about 10% in the United States. It's just a couple of percent on a global basis. And so we think if you consider the overall trends of how technology can be utilized in some of these procedures, if you take a look at our global footprint, we think we will be well positioned there in the long term. 
As you mentioned, our team has continued to make good progress. We said from the very beginning, look, we're building this for the decades. We're not just building this for the next quarter. And we're optimistic about the progress that, that team has been making to ensure that we've got a platform that, one, can truly make a difference for patients in surgery; that, two, that's differentiated; and three, that also allows us to integrate not only the robotics aspect, but also the digital component that we think, long term, can truly help show very significant differences in surgical outcomes. 
And also just to give you one example of an application. We mentioned this before, but in Johnson & Johnson right now, I think this exemplifies the unique nature of our diverse portfolio. Several years ago, we embarked on something that we call the lung cancer initiative. As we know, unfortunately, lung cancer continues to kill more people than just about any other type of cancer. And we know that, all too often, patients are diagnosed far too late in the process. And we are quite excited about an early application with Monarch, where we're not only able to go out and potentially do a diagnostic procedure through bronchoscopy to identify, for example, lung nodules, but we're working right now on how can we deliver oncolytic agents, viruses and other immune type agents locally, and how could we really think about the treatment paradigm being shifted in the way that we fundamentally think about lung cancer by combining Pharma, Medical Device, some of these technologies in very new, unique and innovative ways. 
So still much more work to be done, but we're very excited about some of the early prospects that we've seen thus far. And again, I think it exemplifies kind of our unique position to bring these different clinical development, discovery as well as regulatory capabilities and eventually commercial together."

What I can tell you is that we have a very strong and robust pipeline in immunology driven by our 3 existing assets, SYMPHONY, STELARA and TREMFYA. 
STELARA and TREMFYA had very strong quarters, with close to 40% growth in TREMFYA and 15% in STELARA. In STELARA, we continue to grow share in GI, both in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. And TREMFYA is the first and only IL-23 that does have both indications, PsA and PsO, and it's continued to gain share in both areas. 
Moving forward, we are excited about our possibilities in immunology with our oral agents. As you mentioned, one, we have 2 in Phase II. One of them is a pan-JAK oral that we think could be important. We'll have to see the data. 
And broadly in immunology, we also are excited about the possibilities of nipocalimab, which is our FcRn antibody in pathways that are auto antibody mediated with very rare diseases that could create a pipeline in a product. So for us, immunology remains a core area of growth and focus, and we believe we are in a very strong position to continue to drive growth in the coming years, but even beyond 2025, too."

A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com,  where you can also find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules. 
Please note that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review the cautionary statement included in today's presentation, which identifies certain risks and factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. In particular, there is uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This means that results could change at any time and the contemplated impact of COVID-19 on the company's business results and outlook is a best estimate based on the information available as of today's date. 
A further description of these risks uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2020 Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Qs along with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures are also available at investor.jnj.com. 
Several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. 
Moving to today's agenda. I will review the second quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and the 3 business segments. Joe will provide insights about our cash position and capital allocation deployment and will outline our updated guidance inclusive of the COVID-19 vaccine for 2021. Then we will begin the Q&A session with each of the segment leaders providing a brief update on their respective businesses. The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last up to 75 minutes. 
Now let's move to the second quarter results. Worldwide sales were $23.3 billion for the second quarter of 2021, an increase of 27.1% versus the second quarter of 2020. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 23% as currency had a positive impact of 4.1 points. 
In the U.S., sales increased 24.9%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported growth was 29.5%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 20.9%, with currency positively impacting our reported OUS results by 8.6 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 23.8% worldwide, 25.1% in the U.S. and 22.4% outside the U.S. 
Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $6.3 billion and the diluted earnings per share was $2.35 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.36 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.6 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.48, representing increases of 49% and 48.5%, respectively, compared to the second quarter of 2020. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 44.9%. 
I will now comment on business segment sales performance, highlighting items that build upon the slides you have in front of you. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the second quarter of 2020, and therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation. 
Beginning with Consumer Health, Worldwide Consumer Health sales totaled $3.7 billion and increased 9.2%, with increases in the U.S. of 12.4% and growth of 6.3% outside of the U.S. Excluding the impact of divestitures, worldwide growth was 10%. Year-to-date, adjusted operational growth was 3.3% and is more reflective of performance given the quarterly fluctuations of COVID-19 impacts. Over-the-counter medicines grew 8.9% globally, driven by strong growth in ZYRTEC due to both the timing of and increased incidence in the allergy season. Digestive Health grew double digits driven by U.S. PEPCID, new SKU stocking in the club channel, coupled with share growth and increased COVID-19-related health care professional recommendations for the hydration benefit offering, ORSL, in the Asia Pacific region. 
The Skin Health/Beauty franchise grew 12.9% globally, with the U.S. increasing 23% and OUS increasing 1.4%. Skin Health/Beauty outside the U.S. was negatively impacted by approximately 300 basis points due to divestitures. Worldwide growth was driven by market recovery in key markets, increased U.S. stocking for new products and comparisons to COVID-19-related destocking dynamics. 
NEUTROGENA and AVEENO delivered strong performance in the U.S., primarily due to market recovery, new product innovation and higher stocking due to the NEUTROGENA Rapid Firming product launch, partially offset by competitive pressures. OGX and Maui growth was driven by share gains and market growth in Hair Care. 
Oral Care grew 2.5% globally due to strong OUS performance for LISTERINE, reflecting accelerated category and increased demand from continued successful promotional campaigns. Divestitures in the quarter negatively impacted results by 310 basis points. 
The Baby Care franchise grew by 5% as a result of market recovery and OUS strength in Johnson's and AVEENO Baby in e-commerce. 
Wound Care delivered strong growth of 13.4%, driven by U.S. market growth with increased consumer behaviors focused on preparedness and infection prevention and seasonal stocking versus prior year COVID-19 destocking dynamics. 
Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $12.6 billion grew 13.6%, with strength in both the U.S. increasing by 12.2% and OUS with sales increasing by 15.4%. Excluding the impact of divestitures, worldwide growth was 14.1%. Global sales in the quarter included $164 million contribution from the COVID-19 vaccine. Additionally, as a reminder, for comparison purposes, Q2 of 2020 was negatively impacted by access-related constraints due to COVID-19 resulting in a decrease of roughly 300 to 350 basis points in total across key brands. 
Our strong portfolio of products and commercial capabilities continues to enable us to deliver strong adjusted operational growth at above-market levels. Our immunology therapeutic area delivered global sales growth of 17% and driven by strong double-digit performance of STELARA and TREMFYA offset by declines in REMICADE due to biosimilar competition. STELARA continues to show strength in all regions, growing at 30.5% driven by increased market growth and share gains with U.S. share increasing roughly 4 points in Crohn's disease and nearly 8 points in ulcerative colitis. 
TREMFYA was up 36.8% with strong double-digit growth worldwide due to share gains, continued global expansion into new markets and additional penetration into the psoriatic arthritis indication that was approved -- and U.S. share increased over 2 points in psoriasis and nearly 3 points in psoriatic arthritis in the quarter. 
Our oncology portfolio delivered another strong quarter with growth of 21.5%. DARZALEX continued its exceptional performance trajectory growing 53.8%, driven by share gains and increased penetration of the subcutaneous formulation in the U.S. and EU. DARZALEX continues to grow share across all lines of therapy with nearly 4 points of share growth in Line 1 in the U.S. this quarter. ERLEADA also continued its global momentum with growth of 73.7% in the quarter driven by market share, which increased by nearly 2 points across indications and penetration gains, especially in the metastatic indication. IMBRUVICA grew 12.5% globally due to volume gains driven by our market-leading share, that was partially offset by market share losses in the U.S. to novel oral competition and a market that remains slightly depressed due to temporary COVID-19 impacts on new patient starts. 
In neuroscience, our paliperidone long-acting portfolio had strong double-digit growth of 10.6%, driven by market and share growth due to increased new patient starts and strong persistency. 
Cardiovascular metabolism and other declined 7.3% this quarter, driven by continued biosimilar competition for PROCRIT and competitive pressures in INVOKANA, which was partially offset by growth of 1.8% in XARELTO due to continued demand strength. Lastly, our pulmonary hypertension portfolio achieved growth of 8.7% with OPSUMIT growth of 11.9% and UPTRAVI growth of 9.8%, both driven by market penetration and share gains. 
I'll now turn your attention to the Medical Devices segment. Worldwide Medical Devices sales of $7 billion grew 57.2% with the U.S. increasing 77.2% and OUS increasing 41.9%, primarily due to the recovery of procedures from COVID-19 restrictions that occurred in the second quarter of 2020, coupled with the success of recently launched products and commercial activities across the business. 
Selling days had a minor positive impact on growth this quarter. We expect the full year impact from selling days, excluding the impact of the 53rd-week in 2020, to be minimal. Given the extent of the procedure disruption from COVID-19 in 2020, I thought it may be helpful to provide context for our current quarter performance versus the second quarter of 2019. Worldwide Medical Devices grew about 7% versus Q2 2019, with 8 of our $11 billion platforms showing growth versus 2019. The pace of market recovery in knees, spine and vision surgical has been slower than the other markets in which we compete as these procedures are perceived to be more deferrable by patients. 
Geographically, both the U.S. and Asia Pacific markets surpassed Q2 2019, while EMEA and Latin America markets have been slower to recover and Q2 results remained at or below 2019 levels. 
Looking at results for each of our platforms. Interventional Solutions delivered another strong quarter with worldwide growth of 71.3% and strong double-digit growth versus the second quarter of 2019. Electrophysiology reinforced our global market share leadership position growing 74.4%, driven by a recovery in the market coupled with our market expansion activities, the strength of our broad-based portfolio and new products. Worldwide Orthopedics delivered 48.6% growth versus the prior year, driven primarily by market recovery and success of newer product launches. Worldwide trauma delivered growth of 24.8%, reflecting market recovery, strength of our comprehensive portfolio and success of newer product introductions. This quarter, we expanded our market-leading portfolio of products with the launch of a next-generation variable-angle clavicle plate system designed to enhance plate to bone fit on a broad range of patients and simplify implant selection for the surgeon. And we launched an advanced tibial nailing system designed to provide a more stable implant solution and create efficiency within the health care system by streamlining instrumentation across our portfolio. 
Worldwide hips grew 68.1% this quarter driven by market recovery, our continued leadership position in the anterior approach demand for the ACTIS stem aided by our other enabling technologies such as VELYS hip navigation and innovative commercial programs focused on expanding coverage and ACTIS for hip fracture patients in parts of Europe and Latin America. 
Knees returned to growth this quarter increasing 94.6% globally, primarily due to market recovery. Results reflect continued COVID-19 challenges and the related impact on procedures in markets like India, Japan and Australia; and other dynamics, including faster recovery trends in primary knee procedures compared to revisions. This quarter, we began commercialization of our VELYS robotic-assisted solution for total knee procedures in the U.S. We believe this launch, along with our differentiated VELYS digital solutions and a 2 knee platform, including the second half 2021 launch of ATTUNE Cementless Fixed Bearing Knee with [indiscernible] 3D-printed technology will enhance our portfolio and competitiveness as procedures continue to recover. 
Spine returned to worldwide growth this quarter, increasing 51.7%, reflecting market recovery and positive impact from recently launched products, SYMPHONY, CONDUIT and FIBERGRAFT as well as strategic partnerships, which further enhance our offerings such as the X-Pac expandable cage. 
Advanced Surgery grew 44.3% versus prior year. In addition to the positive impact of procedure recovery, biosurgery delivered sales growth of 48% and positive share momentum driven by new products and commercial strategies to expand market penetration and adoption. Endocutters and energy both grew around 40% globally, primarily due to procedure recovery, new product introductions and China Tier 2 and 3 hospital market expansion activities, partially offset by competitive pressure in U.S. We also achieved a significant milestone within the quarter with our Monarch robotic platform surpassing 100 customers and 8,000 procedures. 
General Surgery grew 67.8% globally with wound closure growing 50.1% globally, driven by recovery in the markets continued strength of our market-leading suture portfolio, including our Plus Sutures and STRATAFIX barb suture family and the change in channel inventory levels in the U.S., contributing about 6 points to global growth. Global general surgery sales were positively impacted by 23 points due to a prior year unfavorable pricing adjustment in the U.S. we communicated last year. 
Worldwide Vision grew 66% this quarter, primarily driven by market recovery. U.S. contact lens growth of 73.6% reflects the strength of our market-leading ACUVUE portfolio, commercial initiatives, such as our prioritize your eyes campaign launched to raise awareness around the importance of routine screenings, new products, including early success from ACUVUE multifocal and an inventory build contributing about 5 points. Growth outside the U.S. of 43.1% reflects market recovery and strength of ACUVUE 1-day and recent Asia Pacific ACUVUE defined Fresh Beauty launch. 
Global Surgical Vision delivered growth of 115.8%, driven by market recovery and positive momentum related to new products like TECNIS Eyhance, TECNIS Synergy, which both launched this year in the U.S. market; and Veritas, our next-generation phaco emulsification device. 
Now regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the second quarter of 2021, please direct your attention to the box section of the schedule. You will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. As reported this morning, our adjusted EPS of $2.48 reflects a reported increase of 48.5% and an operational increase of 44.9%. 
I'd like to now highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed on the statement of earnings compared to the same quarter last year. Cost of products sold improved by 340 basis points, primarily driven by the recovery in medical device from prior year COVID-19-related inventory impacts and fixed cost deleveraging. 
Selling, marketing and administrative margins improved 110 basis points due to the recovery of medical device sales from the prior year's negative COVID-19 impact. We continue to invest in research and development at competitive levels, investing 14.6% of sales this quarter. The $3.4 billion investment was a 25% increase versus the prior year due to portfolio progression. 
The other income and expense line showed net income of $488 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to net expense of $24 million in the second quarter of 2020, primarily due to reduced litigation-related items, partially offset by lower unrealized gains on securities. 
Regarding taxes in the quarter, on a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate declined from 8% in the second quarter of 2020 to 5.8% in the second quarter of 2021, primarily driven by a onetime tax benefit the company recognized in the second quarter 2021, resulting from an internal reorganization of certain international subsidiaries. 
In the second quarter of 2021, additional tax benefits related to the transitional provisions of Swiss tax reform, which benefited the 2020 tax rate. Excluding special items, the effective tax was 14.8% versus 16.7% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our 10-Q for additional details on specific tax matters. 
Let's now look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the second quarter of 2021, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales increased from 29.1% to 33.4%. The following are the main drivers of change to the adjusted income before tax by segment. Medical Devices margin improved from 1.2% to 28.6%, driven primarily by overall expense leveraging resulting from the COVID-19-related sales recovery. 
Consumer Health margins improved by 380 basis points, primarily driven by supply chain efficiencies and including the benefit from our SKU rationalization program, partially offset by increased investments in brand marketing expenses. Pharmaceutical margins decreased by 450 basis points, primarily driven by increased research and development investment, inclusive of the COVID-19 vaccine net costs and general portfolio progression. 
Moving to important developments, here's a slide summarizing notable developments occurring in the second quarter. I'll highlight a few starting with our pharmaceutical business. We continue to make positive progress advancing our strong pipeline of innovative medicines and therapies. As we've shared previously, we are rigorous in focusing on differentiated transformational medical innovation. In the quarter, we announced our decision not to continue a collaboration and license agreement for cusatuzumab, an investigational therapeutic antibody that targets CD70. The decision is based upon Janssen's review of all available data and in consideration of the evolving standard of care for the treatment of AML. 
We received EU approval for PONVORY in relapsing multiple sclerosis, and also a U.S. approval of RYBREVANT for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with epidermal factor receptor Exon 20 insertion mutations. In addition, we completed our EU filing for cilta-cel, a BCMA CAR-T for the treatment of multiple myeloma. We anticipate U.S. approval for our BCMA CAR-T later this year, which will represent a third NME approval this year. 
Within our Medical Device portfolio, we continue to make meaningful advancements in our innovation pipeline launching 17 major first country launches in the first half of 2021, including 8 products this quarter. As noted earlier, we received FDA approval and launched TECNIS SYNERGY and TECNIS SYNERGY TORIC II intraocular lenses in the U.S. These are next-generation presbyopia-correcting lenses and deliver the widest range of continuous vision and the best near vision among leading PC IOLs. 
Finally, within the Surgery business, the ENSEAL X1 curved jaw tissue sealer launched in the U.S., expanding the ETHICON advanced bipolar energy portfolio. 
That concludes the sales, P&L and pipeline highlights for Johnson & Johnson's second quarter. 
I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk."
139677,695371034,2348617,"Johnson & Johnson, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2021",2021-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Johnson & Johnson","Executives","Thank you, Chris. Good morning, and thanks to all of you for joining us today to discuss our strong first half of 2021, specifically the high growth we experienced in the second quarter and our updated outlook for the balance of the year. I hope everyone",1559,"Thank you, Chris. Good morning, and thanks to all of you for joining us today to discuss our strong first half of 2021, specifically the high growth we experienced in the second quarter and our updated outlook for the balance of the year. I hope everyone is having a safe, healthy and enjoyable summer. 
As Chris referenced, Johnson & Johnson's businesses remain leaders or are better positioned within the markets in which they compete. While the pandemic makes it difficult to reliably gauge what results will be in any given quarter, you likely noticed that all 3 segments beat your expectations. We continue to be poised for further growth and value creation, not just in 2021, but more importantly for 2022 and beyond. 
Over the past 18 months, our people have been a driving force behind our success. And guided by our credo, they have demonstrated resilience and agility while remaining committed to ensuring our life-saving medicines and products reach patients and consumers around the world. Thanks to the efforts of our 136,000 colleagues across the world, Johnson & Johnson continues to make significant strides towards our mission of improving human health and well-being of everyone, everywhere. 
Foundational to any healthy business is a focus and commitment to broader stakeholder stewardship. We are proud to share the progress we are making in a transparent and accountable manner. A few weeks ago, we held our annual ESG investor update following the publication of our 2020 Health for Humanity Report and our 2025 goals. Through these goals, we aim to deliver even greater long-term value to our broad set of stakeholders. I hope you had the opportunity to view this webcast. If you have not, the replay is still available on the Johnson & Johnson website. 
Let's get into the results with an update on our cash position. We continue to generate strong free cash flow with approximately $8 billion year-to-date. We ended the second quarter with approximately $25 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $33 billion of debt, resulting in $8 billion of net debt. Our financial position and balance sheet remains strong. As we enter the back half of the year, we are well positioned to continue to deploy capital in a strategic value-creating way that will benefit stakeholders over the long term. 
Our dividend remains a key priority, and during the quarter, we distributed $2.8 billion to shareholders. Regarding M&A, we continually evaluate strategic opportunities that have the potential to further enhance our business while also driving better health outcomes for patients and consumers. 
Since Chris covered highlights from our second quarter performance and our worldwide chairs will provide sector-specific commentary to open the Q&A session, I will now move directly to providing the update to our full year 2021 guidance, which reflects our strong year-to-date performance. 
For clarity, I will first comment on our core business and then remark on our anticipated COVID-19 vaccine revenue, which is now included in our enterprise guidance. For full year 2021, we continue to expect our base business, defined as excluding our COVID-19 vaccine, to remain strong. Based on this confidence, we are increasing and tightening our adjusted operational savings to 9.5% to 10.5%. This adjusted operational sales growth is on a constant currency basis, consistent with how we manage our business performance. We are maintaining our estimate for the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of approximately 50 basis points, which accounts for previously completed divestitures in medical devices, consumer health as well as within other oncology in pharmaceuticals, resulting in an operational sales range of 9.0% to 10.0% or $90 billion to $90.8 billion for a midpoint of 9.5% or $90.4 billion. 
While we don't predict currency movements, utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.18 and in consideration of other currency movements, there is no change from our previous estimates resulting in favorable currency impact of $1.3 billion or a year-over-year increase of 150 basis points. This results in estimated reported sales in the range of $91.3 billion to $92.1 billion, an increase of 10.5% to 11.5% or 11% at the midpoint versus 2020. 
Now a few words on the expected contribution of our COVID-19 vaccine to our updated full year 2021 guidance. Our goal has always been to bring forth our scientific capabilities and resources to develop a safe and efficacious vaccine that would complement other measures to end the global pandemic. We are proud to have been part of the unprecedented collaboration in the health care industry that has led to a number of authorized vaccines in the marketplace. Chris shared earlier that we reported vaccine revenue in the quarter. Specifically, our COVID-19 vaccine contributed $164 million in revenue in the second quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $264 million. 
At this point, revenue from the first half of the year was provisionally recorded at $5 per dose, given that volumes during the pandemic period were uncertain. Currently, we expect the ultimate final not-for-profit price could be as much as $8 per dose. The final not-for-profit price will fluctuate until the end of the year when we know precisely all the variables that go into the calculation, namely the net costs incurred as well as volumes produced during the pandemic period. Given the firm contracts we have in place, pending advanced purchase agreements, we expect to recognize vaccine sales of approximately $2.5 billion in 2021, with more than half of that revenue likely to occur in the fourth quarter. 
Regarding vaccine manufacturing, we continue to expand our global network to include 10 manufacturing sites for various stages of production. On July 2, the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for human use, a prudent expansion of our facility in the Netherlands, increasing our capacity to produce active drug substance. The FDA also released 5 batches of drug substance manufactured at the Emergent BioSolutions Bayview facility under the emergency use authorization, and we continue to work with health authorities on the approval of additional drug substance manufactured at Emergent. 
Now I do appreciate that many of you are understandably looking beyond 2021 to 2022, it is simply too early to provide specific information on a 2022 outlook for our COVID-19 vaccine given the uncertainty on the need for boosters and new variants. But as recent published clinical data indicates, our vaccine appears to have durability for at least 8 months and is effective against the recent Delta variant and other highly prevalent viral variants. At this time, I'd caution you to wait to include future year vaccine projections in your models for our business. The COVID-19 vaccine market will continue to evolve, and we look forward to sharing additional details as more data become available, including the role our vaccine will play for you to forecast future years. Given this and what I already provided on our base business, our new updated guidance expectations are reflected on this slide, reflecting an enterprise total revenue of $94.2 billion at the midpoint. 
Moving to other items of the P&L. We are now expecting our operating margins to be nearly a 200 basis point improvement over last year, slightly less than our prior guidance as we continue to invest for the long term. We are increasing our other income estimate to a range of $800 million to $900 million. This increase is primarily attributable to increased investment returns related to our employee benefit programs. As a reminder, pension service costs are recorded in operating expenses while any investment performance related to our employee benefit programs are recorded in other income and expense. 
Moving to interest expense, based on our year-to-date experience, we are lowering our estimate to a range of $100 million to $200 million. Finally, we are lowering our effective tax rate estimate to a range of 16.0% to 17.0% based on certain onetime benefits realized in the first half of the year. The result of these updates translate to increasing our earnings guidance. 
We are also tightening the guidance range. The new adjusted operational per share guidance range is 18.4% to 19.6% or $9.50 to $9.60, with a midpoint of 19% or $9.55 per share. 
While not predicting currency movements but to provide some direction on the impact of currency fluctuations on our reported adjusted EPS, we expect a slight change from what we communicated on the Q1 earnings call. Currency will now impact EPS by 1.2% or $0.10 per share. Accounting for that, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting reported adjusted EPS ranging from $9.60 to $9.70 or a midpoint of $9.65 increasing 20.2%. Consistent with what we shared before, given the not-for-profit nature of the vaccine, there is no significant EPS contribution in 2021 and therefore, the EPS guidance I provided is inclusive of the vaccine revenue. 
I am now pleased I want to thank our worldwide chairs, Jennifer Taubert, Thibaut Mongon and Ashley McEvoy for their participation in the Q&A portion of our call today. I know this audience values having these leaders on earnings calls from time to time. So before we jump into the Q&A portion of the call, I'd like to ask Jennifer, Thibaut and Ashley each to provide a brief business segment update and quality outlook for the remainder of 2021. Jennifer, let's start with the Pharmaceutical segment."

I'd like to start by thanking my Janssen colleagues around the world for their relentless focus on delivering for patients. As a result, I'm proud to share that our Pharmaceutical sector had another strong quarter of above-market growth. 
As you heard from Chris, our Pharmaceuticals business delivered $12.6 billion in worldwide sales in the second quarter, with adjusted operational growth of approximately 14%. Our base business, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine demonstrated robust growth at 12.6%. This is our third consecutive quarter with sales exceeding $12 billion, and our growth was broadly based across geographic regions and our therapeutic areas. We continue to maximize the value of our industry-leading portfolio, delivering double-digit growth for 9 key brands, including our oncology medicines, DARZALEX, IMBRUVICA and ERLEADA; our immunology medicines, TREMFYA and STELARA, our pulmonary hypertension medicines OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI; and INVEGA SUSTENNA and TRINZA in our neuroscience portfolio. 
Our leading commercial and market access capabilities enabled increased market penetration and share gains across our key promoted brands. And as we shared in our transparency report this year, our growth continues to come from volume gains and not price. This is a strong indication that our life-changing medicines are reaching more patients each day worldwide. It's important to note we continue to be a top investor in research and development. This investment fuels our pipeline and is the foundation for our long-term growth. 
During the second quarter, we continued to deliver on our pipeline of transformational medicines. I'll highlight just a few of the key milestones and achievements. First, in May, the FDA approved amivantamab, now known as RYBREVANT. This is the first bispecific antibody approved for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, characterized by EGFR Exon 20 insertion mutations. This is our first approved treatment for lung cancer, which we hope will be an important area for us going forward. This is our second NME approval of this year. PONVORY, or ponesimod, was our first 2021 NME approval and this was by the FDA in March for the treatment of adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. In the second quarter, it was also approved by the European Commission and Health Canada. We also advanced our BCMA CAR-T cell therapy program, cilta-cel, for patients with multiple myeloma. In the second quarter, the U.S. FDA granted our BCMA CAR-T priority review. Our marketing authorization was filed with the European Medicines Agency, and submission was made to the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency. We anticipate FDA approval of cilta-cel as our third NME approval later this year. 
In addition, our subcutaneous form of DARZALEX continues to benefit an increasing number of patients. In the second quarter, the European Commission approved DARZALEX for 2 additional patient populations as combination therapy for the treatment of adults with newly diagnosed systemic light chain amyloidosis, which is the first and only approved therapy for this rare and life-threatening blood disorder.  And as combination therapy for adults with pretreated multiple myeloma. Additionally, subsequent to the quarter,  The FDA approved DARZALEX FASPRO in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma after first or subsequent relapse, our sixth indication specific to our subcutaneous form of DARZALEX. 
I'm proud of our pharmaceutical results in the second quarter and feel confident in our ability to make 2021 our tenth consecutive year of above-market growth. Our outlook for the rest of the year remains strong. 
Before I close, I'd like to invite you to join us for our Pharmaceuticals business review on November 18. We look forward to sharing a comprehensive overview of our business, our robust pipeline and our long-term growth outlook. We'll cover our key therapeutic areas, including oncology and immunology, which are always areas of high interest. And we'll delve deeper into some of our newer areas, including our retina and gene therapy pipeline and the details behind the breadth of our autoantibody program that came through our acquisition of Momenta last year. I hope you'll be able to join us. So again, it's a pleasure to have this opportunity to connect with you today. Thibaut, I'll now turn it over to you."

Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning to all of you on the call. I would like to start by congratulating my Consumer Health colleagues for their continued focus on flawlessly executing against our strategy. Last year, this focus on execution",477,"All right. Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning to all of you on the call. I would like to start by congratulating my Consumer Health colleagues for their continued focus on flawlessly executing against our strategy. 
Last year, this focus on execution across our broad-based portfolio delivered solid results doing 3% operationally. And this year, we continue to demonstrate a strong level of performance. The strategy we set a couple of years ago for the Consumer Health segment to be focused on personal health with science-based, professionally-endorsed brands and advancing our digital capabilities continues to strengthen our ability to meet the needs of our consumers and customers worldwide, resulting in strong quarterly results and solid year-to-date performance. 
Our Consumer health sector grew 9.2% operationally in the quarter and 2.7% on a year-to-date basis. Our adjusted operational growth for acquisitions and divestitures was 10% in the quarter and 3.3% on a year-to-date basis. And as Chris stated in his remarks, these year-to-date results are a better representation of our performance given the fluctuations we see in the market due to COVID-19 dynamics and seasonality overall. 
We saw strong year-to-date performance for brands in our 2 strongholds, such as ZYRTEC, PEPCID and [indiscernible] in OTC or AVEENO, NEUTROGENA or OGX in skin health. In our specialty areas, brands like LISTERINE, AVEENO Baby and BAND-AID also contributed nicely to our year-to-date results. And from a geographic perspective, we are encouraged to see that we grew across all regions in the quarter. 
Now if we look into the future, even if we will continue to see variability in categories depending on seasonality and local market conditions, we are confident that our strategy is working. We have the right portfolio to continue to deliver solid results, well balanced both in terms of categories we compete in and in terms of geographic presence. And lastly, we have been able to achieve our solid sales results while simultaneously improving our margin profile. Our efforts on end-to-end profitability improvement, including portfolio optimization and network improvements have delivered to plan. 
Our year-to-date adjusted IBT is approximately 27%, another 250 basis point improvement over last year. We have made great strides in increasing our profitability to become a leader within our peer set, and we will continue to look for opportunities to improve our margin profile while at the same time, investing to grow the top line, launching new products and Chris referenced some of them in his remarks and managing through anticipated higher commodity and distribution costs in the back half of 2021. 
So in a nutshell, Consumer Health delivered a strong quarter and a solid first half. Our strategy is working, and we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver profitable growth in line with the categories and markets in which we compete. And now let me hand over to Ashley McEvoy. Ashley?"

Let me just begin with across J&J, how privileged we feel to work in health care because we recognize that what we do matters, especially now. We're united by our purpose to profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity and we are propelled by our MedTech aspiration to reimagine the future of health today in 3 ways: one is innovating across the continuum of patient care; two is prioritizing and modernizing health; and three is promoting health equity and wellness. We continue to see strong evidence that our focus and actions to impact human health and improve our competitiveness is working. 
This quarter, MedTech delivered sales of $7 million, representing adjusted operational growth of 59% versus 2020. And as Chris mentioned, up 7% versus 2019, bringing our first half of 2021 revenue performance to just over 5% compared to 2019. Our sales reflect market recovery and our positive competitive momentum, 8 of our $11 billion MedTech platforms grew versus the second quarter 2019 and quarter 1 '21 share trends show that we have maintained or gained share in 10 of these platforms. 
We have an exciting pipeline and we've achieved some truly amazing results in the first half of this year, which position us well to continue our growth momentum. We've launched 17 major products in [indiscernible] 1, the highest number of first half of the year launches in 5 years for our business. These include products, which will strengthen our core, like TECNIS Synergy, our most advanced premier intraoculens and surgical vision. And the ENSEAL X1 curved tissue sealer and next-generation advanced energy solution and our surgery franchise. We continue to focus on significant global health concerns, including myopia management where we plan to have a portfolio of solutions for patients. And we are progressing all things digital with solutions covering the entire paradigm of care, including open and laparoscopic procedures, orthopedics and aluminum interventional in vision. 
Our Monarch platform achieved a significant milestone, reaching over 100 customers and enabling over 8,000 bronchoscopies, which is life-changing and potentially life-saving in the detection and treatment of lung cancer. VELYS, our robotic-assisted solution for total knee procedures, launched in the United States and received regulatory approval in Australia this month. We are extremely pleased with the early customer engagement and feedback confirming the differentiation of this next-generation solution. And Ottava, our soft tissue digital surgery offering continues to progress its key development milestones. 
We also recognize that the digitization of health care is happening and rapidly accelerating technology like this, making it possible to deliver new ways of care. An example of this is from our innovative team in China who developed a virtual solution powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning to more effectively train and expand the number of highly skilled electrophysiologists and provide broader access to high-quality care. Learning curves went from novice to experts from a year to 4 months. And the first 4 months of launch 150 newly trained physicians delivered care to 7,500 patients. It's no surprise our electrophysiology business in China is so strong. And we continue to leverage science to influence industry trends and positively impact patient outcomes and human health. Just this month, the U.K. modified their NICE guidelines to recommend the use of Plus Sutures as a standard of care, giving the evidence supporting their role in reducing surgical site infections and unnecessary cost to the health care system. 
Okay. Regarding the pandemic, we are seeing light at the end of the COVID-19 tunnel, but this remains, as we all know, a very fluid situation. The pace of continued recovery will depend on multiple factors, including the speed at which global populations are vaccinated, health care capacity and the ability to manage through surges as well as the rate at which patients seek treatment. 
In closing, and I'd like to emphasize that our strong quarter 2 results and continuing momentum can be attributed to a purpose-driven, globally diverse team, which embody a winning spirit every day. The resilient agility and creativity have taken us to the next level in our business, build stronger relationships with our customers and patients and defined a clear vision of our future. Thank you, and I look forward to your questions."

Louise, I would say -- listen, we're encouraged by, quite frankly, several things, the ability that hospitals can manage through capacity and surges and labor as well as, obviously, the vaccination efforts around the world. And just a patient, there's a significant backlog of care. If I look at the U.K. my goodness, there's like 5 million patients waiting for medical interventions, 400,000 of those folks waiting for surgery for the past 12 months. But as we know, it's not going to be linear, we do know hospital systems in the United States are starting to delay care right now. So I think quarter-to-quarter, it will improve, but it will never be a linear line."

Down about 3 points in orthopedics in OUS in quarter 2, really due to some of the slower-moving countries like Japan and India and -- of kind of opening up and COVID. When I think about quarter 3 and quarter 4, I do expect continued momentum. You'll recall last year, we were down about 3% in quarter 3 versus 2019, and then we were down about 1.5% in quarter 4, 2020 versus '19. So I do expect continued progress. I expect Orthopedics to go positive. I expect vision to accelerate given a lot of the new product launches. As we've discussed, we think the category is going to be high double digit, and we expect to be more in the high single digits at the end of this year versus 2019."

And Larry, with respect to your question on guidance overall. I think I almost have to mirror a little bit what Ashley had said the comparables were going to be most pronounced for the second quarter. there'll be a little bit of benefit as we look into the third and fourth quarter. As you know, we don't provide guidance by quarter. But I'm really looking at the underlying strength of each of our businesses, improved share in the markets in which we lead and for those which we don't lead. In addition to the -- what you heard from all 3 of our segment leaders, just an improved cadence of innovation, new approvals, new offerings that offer better health care solutions. So that's how we're thinking about it. 
From an EPS perspective, we are challenging our teams to continue to invest. We think when we have 10% top line growth and EPS growth that will approach 20%, we think that's very healthy to take it up today on top of what we delivered in January, which surprised the upside as well. we want to make sure that we don't only deliver strong results in the current quarter or the next 2 quarters, but really in the middle and back half of this decade as well.

Is it share gain versus overall market growth, other geographies that are standing out? I'm just trying to get a sense of what have been the real upside versus your initial expectations? 
Now if I can just slip a second quick one in. I think you mentioned the pharma margins were impacted by increased investments in 2Q. I guess should we be thinking about that as a onetime event with the COVID vaccine expenses, et cetera? Or are we entering kind of a sustained period of R&D ramp here where we could see with some of those margins under pressure?"

So Chris, let me take a stab at that, and maybe, Jennifer, you can chime in with anything that I might have missed. But with respect to the revenue guidance, Chris, I would say, coming into the year, just like every other company and probably every other industry, we remained a little bit cautious with respect to how the recovery would unfold, would there be new variants. And so we took what was a very responsible and prudent approach to our expectations in the beginning of the year. That being said, I don't want to undermine just the operational performance that each of the teams are executing upon as we go throughout this year what we did learn. And it really is a credit to the leaders that you've heard from today and their teams. 
Just how important it is reaching out to customers during the last 18 months, not only to find out what the status of COVID-19 was and how it was impacting their businesses, but also how Johnson & Johnson could help them in the recovery. And I think that is having some, I'll call it, a goodwill factor with respect to how we're approaching our business today. 
With respect to operating margins in R&D, I would say that the COVID investment for the vaccine specifically is a small part of it. What we're seeing and really what we all take great pride in is there's not 1 big outlying expense item or investment item in the quarter or even year-to-date with respect to milestones. It's really just the maturity of the portfolio, again across all 3 segments that really positions us well. So last year, you might recall, we increased our R&D investment by $800 million above 2019 levels. Even with all the questions and uncertainty and even though maybe competitors pulled back a little bit, we know the only right answer was to invest for the long term. we're actually at a pace this year through 6 months, about $1.3 billion above last year's level on a 6-month comparator. So we feel very well positioned. And again, with how I answered Larry earlier on the EPS accretion we kind of think we're hitting the mark across all aspects. 
I don't know, Jennifer, if there's anything else you want to add?"

We've seen that Japan is in locked down. We know that Australia went back to lockdowns recently. We know India is digging out. So some of those other countries are going to be slower to recover. EMEA, we've been -- which has been at a slower pace than the United States, we actually see a lot of acceleration happening right now in EMEA with the vast distribution and uptake of vaccinations and quite frankly, the the backlog of patients that really need to be cared for. 
As I mentioned, I share a little bit of the waiting list data in the U.K. And the U.S. in quarter 2 has had significant recovery versus the first quarter. I look at data like in January, we were down medical procedures were down about 6% in January versus 2019. And in May, that was positive to up about 3%. But as I mentioned, it's going to be not a vertical line given the recent surges that are happening in hospital systems in the U.S. like Florida, like Michigan and the Midwest. So again, I think our systems are unbelievably equipped to manage through this, have huge respect and admiration for a lot of our customers who are managing COVID as well as non-COVID patients."

So then as it relates to DARZALEX, starting off with DARZALEX. You saw the very strong results that we had in the quarter, also the significance of the additional indications that continue to come through and our sixth indication specifically for the DARZALEX FASPRO application. As we take a look so far across the business already 60% of our DARZALEX business is in the subcutaneous form. And that's whether we look at the United States or whether we look outside the U.S. And so very, very rapid adoption as well as expanded into additional patient populations for DARZALEX. So we're very, very confident in the uptake, and this is really providing significant benefits from patients, going from multiple hour infusions down to a 3- to 5-minute injection. So a lot of good things to come on DARZALEX. 
As it relates to IMBRUVICA, we're seeing very strong growth for IMBRUVICA outside the United States. Right now, a 22% growth in the quarter. As we take a look at IMBRUVICA overall, we had double-digit growth, but obviously less than that than the U.S. In the U.S., we're still a bit impacted. The patient volumes and new patient starts are still down a little bit in CLL due to COVID. For these patient populations, there can be more of a watchful waiting period or sometimes treatment with older therapies. And so we did see growth rate, particularly in the U.S. in the quarter. But we do anticipate that to rebound as we move forward and more people get vaccinated. 
As it relates to the competitive dynamics, IMBRUVICA remains the #1 per [ script ] treatment in CLL and relapsed/refractory MCL and also [indiscernible] So it's the #1 TKI wherever they're prescribed. It's also the only agent that's got demonstrated overall survival in first-line CLL and a safety profile that's supported by over years of follow-up and clinical experience. So we believe we've got a great profile that stands up competitively with IMBRUVICA, and we'll continue to be able to deliver great growth for us going forward."

I know that there were some questions early on sort of the tone of the market and COVID and trends for the back half of the year. But just specifically for Ashley, third quarter for those businesses that are in the past, the Med Device businesses that have been sort of seasonally off down slightly flattish from Q2 to Q3. Is that the pattern -- when you talk about improving momentum, I mean, is that the pattern we should see sort of a normal seasonal pattern? Or the momentum you're describing something that would actually take this -- some of those businesses up sequentially? And I have one follow-up, if I could."

I would tell you that what we've experienced is maybe some bookends like our electrical physiology business, or Afib treating cardiac ablation has kind of recovered very expeditiously. And that team right now is just really working on refilling the patient funnel. At the other book end, I would say would be cataract surgeries, which are procedure volumes are still below in 2019. So we would expect that one to significantly accelerate on a balance to go. So it really depends by procedure. They really are meeting the bell curve, if you will. And again, as I kind of come back to what's going to affect the pace, it's really the pace of vaccinations, patent hospitals being able to match the capacity and keep a highly engaged, healthy workforce and managed through some of the surges that we're seeing right now in the U.S. and other pockets of the world. And then just really patient sentiment. There's been a lot of investment that J&J has been doing to reassure patients to go seek medical care. And I think we've seen a lot of the facts and data and publications on the impact on non-COVID patients who haven't seeked care. So we expect that to continue. We don't expect, again, a perfect linear line. I keep saying that because we learn every week. We take 4 steps forward or maybe a step back."

It's also complemented as Chris was mentioning, with kind of our first innovation in the phaco multiplier to Veritas. So the combination of those 2 with really our first advancement in monofocals in the TECNIS Eyhance, which just launched earlier in quarter 1, the combination of those 3 innovations, I expect should improve our current run rate of revenue performance in the U.S. surgical vision. And as you heard in quarter 2, we did grow revenue versus and OUS. And so I expect that, that should have the U.S. start to pick up more in the back half of the year."

I would say we're very encouraged, we've had about 750 on [indiscernible] knee digital surgery offering. We've done about 100 cases to date. What we keep hearing from customers who have been giving us really positive feedback on a couple of things. The value of the system's smaller footprint, the images interoperative capabilities and really the ease of integration for surgeons and OR teams to reducing the heavy physical and financial burdens of the currently available marketplace offering. So it's new. We've got approval also in Australia. So we're going to start to do cases in Australia. And I would say very, very encouraging. We have several different commercial models that we're assessing, and we're seeing hospitals take really multiple archetypes. So stay tuned on that. 
And then I think you had a second question, Joanne, on M&A. And I would just say, from a Med Tech point of view, you've seen we've invested over $10 billion of capital in M&A really behind getting into eye health, getting more significant into digital surgery. And then really starting to invest in, I'll call it, standard of care changing technologies like NeuWave and ablation. For liver ablation with the first indication, right now, we are under clinical trial to partner that technology with our the luminal Monarch technology for lung cancer, the treatment of tumors or bleeding tumor cells. We're also in first-in-human in oncolytic viruses in drug delivery using Monarch as well as starting to get a stronger foothold in the fast-growing area of stroke. Our stroke business was up over 30% in quarter 2 relative to 2019. So again, a procedure that was less affected in the COVID environment that we continue to build down to. But I'll turn to my colleagues to talk a little bit about M&A."

One of the things that helps us be really successful here is that we're truly agnostic to the source of innovation. So the win is having something that's really transformational and being able to get it to patients. It's not where it originated from. And so as a result, about 50% of our products come internally, 50% externally. So for example, late last year, we brought in bermekimab, we made the acquisition of Momenta. We brought in Terra as a drug delivery device for bladder, a gene therapy for geographic [indiscernible] macular degeneration from HUMIRA. And so we really do work very, very assertively to find the best technology in our key areas of focus. And many times, that's coming from our internal labs, many times it's also coming externally. So our strategy and interest there remains the same and making sure that we've got the best innovation for patients going forward. I feel like we're doing a really good job on that front."

A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com, where you can also find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules.  
Please note that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review the cautionary statement included in today's presentation, which identifies certain risks and factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. In particular, there is uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This means that results could change at any time and the contemplated impact of COVID-19 on the company's business results and outlook is a best estimate based on the information available as of today's date.  
A further description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2020 Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Qs along with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures are also available at investor.jnj.com.  
Several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships.  
Moving to today's agenda. I will review the second quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and the 3 business segments. Joe will provide insights about our cash position and capital allocation deployment and will outline our updated guidance inclusive of the COVID-19 vaccine for 2021. Then we will begin the Q&A session with each of the segment leaders providing a brief update on their respective businesses. The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last up to 75 minutes.  
Now let's move to the second quarter results. Worldwide sales were $23.3 billion for the second quarter of 2021, an increase of 27.1% versus the second quarter of 2020. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 23% as currency had a positive impact of 4.1 points.  
In the U.S., sales increased 24.9%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported growth was 29.5%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 20.9%, with currency positively impacting our reported OUS results by 8.6 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 23.8% worldwide, 25.1% in the U.S. and 22.4% outside the U.S.  
Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $6.3 billion and the diluted earnings per share was $2.35 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.36 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.6 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.48, representing increases of 49% and 48.5%, respectively, compared to the second quarter of 2020.  
On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 44.9%.  
I will now comment on business segment sales performance, highlighting items that build upon the slides you have in front of you. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the second quarter of 2020, and therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation.  
Beginning with Consumer Health, Worldwide Consumer Health sales totaled $3.7 billion and increased 9.2%, with increases in the U.S. of 12.4% and growth of 6.3% outside of the U.S. Excluding the impact of divestitures, worldwide growth was 10%. Year-to-date, adjusted operational growth was 3.3% and is more reflective of performance given the quarterly fluctuations of COVID-19 impacts. Over-the-counter medicines grew 8.9% globally, driven by strong growth in ZYRTEC due to both the timing of and increased incidence in the allergy season. Digestive health grew double digits driven by U.S. PEPCID, new SKU stocking in the club channel, coupled with share growth, and increased COVID-19-related health care professional recommendations for the hydration benefit offering, ORSL, in the Asia Pacific region.  
The skin health/beauty franchise grew 12.9% globally, with the U.S. increasing 23% and OUS increasing 1.4%. Skin health/beauty outside the U.S. was negatively impacted by approximately 300 basis points due to divestitures. Worldwide growth was driven by market recovery in key markets, increased U.S. stocking for new products and comparisons to COVID-19-related destocking dynamics.  
NEUTROGENA and AVEENO delivered strong performance in the U.S., primarily due to market recovery, new product innovation and higher stocking due to the NEUTROGENA rapid firming product launch, partially offset by competitive pressures. OGX and Maui growth was driven by share gains and market growth in Hair Care.  
Oral Care grew 2.5% globally due to strong OUS performance for LISTERINE, reflecting accelerated category and increased demand from continued successful promotional campaigns. Divestitures in the quarter negatively impacted results by 310 basis points.  
The Baby Care franchise grew by 5% as a result of market recovery and OUS strength in Johnson's and AVEENO Baby in e-commerce.  
Wound Care delivered strong growth of 13.4%, driven by U.S. market growth with increased consumer behaviors focused on preparedness and infection prevention and seasonal stocking versus prior year COVID-19 destocking dynamics.  
Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $12.6 billion grew 13.6%, with strength in both the U.S. increasing by 12.2% and OUS with sales increasing by 15.4%. Excluding the impact of divestitures, worldwide growth was 14.1%. Global sales in the quarter included $164 million contribution from the COVID-19 vaccine. Additionally, as a reminder, for comparison purposes, Q2 of 2020 was negatively impacted by access-related constraints due to COVID-19 resulting in a decrease of roughly 300 to 350 basis points in total across key brands.  
Our strong portfolio of products and commercial capabilities continues to enable us to deliver strong adjusted operational growth at above-market levels. Our immunology therapeutic area delivered global sales growth of 17%,  driven by strong double-digit performance of STELARA and TREMFYA offset by declines in REMICADE due to biosimilar competition. STELARA continued to show strength in all regions, growing at 30.5% driven by increased market growth and share gains with U.S. share increasing roughly 4 points in Crohn's disease and nearly 8 points in ulcerative colitis.  
TREMFYA was up 36.8% with strong double-digit growth worldwide due to share gains, continued global expansion into new markets and additional penetration into the psoriatic arthritis indication that was approved in 2020. U.S. share increased over 2 points in psoriasis and nearly 3 points in psoriatic arthritis in the quarter.  
Our oncology portfolio delivered another strong quarter with growth of 21.5%. DARZALEX continued its exceptional performance trajectory growing 53.8%, driven by share gains and increased penetration of the subcutaneous formulation in the U.S. and EU. DARZALEX continues to grow share across all lines of therapy with nearly 4 points of share growth in line 1 in the U.S. this quarter. 
ERLEADA also continued its global momentum with growth of 73.7% in the quarter driven by market share, which increased by nearly 2 points across indications, and penetration gains, especially in the metastatic indication. 
IMBRUVICA grew 12.5% globally due to volume gains driven by our market-leading share but was partially offset by modest share losses in the U.S. to novel oral competition and a market that remains slightly depressed due to temporary COVID-19 impacts on new patient starts.  
In neuroscience, our paliperidone long-acting portfolio had strong double-digit growth of 10.6% driven by market and share growth due to increased new patient starts and strong persistency.  
Cardiovascular/metabolism/other declined 7.3% this quarter, driven by continued biosimilar competition for PROCRIT and competitive pressures in INVOKANA, which was partially offset by growth of 1.8% in XARELTO due to continued demand strength. 
Lastly, our pulmonary hypertension portfolio achieved growth of 8.7% with OPSUMIT growth of 11.9% and UPTRAVI growth of 9.8%, both driven by market penetration and share gains.  
I'll now turn your attention to the Medical Devices segment. Worldwide Medical Devices sales of $7 billion grew 57.2% with the U.S. increasing 77.2% and OUS increasing 41.9%, primarily due to the recovery of procedures from COVID-19 restrictions that occurred in the second quarter of 2020, coupled with the success of recently launched products and commercial activities across the business.  
Selling days had a minor positive impact on growth this quarter. We expect the full year impact from selling days, excluding the impact of the 53rd week in 2020, to be minimal. Given the extent of the procedure disruption from COVID-19 in 2020, I thought it may be helpful to provide context for our current quarter performance versus the second quarter of 2019. 
Worldwide Medical Devices grew about 7% versus Q2 2019, with 8 of our 11 billion-dollar platforms showing growth versus 2019. The pace of market recovery in knees, spine and vision surgical has been slower than the other markets in which we compete as these procedures are perceived to be more deferrable by patients.  
Geographically, both the U.S. and Asia Pacific markets surpassed Q2 2019, while EMEA and Latin America markets have been slower to recover and Q2 results remained at or below 2019 levels.  
Looking at results for each of our platforms. Interventional Solutions delivered another strong quarter with worldwide growth of 71.3% and strong double-digit growth versus the second quarter of 2019. 
Electrophysiology reinforced our global market share leadership position growing 74.4%, driven by a recovery in the market coupled with our market expansion activities, the strength of our broad-based portfolio and new products. 
Worldwide orthopedics delivered 48.6% growth versus the prior year, driven primarily by market recovery and success of newer product launches. 
Worldwide trauma delivered growth of 24.8%, reflecting market recovery, strength of our comprehensive portfolio and success of newer product introductions. This quarter, we expanded our market-leading portfolio of products with the launch of a next-generation variable angle clavicle plate system designed to enhance plate-to-bone fit on a broad range of patients and simplify implant selection for the surgeon.  
And we launched an advanced tibial nailing system designed to provide a more stable implant solution and create efficiency within the health care system by streamlining instrumentation across our portfolio.  
Worldwide hips grew 68.1% this quarter, driven by market recovery, our continued leadership position in the anterior approach, demand for the ACTIS stem aided by our other enabling technologies such as VELYS Hip Navigation and innovative commercial programs focused on expanding coverage and ACTIS for hip fracture patients in parts of Europe and Latin America.  
Knees returned to growth this quarter increasing 94.6% globally, primarily due to market recovery. Results reflect continued COVID-19 challenges and the related impact on procedures in markets like India, Japan and Australia; and other dynamics, including faster recovery trends in primary knee procedures compared to revisions. 
This quarter, we began commercialization of our VELYS robotic-assisted solution for total knee procedures in the U.S. We believe this launch, along with our differentiated VELYS digital solutions and a 2 knee platform, including the second half 2021 launch of ATTUNE Cementless fixed bearing knee with AFFIXIUM 3D-printed technology will enhance our portfolio and competitiveness as procedures continue to recover.  
Spine returned to worldwide growth this quarter, increasing 51.7%, reflecting market recovery and positive impact from recently launched products, SYMPHONY, CONDUIT and FIBERGRAFT as well as strategic partnerships which further enhance our offerings such as the X-Pac expandable cage.  
Advanced Surgery grew 44.3% versus prior year. In addition to the positive impact of procedure recovery, biosurgery delivered sales growth of 48% and positive share momentum driven by new products and commercial strategies to expand market penetration and adoption. 
Endocutters and energy both grew around 40% globally, primarily due to procedure recovery, new product introductions and China Tier 2 and 3 hospital market expansion activities, partially offset by competitive pressure in U.S. We also achieved a significant milestone within the quarter with our Monarch robotic platform surpassing 100 customers and 8,000 procedures.  
General Surgery grew 67.8% globally, with wound closure growing 50.1% globally, driven by recovery in the markets continued strength of our market-leading suture portfolio, including our Plus Sutures and STRATAFIX barb suture family and the change in channel inventory levels in the U.S., contributing about 6 points to global growth. Global general surgery sales were positively impacted by 23 points due to a prior year unfavorable pricing adjustment in the U.S. we communicated last year.  
Worldwide vision grew 66% this quarter, primarily driven by market recovery. U.S. contact lens growth of 73.6% reflects the strength of our market-leading ACUVUE portfolio, commercial initiatives, such as our Prioritize Your Eyes campaign launched to raise awareness around the importance of routine screenings, new products, including early success from ACUVUE multifocal and an inventory build contributing about 5 points. Growth outside the U.S. of 43.1% reflects market recovery and strength of ACUVUE 1-day and recent Asia Pacific ACUVUE DEFINE FRESH beauty launch.  
Global surgical vision delivered growth of 115.8%, driven by market recovery and positive momentum related to new products like TECNIS Eyhance, TECNIS Synergy, which both launched this year in the U.S. market; and VERITAS, our next-generation phacoemulsification device.  
Now regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the second quarter of 2021, please direct your attention to the box section of the schedule. You will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. As reported this morning, our adjusted EPS of $2.48 reflects a reported increase of 48.5% and an operational increase of 44.9%.  
I'd like to now highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed on the statement of earnings compared to the same quarter last year. Cost of products sold improved by 340 basis points, primarily driven by the recovery in Medical Device from prior year COVID-19-related inventory impacts and fixed cost deleveraging.  
Selling, marketing and administrative margins improved 110 basis points due to the recovery of Medical Device sales from the prior year's negative COVID-19 impact. 
We continue to invest in research and development at competitive levels, investing 14.6% of sales this quarter. The $3.4 billion investment was a 25% increase versus the prior year due to portfolio progression. 
The other income and expense line showed net income of $488 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to net expense of $24 million in the second quarter of 2020, primarily due to reduced litigation-related items, partially offset by lower unrealized gains on securities.  
Regarding taxes in the quarter, on a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate declined from 8% in the second quarter of 2020 to 5.8% in the second quarter of 2021, primarily driven by a onetime tax benefit the company recognized in the second quarter 2021, resulting from an internal reorganization of certain international subsidiaries.  
In the second quarter of 2021, the company recorded additional tax benefits related to the transitional provisions of Swiss tax reform, which benefited the 2020 tax rate. Excluding special items, the effective tax was 14.8% versus 16.7% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our 10-Q for additional details on specific tax matters.  
Let's now look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the second quarter of 2021, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales increased from 29.1% to 33.4%. The following are the main drivers of change to the adjusted income before tax by segment. 
Medical Devices margin improved from 1.2% to 28.6%, driven primarily by overall expense leveraging resulting from the COVID-19-related sales recovery.  
Consumer Health margins improved by 380 basis points, primarily driven by supply chain efficiencies and including the benefit from our SKU rationalization program, partially offset by increased investments in brand marketing expenses. 
Pharmaceutical margins decreased by 450 basis points, primarily driven by increased research and development investment, inclusive of the COVID-19 vaccine net costs and general portfolio progression.  
Moving to important developments. Here's a slide summarizing notable developments occurring in the second quarter. I'll highlight a few starting with our Pharmaceutical business. We continue to make positive progress advancing our strong pipeline of innovative medicines and therapies. As we've shared previously, we are rigorous in focusing on differentiated, transformational medical innovation. 
In the quarter, we announced our decision not to continue a collaboration and license agreement for cusatuzumab, an investigational therapeutic antibody that targets CD70. The decision is based upon Janssen's review of all available data and in consideration of the evolving standard of care for the treatment of AML.  
We received EU approval for PONVORY in relapsing multiple sclerosis, and also a U.S. approval of RYBREVANT for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with epidermal factor receptor exon 20 insertion mutations. 
In addition, we completed our EU filing for Cilta-cel, a BCMA CAR-T for the treatment of multiple myeloma. We anticipate U.S. approval for our BCMA CAR-T later this year, which will represent a third NME approval this year.  
Within our Medical Device portfolio, we continue to make meaningful advancements in our innovation pipeline, launching 17 major first-country launches in the first half of 2021, including 8 products this quarter. 
As noted earlier, we received FDA approval and launched TECNIS SYNERGY and TECNIS SYNERGY TORIC II intraocular lenses in the U.S. These are next-generation presbyopia-correcting lenses and deliver the widest range of continuous vision and the best near vision among leading PC IOLs.  
Finally, within the Surgery business, the ENSEAL X1 Curved Jaw Tissue Sealer launched in the U.S., expanding the ETHICON advanced bipolar energy portfolio.  
That concludes the sales, P&L and pipeline highlights for Johnson & Johnson's second quarter.  
I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk."
139677,695371034,2348741,"Johnson & Johnson, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2021",2021-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Johnson & Johnson","Executives","Thank you, Chris. Good morning, and thanks to all of you for joining us today to discuss our strong first half of 2021, specifically the high growth we experienced in the second quarter and our updated outlook for the balance of the year. I hope everyone",1560,"Thank you, Chris. Good morning, and thanks to all of you for joining us today to discuss our strong first half of 2021, specifically the high growth we experienced in the second quarter and our updated outlook for the balance of the year. I hope everyone is having a safe, healthy and enjoyable summer.  
As Chris referenced, Johnson & Johnson's businesses remain leaders or are better positioned within the markets in which they compete. While the pandemic makes it difficult to reliably gauge what results will be in any given quarter, you likely noticed that all 3 segments beat your expectations. We continue to be poised for further growth and value creation, not just in 2021, but more importantly for 2022 and beyond.  
Over the past 18 months, our people have been a driving force behind our success and guided by our credo, they have demonstrated resilience and agility while remaining committed to ensuring our life-saving medicines and products reach patients and consumers around the world. Thanks to the efforts of our 136,000 colleagues across the world, Johnson & Johnson continues to make significant strides towards our mission of improving human health and well-being of everyone, everywhere.  
Foundational to any healthy business is a focus and commitment to broader stakeholder stewardship. We are proud to share the progress we are making in a transparent and accountable manner. A few weeks ago, we held our annual ESG investor update following the publication of our 2020 Health for Humanity Report and our 2025 goals. Through these goals, we aim to deliver even greater long-term value to our broad set of stakeholders. I hope you had the opportunity to view this webcast. If you have not, the replay is still available on the Johnson & Johnson website.  
Let's get into the results with an update on our cash position. We continue to generate strong free cash flow with approximately $8 billion year-to-date. We ended the second quarter with approximately $25 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $33 billion of debt, resulting in $8 billion of net debt. Our financial position and balance sheet remains strong. As we enter the back half of the year, we are well positioned to continue to deploy capital in a strategic value-creating way that will benefit stakeholders over the long term.  
Our dividend remains a key priority. And during the quarter, we distributed $2.8 billion to shareholders. 
Regarding M&A, we continually evaluate strategic opportunities that have the potential to further enhance our business while also driving better health outcomes for patients and consumers.  
Since Chris covered highlights from our second quarter performance and our worldwide chairs will provide sector-specific commentary to open the Q&A session, I will now move directly to providing the update to our full year 2021 guidance, which reflects our strong year-to-date performance.  
For clarity, I will first comment on our core business and then remark on our anticipated COVID-19 vaccine revenue, which is now included in our enterprise guidance. 
For full year 2021, we continue to expect our base business, defined as excluding our COVID-19 vaccine, to remain strong. Based on this confidence, we are increasing and tightening our adjusted operational sales range to 9.5% to 10.5%. This adjusted operational sales growth is on a constant currency basis, consistent with how we manage our business performance. 
We are maintaining our estimate for the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of approximately 50 basis points, which accounts for previously completed divestitures in Medical Devices, Consumer Health as well as within other oncology in pharmaceuticals, resulting in an operational sales range of 9.0% to 10.0% or $90 billion to $90.8 billion for a midpoint of 9.5% or $90.4 billion.  
While we don't predict currency movements, utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.18 and in consideration of other currency movements, there is no change from our previous estimates resulting in favorable currency impact of $1.3 billion or a year-over-year increase of 150 basis points. This results in estimated reported sales in the range of $91.3 billion to $92.1 billion, an increase of 10.5% to 11.5% or 11% at the midpoint versus 2020.  
Now a few words on the expected contribution of our COVID-19 vaccine to our updated full year 2021 guidance. Our goal has always been to bring forth our scientific capabilities and resources to develop a safe and efficacious vaccine that would complement other measures to end the global pandemic. We are proud to have been part of the unprecedented collaboration in the health care industry that has led to a number of authorized vaccines in the marketplace. 
Chris shared earlier that we reported vaccine revenue in the quarter. Specifically, our COVID-19 vaccine contributed $164 million in revenue in the second quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $264 million. At this point, revenue from the first half of the year was provisionally recorded at $5 per dose, given that volumes during the pandemic period were uncertain. 
Currently, we expect the ultimate final not-for-profit price could be as much as $8 per dose. The final not-for-profit price will fluctuate until the end of the year when we know precisely all the variables that go into the calculation, namely the net costs incurred as well as volumes produced during the pandemic period. 
Given the firm contracts we have in place, pending advanced purchase agreements, we expect to recognize vaccine sales of approximately $2.5 billion in 2021, with more than half of that revenue likely to occur in the fourth quarter.  
Regarding vaccine manufacturing, we continue to expand our global network to include 10 manufacturing sites for various stages of production. On July 2, the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, a prudent expansion of our facility in the Netherlands, increasing our capacity to produce active drug substance. The FDA also released 5 batches of drug substance manufactured at the Emergent BioSolutions Bayview facility under the emergency use authorization, and we continue to work with health authorities on the approval of additional drug substance manufactured at Emergent.  
Now I do appreciate that many of you are understandably looking beyond 2021 to 2022. It is simply too early to provide specific information on a 2022 outlook for our COVID-19 vaccine given the uncertainty on the need for boosters and new variants. But as recent published clinical data indicates, our vaccine appears to have durability for at least 8 months and is effective against the recent Delta variant and other highly prevalent viral variants. 
At this time, I'd caution you to wait to include future year vaccine projections in your models for our business. The COVID-19 vaccine market will continue to evolve, and we look forward to sharing additional details as more data become available, including the role our vaccine will play for you to forecast future years.  
Given this and what I already provided on our base business, our new updated guidance expectations are reflected on this slide, reflecting an enterprise total revenue of $94.2 billion at the midpoint.  
Moving to other items of the P&L. We are now expecting our operating margins to be nearly a 200 basis point improvement over last year, slightly less than our prior guidance as we continue to invest for the long term. 
We are increasing our other income estimate to a range of $800 million to $900 million. This increase is primarily attributable to increased investment returns related to our employee benefit programs. As a reminder, pension service costs are recorded in operating expenses while any investment performance related to our employee benefit programs are recorded in other income and expense.  
Moving to interest expense, based on our year-to-date experience, we are lowering our estimate to a range of $100 million to $200 million. 
Finally, we are lowering our effective tax rate estimate to a range of 16.0% to 17.0% based on certain onetime benefits realized in the first half of the year. 
The result of these updates translate to increasing our earnings guidance. We are also tightening the guidance range. The new adjusted operational per share guidance range is 18.4% to 19.6% or $9.50 to $9.60, with a midpoint of 19% or $9.55 per share.  
While not predicting currency movements but to provide some direction on the impact of currency fluctuations on our reported adjusted EPS, we expect a slight change from what we communicated on the Q1 earnings call. Currency will now impact EPS by 1.2% or $0.10 per share. Accounting for that, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting reported adjusted EPS ranging from $9.60 to $9.70 or a midpoint of $9.65 increasing 20.2%. 
Consistent with what we shared before, given the not-for-profit nature of the vaccine, there is no significant EPS contribution in 2021 and therefore, the EPS guidance I provided is inclusive of the vaccine revenue.  
I am now pleased and want to thank our worldwide chairs, Jennifer Taubert, Thibaut Mongon and Ashley McEvoy, for their participation in the Q&A portion of our call today. I know this audience values having these leaders on earnings calls from time to time. 
So before we jump into the Q&A portion of the call, I'd like to ask Jennifer, Thibaut and Ashley each to provide a brief business segment update and quality outlook for the remainder of 2021. 
Jennifer, let's start with the Pharmaceutical segment."
139677,695371034,2348741,"Johnson & Johnson, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2021",2021-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Johnson & Johnson","Executives","Well, thank you, Joe, and hello, everyone.

As a result, I'm proud to share that our Ph",704,"Well, thank you, Joe, and hello, everyone. It's a pleasure to be here with you today. 
I'd like to start by thanking my Janssen colleagues around the world for their relentless focus on delivering for patients. As a result, I'm proud to share that our Pharmaceutical sector had another strong quarter of above-market growth. 
As you heard from Chris, our Pharmaceuticals business delivered $12.6 billion in worldwide sales in the second quarter, with adjusted operational growth of approximately 14%. Our base business, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, demonstrated robust growth at 12.6%. This is our third consecutive quarter with sales exceeding $12 billion, and our growth was broadly based across geographic regions and our therapeutic areas. We continue to maximize the value of our industry-leading portfolio, delivering double-digit growth for 9 key brands, including our oncology medicines, DARZALEX, IMBRUVICA and ERLEADA; our immunology medicines, TREMFYA and STELARA; our pulmonary hypertension medicines, OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI; and INVEGA, SUSTENNA and TRINZA in our neuroscience portfolio. 
Our leading commercial and market access capabilities enabled increased market penetration and share gains across our key promoted brands. And as we shared in our transparency report this year, our growth continues to come from volume gains and not price. This is a strong indication that our life-changing medicines are reaching more patients each day worldwide. 
It's important to note we continue to be a top investor in research and development. This investment fuels our pipeline and builds the foundation for our long-term growth. During the second quarter, we continued to deliver on our pipeline of transformational medicines. I'll highlight just a few of the key milestones and achievements. 
First, in May, the FDA approved amivantamab, now known as RYBREVANT. This is the first bispecific antibody approved for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, characterized by EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. This is our first approved treatment for lung cancer, which we hope will be an important area for us going forward. This is our second NME approval of this year. 
PONVORY, or ponesimod, was our first 2021 NME approval and this was by the FDA in March, for the treatment of adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. In the second quarter, it was also approved by the European Commission and Health Canada. 
We also advanced our BCMA CAR-T cell therapy program, Cilta-cel, for patients with multiple myeloma. In the second quarter, the U.S. FDA granted our BCMA CAR-T priority review. Our marketing authorization was filed with the European Medicines Agency, and submission was made to the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency. We anticipate FDA approval of Cilta-cel as our third NME approval later this year. 
In addition, our subcutaneous form of DARZALEX continues to benefit an increasing number of patients. In the second quarter, the European Commission approved DARZALEX for 2 additional patient populations as combination therapy for the treatment of adults with newly diagnosed systemic light chain amyloidosis, which is the first and only approved therapy for this rare and life-threatening blood disorder. And as combination therapy for adults with pretreated multiple myeloma. Additionally, subsequent to the quarter, the FDA approved DARZALEX FASPRO in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma after first or subsequent relapse, our sixth indication specific to our subcutaneous form of DARZALEX. 
I'm proud of our pharmaceutical results in the second quarter and feel confident in our ability to make 2021 our tenth consecutive year of above-market growth. Our outlook for the rest of the year remains strong. 
Before I close, I'd like to invite you to join us for our Pharmaceuticals business review on November 18. We look forward to sharing a comprehensive overview of our business, our robust pipeline and our long-term growth outlook. We'll cover our key therapeutic areas, including oncology and immunology, which are always areas of high interest. And we'll delve deeper into some of our newer areas, including our retina and gene therapy pipeline and the details behind the breadth of our autoantibody program that came through our acquisition of Momenta last year. I hope you'll be able to join us. So again, it's a pleasure to have this opportunity to connect with you today. 
Thibaut, I'll now turn it over to you."

Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning to all of you on the call. I would like to start by congratulating my Consumer Health colleagues for their continued focus on flawlessly executing against our strategy. Last year, this focus on execution",477,"All right. Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning to all of you on the call. 
I would like to start by congratulating my Consumer Health colleagues for their continued focus on flawlessly executing against our strategy. Last year, this focus on execution across our broad-based portfolio delivered solid results, growing 3% operationally. And this year, we continue to demonstrate a strong level of performance. 
The strategy we set a couple of years ago for the Consumer Health segment to be focused on personal health with science-based, professionally-endorsed brands and advancing our digital capabilities continues to strengthen our ability to meet the needs of our consumers and customers worldwide, resulting in strong quarterly results and solid year-to-date performance. 
Our Consumer Health sector grew 9.2% operationally in the quarter and 2.7% on a year-to-date basis. Our adjusted operational growth for acquisitions and divestitures was 10% in the quarter and 3.3% on a year-to-date basis. And as Chris stated in his remarks, these year-to-date results are a better representation of our performance given the fluctuations we see in the market due to COVID-19 dynamics and seasonality overall. 
We saw strong year-to-date performance for brands in our 2 strongholds, such as ZYRTEC, PEPCID and NICORETTE in OTC or AVEENO, NEUTROGENA or OGX in skin health. In our specialty areas, brands like LISTERINE, AVEENO Baby and BAND-AID also contributed nicely to our year-to-date results. And from a geographic perspective, we are encouraged to see that we grew across all regions in the quarter. 
Now if we look into the future, even if we will continue to see variability in categories depending on seasonality and local market conditions, we are confident that our strategy is working. We have the right portfolio to continue to deliver solid results, well balanced both in terms of categories we compete in and in terms of geographic presence. 
And lastly, we have been able to achieve our solid sales results while simultaneously improving our margin profile. Our efforts on end-to-end profitability improvement, including portfolio optimization and network improvements, have delivered to plan. 
Our year-to-date adjusted IBT is approximately 27%, another 250 basis point improvement over last year. We have made great strides in increasing our profitability to become a leader within our peer set, and we will continue to look for opportunities to improve our margin profile while at the same time investing to grow the top line, launching new products, and Chris referenced some of them in his remarks, and managing through anticipated higher commodity and distribution costs in the back half of 2021. 
So in a nutshell, Consumer Health delivered a strong quarter and a solid first half. Our strategy is working, and we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver profitable growth in line with the categories and markets in which we compete. 
And now let me hand over to Ashley McEvoy. Ashley?"
139677,695371034,2348741,"Johnson & Johnson, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2021",2021-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Johnson & Johnson","Executives","Thank you. Thank you, Thibaut, and good morning.

Let me just begin with across J&J, how privileged we feel to work in health care because we recognize that what we do matters, especially now. We're united by our purpose to profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity and we are propelled by our med tech aspiration to reimagine the future of health today in 3 ways: one is innovating across the continuum of patient care; two is prioritizing and modernizing health; and three is promoting health equity and wellness. We continue to see strong evidence that our focus and actions to impact human health and improve our competitiveness is working. 
This quarter, med tech delivered sales of $7 billion, representing adjusted operational growth of 59% versus 2020, and as Chris mentioned, up 7% versus 2019, bringing our first half of 2021 revenue performance to just over 5% compared to 2019. Our sales reflect market recovery and our positive competitive momentum, 8 of our 11 billion-dollar med tech platforms grew versus the second quarter 2019 and quarter 1 '21 share trends show that we have maintained or gained share in 10 of these platforms. 
We have an exciting pipeline and we've achieved some truly amazing results in the first half of this year, which position us well to continue our growth momentum. We've launched 17 major products in the first half of 2021. This is the highest number of first half of the year launches in 5 years for our business. These include products which will strengthen our core, like TECNIS Synergy, our most advanced premier intraocular lens in surgical vision. And the ENSEAL X1 Curved Tissue Sealer and next-generation advanced energy solution and our surgery franchise. 
We continue to focus on significant global health concerns, including myopia management where we plan to have a portfolio of solutions for patients. And we are progressing all things digital with solutions covering the entire paradigm of care, including open and laparoscopic procedures, orthopedics, endoluminal, interventional in vision. 
Our Monarch platform achieved a significant milestone, reaching over 100 customers and enabling over 8,000 bronchoscopies, which is life-changing and potentially life-saving in the detection and treatment of lung cancer. VELYS, our robotic-assisted solution for total knee procedures, launched in the United States and received regulatory approval in Australia this month. We are extremely pleased with the early customer engagement and feedback confirming the differentiation of this next-generation solution. And Ottava, our soft tissue digital surgery offering, continues to progress its key development milestones. 
We also recognize that the digitization of health care is happening and rapidly accelerating technology like this, making it possible to deliver new ways of care. An example of this is from our innovative team in China who developed a virtual solution powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning to more effectively train and expand the number of highly skilled electrophysiologists and provide broader access to high-quality care. Learning curves went from novice to experts from a year to 4 months. In the first 4 months of launch, 150 newly trained physicians delivered care to 7,500 patients. It's no surprise our electrophysiology business in China is so strong. 
And we continue to leverage science to influence industry trends and positively impact patient outcomes and human health. Just this month, the U.K. modified their NICE guidelines to recommend the use of Plus Sutures as a standard of care, giving the evidence supporting their role in reducing surgical site infections and unnecessary cost to the health care system. 
Okay. Regarding the pandemic, we are seeing light at the end of the COVID-19 tunnel, but this remains, as we all know, a very fluid situation. The pace of continued recovery will depend on multiple factors, including the speed at which global populations are vaccinated, health care capacity and the ability to manage through surges as well as the rate at which patients seek treatment. 
In closing, and I'd like to emphasize that our strong quarter 2 results and continuing momentum can be attributed to a purpose-driven, globally diverse team, which embody a winning spirit every day. The resilient agility and creativity have taken us to the next level in our business, built stronger relationships with our customers and patients and defined a clear vision of our future. Thank you, and I look forward to your questions."

But as we know, it's not going to be linear. We do know hospital systems in the United States are starting to delay care right now. So I think quarter-to-quarter, it will improve, but it will never be a linear line."

Down about 3 points in orthopedics in OUS in quarter 2 really due to some of the slower-moving countries like Japan and India and -- of kind of opening up and COVID. 
When I think about quarter 3 and quarter 4, I do expect continued momentum. You'll recall last year, we were down about 3% in quarter 3 versus 2019, and then we were down about 1.5% in quarter 4, 2020 versus '19. So I do expect continued progress. I expect orthopedics to go positive. I expect vision to accelerate given a lot of the new product launches. As we've discussed, we think the category is going to be high double digit, and we expect to be more in the high single digits at the end of this year versus 2019."

But I'm really looking at the underlying strength of each of our businesses, improved share in the markets in which we lead and for those which we don't lead. 
In addition to the -- what you heard from all 3 of our segment leaders, just an improved cadence of innovation, new approvals, new offerings that offer better health care solutions. So that's how we're thinking about it. 
From an EPS perspective, we are challenging our teams to continue to invest. We think when we have 10% top line growth and EPS growth that will approach 20%, we think that's very healthy to take it up today on top of what we delivered in January, which surprised the upside as well. We want to make sure that we don't only deliver strong results in the current quarter or the next 2 quarters, but really in the middle and back half of this decade as well.

Is it share gain versus overall market growth, other geographies that are standing out? I'm just trying to get a sense of like really, what have been the real upside versus your initial expectations? 
Now if I can just slip a second quick one in. I think you mentioned the Pharma margins were impacted by increased investments in 2Q. I guess should we be thinking about that as a onetime event with the COVID vaccine expenses, et cetera? Or are we entering kind of a sustained period of R&D ramp here where we could see with some of those margins under pressure?"

So Chris, let me take a stab at that, and maybe, Jennifer, you can chime in with anything that I might have missed. 
But with respect to the revenue guidance, Chris, I would say, coming into the year, just like every other company and probably every other industry, we remained a little bit cautious with respect to how the recovery would unfold, would there be new variants. And so we took what was a very responsible and prudent approach to our expectations in the beginning of the year. That being said, I don't want to undermine just the operational performance that each of the teams are executing upon as we go throughout this year. 
What we did learn -- and it really is a credit to the leaders that you've heard from today and their teams, just how important it is reaching out to customers during the last 18 months, not only to find out what the status of COVID-19 was and how it was impacting their businesses, but also how Johnson & Johnson could help them in the recovery. And I think that is having some, I'll call it, a goodwill factor with respect to how we're approaching our business today. 
With respect to operating margins in R&D, I would say that the COVID investment for the vaccine specifically is a small part of it. What we're seeing and really what we all take great pride in is there's not one big outlying expense item or investment item in the quarter or even year-to-date with respect to milestones. It's really just the maturity of the portfolio, again, across all 3 segments that really positions us well. 
So last year, you might recall, we increased our R&D investment by $800 million above 2019 levels. Even with all the questions and uncertainty and even though maybe competitors pulled back a little bit, we know the only right answer was to invest for the long term. We're actually at a pace this year through 6 months, about $1.3 billion above last year's level on a 6-month comparator. So we feel very well positioned. And again, with how I answered Larry earlier on the EPS accretion, we kind of think we're hitting the mark across all aspects. 
I don't know, Jennifer, if there's anything else you want to add?"

We've seen that Japan is in lockdown. We know that Australia went back to lockdowns recently. We know India is digging out. So some of those other countries are going to be slower to recover. EMEA, we've been -- which has been at a slower pace than the United States, we actually see a lot of acceleration happening right now in EMEA with the vast distribution and uptake of vaccinations and quite frankly, the backlog of patients that really need to be cared for. 
As I mentioned, I shared a little bit of the waiting list data in the U.K. And the U.S. in quarter 2 has had significant recovery versus the first quarter. I look at data like in January, we were down -- medical procedures were down about 6% in January versus 2019. And in May, that was positive to up about 3%. But as I mentioned, it's going to be not a vertical line given the recent surges that are happening in hospital systems in the U.S. like Florida, like Michigan and the Midwest. So again, I think our systems are unbelievably equipped to manage through this, have huge respect and admiration for a lot of our customers who are managing COVID as well as non-COVID patients."

So then as it relates to DARZALEX, starting off with DARZALEX. You saw the very strong results that we had in the quarter, also the significance of the additional indications that continue to come through and our sixth indication specifically for the DARZALEX FASPRO application. As we take a look so far across the business already 60% of our DARZALEX business is in the subcutaneous form. And that's whether we look at the United States or whether we look outside the U.S. And so very, very rapid adoption as well as expanded into additional patient populations for DARZALEX. So we're very, very confident in the uptake, and this is really providing significant benefits from patients, going from multiple hour infusions down to a 3- to 5-minute injection. So a lot of good things to come on DARZALEX. 
As it relates to IMBRUVICA, we're seeing very strong growth for IMBRUVICA outside the United States. Right now, a 22% growth in the quarter. As we take a look at IMBRUVICA overall, we had double-digit growth, but obviously less than that than in the U.S. In the U.S., we're still a bit impacted. The patient volumes and new patient starts are still down a little bit in CLL due to COVID. For these patient populations, there can be more of a watchful waiting period or sometimes treatment with older therapies. And so we did see a slower growth rate, particularly in the U.S. in the quarter. But we do anticipate that to rebound as we move forward and more people get vaccinated. 
As it relates to the competitive dynamics, IMBRUVICA remains the #1 prescribed treatment in CLL and relapsed/refractory MCL and also Waldenstrom. So it's the #1 BTKi wherever they're prescribed. It's also the only agent that's got demonstrated overall survival in first-line CLL and a safety profile that's supported by over 5 years of follow-up and clinical experience. So we believe we've got a great profile that stands up competitively with IMBRUVICA, and we'll continue to be able to deliver great growth for us going forward."

At the other bookend, I would say would be cataract surgeries, which are procedure volumes are still below in 2019. So we would expect that one to significantly accelerate on a balance to go. 
So it really depends by procedure. They really are meeting the bell curve, if you will. And again, as I kind of come back to what's going to affect the pace, it's really the pace of vaccinations, pace of hospitals being able to match the capacity and keep a highly engaged, healthy workforce and managed through some of the surges that we're seeing right now in the U.S. and other pockets of the world. And then just really patient sentiment. There's been a lot of investment that J&J has been doing to reassure patients to go seek medical care. And I think we've seen a lot of the facts and data and publications on the impact on non-COVID patients who haven't seeked care. So we expect that to continue. We don't expect, again, a perfect linear line. I keep saying that because we learn every week. We take 4 steps forward or maybe a step back. Thank you."

And that market had a lot of available premium intraocular lenses. We're pleased to bring that technology to the United States. We just launched in quarter 2. There's been very good pickup. It's also complemented, as Chris was mentioning, with kind of our first innovation in the phacoemulsifier, the VERITAS. So the combination of those 2 with really our first advancement in monofocals in the TECNIS Eyhance, which just launched earlier in quarter 1, the combination of those 3 innovations, I expect should improve our current run rate of revenue performance in the U.S. surgical vision. And as you heard in quarter 2, we did grow revenue versus 2019 in OUS. And so I expect that, that should have the U.S. start to pick up more in the back half of the year."

I would say we're very encouraged, we've had about 750 on hand demonstrations with our VELYS knee digital surgery offering. We've done about 100 cases to date. What we keep hearing from customers who have been giving us really positive feedback on a couple of things. The value of the system's smaller footprint, the images' interoperative capabilities and really the ease of integration for surgeons and OR teams to workflows, reducing the heavy physical and financial burdens of the currently available marketplace offering. 
So it's new. We've got approval also in Australia. So we're going to start to do cases in Australia. And I would say very, very encouraging. We have several different commercial models that we're assessing, and we're seeing hospitals take really multiple archetypes. So stay tuned on that. 
And then I think you had a second question, Joanne, on M&A. And I would just say, from a med tech point of view, you've seen we've invested over $10 billion of capital in M&A really behind getting into eye health, getting more significant into digital surgery. And then really starting to invest in, I'll call it, standard of care changing technologies like NeuWave and ablation. For liver ablation with the first indication, right now, we are under clinical trial to partner that technology with our endoluminal Monarch technology for lung cancer, the treatment of tumors or bleeding tumor cells. We're also in first-in-human in oncolytic viruses in drug delivery using Monarch as well as starting to get a stronger foothold in the fast-growing area of stroke. Our stroke business was up over 30% in quarter 2 relative to 2019. So again, a procedure that was less affected in the COVID environment that we continue to build down to. 
But I'll turn to my colleagues to talk a little bit about M&A."

One of the things that helps us be really successful here is that we're truly agnostic to the source of innovation. So the win is having something that's really transformational and being able to get it to patients. It's not where it originated from. And so as a result, about 50% of our products come internally, 50% externally. 
So for example, late last year, we brought in bermekimab, we made the acquisition of Momenta. We brought in TARIS as a drug delivery device for bladder, a gene therapy for geographic atrophy in age-related macular degeneration from Humira. 
And so we really do work very, very assertively to find the best technology in our key areas of focus. And many times, that's coming from our internal labs, many times it's also coming externally. So our strategy and interest there remains the same and making sure that we've got the best innovation for patients going forward. I feel like we're doing a really good job on that front."

A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com, where you can also find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules. 
Please note that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review the cautionary statements included in today's presentation, which identifies certain risks and factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. In particular, there is uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other marketplace dynamics. This means that results could change at any time, and the contemplated impact of COVID-19 on the company's business results and outlook is a best estimate based on the information available as of today's date. A further description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2020 Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Qs, along with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures. These materials are also available at investor.jnj.com. 
Several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. 
Moving to today's agenda. I will review the third quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and the 3 segments. Joe will provide some additional business and financial commentary, before providing an overview of our cash position and capital allocation, and then conclude with updated guidance on 2021 results. The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last up to 60 minutes. Now let's move to the third quarter results. 
Worldwide sales were $23.3 billion for the third quarter of 2021, an increase of 10.7% versus the third quarter of 2020. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 9.9% as currency had a positive impact of 0.8 points. In the U.S., sales increased 7.9%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported growth was 13.8%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 12.1%, with currency positively impacting our reported OUS results by 1.7 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 10.6% worldwide, 8% in the U.S. and 13.5% outside the U.S. 
Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $3.7 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $1.37 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.33 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $7 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.60, representing increases of 18.7% and 18.2%, respectively, compared to the third quarter of 2020. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 16.4%. 
I will now comment on business segment sales performance, highlighting items that build upon the slides you have in front of you. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the third quarter of 2020, and therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation. 
Beginning with Consumer Health. Worldwide Consumer Health sales of $3.7 billion increased 4.1% with growth of 4.5% in the U.S. and growth of 3.7% outside of the U.S. Excluding the impact of divestitures, worldwide growth was 5.7%. Although there is variability across the franchises due to the impact of COVID-19, the overall portfolio is performing well. When comparing to 2019, the Consumer Health business grew approximately 8% operationally in the quarter. 
Over-the-counter medicines saw strong growth of 18.2% globally due to share gains in the U.S., along with an increase of pediatric fever incidences and demand for vaccination symptom relief that drove increased sales of TYLENOL and MOTRIN globally. Additionally, category recovery increased demand for cough, cold, flu and digestive health brands such as IMODIUM. Sales outside the U.S. benefited from prior year comparisons, specifically prior year reduction in consumption in China. 
Our Skin Health/Beauty franchise declined by 3% globally, largely due to the 330 basis point impact of the divestiture of Sedona, the salon-based portion of Dr. Calavo in Asia Pacific. Excluding this impact, the franchise experienced modest growth driven by strong performance in AVEENO and NEUTROGENA facial moisturizing and body care, driven by COVID-19 market recovery and e-commerce growth, partially offset by external supply constraints and lost sales from the Sun Aerosol recall. 
Oral Care declined 4.5% globally, largely due to the impact of divestitures worth approximately 300 basis points. Excluding this impact, the franchise declined due to external supply constraints for LISTERINE in the U.S. and negative comparisons to prior year COVID-19-related impacts in EMEA, partially offset by strong performance in Asia Pacific, driven by strong promotions and brand building behind LISTERINE germ fighting ability. 
The Baby Care franchise declined 1.2% globally, resulting from Asia Pacific COVID-19 lockdowns and competitive pressure, mostly offset by strong AVEENO performance, along with category and e-commerce growth in the U.S. Our women's health franchise grew 0.8% globally, primarily due to lapping prior year COVID-19 impacts. And finally, our Wound Care franchise declined 4.8% globally, driven by unfavorable comparisons to prior year stocking in the U.S. and competitive pressure in Asia Pacific. 
Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $13 billion increased 13.2% with growth of 12.2% in the U.S. and growth of 14.6% outside of the U.S. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide growth was 13.8%. Additionally, as a reminder, for comparison purposes, Q3 of 2020 was negatively impacted by access-related constraints due to COVID-19, resulting in a decrease of roughly 200 basis points in total across key brands. Our strong portfolio of products and commercial capabilities continued to enable us to deliver adjusted operational growth at above market levels. 
The Immunology portfolio delivered strong global sales growth of 11.7%, driven by double-digit performance of STELARA and TREMFYA, offset by declines in REMICADE due to biosimilar competition. STELARA continued to show strength in all regions, growing at 21.7%, driven by market growth and share gains of roughly 4 points in Crohn's disease and nearly 7 points in ulcerative colitis in the U.S. TREMFYA was up 63.5%, with strong double-digit growth worldwide due to continued positive share growth and additional penetration into the psoriatic arthritis indication. U.S. share increased over 2 points in psoriasis and over 3 points in psoriatic arthritis. 
Oncology also delivered another strong quarter with global sales growth of 16.5%. DARZALEX continued its double-digit performance with 42.9% growth in the quarter, driven by share gains, increased penetration of the subcutaneous formulation in the U.S. and EU and continued launches globally. DARZALEX grew share across all lines of therapy with nearly 5 points of share growth in the U.S. this quarter, as an example. 
ERLEADA also continued its global uptake with growth of 65.8% in the quarter, driven by global market share gains, which increased in the U.S. alone by nearly 2 points across all indications led by the metastatic indication. IMBRUVICA grew 2.5% globally due to the brand's market-leading share position but was partially offset by modest share losses in the U.S. and a market that remains constrained due to temporary COVID-19 impact on new patient starts. In addition, growth was negatively impacted by a prior period adjustment in the U.S. that was worth nearly 350 basis points on worldwide IMBRUVICA growth. 
Neuroscience grew 4.6% globally, driven by paliperidone long-acting portfolio, posting market and share growth due to increased new patient starts and strong persistency in the U.S. The cardiovascular metabolism and other business declined 12.4% globally due to competitive pressures in INVOKANA and biosimilar competition for PROCRIT. 
Pulmonary hypertension achieved strong growth of 16.1% driven by OPSUMIT growth of 17.1% and UPTRAVI growth of 18.8%, both driven by market penetration and share gains. And lastly, global sales in the quarter included a $502 million contribution from the COVID-19 vaccine, bringing the year-to-date total to $766 million. Through the first 9 months of the year, revenue has been recorded at a not-for-profit price of $7.50. 
I'll now turn your attention to the Medical Devices segment. Worldwide Medical Devices sales of $6.6 billion increased 7% with growth of 0.8% in the U.S. and growth of 13.3% outside of the U.S. Excluding the impact of divestitures, worldwide growth was 7.6%. In the Medical Devices segment, we have seen mixed marketplace recovery as the COVID-19 Delta variant and related factors impacted our sales across most of the categories in which we participate within the quarter, with certain procedures such as spine and knees within Orthopaedics deemed to be more elective in nature continuing to lag in terms of recovery. 
The Interventional Solutions franchise delivered another quarter of worldwide double-digit growth at 13.2%, driven by market recovery success of new products in both electrophysiology and neurovascular and strong commercial execution. Worldwide surgery grew 10.2%, primarily driven by recovering procedure volumes and market expansion in Asia Pacific. Advanced Surgery grew 12.6% globally driven by the positive impact of procedure recovery, new product introductions and China Tier 2 and 3 hospital market expansion across endocutters, biosurgicals and energy, partially offset by continued competitive pressure in endocutters and energy in the U.S. Building on the Monarch robotic milestone communicated last quarter, we reached another significant commercial achievement now enabling over 10,000 bronchoscopy procedures. 
General Surgery grew 8.1% globally. Wound closure is the largest contributor with growth driven by procedure recovery China Tier 2 and 3 hospital market expansion and continued competitive growth in both traditional and barbed suture markets. 
The worldwide Orthopedics franchise declined 0.3% with U.S. declines of 4.5%, reflecting the impact of COVID-19 on procedures within the quarter, partially offset by 6.8% OUS growth. Trauma grew 3.7% globally, 5.3% increase in the U.S. and a 0.9% increase outside the U.S. Results reflect global market recovery dynamics and the success of recent product introductions like our cannulated compression headless screws, advanced nailing systems and Fibe link. 
Hips grew 2.3% globally driven by recovery in procedures primarily outside the U.S. and continued leadership in the anterior approach, supported by our robust portfolio of new products, such as active femoral stem; PINNACLE Mobility and VELYS hip navigation. In Q3, we introduced new image guidance capability for VELYS hip navigation, which supports surgeons who prefer the posterior approach in addition to the interior approach. 
Knees grew 2.1% this quarter, reflecting recovery of procedures, especially in markets outside of the U.S.; growth in the U.S. outpatient surgery channel and continued momentum from recently launched products, including the VELYS robotic-assisted solution and our knee portfolio. Results in the quarter also benefited from the timing of international tender orders worth approximately 350 basis points of global growth. 
Lastly, within Orthopaedics, Spine declined 11% globally, driven primarily by a deceleration in procedure volume related to COVID-19. The worldwide vision franchise grew 10% this quarter, primarily driven by market recovery, commercial initiatives and new products driving enhanced competitiveness. Contact lens global growth of 6.4% reflects continued positive momentum for our market-leading ACUVUE portfolio, success of commercial initiatives and recently launched products such as ACUVUE OASYS multifocal and ACUVUE DEFINE FRESH. The decline of 4.3% in the U.S. includes a negative impact of prior year stocking worth about 10 points. 
Surgical Vision delivered global growth of 22.1% driven by market recovery across all regions and success of recently launched products continuing to enhance competitiveness, including TECNIS Eyhance and TECNIS Synergy. 
Now regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2021, I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold improved by 200 basis points, driven by recovery from prior year COVID-19-related impacts and favorable enterprise mix from growth in Pharmaceuticals. We continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing 14.7% of sales this quarter. The $3.4 billion investment was a 20.5% increase versus the prior year due to portfolio progression. In-process research and development reflect a partial impairment expense of $900 million for assets associated with the acquisition of Auris. The other income and expense line changed from a net expense of $1.2 billion in the third quarter of 2020 to net expense of $1.9 billion in the third quarter of 2021, primarily due to an increase in litigation-related charges. Joe will provide more details on both the IP R&D and litigation-related charges. 
Regarding taxes in the quarter, on a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate was 4.7% in the third quarter of 2021 compared to 19.2% in the third quarter of 2020, mostly driven by unfavorable tax reserves and positions from the prior year, which did not reoccur, along with lower income and higher tax jurisdictions driven by onetime current quarter special items. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 13.5% versus 19% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming third quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax matters. 
Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the back section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. 
In the third quarter of 2021, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales remained fairly consistent to the prior year with some changes between our 3 segments. Pharmaceutical margins declined from 46.4% to 43.9%, driven by research and development investment to enable portfolio progression. Medical Devices margin improved from 21.6% to 25.5%, driven by recovery from prior year COVID-19-related impacts and overall expense leveraging resulting from sales recovery. Finally, Consumer Health margins declined from 24.4% to 23.3%, driven by a 2020 onetime item and increased brand marketing expenses, partially offset by COGS improvement. 
That concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson & Johnson third quarter results. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk."

We appreciate you joining us to discuss our third quarter results, which reflect the continued strength in our Pharmaceutical and Consumer Health businesses and solid growth in Medical Devices despite COVID-19",1688,"Thank you, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us to discuss our third quarter results, which reflect the continued strength in our Pharmaceutical and Consumer Health businesses and solid growth in Medical Devices despite COVID-19 variability across geographies. How do we see the current Medical Device landscape? In the U.S., surgical procedures across most specialties in which we compete decelerated in late July and August, with the highest impacts consistently in those procedures deemed to be more elective such as knees and spine. Globally, new cases of COVID-19 and hospitalizations related to the Delta variant have gradually declined in recent weeks, and we are encouraged by more positive procedure trends in many Western European markets where restrictions are beginning to ease. Some hotspots still remain in parts of the U.S., the U.K., Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia, and the growing impact from reduced medical staffing are constraining procedure volumes. We continue to believe these variables are more short term in nature and the medical devices market remains attractive as the long-term factors leading to the need for medical and surgical intervention have not changed due to COVID-19. 
The segment leaders on the call will provide more insights into each of their businesses during the Q&A, but let me briefly touch upon some pipeline updates for the quarter. 
We continued to advance our strong pipeline of innovative medicines and products. This progress is supported by our commitment to investments in R&D that have increased $1.9 billion or 23% on a year-to-date basis. In the quarter, we received U.S. approval for INVEGA [ Hafyera ], the first and only twice-yearly treatment for adults with schizophrenia. And we announced the start of a Phase III study of our investigational RSV vaccine in older adults. 
Subsequent to the quarter, the FDA granted orphan drug designation for nipocalimab in chronic inflammatory demililinating polyneuropathy or CIDP, a rare neurological disorder of the peripheral nerves characterized by gradually increasing sensory loss and weakness associated with loss of reflexes. This represents nipocalimab's fourth orphan drug designation. We also anticipate U.S. approval for our BCMA CAR-T later this year, which will represent a third new product approval in 2021. 
However, we are stopping further investigation in the Fontan-paliated population of macitentan 10-milligram in pulmonary hypertension as results from the Roboto Phase III trial did not yield sufficient clinical benefit. 
Regarding our COVID-19 vaccine, we are pleased that on Friday, the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee voted unanimously to recommend Emergency Use Authorization for a booster dose of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine for adults aged 18 and older, at least 2 months following initial single-shot vaccine. The recommendation is based on the totality of evidence with clinical and real-world data showing that while a single shot offers strong and lasting protection, a booster increases protection, particularly against symptomatic COVID-19. We are very excited to share more about the entirety of our robust pharmaceutical pipeline and long-term growth outlook at our business review on November 18. 
In our Medical Device business, we built upon a record number of 17 significant product introductions in the first half of 2021 by introducing the INHANCE shoulder system in the third quarter, a first-to-market fully integrated shoulder arthroplasty system designed to treat a broad range of cases in hospital or outpatient settings where economic value and operational efficiency are important considerations. 
We also announced results from a real-world study showing that the ECHELON circular powered stapler is associated with a major reduction in serious complications following colorectal surgery when compared with manual staplers, reinforcing clinical evidence as a meaningful differentiator in product selection. 
Let's transition to financials, starting with commentary on special items for the quarter. Other income and expense in the third quarter includes a $2.1 billion charge of litigation expenses, primarily driven by an incremental $1.4 billion charge associated with the recently announced qualified settlement fund for current and future talc claims. The qualified settlement fund is intended to facilitate a final equitable resolution of all talc litigation in a structured manner through established bankruptcy law precedent. Additionally, there is another $800 million legal expense in the quarter, representing final resolution of outstanding claims related to RISPERDAL. 
Another special item worth noting is on the in-process research and development line. We have a broad offering across the digital robotic surgery landscape and continue to make meaningful progress in advancing differentiated solutions across our portfolio. We are very pleased with the adoption of our Monarch platform for lung bronchoscopy and are well on our way to expanding Monarch indications, including initiating a clinical trial exploring the potential for localized drug delivery for the treatment of lung cancer and submitting an application to the FDA for Monarch to be used in the treatment of kidney stones. 
Our VELYS robotic-assisted solution for total knee replacement is commercialized in the U.S., has received several OUS approvals, and we are experiencing higher utilization on the systems placed to date than we projected. We continue to be committed to the development of a general surgery offering with Ottava. But as Sarah mentioned, we recorded a partial in-process R&D charge for $900 million in the third quarter. The accounting for this charge contemplates a first-in-human delay of approximately 2 years from our earlier projections of the second half of 2022, reflecting technical development challenges and COVID-19-related disruption, including supply chain constraints being experienced broadly across all industries. Clearly, we realize the importance that a differentiated digital robotic platform can have for patient outcomes and the market. We continue to invest in and be committed to the platform, and we'll provide updates to the external community as warranted. 
Let's transition to a few comments on our cash position. We continue to generate strong free cash flow with $15 billion year-to-date. We ended the third quarter with $31 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $34 billion of debt, resulting in $3 billion of net debt. Our financial position and balance sheet remains strong, and we are well positioned to continue to deploy capital in a strategic, value-creating way, consistent with our priorities that will benefit stakeholders over the long term. 
Moving to our full year 2021 guidance. Given where we are in the year, our current assumptions around continued recovery in medical device markets and confidence in the business, we are tightening our adjusted operational sales range to 12.9% to 13.5%. This adjusted operational sales growth is on a constant currency basis, consistent with how we assess our business performance. This guidance also incorporates the estimated $2.5 billion of COVID-19 vaccine sales, consistent with our July guidance. We are maintaining our estimate for the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of approximately 50 basis points, resulting in an operational sales range of 12.4% to 13.0% or $92.8 billion to $93.3 billion for a midpoint of 12.7% or $93.1 billion. 
As you know, we do not predict the impact of currency movements, but utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.16, there's an estimated positive impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 150 basis points, consistent with our July guidance, resulting in estimated reported sales growth between 13.9% and 14.5% compared to 2020 or $94.1 billion to $94.6 billion. 
Moving to other items of the P&L. Consistent with our previous guidance, you can expect our operating margins to be nearly a 200 basis point improvement over last year. Given year-to-date trends, we are modestly increasing and tightening our other income estimate to be a range of $900 million to $950 million. Regarding interest expense, again, based on our year-to-date experience, we are also tightening the range of our estimate to $100 million to $150 million. And finally, we are lowering our effective tax rate estimate to a range of 14.5% to 15.5% based on the occurrence of certain onetime favorable tax positions and settlements, both in the U.S. and abroad. Considering those updates, we are comfortable with adjusted earnings per share guidance ranging from $9.65 to $9.70 on a constant currency basis, a guidance increase of $0.13 at the midpoint. 
While not predicting currency movements, but to provide some insights on the potential impact on EPS, our reported adjusted EPS would be positively impacted by approximately $0.12 per share. Accounting for that, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting reported adjusted EPS ranging from $9.77 to $9.82, an increase versus 2020 of 22% at the midpoint. 
Consistent with what we shared before, given the not-for-profit nature of the vaccine, there is no significant EPS contribution in 2021, and therefore, the EPS guidance I provided is inclusive of the vaccine revenue. As always, none of our achievements are possible without the hard work of our world-class team of employees around the globe whose dedication ensures that we deliver for all our stakeholders. We continue to make significant strides towards our mission of improving human health and well-being of everyone, everywhere, and I am grateful for their efforts and commitment. 
I'd like to close my prepared remarks by briefly commenting on the CEO transition that was announced earlier in the third quarter. First, I want to acknowledge Alex for his leadership and contributions to Johnson & Johnson during his tenure. It has been my pleasure to work alongside him, particularly over the last 3 years and to observe and to learn from him, both professionally and personally. I'm also pleased to congratulate Joaquin on his new role starting this January. I know firsthand that he shares the same commitment to patients, employees and society that Alex considered core. Joaquin similarly values innovation that underscores our strategy for long-term success. Both gentlemen will be featured at the previously mentioned November 18 Analyst Day, sharing their thoughts on our business and plans for the future. 
I am pleased our worldwide chairs, Ashley McEvoy, Thibaut Mongon and Jennifer Taubert, are here with me today to address your questions. Jen McIntyre from our Investor Relations team will facilitate the Q&A portion of the call. So I will now turn it over to her to begin the Q&A. Jen?"

And then just kind of maybe building on that. As we think out to 2022, I know you're not giving guidance yet, but is there more in the way of COVID recovery that can aid growth next year as you think about the portfolio as a whole? So I guess I'm trying to get to basically as pharma growth is sustainable at these levels. And should we think about still device growth maybe above historic levels as we kind of get COVID more in the rearview mirror a bit?"

Let me answer some of it quantitatively, and then maybe I'll hand it over to Ashley and Jennifer to discuss their outlook for their particular segments. 
In terms of the guidance for the balance of the year as it relates to where we ended the third quarter, if you look at what, I guess, has been labeled early morning here as a miss, I would say, I think about it in 2 categories: the vaccine quite frankly; and as you saw, we did not change the full year guidance. So that is simply timing. We expect that to be fulfilled in the fourth quarter, and we're still very much committed to the $2.5 billion of revenue and the supply that is correlated to that. 
With respect to Medical Devices, I think we're very pleased that we had a above 7% growth in the quarter, given the different dynamics of Delta variant and hospital shortages. And we do anticipate that those procedures will be recovered. It's hard to say whether they'll be recovered in the fourth quarter or early next year. So that could provide some tailwind as you think about 2022. But let me turn it over first to Ashley to comment on Medical Devices, and then to Jennifer to discuss Pharmaceuticals."

I would -- when I look at quarter 3, as we shared, procedures across most categories in which we participated did decelerate through the quarter, primarily due to, obviously, the Delta. 
So if I take you a little bit around the world, Asia Pacific in aggregate continues to operate above pre-COVID levels. However, COVID does continue to be a challenge with like mobility restrictions being reinstated or remaining in places like Japan, Australia, Southeast Asia. China clearly is setting a new pace for the world. When we look in the United States, we saw procedure trends decelerate in quarter 3. You'll recall on our quarter 2 call, we were feeling pretty good around 5% growth in procedures in May. We saw a stabilization in June and July. In August, we saw the numbers of procedures dipped around mid-single digit, and we saw that continue into the early part of September. We are starting to see qualitatively recover from hospital systems the past 4 weeks. When we look at early indicators of really filling the patient funnel, we look at diagnostic procedures in the past 4 weeks, we're seeing diagnostic procedures in the United States flat relative to pre-COVID numbers. And as we talked about, we do expect some micro surges in areas like the Northwest as well as the Midwest. 
And then in EMEA, rounding it out, we are encouraged that countries are beginning to ease the strict mobility restrictions and are really starting to resume procedures, given the vaccine deployment acceleration, the decrease in rates of new cases and hospitalizations and overall procedure volumes are gradually improving, like Spain, Italy, Germany are all above pre-COVID. The U.K., where I was just there 2 weeks ago, clearly below 2019, long waiting lists, really working to go make progress on that patient funnel. 
I'll turn it to Jen for any other commentary."

Those areas, we have seen strong recovery, and we believe that the trajectory on those assets is really going to continue. So continued trajectory in '21 and into '22. 
On the area, part of the market where we're still seeing a bit of a slower recovery, but we're starting to see it tick back. It's really in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, cell lymphoma. The market where IMBRUVICA is right now, from IMBRUVICA, we've just achieved double-digit growth ex U.S. in the U.S., it's actually been a little bit lower than that. And so I think that's 1 that as you take a look and we move into 2022, we're anticipating to see some positive recovery there.

Let me start this response by underscoring just our conviction in the safety based on decades of science that these products are safe.

We initiated this process specifically for cosmetic talc claims, both current and future. And while we believe the cases lack merit, and by the way, an overwhelming number of courts, juries and judges who have opined on this to full adjudication ultimately agree with us, we did establish a $2 billion qualified settlement fund. But as you note in your question, Josh, it's really the bankruptcy courts that will ultimately decide this. It's not plaintiff attorneys. It's not Johnson & Johnson. But we do know that based on prior experience precedent, that claimants are far better off and clarity and resolution is in the best interest of all stakeholders.

And before I get to quarter 4, let me just give a quick frame for quarter 3, just so at a macro level. First is really the market. And while COVID-19 has temporarily disrupted the med tech markets, we absolutely believe that the underlying foundation of these end-state markets continue to remain attractive, really due to what we say are oodles of clinical unmet need and, quite frankly, the overall state of the technology on the S curve. 
A quick refresh is our standing and our competitiveness as the second largest med tech company with 11 platforms delivering at least $1 billion in annual sales. We are very much focused on competitiveness and innovation. In quarter 2, almost all of our priority platforms held or gained share. Some notables include continuing to enhance our global market position in electrophysiology, biosurgery, gain share in hips. Seen the impact of recent innovation in surgical vision, now seeing several sequential quarters of share gains and even seeing stabilization in knees year-to-date. So really about our focus on commercial effectiveness and our ability to deliver innovation. 
As Joe mentioned earlier, in 2021, we had 17 new product launches to-date, and this is a significant amount over last year. So year-to-date through 2021, Larry, we are tracking to 5% growth versus 2019. We did achieve 4% growth in quarter 3. Obviously, that's an improvement of how we exited 2019, the full year. 
And then last, I would just say, you heard us talk a lot about digital surgery. We're absolutely committed to leading in the future of surgery and making it -- our medical innovation smarter, less invasive and more personalized. Joe talked a little bit about our Monarch reaching 10,000 patients this year, has a very rich pipeline. VELYS knees is now approved in 5 countries. Our smart digital tools continue to scale. And lastly, Ottava, our soft tissue offering, you heard a share, we're experiencing a temporary setback in its development. Transformational innovation is all kinds of fun. I will tell you it's highly complex, but sometimes, we do experience technical challenges, but we are absolutely committed resolving our challenges, continuing to invest and bringing to market a competitive, differentiated offering as soon as possible. 
When we look at quarter 4, we do expect to see continued improvement. We do expect hospitals are going to have to continue to manage through labor shortages. I don't expect that to get better in quarter 4 nor in 2022, but they've been quite masteral on how to manage patient flows. We are, when I talk to hospital systems over the past 3 weeks, in particular in the United States, they are ramping up again and resuming elective procedures. We're keeping our eye on vaccination rates, patient sentiment, the cold weather. But we do -- we are planning for a strong recovery in quarter 4 versus how we exited quarter 3."

With respect to CSO, we have not had a chance to acknowledge just really the impact that Paul has had on the scientific community, not just here at Johnson & Johnson, but across the globe. He was a pioneer in infectious diseases. When nobody had an answer for HIV, Paul emerged as clearly a leader there. And then just most recently, his notable leadership on the COVID-19 vaccine, again, here at J&J, but also on the global stage. 
I think that probably the greatest testament to Paul's legacy is the fact that our R&D investment this year is 23% higher through 9 months than what it was last year. And last year was a record-setting year in terms of what we've invested in innovation. We've got a great team of scientists that Paul has assembled over the years across all of our therapeutic areas, across all of our franchises. And I just look forward to the success that they will continue to carry on that Paul has really, I guess, cement it in terms of how we approach our business."

And so the team -- the total team from R&D to supply chain to commercial has been really, really invested in this asset over the past couple of years preparing to launch. I think the results that you've all seen and the really deep and durable responses that have been proven through our clinical programs really highlight that this is a really meaningful and transformational asset for patients. 
As we have been planning the launch, we're really taking a thoughtful to scaling our global manufacturing, making sure that we're learning from those who've come before us, and that we're really going to plan to deliver an optimal patient experience and patient treatment or provider treatment experience as well as we scale up. So the team has been working very heavily on this, and we're gearing up for what we believe will be a very successful launch for patients, hopefully later this year. 
I also want to call out the very strong partnership that we have with Legend Biotech, where we've been attached at the hip. And we're so excited to be working in partnership with them to be bringing that to market. So looking forward to a good launch later this year."

As Joe shared earlier, the utilization rates are very encouraging from hospital systems that have adopted this new technology. That, coupled with a very proven differentiated at knee implant with a revision offering as well as a cementless rotating platform, all really helped shore up, I would say, our portfolio in knees. 
And then you mentioned the channel, and we are seeing really healthy growth in the ASC channel. We continue to be encouraged by market share gains predominantly in joints in ASCs. And really, we start to deploy what we call an advanced case management, which is really how you simplify pre-op planning in ASCs. And that new advanced case management service is starting to really take effect. And we expect to have these new sites of care start to really improve not just in -- not just in the U.S. but even in areas of Europe and really moving joints to more of a day surgery.

I think what we're planning for quarter 4 is, I think we'll still continue to see micro surges in cases. There'll always be little hotspots. Hospitals are still going to experience some labor challenges. We don't see that getting better in the near term immediately. 
I will qualify that though to say that they have been, quite frankly, masters at understanding how to manage patient flow and procedure flow. When we look at diagnostic and routine screenings and surgical procedures, we expect the trends will continue to recover globally similar to the trends we saw in quarter 2, where surgical procedures grew low single digit above 2019 baseline. 
As we've referenced, there are more procedural backlogs in the highly elective procedures like knees and spine. And we expect those to recover, although maybe not as in terms of hospital capacity at levels significantly above 2019 in the near term. But I would just say, going into November, relative to where we were entering November last year, we are encouraged to look at the worldwide case data to look at the worldwide hospitalization data and the freeing up of mobility restrictions. So we are encouraged by [ quarter-over core ] performance from 2021 Q4 versus last year. You'll recall, we ended around 1.5% Medical Device did in revenue versus 2019. So we are anticipating a healthier recovery."

A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com, where you can also find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules.
Please note that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review the cautionary statements included in today's presentation, which identifies certain risks and factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. 
In particular, there is uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other marketplace dynamics. This means that results could change at any time, and the contemplated impact of COVID-19 on the company's business results and outlook is a best estimate based on the information available as of today's date. 
A further description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2020 Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Qs, along with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures. These materials are also available at investor.jnj.com.
Several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships.
Moving to today's agenda. I will review the third quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and the 3 segments. Joe will provide some additional business and financial commentary, before providing an overview of our cash position and capital allocation, and then conclude with updated guidance on 2021 results. The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last up to 60 minutes. Now let's move to the third quarter results. 
Worldwide sales were $23.3 billion for the third quarter of 2021, an increase of 10.7% versus the third quarter of 2020. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 9.9% as currency had a positive impact of 0.8 points. In the U.S., sales increased 7.9%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported growth was 13.8%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 12.1%, with currency positively impacting our reported OUS results by 1.7 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 10.6% worldwide, 8% in the U.S. and 13.5% outside the U.S.
Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $3.7 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $1.37 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.33 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $7 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.60, representing increases of 18.7% and 18.2%, respectively, compared to the third quarter of 2020. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 16.4%.
I will now comment on business segment sales performance, highlighting items that build upon the slides you have in front of you. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the third quarter of 2020 and, therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation. 
Beginning with Consumer Health. Worldwide Consumer Health sales of $3.7 billion increased 4.1% with growth of 4.5% in the U.S. and growth of 3.7% outside of the U.S. Excluding the impact of divestitures, worldwide growth was 5.7%. Although there is variability across the franchises due to the impact of COVID-19, the overall portfolio is performing well. When comparing to 2019, the Consumer Health business grew approximately 8% operationally in the quarter.
Over-the-counter medicines saw strong growth of 18.2% globally due to share gains in the U.S., along with an increase of pediatric fever incidences and demand for vaccination symptom relief that drove increased sales of TYLENOL and MOTRIN globally. Additionally, category recovery increased demand for cough, cold, flu and digestive health brands, such as IMODIUM. Sales outside the U.S. benefited from prior year comparisons, specifically prior year reduction in consumption in China.
Our Skin Health/Beauty franchise declined by 3% globally, largely due to the 330 basis point impact of the divestiture of Sedona, the salon-based portion of Dr. Ci Labo in Asia Pacific. Excluding this impact, the franchise experienced modest growth driven by strong performance in AVEENO and NEUTROGENA facial moisturizing and body care, driven by COVID-19 market recovery and e-commerce growth, partially offset by external supply constraints and lost sales from the sun aerosol recall.
Oral Care declined 4.5% globally, largely due to the impact of divestitures worth approximately 300 basis points. Excluding this impact, the franchise declined due to external supply constraints for LISTERINE in the U.S. and negative comparisons to prior year COVID-19-related impacts in EMEA, partially offset by strong performance in Asia Pacific, driven by strong promotions and brand building behind LISTERINE germ fighting ability.
The Baby Care franchise declined 1.2% globally, resulting from Asia Pacific COVID-19 lockdowns and competitive pressure, mostly offset by strong AVEENO performance, along with category and e-commerce growth in the U.S. Our Women's Health franchise grew 0.8% globally, primarily due to lapping prior year COVID-19 impacts. And finally, our Wound Care franchise declined 4.8% globally, driven by unfavorable comparisons to prior year stocking in the U.S. and competitive pressure in Asia Pacific.
Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $13 billion increased 13.2% with growth of 12.2% in the U.S. and growth of 14.6% outside of the U.S. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide growth was 13.8%. Additionally, as a reminder, for comparison purposes, Q3 of 2020 was negatively impacted by access-related constraints due to COVID-19, resulting in a decrease of roughly 200 basis points in total across key brands. Our strong portfolio of products and commercial capabilities continued to enable us to deliver adjusted operational growth at above-market levels.
The immunology portfolio delivered strong global sales growth of 11.7%, driven by double-digit performance of STELARA and TREMFYA, offset by declines in REMICADE due to biosimilar competition. STELARA continued to show strength in all regions, growing at 21.7%, driven by market growth and share gains of roughly 4 points in Crohn's disease and nearly 7 points in ulcerative colitis in the U.S. 
TREMFYA was up 63.5%, with strong double-digit growth worldwide due to continued positive share growth and additional penetration into the psoriatic arthritis indication. U.S. share increased over 2 points in psoriasis and over 3 points in psoriatic arthritis.
Oncology also delivered another strong quarter with global sales growth of 16.5%. DARZALEX continued its double-digit performance with 42.9% growth in the quarter, driven by share gains, increased penetration of the subcutaneous formulation in the U.S. and EU and continued launches globally. DARZALEX grew share across all lines of therapy with nearly 5 points of share growth in the U.S. this quarter, as an example.
ERLEADA also continued its global uptake with growth of 65.8% in the quarter, driven by global market share gains, which increased in the U.S. alone by nearly 2 points across all indications led by the metastatic indication. IMBRUVICA grew 2.5% globally due to the brand's market-leading share position but was partially offset by modest share losses in the U.S. and a market that remains constrained due to temporary COVID-19 impact on new patient starts. In addition, growth was negatively impacted by a prior period adjustment in the U.S. that was worth nearly 350 basis points on worldwide IMBRUVICA growth.
Neuroscience grew 4.6% globally, driven by paliperidone long-acting portfolio, posting market and share growth due to increased new patient starts and strong persistency in the U.S. The Cardiovascular, Metabolism and other business declined 12.4% globally due to competitive pressures in INVOKANA and biosimilar competition for PROCRIT.
Pulmonary Hypertension achieved strong growth of 16.1% driven by OPSUMIT growth of 17.1% and UPTRAVI growth of 18.8%, both driven by market penetration and share gains. And lastly, global sales in the quarter included a $502 million contribution from the COVID-19 vaccine, bringing the year-to-date total to $766 million. Through the first 9 months of the year, revenue has been recorded at a not-for-profit price of $7.50.
I'll now turn your attention to the Medical Devices segment. Worldwide Medical Devices sales of $6.6 billion increased 7% with growth of 0.8% in the U.S. and growth of 13.3% outside of the U.S. Excluding the impact of divestitures, worldwide growth was 7.6%. 
In the Medical Devices segment, we have seen mixed marketplace recovery as the COVID-19 Delta variant and related factors impacted our sales across most of the categories in which we participate within the quarter, with certain procedures such as spine and knees within Orthopaedics, deemed to be more elective in nature, continuing to lag in terms of recovery.  
The Interventional Solutions franchise delivered another quarter of worldwide double-digit growth at 13.2%, driven by market recovery, success of new products in both electrophysiology and neurovascular, and strong commercial execution. Worldwide surgery grew 10.2%, primarily driven by recovering procedure volumes and market expansion in Asia Pacific. 
Advanced Surgery grew 12.6% globally driven by the positive impact of procedure recovery, new product introductions and China Tier 2 and 3 hospital market expansion across endocutters, biosurgicals and energy, partially offset by continued competitive pressure in endocutters and energy in the U.S. Building on the Monarch robotic milestone communicated last quarter, we reached another significant commercial achievement, now enabling over 10,000 bronchoscopy procedures.  
General Surgery grew 8.1% globally. Wound closure is the largest contributor with growth driven by procedure recovery, China Tier 2 and 3 hospital market expansion and continued competitive growth in both traditional and barbed suture markets.  
The worldwide Orthopaedics franchise declined 0.3%, with U.S. declines of 4.5% reflecting the impact of COVID-19 on procedures within the quarter, partially offset by 6.8% OUS growth. Trauma grew 3.7% globally, 5.3% increase in the U.S. and a 0.9% increase outside the U.S. Results reflect global market recovery dynamics and the success of recent product introductions, like our Cannulated Compression Headless Screws, advanced nailing systems and FIBULINK.  
Hips grew 2.3% globally driven by recovery in procedures, primarily outside the U.S., and continued leadership in the anterior approach, supported by our robust portfolio of new products, such as ACTIS femoral stem, PINNACLE Dual Mobility and VELYS Hip Navigation. In Q3, we introduced new image guidance capability for VELYS Hip Navigation, which supports surgeons who prefer the posterior approach in addition to the anterior approach.  
Knees grew 2.1% this quarter, reflecting recovery of procedures, especially in markets outside of the U.S., growth in the U.S. outpatient surgery channel and continued momentum from recently launched products, including the VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution and our ATTUNE Knee portfolio. Results in the quarter also benefited from the timing of international tender orders worth approximately 350 basis points of global growth.
Lastly, within Orthopaedics, Spine declined 11% globally, driven primarily by a deceleration in procedure volume related to COVID-19. The worldwide Vision franchise grew 10% this quarter, primarily driven by market recovery, commercial initiatives and new products driving enhanced competitiveness. Contact lens global growth of 6.4% reflects continued positive momentum for our market-leading ACUVUE portfolio, success of commercial initiatives and recently launched products, such as ACUVUE OASYS multifocal and ACUVUE DEFINE FRESH. The decline of 4.3% in the U.S. includes a negative impact of prior year stocking worth about 10 points. Surgical vision delivered global growth of 22.1% driven by market recovery across all regions and success of recently launched products continuing to enhance competitiveness, including TECNIS Eyhance and TECNIS Synergy.  
Now regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2021, I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold improved by 200 basis points, driven by recovery from prior year COVID-19-related impacts and favorable enterprise mix from growth in Pharmaceuticals. We continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing 14.7% of sales this quarter. The $3.4 billion investment was a 20.5% increase versus the prior year due to portfolio progression. 
In-process research and development reflect a partial impairment expense of $900 million for assets associated with the acquisition of Auris. The other income and expense line changed from a net expense of $1.2 billion in the third quarter of 2020 to net expense of $1.9 billion in the third quarter of 2021, primarily due to an increase in litigation-related charges. Joe will provide more details on both the IP R&D and litigation-related charges.  
Regarding taxes in the quarter, on a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate was 4.7% in the third quarter of 2021 compared to 19.2% in the third quarter of 2020, mostly driven by unfavorable tax reserves and positions from the prior year, which did not reoccur, along with lower income and higher tax jurisdictions driven by onetime current quarter special items. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 13.5% versus 19% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming third quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the boxed section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. 
Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the third quarter of 2021, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales remained fairly consistent to the prior year with some changes between our 3 segments. Pharmaceutical margins declined from 46.4% to 43.9%, driven by research and development investment to enable portfolio progression. Medical Devices margins improved from 21.6% to 25.5%, driven by recovery from prior year COVID-19-related impacts and overall expense leveraging resulting from sales recovery. Finally, Consumer Health margins declined from 24.4% to 23.3%, driven by a 2020 onetime item and increased brand marketing expenses, partially offset by COGS improvement.  
That concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson & Johnson third quarter results. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk."

We appreciate you joining us to discuss our third quarter results, which reflect the continued strength in our Pharmaceutical and Consumer Health businesses and solid growth in Medical Devices despite COVID-19",1687,"Thank you, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us to discuss our third quarter results, which reflect the continued strength in our Pharmaceutical and Consumer Health businesses and solid growth in Medical Devices despite COVID-19 variability across geographies. 
How do we see the current medical device landscape? In the U.S., surgical procedures across most specialties in which we compete decelerated in late July and August, with the highest impacts consistently in those procedures deemed to be more elective, such as knees and spine. Globally, new cases of COVID-19 and hospitalizations related to the Delta variant have gradually declined in recent weeks, and we are encouraged by more positive procedure trends in many Western European markets where restrictions are beginning to ease. Some hotspots still remain in parts of the U.S., the U.K., Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia, and the growing impact from reduced medical staffing are constraining procedure volumes. 
We continue to believe these variables are more short term in nature, and the medical devices market remains attractive as the long-term factors leading to the need for medical and surgical intervention have not changed due to COVID-19. The segment leaders on the call will provide more insights into each of their businesses during the Q&A, but let me briefly touch upon some pipeline updates for the quarter.
We continued to advance our strong pipeline of innovative medicines and products. This progress is supported by our commitment to investments in R&D that have increased $1.9 billion or 23% on a year-to-date basis. In the quarter, we received U.S. approval for INVEGA HAFYERA, the first and only twice-yearly treatment for adults with schizophrenia. And we announced the start of a Phase III study of our investigational RSV vaccine in older adults. 
Subsequent to the quarter, the FDA granted orphan drug designation for nipocalimab in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, or CIDP, a rare neurological disorder of the peripheral nerves characterized by gradually increasing sensory loss and weakness associated with loss of reflexes. This represents nipocalimab's fourth orphan drug designation. We also anticipate U.S. approval for our BCMA CAR-T later this year, which will represent a third new product approval in 2021. However, we are stopping further investigation in the Fontan-palliated population of macitentan 10 milligram in pulmonary hypertension as results from the RUBATO Phase III trial did not yield sufficient clinical benefit. 
Regarding our COVID-19 vaccine, we are pleased that on Friday, the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee voted unanimously to recommend Emergency Use Authorization for a booster dose of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine for adults aged 18 and older at least 2 months following initial single-shot vaccine. The recommendation is based on the totality of evidence with clinical and real-world data showing that while a single shot offers strong and lasting protection, a booster increases protection, particularly against symptomatic COVID-19. We are very excited to share more about the entirety of our robust pharmaceutical pipeline and long-term growth outlook at our business review on November 18. 
In our Medical Device business, we built upon a record number of 17 significant product introductions in the first half of 2021 by introducing the INHANCE Shoulder System in the third quarter, a first-to-market, fully integrated shoulder arthroplasty system designed to treat a broad range of cases in hospital or outpatient settings where economic value and operational efficiency are important considerations. We also announced results from a real-world study showing that the ECHELON CIRCULAR Powered Stapler is associated with a major reduction in serious complications following colorectal surgery when compared with manual staplers, reinforcing clinical evidence as a meaningful differentiator in product selection. 
Let's transition to financials, starting with commentary on special items for the quarter. Other income and expense in the third quarter includes a $2.1 billion charge of litigation expenses, primarily driven by an incremental $1.4 billion charge associated with the recently announced qualified settlement fund for current and future talc claims. The qualified settlement fund is intended to facilitate a final, equitable resolution of all talc litigation in a structured manner through established bankruptcy law precedent. Additionally, there is another $800 million legal expense in the quarter, representing final resolution of outstanding claims related to RISPERDAL. 
Another special item worth noting is on the in-process research and development line. We have a broad offering across the digital robotic surgery landscape and continue to make meaningful progress in advancing differentiated solutions across our portfolio. We are very pleased with the adoption of our Monarch platform for lung bronchoscopy and are well on our way to expanding Monarch indications, including initiating a clinical trial exploring the potential for localized drug delivery for the treatment of lung cancer and submitting an application to the FDA for Monarch to be used in the treatment of kidney stones.
Our VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution for total knee replacement is commercialized in the U.S., has received several OUS approvals, and we are experiencing higher utilization on the systems placed to date than we projected. We continue to be committed to the development of a general surgery offering with Ottava. But as Sarah mentioned, we recorded a partial in-process R&D charge for $900 million in the third quarter. The accounting for this charge contemplates a first-in-human delay of approximately 2 years from our earlier projections of the second half of 2022, reflecting technical development challenges and COVID-19-related disruption, including supply chain constraints being experienced broadly across all industries. 
Clearly, we realize the importance that a differentiated digital robotic platform can have for patient outcomes and the market. We continue to invest in and be committed to the platform, and we'll provide updates to the external community as warranted. 
Let's transition to a few comments on our cash position. We continue to generate strong free cash flow with $15 billion year-to-date. We ended the third quarter with $31 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $34 billion of debt, resulting in $3 billion of net debt. Our financial position and balance sheet remains strong, and we are well positioned to continue to deploy capital in a strategic, value-creating way, consistent with our priorities that will benefit stakeholders over the long term. 
Moving to our full year 2021 guidance. Given where we are in the year, our current assumptions around continued recovery in medical device markets and confidence in the business, we are tightening our adjusted operational sales range to 12.9% to 13.5%. This adjusted operational sales growth is on a constant currency basis, consistent with how we assess our business performance. This guidance also incorporates the estimated $2.5 billion of COVID-19 vaccine sales, consistent with our July guidance. We are maintaining our estimate for the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of approximately 50 basis points, resulting in an operational sales range of 12.4% to 13.0% or $92.8 billion to $93.3 billion for a midpoint of 12.7% or $93.1 billion. 
As you know, we do not predict the impact of currency movements, but utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at $1.16, there's an estimated positive impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 150 basis points, consistent with our July guidance, resulting in estimated reported sales growth between 13.9% and 14.5% compared to 2020 or $94.1 billion to $94.6 billion. 
Moving to other items of the P&L. Consistent with our previous guidance, you can expect our operating margins to be nearly a 200 basis point improvement over last year. Given year-to-date trends, we are modestly increasing and tightening our other income estimate to be a range of $900 million to $950 million. Regarding interest expense, again, based on our year-to-date experience, we are also tightening the range of our estimate to $100 million to $150 million. And finally, we are lowering our effective tax rate estimate to a range of 14.5% to 15.5% based on the occurrence of certain onetime, favorable tax positions and settlements, both in the U.S. and abroad. Considering those updates, we are comfortable with adjusted earnings per share guidance ranging from $9.65 to $9.70 on a constant currency basis, a guidance increase of $0.13 at the midpoint. 
While not predicting currency movements, but to provide some insights on the potential impact on EPS, our reported adjusted EPS would be positively impacted by approximately $0.12 per share. Accounting for that, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting reported adjusted EPS ranging from $9.77 to $9.82, an increase versus 2020 of 22% at the midpoint. Consistent with what we shared before, given the not-for-profit nature of the vaccine, there is no significant EPS contribution in 2021 and, therefore, the EPS guidance I provided is inclusive of the vaccine revenue. 
As always, none of our achievements are possible without the hard work of our world-class team of employees around the globe, whose dedication ensures that we deliver for all our stakeholders. We continue to make significant strides towards our mission of improving human health and well-being of everyone, everywhere. And I am grateful for their efforts and commitment. 
I'd like to close my prepared remarks by briefly commenting on the CEO transition that was announced earlier in the third quarter. First, I want to acknowledge Alex for his leadership and contributions to Johnson & Johnson during his tenure. It has been my pleasure to work alongside him, particularly over the last 3 years, and to observe and to learn from him, both professionally and personally. 
I'm also pleased to congratulate Joaquin on his new role starting this January. I know firsthand that he shares the same commitment to patients, employees and society that Alex considered core. Joaquin similarly values innovation that underscores our strategy for long-term success. Both gentlemen will be featured at the previously mentioned November 18 Analyst Day, sharing their thoughts on our business and plans for the future. 
I am pleased our worldwide chairs, Ashley McEvoy, Thibaut Mongon and Jennifer Taubert, are here with me today to address your questions. Jen McIntyre from our Investor Relations team will facilitate the Q&A portion of the call. So I will now turn it over to her to begin the Q&A. Jen?"

And then just kind of maybe building on that, as we think out to 2022, I know you're not giving guidance yet, but is there more in the way of COVID recovery that can aid growth next year as you think about the portfolio as a whole? So -- and I guess what I'm trying to get to basically is pharma growth is sustainable at these levels. And should we think about still device growth maybe above historic levels as we kind of get COVID more in the rearview mirror a bit?"

Let me answer some of it quantitatively, and then maybe I'll hand it over to Ashley and Jennifer to discuss their outlook for their particular segments. 
In terms of the guidance for the balance of the year as it relates to where we ended the third quarter, if you look at what, I guess, has been labeled early morning here as a miss, I would say, I think about it in 2 categories: The vaccine quite frankly, and as you saw, we did not change the full year guidance. So that is simply timing. We expect that to be fulfilled in the fourth quarter, and we're still very much committed to the $2.5 billion of revenue and the supply that is correlated to that. 
With respect to Medical Devices, I think we're very pleased that we had above 7% growth in the quarter, given the different dynamics of Delta variant and hospital shortages. And we do anticipate that those procedures will be recovered. It's hard to say whether they'll be recovered in the fourth quarter or early next year. So that could provide some tailwind as you think about 2022. 
But let me turn it over first to Ashley to comment on Medical Devices, and then to Jennifer to discuss Pharmaceuticals."

Thanks, Joe. And thanks for the question, Chris. I would -- when I look at quarter 3, as we shared, procedures across most categories in which we participated did decelerate through the quarter, primarily due to, obviously, the Delta.
So if I take you a little bit around the world, Asia Pacific in aggregate continues to operate above pre-COVID levels. However, COVID does continue to be a challenge with like mobility restrictions being reinstated or remaining in places like Japan, Australia, Southeast Asia. China clearly is setting a new pace for the world. 
When we look in the United States, we saw procedure trends decelerate in quarter 3. You'll recall on our quarter 2 call, we were feeling pretty good around 5% growth in procedures in May. We saw a stabilization in June and July. In August, we saw the numbers of procedures dip around mid-single digit, and we saw that continue into the early part of September. We are starting to see qualitatively recover from hospital systems the past 4 weeks. When we look at early indicators of really filling the patient funnel, we look at diagnostic procedures. In the past 4 weeks, we're seeing diagnostic procedures in the United States flat relative to pre-COVID numbers. And as we talked about, we do expect some micro surges in areas like the Northwest as well as the Midwest. 
And then in EMEA, rounding it out, we are encouraged that countries are beginning to ease the strict mobility restrictions and are really starting to resume procedures. Given the vaccine deployment accelerations, the decrease in rates of new cases and hospitalizations and overall procedure volumes are gradually improving. Like Spain, Italy, Germany are all above pre-COVID. The U.K., where I was just there 2 weeks ago, clearly below 2019. Long waiting lists, really working to go, make progress on that patient funnel. 
I'll turn it to Jennifer for any other commentary."

Those areas, we have seen strong recovery, and we believe that the trajectory on those assets is really going to continue. So continued trajectory in '21 and into '22. 
On the area -- part of the market where we're still seeing a bit of a slower recovery, but we're starting to see it tick back, is really in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, the market where IMBRUVICA is right now. From IMBRUVICA, we've just achieved double-digit growth ex U.S. But in the U.S., it's actually been a little bit lower than that. And so I think that's one that as you take a look and we move into 2022, we're anticipating to see some positive recovery there.

And while COVID-19 has temporarily disrupted the med tech markets, we absolutely believe that the underlying foundation of these end-state markets continue to remain attractive, really due to what we say are oodles of clinical unmet need and, quite frankly, the overall state of the technology on the S curve. 
A quick refresh is our standing and our competitiveness as the second largest med tech company with 11 platforms, delivering at least $1 billion in annual sales. We are very much focused on competitiveness and innovation. In quarter 2, almost all of our priority platforms held or gained share. Some notables include continuing to enhance our global market position in electrophysiology, biosurgery, gaining share in hips. Seeing the impact of recent innovation in surgical vision, now seeing several sequential quarters of share gains, and even seeing stabilization in knees year-to-date. 
So this is really about our focus on commercial effectiveness and our ability to deliver innovation. As Joe mentioned earlier, in 2021, we had 17 new product launches to-date, and this is a significant amount over last year. So year-to-date through 2021, Larry, we are tracking to 5% growth versus 2019. We did achieve 4% growth in quarter 3. Obviously, that's an improvement of how we exited 2019, the full year. 
And then last, I would just say, you heard us talk a lot about digital surgery. We're absolutely committed to leading in the future of surgery and making it -- our medical innovation smarter, less invasive and more personalized. Joe talked a little bit about our Monarch reaching 10,000 patients this year, has a very rich pipeline. VELYS knees is now approved in 5 countries. Our smart digital tools continue to scale. 
And lastly, Ottava, our soft tissue offering, you heard us share, we're experiencing a temporary setback in its development. Transformational innovation is all kinds of fun, I will tell you. It's highly complex, but sometimes, we do experience technical challenges. But we are absolutely committed to resolving our challenges, continuing to invest and bringing to market a competitive, differentiated offering as soon as possible. 
When we look at quarter 4, we do expect to see continued improvement. We do expect hospitals are going to have to continue to manage through labor shortages. I don't expect that to get better in quarter 4 nor in 2022, but they've been quite masterful on how to manage patient flows. We are -- when I talk to hospital systems over the past 3 weeks, in particular in the United States, they are ramping up again and resuming elective procedures. We're keeping our eye on vaccination rates, patient sentiment, the cold weather. But we do -- we are planning for a strong recovery in quarter 4 versus how we exited quarter 3."

What I would say is, first off, I'd probably repeat the words I had both to congratulate Alex as well as Joaquin. Alex, clearly, on a stellar career, a great run as his tenure as CEO. And he'll be a very active Executive Chairman, I suspect. It's not as if he's riding completely off into the sunset. 
Joaquin values the same principles that have made Johnson & Johnson successful. That's investing in innovation and making sure that we've got differentiated products and solutions to improve the standard of health care across the globe.
The nice thing about the transition is I don't expect any significant bumps. They've worked together for a number of years. The strategies that they have talked about and that you'll probably see in the early part of Joaquin's tenure have been contemplated with Alex in mind, and they've collaborated as Chair and Vice Chair over a number of years. So I would expect, as the organization does, a very smooth transition. 
With respect to CSO, we have not had a chance to acknowledge just really the impact that Paul has had on the scientific community, not just here at Johnson & Johnson, but across the globe. He was a pioneer in infectious diseases. When nobody had an answer for HIV, Paul emerged as clearly a leader there. And then just most recently, his notable leadership on the COVID-19 vaccine, again, here at J&J, but also on the global stage. 
I think that probably the greatest testament to Paul's legacy is the fact that our R&D investment this year is 23% higher through 9 months than what it was last year. And last year was a record-setting year in terms of what we've invested in innovation. We've got a great team of scientists that Paul has assembled over the years across all of our therapeutic areas, across all of our franchises. And I just look forward to the success that they will continue to carry on, that Paul has really, I guess, cemented in terms of how we approach our business."

And so the team -- the total team from R&D to supply chain to commercial has been really, really invested in this asset over the past couple of years, preparing to launch. I think the results that you've all seen and the really deep and durable responses that have been proven through our clinical programs really highlight that this is going to be a really meaningful and transformational asset for patients. 
As we had been planning the launch, we're really taking a thoughtful approach to scaling our global manufacturing, making sure that we're learning from those who've come before us. And that we're really going to plan to deliver an optimal patient experience and a patient treatment or provider treatment center experience as well as we scale up. So the team has been working very heavily on this, and we're gearing up for what we believe will be a very successful launch for patients, hopefully later this year. 
I also want to call out the very strong partnership that we have with Legend Biotech, where we've been attached at the hip throughout. And we're so excited to be working in partnership with them to be bringing that to market. So looking forward to a good launch later this year."

That, coupled with a very proven, differentiated to knee implant with a revision offering as well as a cementless rotating platform, have all really helped shore up, I would say, our portfolio in knees. 
And then you mentioned the channel, and we are seeing really healthy growth in the ASC channel. We continue to be encouraged by our market share gains predominantly in joints in ASCs. And really, we start to deploy what we call an Advanced Case Management, which is really how you simplify the pre-op planning in ASCs. And that new Advanced Case Management service is starting to really take effect. And we expect to have these new sites of care start to really improve, not just -- and take hold not just in the U.S. but even in areas of Europe and really moving joints to more of a day surgery.

I think as the pandemic -- as we continue to work through and fulfill our existing contracts that we have throughout the globe, and as we move into more of a booster market in later '22, potentially into 2023, we'd be looking at moving into more of a commercial market.

Hospitals are still going to experience some labor challenges. We don't see that getting better in the near term immediately. I will qualify that though to say that they have been, quite frankly, masters at understanding how to manage patient flow and procedure flow. 
When we look at diagnostic and routine screenings and surgical procedures, we expect the trends will continue to recover globally similar to the trends we saw in quarter 2, where surgical procedures grew low single digit above 2019 baselines. As we've referenced, there are more procedural backlogs in the highly elective procedures, like knees and spine. And we expect those to recover, although maybe not as, in terms of hospital capacity, at levels significantly above 2019 in the near term. 
But I would just say, going into November, relative to where we were entering November last year, we are encouraged to look at the worldwide case data, to look at the worldwide hospitalization data, and the freeing up of mobility restrictions. So we are encouraged by quarter-over-quarter performance from 2021 Q4 versus last year. You'll recall, we ended around 1.5%, Medical Device did in revenue versus 2019.
