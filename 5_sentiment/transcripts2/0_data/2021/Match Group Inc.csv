Good morning, and thank you all for joining the call today. Since this is the first one of the year, I'm going to start out with sharing some of my thoughts, and then Gary is going to add a little more color to the financials. So 2020",925,"Thank you, Lance. Good morning, and thank you all for joining the call today. Since this is the first one of the year, I'm going to start out with sharing some of my thoughts, and then Gary is going to add a little more color to the financials. 
So 2020 was some year, and even though it feels like we're still dealing with some of the hangovers, all in all, I feel grateful for how we navigated the year, both as an organization and as a business. It is remarkable that despite COVID and lockdown having put a real damper to dating and meeting and socializing, we were still able to meet our goal of mid- to high-teens growth we set out at the beginning of the year. Needless to say, without COVID, it would have been an even better year. 
The thing I wanted to point out is the strength of our portfolio strategy as well as our ability to pull different levers quickly, which is what allowed us to manage through different levels of volatility we saw throughout the year. And as you're probably aware, COVID has had a resurgence in the second half of Q4. And 7 large markets, U.K. being an example, where 4 of our largest brands have a meaningful presence, are seeing an outsized drag still. 
But despite all of that, every one of our key brands grew revenue again in Q4. And at the beginning of COVID back in March, April, I don't think I could have predicted exiting the year with a 19% revenue growth and more importantly, fueled by all of our major brands. 
Investors should also take comfort in the institutional strength of the company. In addition to having delivered on business goals consistently these last 5 years of being a public company, in a year like 2020, with all of our global employees working remotely, we were also able to seamlessly navigate leadership changes and even a full separation to become an independent company. 
So as I look ahead, one thing I do see that 2020 has done, in particular, is a real step change in user behavior, not the least of which is how much of our lives and activity has moved online. And while I do think as the world gets back to normal, some of this online, offline behavior will rebalance, but parts of this online shift is definitely here to stay. And this, of course, has implications to our products, both in terms of how we evolve the experiences on our apps as well as looking at new use cases we offer to help people connect. And we think this is going to be a big area for us this year. 
And again, while we set similar levels of goals for ourselves at the beginning of the year, it is important to keep in mind that the pandemic is still disrupting our lives and activities. And we continue to see volatility, which makes predicting this year particularly challenging. For instance, in many of our western markets, we generally see a positive seasonality post-Christmas and into the new year. I always like to say single people going home for the holidays and getting nagged by their family is what causes this post-Christmas spike. This year, however, as you can imagine, it was less pronounced. 
That said, as in Q4, we're still expecting to see all of our major brands grow revenue again in Q1. And as we saw last summer and in countries that emerged from periods of lockdowns, I do expect that as vaccines roll out and things look better on the pandemic front, we will see more people pick up their dating activities and turn to our apps. 
One of the areas I wanted to talk about is an area of incremental investment and focus we're planning to make this year, which we called out in our letter. It's in our trust and safety efforts. This has been an existential area for our category since the very beginning, and here's how I think about it. 
In the real world, we've developed laws and enforcement tools and acceptable codes of behavior and rules over hundreds of years. The digital world by contrast is barely a couple of decades old, and its popularity really has only increased in the last decade. So it is going to take leadership from tech companies, regulators, law enforcement and the community at large to work through the acceptable rules and norms of this digital world. 
And so we're planning to increase investments in our own platforms. But more importantly, you will see us make an increased effort in broader initiatives like partnerships with third-party organizations, technologies, nonprofits. You're going to see us have increased collaboration with law enforcement and regulators around the world in order to be -- continue to be a leading voice on trust and safety in the digital world. 
All in all, I feel good about our product and our portfolio strategy that gives us multiple levels of growth. The value proposition of our products remains strong. And I am hopeful that the vaccine rollouts are months away, and we will be looking at more normalcy later this year. And just as I am personally looking forward to getting on a plane and visiting with our teams again, I know our users will be out there dating and meeting with the renewed perspective of what connections and relationships mean to them. 
So with that, I'm going to hand it over to Gary."

Q4 saw our fastest top line growth of the year, 19% year-over-year, a 1 point acceleration from Q3 levels. Tinder grew direct revenue 13%, and the non-Tinder businesses continued to accelerate, with direct revenue up 28% year-over-year. Al",1318,"Thanks, Shar. Q4 saw our fastest top line growth of the year, 19% year-over-year, a 1 point acceleration from Q3 levels. Tinder grew direct revenue 13%, and the non-Tinder businesses continued to accelerate, with direct revenue up 28% year-over-year. 
All major non-Tinder brands contributed year-over-year direct revenue growth in Q4. This was the third consecutive quarter of non-Tinder brands showing growth in aggregate. 
Pairs as well as our newer brands, Hinge, Chispa, BLK and Plenty of Fish live streaming all grew rapidly in the quarter. We believe Q4 results would have been even better had COVID lockdowns not sent so many people back inside their homes and colder weather limited people's activities in many parts of the globe. The growth in Q4 was very balanced by geography, with each of North America and international contributing 19% year-over-year direct revenue growth. 
Indirect revenue grew 35% year-over-year as many marketers looked to deploy unspent budgets in Q4. Average subscribers increased 1.1 million over the prior year to 10.9 million, representing 12% year-over-year growth, up 9% in North America and 14% internationally. 
Year-over-year, Tinder's average subscribers were up over 800,000 or 14%, and non-Tinder brands were up over 300,000 or 8%. Recall that Q4 tends to be our weakest quarter seasonally for subscriber growth. Virtually all of the sequential subscriber growth in Q4 came from Tinder. 
Subscriber growth, particularly at Tinder's broad global business, was impacted by COVID-related effects in a number of key markets, including India, Brazil and Western Europe, particularly the U.K. Total company ARPU was up 5% year-over-year to $0.62, up 7% in North America and 4% internationally. Tinder ARPU was down slightly year-over-year due to a softness in the a la carte revenue as COVID lockdowns increased and a deliberately slower-than-expected rollout of Tinder platinum, which we decided to only make available to existing Tinder subscribers in Q4. 
Non-Tinder brands 16% year-over-year ARPU growth was remarkable. All major non-Tinder brands increased ARPU year-over-year in Q4. Pricing optimization at Hinge and OkCupid, the launch of a la carte features at Hinge and Plenty of Fish live streaming revenue were major contributors to the ARPU improvement in the quarter. 
Operating income grew 17%, and EBITDA grew 13% year-over-year in Q4. EBITDA margins were 38%, 1.8 points lower than in Q4 '19 primarily because of higher cost of revenue and sales and marketing spend. 
Sales and marketing spend was up $34 million or 34% year-over-year as we try to take advantage of new channels in Japan and spent into the well-received Match Made in Hell campaign. Marketing spend represented 21% of total revenue in Q4, in line with Q3 levels but up 3 points from the year-ago period. Cost of revenue was impacted by higher IFPs, web hosting costs and fees related to live streaming video at Plenty of Fish. 
For the full year, we achieved nearly $2.4 billion of total revenue, up 17% and almost $900 million of EBITDA, up 15%. Despite all the challenges posed by COVID, we delivered on the mid- to high teens revenue and EBITDA targets we set a year ago. 
Our gross and net leverage declined to 4.3x and 3.5x, respectively, down from 4.8x and 4.6x at the time of the separation from IAC. We are pleased to see net leverage already well below 4x. 
We ended the quarter with $739 million of cash on hand. Due to timing of certain payments, our EBITDA to free cash flow conversion rate was higher in Q4 than it had been year-to-date through September. As a result, our 2020 full year free cash flow conversion was similar to 2019 levels. 
As we discussed in our shareholder letter, there is much uncertainty as we begin 2021. We expect COVID will continue to be a headwind for subscriber growth in the first half of 2021 but are hoping for improvement as the vaccine rollout gains steam. Factoring this in, we believe we can generate $2.75 billion to $2.85 billion of total revenue in 2021, representing another year of mid- to high teens top line growth. 
We anticipate strong contributions to growth by both the Tinder and non-Tinder brands. We expect a combination of low double-digit subscriber growth and single-digit ARPU growth to drive company direct revenue growth. 
Our outlook also assumes indirect revenue is essentially flat year-over-year. While we expect Tinder subscriber net additions to gradually improve as 2021 progresses, our Q4 performance is testament to the fact that our growth is no longer dependent on Tinder subscriber additions. We now are a business with multiple growth drivers, and we expect the combination of these will drive strong growth in the foreseeable future. 
We expect 2021 EBITDA to exceed $1 billion with mid- to high teens year-over-year growth driven by the revenue growth and additional spend in product development, trust and safety and somewhat higher legal costs. The legal cost increase includes cost to defend the lawsuit by former Tinder employees, which is scheduled to go to trial late this year. 
Incremental product development spend will be focused in 3 buckets: one, continued investment in our emerging brands such as Ablo, Hawaya and Pairs Engage, the latter 2 of which are targeted primarily at growth in Asia; two, adding to our tech and video capabilities as we expand our product use cases; and three, supporting growth at Tinder, Hinge and our other key brands. 
Given the investments we think are appropriate, we may not expand margins this year. Underlying that is an assumption that conditions will create an environment where our anticipated spend levels, particularly in marketing, makes sense, and that is far from certain in the current tumultuous climate. We intend to continue to be flexible and adjust quickly as we have throughout the past year in the face of the pandemic. 
In 2021, we expect to again derive meaningful growth from newer brands such as Hinge, Chispa and BLK, which have recently reached or are close to reaching profitability. As these brands continue to improve their margins, overall company margins will benefit as well. We continue to expect to gradually increase company margins in subsequent years to reach our long-term target of 40%. 
We expect 2021 capital expenditures of approximately $80 million as we build out new office space in New York and L.A. We expect free cash flow conversion levels in 2021 to be similar to those of the prior 2 years. 
We do not expect to be a full U.S. federal cash taxpayer until 2023. We expect stock-based compensation for the full year 2021 to be approximately $100 million, and depreciation and amortization to total approximately $45 million. 
For Q1, we expect total revenue of $645 million to $655 million, which will represent 18% to 20% year-over-year growth. In Q1, we expect continued 20-plus percent year-over-year revenue growth levels at the non-Tinder brands and slightly stronger year-over-year growth at Tinder than we saw in Q4. We expect EBITDA of $210 million to $215 million in Q1, which reflects margins that are consistent with our typical Q1 levels. 
Our ranges for Q1 and full year 2021 factor in anticipated impacts from Google's new requirement to use their in-app billing system beginning in September. The outlook does not include potential impact from changes to IDFA, which remains difficult to quantify at this time nor any relief that might be achieved on App Store fees as a result of all the regulatory actions challenging Apple and Google's conduct or changes that the stores themselves may decide to impose. 
We are delighted to be able to provide an outlook which includes mid- to high teens revenue and EBITDA growth again for 2021 as we did for 2020 a year ago. We are hopeful that 2021 will gradually provide calmer waters on which we can execute our plan and deliver another solid year of performance for our shareholders. 
With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions."

So let me maybe first give a broader picture of how the second wave of COVID resurgence is playing out, and then I'll get into Tinder-specific impacts. So the second half of the -- of Q4 in particular and into the new year as we saw, there's been a surge in COVID and lockdowns and reduced mobility in many markets. In fact, as I mentioned in my remarks, a normal peak season looks a little different this year. U.K., that we called out specifically, looks to be one of the worst impacted, a combination perhaps of both COVID and Brexit there. But there are also less severely impacted markets throughout Europe. 
Same story here in the U.S. As we saw before, California and New York more impacted than Florida, Arizona, Texas, for instance. Again, few markets in Asia and LatAm have been impacted. And sort of similar to what we saw earlier in the year, the impacts are on both new users as well as propensity to pay, particularly a la carte. And it, of course, varies by market. 
So with all of that said broadly, Tinder specifically, obviously, the geographic exposure is greater. And so if you think about even just markets like India and Brazil alone could create 100,000 swing in subs at Tinder. And then there is the impact to a la carte, which is when propensity to pay goes down a little bit, that's the first one that gets impacted. And it hurts Tinder more because it does have a higher portion of its revenue as a la carte compared to the other brands. 
So with that all said, that hopefully answers the question of what we saw in Q4. We do -- as I mentioned, the new year is seeing an impact from COVID. But we are optimistic that as the quarter goes, Tinder is going to see accelerated growth rates here on. 
The -- based on everything that we saw over summer and what we're seeing in markets like India, in particular, in more recent weeks as lockdowns ease and mobility increases, people do turn to our apps. On platinum, we've always said it's an ARPU play. And because it is a higher-priced product, given the current environment, we have chosen to not roll it out to all users. In fact, it's currently available for current and previous subscribers only, and we will evaluate when it makes sense to roll it out to all users. 
For the user set that we've rolled it out to, it has gone as we expected. The good news is it has meaningfully improved the efficacy of the product in terms of driving messages and matches, which was the intention of this package tier. So we do believe it is a good product, and we will be watching to see the right time to roll it out fully."

Pairs has been a great contributor. It's opened new marketing channels, which sort of puts it in a really good position for 2021. And then there are new revenue initiatives like POF Live, which became meaningful contributors. And they -- basically, you had 0 revenue at the beginning of the year. 
So we do believe that all of these growth drivers and non-Tinder brands are sustainable, and they will continue to make strong contributions in 2021. And  even beyond 2021, these brands are positioned to contribute a meaningful amount of our growth as our current drivers get further supplemented by emerging brands like Hawaya, Ablo and Upward, for instance.

First of all, just to kind of step back a little bit on what's going on with gross margins, I would say that in general, our cost of revenue ex the IFPs is relatively stable. That's despite a lot of initiatives we have in there for video and other things. So we're seeing relative stability ex IF. 
On the IF side, first, naturally, we are seeing a little bit of an increase from the fact that we have a number of apps like Hinge, Chispa and BLK that are contributing, increasing revenue and are growing quickly. And those are fully paying the 30% across the board to the App Store. So the mix of our brand contribution is having some impact on the overall IFPs as a percentage of revenue. 
That said, when we look at Apple, which is the largest component of our App Store fees, there's not really flexibility there from Apple. And so we'll have to see kind of how that plays out. There's a lot of scrutiny, as I'm sure you know, related to the App Stores and conduct generally. And so we'll see how that plays out on the app front. 
On Google, more specifically, they have announced a change in policy. That would go effective in September, and that would have a meaningful impact on us if that policy change goes into effect later this year. We are having productive -- we have a productive relationship with them, and we're having good conversations. They understand the financial impact on us of their policy change, and so we're hopeful that we'll be able to find a solution that will avoid this added cost for us. 
Our ranges for the year contemplate the impact in Q4 from the Google change. So we'd be lower in the range if that played through and there was no solution, higher if there is. And so we'll see how this all plays out. 
In general, there's a lot of moving pieces with regulators around the world and a lot going on related to the App Store fees. So this is going to be a very important year, and we'll see how this plays out over the coming months related to all those discussions and considerations around the App Store fees."

About Hinge, our first goal at Hinge was to establish a strong subscription product, and then we have since launched 2 solid a la carte products. The rose and standouts, which is the equivalent of super likes on Tinder, and that has already surpassed the take rates relative to super likes on Tinder, for instance. 
Roses, interestingly, are not just a revenue product, they're actually a fairly effective engagement product that they're getting 2.5x more likely to lead to a conversation of the platform. So now ALC revenue at Hinge is already becoming a meaningful component of revenue. And it's important to note at the beginning of 2020, it was basically 0. And so in 2021, there's a full road map to make both the subscription product richer and then focus on making the overall product engagement features. 
The other thing, of course, for Hinge is user growth. And towards that end, in addition to the existing markets that we already play in, Hinge's testing a select few international markets but with this broader view of a broader international rollout in 2022. All in all, very pleased at how Hinge has been executing on their plan and all the confidence in the world that 2021 will be a great year for them. 
On IDFA, so obviously, since we're not an ad-supported business, the impact to us is mostly on the marketing spend and the user acquisition efficiency. And so there are a lot of puts and takes, and it is a little bit unclear how this all shakes out. For instance, if the targeting becomes weaker, it will have an impact on marketing efficiency. At the same time, it's unclear to what extent rates may or may not come down. 
In terms of how we measure and our spend and marketing spend attribution framework goes, we do have experience in evaluating brand spend like out-of-home and TV, et cetera. So net-net, I don't think we know quite how the market will sort itself out. I do believe it will eventually sort itself out. 
In the short term, what sort of dislocation happens is unclear, particularly in terms of what the impact will be to our marketing spend efficiency. So we're not really currently building it into our outlook yet. Gary, you wanted to add anything?"

I mean, Brent, you've watched us for a long time in terms of how we think about outlooks, and there's a lot of uncertainty as we come into this year. We're early in the year. And so naturally, we're trying to be thoughtful about not assuming too much",374,"Yes. I mean, Brent, you've watched us for a long time in terms of how we think about outlooks, and there's a lot of uncertainty as we come into this year. We're early in the year. And so naturally, we're trying to be thoughtful about not assuming too much goodness as the year goes on. We're hoping things improve. But as we provide ranges and so forth, we're trying to be cautious and thoughtful just because there are so many questions out there. 
So right now, when you look at kind of the year, for the first quarter, we gave specific expectations, which obviously assumes continued COVID headwinds. For the second quarter, we're still assuming some COVID headwinds. And it will be an easier comp in Q2 over last year because obviously, there was severe impact from COVID in the second quarter. So that's something we're factoring into our growth thoughts for Q2. 
When we get to the back half of the year, which obviously still pretty far out, we have assumed some reduction in the current COVID headwinds but not a full return to normalcy for the back half of the year. And we certainly haven't assumed any major resurgence from pent-up demand for dating activity in the second half of the year. 
It's certainly possible that, that could happen. I know there are people who believe that, that's what's going to happen. It's just too hard to predict. And so in our normal way of providing an outlook, we haven't assumed an abnormal level of dating activity, a major burst from pent-up demand in the back half of the year. 
So our plan is to kind of watch this all for a quarter or 2, see how the vaccine rollouts go, see how mobility starts to improve. Clearly, as mobility improves, we see dating activity improve and how the world starts to open up. And as the year progresses, if those trends start to be better than we had been expecting, we will adjust our outlook. 
But sitting here today, we felt that this was the right approach in terms of providing the outlook for the year. But it is something that could get adjusted later depending on what trends we see."

Now it was still -- even though it's gotten better in recent weeks, there was a material impact on some additions in Q4 because the first half of Q4 was still fairly impacted. As much as I don't want to extrapolate the India-specific story, I do -- we are seeing a correlation between increased mobility and increased activity on our platforms as markets ease out of lockdowns. We've seen that happen throughout summer in a number of other markets that have -- that go through long periods of lockdown and then ease up. 
In India again, Kunal, the other thing to note about it is we did pull back a lot of marketing spend there when we saw the real significant impact last year. But things are looking much better there, and we're going back in, and it will become an area for refocus for growth in 2021 for us."

So in addition to everything I said earlier about the importance of trust and safety in the digital world broadly, we have firsthand seen the effects of this on our category as we've developed this category over the last 15 years, right? And we know for a fact that it has an impact on category perception and penetration. And we've done a lot of work in this area, particularly in the western markets. 
More recently, Japan is a good example of a market where we've been very active on this front from initiatives that we've done on our platforms with features like verifications, our enhanced community and customer care processes. We've worked with local regulators and authorities. We've done a lot of education and outreach through marketing and PR. And all of this work has very directly in Japan actually allowed us to open up new marketing channels, for instance, out-of-home, several digital channels. We're hoping we can unlock television advertising soon there as well. 
And so those are very sort of short-term definitive things we can point to. But overall, the perception changes are meaningful in the long term for a lot of these higher stigma markets. We're starting to do similar work in India, which is why I do think we will continue to focus on moderation and safety features, both internally on our platforms. 
But one of the things we're going to amplify this year is engaging more with outreach with other organizations, third-party technologies, partnerships with nonprofits, working with regulators and engaging law enforcement. I think it's important. I'm personally committed to this, and there is a lot of work and leadership we can provide in this area more generally for digital platforms."

We didn't make as much progress on that in 2020 as we would have liked. Because of COVID, we're probably in that 17%, 18% range. 
But Asia is still very strategically important to us. We think there's real opportunity there. We've got a lot of different ways of attacking it product-wise. And we think we ultimately will get there and perhaps surpass it. 
But I think the intermediate term goal is to kind of get to 25%. We had said that would be in 2023. I think maybe we've gotten 1 year delayed from COVID. We'll see how things kind of play out. 
When you look at it, I think Asia being such a big market, you've got to take it in pieces. And so as we did say, Japan is going extremely well for us. We've got a great team there on the ground, a great one-two punch with Tinder and Pairs. And we think there's much more opportunity. We've got a matrimony product as well, which we think makes a lot of sense in that market. And we think there's more opportunity in Japan to work with multiple brands. So that's a major focus for us. 
India also continues to be a big focus for us. It's a bit of a longer-term play. We've got Tinder there, which has been very successful as well as OkCupid. I think OkCupid has gotten good traction. But with all of the COVID cases in that market in 2020, we really didn't push as hard, but we are pushing hard again at the start of 2021 with our OkCupid business in India, and we remain optimistic that we have some good products to work in the India market. 
And then we've got other markets like South Korea. That's a market we haven't quite cracked with a product yet. We think there's real opportunity there, and we need to keep trying to find something that work. So there's a -- it's a multiproduct strategy. Pairs, Tinder, OkCupid, the matrimony product, Pairs Engage, across the Asian continent. 
And then we've got Hawaya, which we're still working on the product and feel very good about. That could be a real player in Asia over time, especially in countries where there's a large Muslim populations like Indonesia, we think Hawaya could gain significant share there. So again, a bit of a longer-term play, but something that we are actively focused on and working on. 
And then we talked last year about Tinder rolling out in-app currency to focus on the Asia market, which we think is important to the Asian market and the way Asian users pay and use the products. We didn't roll that out in 2020, mostly because of COVID. But we are planning to resume that initiative for 2021 and expect to roll out in-app currency at first in a couple of Asian markets and kind of go from there. So again, something that got delayed because of COVID, but we are planning to bring that back in 2021. 
So a lot going on in Asia, remains a big focus for us. Our goals remain the same, and we're hoping to make more progress as we turn the corner here into 2021."

So as more of our lives are moving online, the opportunities for -- in real-life connections are decreasing. And meanwhile, loneliness is on the rise around the world.

So as more of our lives are moving online, the opportunities for -- in real-life connections are decreasing. And meanwhile, loneliness is on the rise around the world. And there's been some interesting lessons we've learned both from Ablo, which was designed with the thesis that during these times when the shift is going on, there are benefits to having people connections and conversations and communities with people online. 
And there's a feature on Ablo called around the world, which allows people to connect on themes like food and culture, local culture and travel and allows them to share their parts of the world with each other. And we're seeing people use that contacts to connect and chat and video chat one on one and have sort of deeper conversations with people around the world. And sometimes, these might result in relationships. 
The other big lesson for us was on POF Live. There's a few interesting anecdotal stories which sort of illustrate what it is that we're trying to do here. There was very recently one of the users on POF Live with a homeless man who started building a community, and his entire -- he's trying to turn his life around with the power of the message of positivity, and he's built a real community around it. He talks to people about positive thoughts. And he's made 100k on POF Live, and it's turned his life around. 
One of the other sort of top streamers there is an ex-vet who was suffering from deep PTSD, who's managed to turn that around and engage and build a network and a community on POF Live. And he attributes it to having saved his life. 
So this is the type of sort of human connection that we're trying to enable, which is in the context of our mission, which is of helping people make meaningful connections. So this is what's informing our belief that social discovery is going to -- which is already, by the way, popular in parts -- other parts of the world. We think this is going to become more and more popular broadly, and hence, we're looking into this space for expansion. 
The -- in terms of monetization, we do believe this sort of a platform lends itself well to virtual currencies and consumables, people gifting one another, et cetera. And those are sort of the initial things we're testing out on Ablo. And of course, POF Live has a fairly well-established monetization by way of gifting as we know. 
So we're -- it's still early days, and we're going to try a bunch of different things. We do obviously prefer direct-to-consumer revenue as opposed to ad-based models. And so that's going to be, of course, part of the work that we're going to do over the coming year. 
All right. With that, thank you all again for supporting us and being on the call today. My real hope is the vaccines come soon, we're out of this pandemic-fraught era soon. And thank you again."

Good morning, and thank you all for joining the call today. Since this is the first one of the year, I'm going to start out with sharing some of my thoughts, and then Gary is going to add a little more color to the financials.  So 2020",926,"Thank you, Lance. Good morning, and thank you all for joining the call today. Since this is the first one of the year, I'm going to start out with sharing some of my thoughts, and then Gary is going to add a little more color to the financials.  
So 2020 was some year, and even though it feels like we're still dealing with some of the hangovers, all in all, I feel grateful for how we navigated the year, both as an organization and as a business. It is remarkable that despite COVID and lockdown having put a real damper to dating and meeting and socializing, we were still able to meet our goal of mid- to high-teens growth we set out at the beginning of the year. Needless to say, without COVID, it would have been an even better year.  
The thing I wanted to point out is the strength of our portfolio strategy as well as our ability to pull different levers quickly, which is what allowed us to manage through different levels of volatility we saw throughout the year. And as you're probably aware, COVID has had a resurgence in the second half of Q4. And 7 large markets, U.K. being an example, where 4 of our largest brands have a meaningful presence, are seeing an outsized drag still.  
But despite all of that, every one of our key brands grew revenue again in Q4. And at the beginning of COVID back in March, April, I don't think I could have predicted exiting the year with a 19% revenue growth and, more importantly, fueled by all of our major brands.  
Investors should also take comfort in the institutional strength of the company. In addition to having delivered on business goals consistently these last 5 years of being a public company, in a year like 2020, with all of our global employees working remotely, we were also able to seamlessly navigate leadership changes and even a full separation to become an independent company.  
So as I look ahead, one thing I do see that 2020 has done, in particular, is a real step change in user behavior, not the least of which is how much of our lives and activity has moved online. And while I do think, as the world gets back to normal, some of this online, offline behavior will rebalance, but parts of this online shift is definitely here to stay. And this, of course, has implications to our products, both in terms of how we evolve the experiences on our apps as well as looking at new use cases we offer to help people connect, and we think this is going to be a big area for us this year.  
And again, while we set similar levels of goals for ourselves at the beginning of the year, it is important to keep in mind that the pandemic is still disrupting our lives and activities. And we continue to see volatility, which makes predicting this year particularly challenging. 
For instance, in many of our Western markets, we generally see a positive seasonality post Christmas and into the new year. I always like to say single people going home for the holidays and getting nagged by their family is what causes this post-Christmas spike. This year, however, as you can imagine, it was less pronounced.  
That said, as in Q4, we're still expecting to see all of our major brands grow revenue again in Q1. And as we saw last summer and in countries that emerged from periods of lockdowns, I do expect that, as vaccines roll out and things look better on the pandemic front, we will see more people pick up their dating activities and turn to our apps.  
One of the areas I wanted to talk about is an area of incremental investment and focus we're planning to make this year, which we called out in our letter. It's in our trust and safety efforts. This has been an existential area for our category since the very beginning, and here's how I think about it.  
In the real world, we've developed laws and enforcement tools and acceptable codes of behavior and rules over hundreds of years. The digital world by contrast is barely a couple of decades old, and its popularity really has only increased in the last decade. So it is going to take leadership from tech companies, regulators, law enforcement and the community at large to work through the acceptable rules and norms of this digital world.  
And so we're planning to increase investments in our own platforms. But more importantly, you will see us make an increased effort in broader initiatives, like partnerships with third-party organizations, technologies, nonprofits. You're going to see us have increased collaboration with law enforcement and regulators around the world in order to be -- continue to be a leading voice on trust and safety in the digital world.  
All in all, I feel good about our product and our portfolio strategy that gives us multiple levels of growth. The value proposition of our products remains strong. And I am hopeful that the vaccine rollouts are months away, and we will be looking at more normalcy later this year. And just as I am personally looking forward to getting on a plane and visiting with our teams again, I know our users will be out there dating and meeting with a renewed perspective of what connections and relationships mean to them.  
So with that, I'm going to hand it over to Gary."

Q4 saw our fastest top line growth of the year, 19% year-over-year, a 1 point acceleration from Q3 levels. Tinder grew direct revenue 13%, and the non-Tinder businesses continued to accelerate, with direct revenue up 28% year-over-year. All major non-Tinder brands contributed year-over-year direct revenue growth in Q4. This was the third consecutive quarter of non-Tinder brands showing growth in aggregate. Pairs, as well as our newer brands, Hinge, Chispa, BLK and Plenty of Fish live streaming all grew rapidly in the quarter. 
We believe Q4 results would have been even better had COVID lockdowns not sent so many people back inside their homes, and colder weather limited people's activities in many parts of the globe. The growth in Q4 was very balanced by geography, with each of North America and international contributing 19% year-over-year direct revenue growth. Indirect revenue grew 35% year-over-year as many marketers looked to deploy unspent budgets in Q4. 
Average subscribers increased 1.1 million over the prior year to 10.9 million, representing 12% year-over-year growth, up 9% in North America and 14% internationally. Year-over-year, Tinder's average subscribers were up over 800,000 or 14%, and non-Tinder brands were up over 300,000 or 8%. Recall that Q4 tends to be our weakest quarter seasonally for subscriber growth. Virtually all of the sequential subscriber growth in Q4 came from Tinder.  
Subscriber growth, particularly at Tinder's broad global business, was impacted by COVID-related effects in a number of key markets, including India, Brazil and Western Europe, particularly the U.K. Total company ARPU was up 5% year-over-year to $0.62, up 7% in North America and 4% internationally. Tinder ARPU was down slightly year-over-year due to a softness in the a la carte revenue as COVID lockdowns increased and a deliberately slower-than-expected rollout of Tinder Platinum, which we decided to only make available to existing Tinder subscribers in Q4.  
Non-Tinder brands' 16% year-over-year ARPU growth was remarkable. All major non-Tinder brands increased ARPU year-over-year in Q4. Pricing optimization at Hinge and OkCupid, the launch of a la carte features at Hinge and Plenty of Fish live streaming revenue were major contributors to the ARPU improvement in the quarter.  
Operating income grew 17%, and EBITDA grew 13% year-over-year in Q4. EBITDA margins were 38%, 1.8 points lower than in Q4 '19, primarily because of higher cost of revenue and sales and marketing spend. Sales and marketing spend was up $34 million or 34% year-over-year as we try to take advantage of new channels in Japan and spent into the well-received Match Made in Hell campaign. 
Marketing spend represented 21% of total revenue in Q4, in line with Q3 levels, but up 3 points from the year-ago period. Cost of revenue was impacted by higher IFPs, web hosting costs and fees related to live streaming video at Plenty of Fish.  
For the full year, we achieved nearly $2.4 billion of total revenue, up 17%, and almost $900 million of EBITDA, up 15%. Despite all the challenges posed by COVID, we delivered on the mid- to high-teens revenue and EBITDA targets we set a year ago.  
Our gross and net leverage declined to 4.3x and 3.5x, respectively, down from 4.8x and 4.6x at the time of the separation from IAC. We are pleased to see net leverage already well below 4x. We ended the quarter with $739 million of cash on hand. 
Due to timing of certain payments, our EBITDA to free cash flow conversion rate was higher in Q4 than it had been year-to-date through September. As a result, our 2020 full year free cash flow conversion was similar to 2019 levels.  
As we discussed in our shareholder letter, there is much uncertainty as we begin 2021. We expect COVID will continue to be a headwind for subscriber growth in the first half of 2021, but are hoping for improvement as the vaccine rollout gains steam. Factoring this in, we believe we can generate $2.75 billion to $2.85 billion of total revenue in 2021, representing another year of mid- to high-teens top line growth.  
We anticipate strong contributions to growth by both the Tinder and non-Tinder brands. We expect a combination of low double-digit subscriber growth and single-digit ARPU growth to drive company direct revenue growth. Our outlook also assumes indirect revenue is essentially flat year-over-year. 
While we expect Tinder subscriber net additions to gradually improve as 2021 progresses, our Q4 performance is testament to the fact that our growth is no longer dependent on Tinder subscriber additions. We now are a business with multiple growth drivers, and we expect the combination of these will drive strong growth in the foreseeable future.  
We expect 2021 EBITDA to exceed $1 billion with mid- to high-teens year-over-year growth driven by the revenue growth and additional spend in product development, trust and safety and somewhat higher legal costs. The legal cost increase includes cost to defend the lawsuit by former Tinder employees, which is scheduled to go to trial late this year.  
Incremental product development spend will be focused in 3 buckets: one, continued investment in our emerging brands such as Ablo, Hawaya and Pairs Engage, the latter 2 of which are targeted primarily at growth in Asia; two, adding to our tech and video capabilities as we expand our product use cases; and three, supporting growth at Tinder, Hinge and our other key brands.  
Given the investments we think are appropriate, we may not expand margins this year. Underlying that is an assumption that conditions will create an environment where our anticipated spend levels, particularly in marketing, makes sense, and that is far from certain in the current tumultuous climate. We intend to continue to be flexible and adjust quickly as we have throughout the past year in the face of the pandemic.  
In 2021, we expect to again derive meaningful growth from newer brands, such as Hinge, Chispa and BLK, which have recently reached or are close to reaching profitability. As these brands continue to improve their margins, overall company margins will benefit as well. We continue to expect to gradually increase company margins in subsequent years to reach our long-term target of 40%.  
We expect 2021 capital expenditures of approximately $80 million as we build out new office space in New York and L.A. We expect free cash flow conversion levels in 2021 to be similar to those of the prior 2 years. We do not expect to be a full U.S. federal cash taxpayer until 2023. We expect stock-based compensation for the full year 2021 to be approximately $100 million, and depreciation and amortization to total approximately $45 million.  
For Q1, we expect total revenue of $645 million to $655 million, which will represent 18% to 20% year-over-year growth. In Q1, we expect continued 20-plus percent year-over-year revenue growth levels at the non-Tinder brands and slightly stronger year-over-year growth at Tinder than we saw in Q4. We expect EBITDA of $210 million to $215 million in Q1, which reflects margins that are consistent with our typical Q1 levels.  
Our ranges for Q1 and full year 2021 factor in anticipated impacts from Google's new requirement to use their in-app billing system beginning in September. The outlook does not include potential impact from changes to IDFA, which remains difficult to quantify at this time, nor any relief that might be achieved on App Store fees as a result of all the regulatory actions challenging Apple and Google's conduct or changes that the stores themselves may decide to impose.  
We are delighted to be able to provide an outlook which includes mid- to high-teens revenue and EBITDA growth again for 2021 as we did for 2020 a year ago. We are hopeful that 2021 will gradually provide calmer waters on which we can execute our plan and deliver another solid year of performance for our shareholders.  
With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions."

So let me maybe first give a broader picture of how the second wave of COVID resurgence is playing out, and then I'll get into Tinder-specific impacts. 
So the second half of the -- of Q4 in particular and into the new year, as we saw, there's been a surge in COVID and lockdowns and reduced mobility in many markets. In fact, as I mentioned in my remarks, a normal peak season looks a little different this year. U.K., that we called out specifically, looks to be one of the worst impacted, a combination perhaps of both COVID and Brexit there, but there are also less severely impacted markets throughout Europe.  
Same story here in the U.S. As we saw before, California and New York, more impacted than Florida, Arizona, Texas, for instance. Again, few markets in Asia and LatAm have been impacted. And sort of similar to what we saw earlier in the year, the impacts are on both new users as well as propensity to pay, particularly a la carte. And it, of course, varies by market.  
So with all of that said broadly, Tinder specifically, obviously, the geographic exposure is greater. And so if you think about even just markets like India and Brazil alone could create 100,000 swing in subs at Tinder. 
And then there is the impact to a la carte, which is when propensity to pay goes down a little bit, it -- that's the first one that gets impacted, and it hurts Tinder more because it does have a higher portion of its revenue as a la carte compared to the other brands.  
So with that all said, that hopefully answers the question of what we saw in Q4. We do -- as I mentioned, the new year is seeing an impact from COVID, but we are optimistic that as the quarter goes, Tinder is going to see accelerated growth rates here on. The -- based on everything that we saw over summer and what we're seeing in markets like India, in particular, in more recent weeks as lockdowns ease and mobility increases, people do turn to our apps. 
On Platinum, we've always said it's an ARPU play, and because it is a higher-priced product, given the current environment, we have chosen to not roll it out to all users. In fact, it's currently available for current and previous subscribers only, and we will evaluate when it makes sense to roll it out to all users. For the user set that we've rolled it out to, it has gone as we expected. The good news is it has meaningfully improved the efficacy of the product in terms of driving messages and matches, which was the intention of this package tier. So we do believe it is a good product, and we will be watching to see the right time to roll it out fully."

We laid this out last quarter. Our non-Tinder performance is driven by 3 main vectors. 
First, the legacy brands, like Match, Meetic, OkCupid North America, et cetera, they continue to accelerate through product and marketing work. Then there are the new brands, like Hinge, Chispa, BLK, which have seen tremendous user and monetization growth. Pairs has been a great contributor. It's opened new marketing channels, which post -- which sort of puts it in a really good position for 2021. And then there are new revenue initiatives, like POF Live, which became meaningful contributors, and they -- basically, you had 0 revenue at the beginning of the year.  
So we do believe that all of these growth drivers and non-Tinder brands are sustainable, and they will continue to make strong contributions in 2021. And even beyond 2021, these brands are positioned to contribute a meaningful amount of our growth as our current drivers get further supplemented by emerging brands, like Hawaya, Ablo and Upward, for instance. So all in all, we feel very good about a broad set of drivers for growth within our portfolio."

First of all, just to kind of step back a little bit on what's going on with gross margins, I would say that, in general, our cost of revenue ex the IFPs is relatively stable. That's despite a lot of initiatives we have in there for video and other things. So we're seeing relative stability ex IF. 
On the IF side, first, naturally, we are seeing a little bit of an increase from the fact that we have a number of apps like Hinge, Chispa and BLK that are contributing increasing revenue and are growing quickly. And those are fully paying the 30% across the board to the App Store. So the mix of our brand contribution is having some impact on the overall IFPs as a percentage of revenue. 
That said, when we look at Apple, which is the largest component of our App Store fees, there's not really flexibility there from Apple, and so we'll have to see kind of how that plays out. There's a lot of scrutiny, as I'm sure you know, related to the App Stores and conduct generally. And so we'll see how that plays out on the app front. 
On Google, more specifically, they have announced a change in policy. That would go effective in September, and that would have a meaningful impact on us if that policy change goes into effect later this year. We are having productive -- we have a productive relationship with them, and we're having good conversations. They understand the financial impact on us of their policy change, and so we're hopeful that we'll be able to find a solution that will avoid this added cost for us. 
Our ranges for the year contemplate the impact in Q4 from the Google change. So we'd be lower in the range if that played through and there was no solution, higher if there is. And so we'll see how this all plays out. 
In general, there's a lot of moving pieces with regulators around the world and a lot going on related to the App Store fees. So this is going to be a very important year, and we'll see how this plays out over the coming months related to all those discussions and considerations around the App Store fees."

About Hinge, our first goal at Hinge was to establish a strong subscription product, and then we have since launched 2 solid a la carte products. The Rose and Standouts, which is the equivalent of Super Likes on Tinder, and that has already surpassed the take rates relative to Super Likes on Tinder, for instance. Roses, interestingly, are not just a revenue product. They're actually a fairly effective engagement product that they're getting 2.5x more likely to lead to a conversation off the platform. 
So now ALC revenue at Hinge is already becoming a meaningful component of revenue. And it's important to note, at the beginning of 2020, it was basically 0. And so in 2021, there's a full road map to make, both the subscription product richer and then focus on making the overall product engagement features. 
The other thing, of course, for Hinge is user growth. And towards that end, in addition to the existing markets that we already play in, Hinge is testing a select few international markets, but with this broader view of a broader international rollout in 2022. All in all, we're very pleased at how Hinge has been executing on their plan, and all the confidence in the world that 2021 will be a great year for them. 
On IDFA, so obviously, since we're not an ad-supported business, the impact to us is mostly on the marketing spend and the user acquisition efficiency. And so there are a lot of puts and takes, and it is a little bit unclear how this all shakes out. 
For instance, if the targeting becomes weaker, it will have an impact on marketing efficiency. At the same time, it's unclear to what extent rates may or may not come down. 
In terms of how we measure and our spend -- and marketing spend attribution framework goes, we do have experience in evaluating brand spend like out-of-home and TV, et cetera. So net-net, I don't think we know quite how the market will sort itself out. I do believe it will eventually sort itself out. 
In the short term, what sort of dislocation happens is unclear, particularly in terms of what the impact will be to our marketing spend efficiency. So we're not really currently building it into our outlook yet.

I mean, Brent, you've watched us for a long time in terms of how we think about outlooks, and there's a lot of uncertainty as we come into this year. We're early in the year. And so naturally, we're trying to be thoughtful about not assuming too much goodness as the year goes on. We're hoping things improve, but as we provide ranges and so forth, we're trying to be cautious and thoughtful just because there are so many questions out there. 
So right now, when you look at kind of the year, for the first quarter, we gave specific expectations, which obviously assumes continued COVID headwinds. For the second quarter, we're still assuming some COVID headwinds, and it will be an easier comp in Q2 over last year because, obviously, there was severe impact from COVID in the second quarter. So that's something we're factoring into our growth thoughts for Q2. 
When we get to the back half of the year, which is obviously still pretty far out, we have assumed some reduction in the current COVID headwinds, but not a full return to normalcy for the back half of the year. And we certainly haven't assumed any major resurgence from pent-up demand for dating activity in the second half of the year. 
It's certainly possible that, that could happen. I know there are people who believe that, that's what's going to happen. It's just too hard to predict. And so in our normal way of providing an outlook, we haven't assumed an abnormal level of dating activity, a major burst from pent-up demand in the back half of the year. 
So our plan is to kind of watch this all for a quarter or 2, see how the vaccine rollouts go, see how mobility starts to improve. Clearly, as mobility improves, we see dating activity improve and how the world starts to open up. And as the year progresses, if those trends start to be better than we had been expecting, we will adjust our outlook. 
But sitting here today, we felt that this was the right approach in terms of providing the outlook for the year. But it is something that could get adjusted later, depending on what trends we see."

And we know for a fact that it has an impact on category perception and penetration. And we've done a lot of work in this area, particularly in the Western markets. 
More recently, Japan is a good example of a market where we've been very active on this front from initiatives that we've done on our platforms with features like verifications, our enhanced community and customer care processes. We've worked with local regulators and authorities. We've done a lot of education and outreach through marketing and PR. And all of this work has very directly in Japan actually allowed us to open up new marketing channels, for instance, out-of-home, several digital channels. We're hoping we can unlock television advertising soon there as well. 
And so those are very sort of short-term definitive things we can point to. But overall, the perception changes are meaningful in the long term for a lot of these higher stigma markets. We're starting to do similar work in India, which is why I do think we will continue to focus on moderation and safety features, both internally on our platforms. 
But one of the things we're going to amplify this year is engaging more with outreach with other organizations, third-party technologies, partnerships with nonprofits, working with regulators and engaging law enforcement. I think it's important. I'm personally committed to this, and there is a lot of work and leadership we can provide in this area more generally for digital platforms."

We didn't make as much progress on that in 2020 as we would have liked. Because of COVID, we're probably in that 17%, 18% range. 
But Asia is still very strategically important to us. We think there's real opportunity there. We've got a lot of different ways of attacking it product-wise. And we think we ultimately will get there and perhaps surpass it. 
But I think the intermediate term goal is to kind of get to 25%. We had said that would be in 2023. I think maybe we've gotten 1 year delayed from COVID. We'll see how things kind of play out. 
When you look at it, I think Asia being such a big market, you've got to take it in pieces. And so as we did say, Japan is going extremely well for us. We've got a great team there on the ground, a great one-two punch with Tinder and Pairs. And we think there's much more opportunity. We've got a matrimony product as well, which we think makes a lot of sense in that market. And we think there's more opportunity in Japan to work with multiple brands. So that's a major focus for us. 
India also continues to be a big focus for us. It's a bit of a longer-term play. We've got Tinder there, which has been very successful as well as OkCupid. I think OkCupid has gotten good traction. But with all of the COVID cases in that market in 2020, we really didn't push as hard, but we are pushing hard again at the start of 2021 with our OkCupid business in India. And we remain optimistic that we have some good products to work in the India market. 
And then we've got other markets like South Korea. That's a market we haven't quite cracked with a product yet. We think there's real opportunity there, and we need to keep trying to find something that work. So there's a -- it's a multiproduct strategy, Pairs, Tinder, OkCupid, the matrimony product, Pairs Engage, across the Asian continent. 
And then we've got Hawaya, which we're still working on the product and feel very good about, that could be a real player in Asia over time. Especially in countries where there's large Muslim populations like Indonesia, we think Hawaya could gain significant share there. So again, a bit of a longer-term play, but something that we are actively focused on and working on. 
And then we talked last year about Tinder rolling out in-app currency to focus on the Asia market, which we think is important to the Asian market and the way Asian users pay and use the products. We didn't roll that out in 2020 mostly because of COVID, but we are planning to resume that initiative for 2021 and expect to roll out in-app currency at first in a couple of Asian markets and kind of go from there. So again, something that got delayed because of COVID, but we are planning to bring that back in 2021. 
So a lot going on in Asia, remains a big focus for us. Our goals remain the same, and we're hoping to make more progress as we just turn the corner here into 2021."

So as more of our lives are moving online, the opportunities for -- in real-life connections are decreasing. And meanwhile, loneliness is on the rise around the world. 
And there's been some interesting lessons we've learned both from Ablo, which was designed with the thesis that during these times, when the shift is going on, there are benefits to having people connections and conversations and communities with people online. And there's a feature on Ablo called around the world, which allows people to connect on themes like food and culture -- local culture and travel and allows them to share their parts of the world with each other. 
And we're seeing people use that contacts to connect and chat and video chat one on one and have sort of deeper conversations with people around the world. And sometimes, these might result in relationships. 
The other big lesson for us was on POF Live. There's a few interesting anecdote and stories, which sort of illustrate what it is that we're trying to do here. 
There was very recently one of the users on POF Live with a homeless man who started building a community, and his entire -- he's trying to turn his life around with the power of the message of positivity, and he's built a real community around it. He talks to people about positive thoughts. And he's made 100,000 on POF Live, and it's turned his life around. 
One of the other sort of top streamers there is an ex-vet who was suffering from deep PTSD, who's managed to turn that around and engage and build a network and a community on POF Live. And he attributes it to having saved his life. 
So this is the type of sort of human connection that we're trying to enable, which is in the context of our mission, which is of helping people make meaningful connections. So this is what's informing our belief that social discovery is going to -- which is already, by the way, popular in parts -- other parts of the world. We think this is going to become more and more popular broadly. And hence, we're looking into this space for expansion. 
The -- in terms of monetization, we do believe this sort of a platform lends itself well to virtual currencies and consumables, people gifting one another, et cetera. And those are sort of the initial things we're testing out on Ablo. And of course, POF Live has a fairly well-established monetization by way of gifting, as we know. 
So we're -- it's still early days, and we're going to try a bunch of different things. We do obviously prefer direct-to-consumer revenue as opposed to ad-based models. And so that's going to be, of course, part of the work that we're going to do over the coming year. 
All right. With that, thank you all again for supporting us and being on the call today. My real hope is the vaccines come soon, we're out of this pandemic-fraught era soon. And thank you again."

Good morning, and thank you all for joining the call today. Since this is the first one of the year, I'm going to start out with sharing some of my thoughts, and then Gary is going to add a little more color to the financials. 
So 2020 was some year, and even though it feels like we're still dealing with some of the hangovers, all in all, I feel grateful for how we navigated the year, both as an organization and as a business. It is remarkable that despite COVID and lockdown having put a real damper to dating and meeting and socializing, we were still able to meet our goal of mid to high-teens growth we set out at the beginning of the year. Needless to say, without COVID, it would have been an even better year. 
The thing I wanted to point out is the strength of our portfolio strategy as well as our ability to pull different levers quickly, which is what allowed us to manage through different levels of volatility we saw throughout the year. And as you're probably aware, COVID has had a resurgence in the second half of Q4. And 7 large markets, U.K. being an example, where 4 of our largest brands have a meaningful presence, are seeing an outsized drag still. But despite all of that, every one of our key brands grew revenue again in Q4. And at the beginning of COVID back in March, April, I don't think I could have predicted exiting the year with a 19% revenue growth and, more importantly, fueled by all of our major brands. 
Investors should also take comfort in the institutional strength of the company. In addition to having delivered on business goals consistently these last 5 years of being a public company, in a year like 2020, with all of our global employees working remotely, we were also able to seamlessly navigate leadership changes and even a full separation to become an independent company. 
So as I look ahead, one thing I do see that 2020 has done, in particular, is a real step change in user behavior, not the least of which is how much of our lives and activity has moved online. And while I do think, as the world gets back to normal, some of this online, offline behavior will rebalance, but parts of this online shift is definitely here to stay. And this, of course, has implications to our products, both in terms of how we evolve the experiences on our apps as well as looking at new use cases we offer to help people connect, and we think this is going to be a big area for us this year. 
And again, while we set similar levels of goals for ourselves at the beginning of the year, it is important to keep in mind that the pandemic is still disrupting our lives and activities, and we continue to see volatility, which makes predicting this year particularly challenging. For instance, in many of our Western markets, we generally see a positive seasonality post-Christmas and into the new year. I always like to say single people going home for the holidays and getting nagged by their family is what causes this post-Christmas spike. This year, however, as you can imagine, it was less pronounced. 
That said, as in Q4, we're still expecting to see all of our major brands grow revenue again in Q1. And as we saw last summer and in countries that emerged from periods of lockdowns, I do expect that as vaccines roll out and things look better on the pandemic front, we will see more people pick up their dating activities and turn to our apps. One of the areas I wanted to talk about is an area of incremental investment and focus we're planning to make this year, which we called out in our letter. It's in our trust and safety efforts. This has been an existential area for our category since the very beginning, and here's how I think about it. 
In the real world, we've developed laws and enforcement tools and acceptable codes of behavior and rules over hundreds of years. The digital world by contrast is barely a couple of decades old, and its popularity really has only increased in the last decade. So it is going to take leadership from tech companies, regulators, law enforcement and the community at large to work through the acceptable rules and norms of this digital world. 
And so we're planning to increase investments in our own platforms. But more importantly, you will see us make an increased effort in broader initiatives, like partnerships with third-party organizations, technologies, nonprofits. You're going to see us have increased collaboration with law enforcement and regulators around the world in order to be -- continue to be a leading voice on trust and safety in the digital world. 
All in all, I feel good about our product and our portfolio strategy that gives us multiple levels of growth. The value proposition of our products remains strong. And I am hopeful that the vaccine rollouts are months away, and we will be looking at more normalcy later this year. And just as I am personally looking forward to getting on a plane and visiting with our teams again, I know our users will be out there dating and meeting with a renewed perspective of what connections and relationships mean to them. 
So with that, I'm going to hand it over to Gary."

Q4 saw our fastest top line growth of the year, 19% year-over-year, a 1 point acceleration from Q3 levels. Tinder grew direct revenue 13%, and the non-Tinder businesses continued to accelerate, with direct revenue up 28% year-over-year. All",1309,"Thanks, Shar. Q4 saw our fastest top line growth of the year, 19% year-over-year, a 1 point acceleration from Q3 levels. Tinder grew direct revenue 13%, and the non-Tinder businesses continued to accelerate, with direct revenue up 28% year-over-year. All major non-Tinder brands contributed year-over-year direct revenue growth in Q4. This was the third consecutive quarter of non-Tinder brands showing growth in aggregate. Pairs, as well as our newer brands, Hinge, Chispa, BLK and PlentyOfFish live streaming all grew rapidly in the quarter. 
We believe Q4 results would have been even better had COVID lockdowns not sent so many people back inside their homes, and colder weather limited people's activities in many parts of the globe. The growth in Q4 was very balanced by geography, with each of North America and international contributing 19% year-over-year direct revenue growth. Indirect revenue grew 35% year-over-year as many marketers looked to deploy unspent budgets in Q4. 
Average subscribers increased 1.1 million over the prior year to 10.9 million, representing 12% year-over-year growth, up 9% in North America and 14% internationally. Year-over-year, Tinder's average subscribers were up over 800,000 or 14%, and non-Tinder brands were up over 300,000 or 8%. Recall that Q4 tends to be our weakest quarter seasonally for subscriber growth. Virtually all of the sequential subscriber growth in Q4 came from Tinder. 
Subscriber growth, particularly at Tinder's broad global business, was impacted by COVID-related effects in a number of key markets, including India, Brazil and Western Europe, particularly the U.K. Total company ARPU was up 5% year-over-year to $0.62, up 7% in North America and 4% internationally. Tinder ARPU was down slightly year-over-year due to a softness in the a la carte revenue as COVID lockdowns increased and a deliberately slower-than-expected rollout of Tinder Platinum, which we decided to only make available to existing Tinder subscribers in Q4. 
Non-Tinder brand’s 16% year-over-year ARPU growth was remarkable. All major non-Tinder brands increased ARPU year-over-year in Q4. Pricing optimization at Hinge and OkCupid, the launch of a la carte features at Hinge and PlentyOfFish live streaming revenue were major contributors to the ARPU improvement in the quarter. 
Operating income grew 17% and EBITDA grew 13% year-over-year in Q4. EBITDA margins were 38%, 1.8 points lower than in Q4 '19, primarily because of higher cost of revenue and sales and marketing spend. Sales and marketing spend was up $34 million or 34% year-over-year as we try to take advantage of new channels in Japan and spent into the well-received Match Made in Hell campaign. 
Marketing spend represented 21% of total revenue in Q4, in line with Q3 levels, but up 3 points from the year ago period. Cost of revenue was impacted by higher IFPs, web hosting costs and fees related to live streaming video at PlentyOfFish. For the full year, we achieved nearly $2.4 billion of total revenue, up 17%, and almost $900 million of EBITDA, up 15%. Despite all the challenges posed by COVID, we delivered on the mid to high-teens revenue and EBITDA targets we set a year ago. 
Our gross and net leverage declined to 4.3x and 3.5x, respectively, down from 4.8x and 4.6x at the time of the separation from IAC. We are pleased to see net leverage already well below 4x. We ended the quarter with $739 million of cash on hand. Due to timing of certain payments, our EBITDA to free cash flow conversion rate was higher in Q4 than it had been year-to-date through September. As a result, our 2020 full year free cash flow conversion was similar to 2019 levels. 
As we discussed in our shareholder letter, there is much uncertainty as we begin 2021. We expect COVID will continue to be a headwind for subscriber growth in the first half of 2021, but are hoping for improvement as the vaccine rollout gains steam. Factoring this in, we believe we can generate $2.75 billion to $2.85 billion of total revenue in 2021, representing another year of mid to high-teens top line growth. We anticipate strong contributions to growth by both the Tinder and non-Tinder brands. We expect a combination of low double-digit subscriber growth and single-digit ARPU growth to drive company direct revenue growth. Our outlook also assumes indirect revenue is essentially flat year-over-year. 
While we expect Tinder subscriber net additions to gradually improve as 2021 progresses, our Q4 performance is testament to the fact that our growth is no longer dependent on Tinder subscriber additions. We now are a business with multiple growth drivers, and we expect the combination of these will drive strong growth in the foreseeable future. We expect 2021 EBITDA to exceed $1 billion with mid to high-teens year-over-year growth driven by the revenue growth and additional spend in product development, trust and safety and somewhat higher legal costs. The legal cost increase includes cost to defend the lawsuit by former Tinder employees, which is scheduled to go to trial late this year. 
Incremental product development spend will be focused in 3 buckets: one, continued investment in our emerging brands such as Ablo, Hawaya and Pairs Engage, the latter 2 of which are targeted primarily at growth in Asia; two, adding to our tech and video capabilities as we expand our product use cases; and three, supporting growth at Tinder, Hinge and our other key brands. 
Given the investments we think are appropriate, we may not expand margins this year. Underlying that is an assumption that conditions will create an environment where our anticipated spend levels, particularly in marketing, makes sense, and that is far from certain in the current tumultuous climate. We intend to continue to be flexible and adjust quickly as we have throughout the past year in the face of the pandemic. 
In 2021, we expect to again derive meaningful growth from newer brands, such as Hinge, Chispa and BLK, which have recently reached or are close to reaching profitability. As these brands continue to improve their margins, overall company margins will benefit as well. We continue to expect to gradually increase company margins in subsequent years to reach our long-term target of 40%. 
We expect 2021 capital expenditures of approximately $80 million as we build out new office space in New York and L.A. We expect free cash flow conversion levels in 2021 to be similar to those of the prior 2 years. We do not expect to be a full U.S. federal cash taxpayer until 2023. We expect stock-based compensation for the full year 2021 to be approximately $100 million, and depreciation and amortization to total approximately $45 million. 
For Q1, we expect total revenue of $645 million to $655 million, which will represent 18% to 20% year-over-year growth. In Q1, we expect continued 20-plus percent year-over-year revenue growth levels at the non-Tinder brands and slightly stronger year-over-year growth at Tinder than we saw in Q4. We expect EBITDA of $210 million to $215 million in Q1, which reflects margins that are consistent with our typical Q1 levels. 
Our ranges for Q1 and full year 2021 factor in anticipated impacts from Google's new requirement to use their in-app billing system beginning in September. The outlook does not include potential impact from changes to IDFA, which remains difficult to quantify at this time, nor any relief that might be achieved on App Store fees as a result of all the regulatory actions challenging Apple and Google's conduct or changes that the stores themselves may decide to impose. 
We are delighted to be able to provide an outlook which includes mid to high-teens revenue and EBITDA growth again for 2021 as we did for 2020 a year ago. We are hopeful that 2021 will gradually provide calmer waters on which we can execute our plan and deliver another solid year of performance for our shareholders. 
With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions."

So let me maybe first give a broader picture of how the second wave of COVID resurgence is playing out, and then I'll get into Tinder-specific impacts. So the second half of the -- of Q4 in particular and into the new year, as we saw, there's been a surge in COVID and lockdowns and reduced mobility in many markets. In fact, as I mentioned in my remarks, a normal peak season looks a little different this year. U.K., that we called out specifically, looks to be one of the worst impacted, a combination perhaps of both COVID and Brexit there, but there are also less severely impacted markets throughout Europe. 
Same story here in the U.S. As we saw before, California and New York, more impacted than Florida, Arizona, Texas, for instance. Again, few markets in Asia and LatAm have been impacted. And sort of similar to what we saw earlier in the year, the impacts are on both new users as well as propensity to pay, particularly a la carte. And it, of course, varies by market. So with all of that said broadly, Tinder specifically, obviously, the geographic exposure is greater. And so if you think about even just markets like India and Brazil alone could create 100,000 swing in subs at Tinder. And then there is the impact to a la carte, which is when propensity to pay goes down a little bit, it -- that's the first one that gets impacted, and it hurts Tinder more because it does have a higher portion of its revenue as a la carte compared to the other brands. 
So with that all said, that hopefully answers the question of what we saw in Q4. We do -- as I mentioned, the new year is seeing an impact from COVID, but we are optimistic that as the quarter goes, Tinder is going to see accelerated growth rates here on. The -- based on everything that we saw over summer and what we're seeing in markets like India, in particular, in more recent weeks as lockdowns ease and mobility increases, people do turn to our apps. 
On Platinum, we've always said it's an ARPU play, and because it is a higher-priced product, given the current environment, we have chosen to not roll it out to all users. In fact, it's currently available for current and previous subscribers only, and we will evaluate when it makes sense to roll it out to all users. For the user set that we've rolled it out to, it has gone as we expected. The good news is it has meaningfully improved the efficacy of the product in terms of driving messages and matches, which was the intention of this package tier.

We laid this out last quarter. Our non-Tinder performance is driven by 3 main vectors. First, the legacy brands, like Match, Meetic, OkCupid, North America, et cetera, they continue to accelerate through product and marketing work. Then there are the new brands, like Hinge, Chispa, BLK, which have seen tremendous user and monetization growth. Pairs has been a great contributor. It's opened new marketing channels, which pose -- which sort of puts it in a really good position for 2021. And then there are new revenue initiatives, like POF Live, which became meaningful contributors, and they -- basically, you had 0 revenue at the beginning of the year. 
So we do believe that all of these growth drivers and non-Tinder brands are sustainable, and they will continue to make strong contributions in 2021. And even beyond 2021, these brands are positioned to contribute a meaningful amount of our growth as our current drivers get further supplemented by emerging brands, like Hawaya, Ablo and Upward, for instance. So all in all, we feel very good about a broad set of drivers for growth within our portfolio."

First of all, just to kind of step back a little bit on what's going on with gross margins, I would say that, in general, our cost of revenue ex the IFPs is relatively stable. That's despite a lot of initiatives we have in there for video and other things. So we're seeing relative stability ex IF. 
On the IF side, first, naturally, we are seeing a little bit of an increase from the fact that we have a number of apps like Hinge, Chispa and BLK that are contributing increasing revenue and are growing quickly. And those are fully paying the 30% across the board to the App Store. So the mix of our brand contribution is having some impact on the overall IFPs as a percentage of revenue. 
That said, when we look at Apple, which is the largest component of our App Store fees, there's not really flexibility there from Apple, and so we'll have to see kind of how that plays out. There's a lot of scrutiny, as I'm sure you know, related to the App Store and conduct generally. And so we'll see how that plays out on the app front. 
On Google, more specifically, they have announced a change in policy. That would go effective in September, and that would have a meaningful impact on us if that policy change goes into effect later this year. We are having productive -- we have a productive relationship with them, and we're having good conversations. They understand the financial impact on us of their policy change, and so we're hopeful that we'll be able to find a solution that will avoid this added cost for us. 
Our ranges for the year contemplate the impact in Q4 from the Google change. So we'd be lower in the range if that played through and there was no solution, higher if there is. And so we'll see how this all plays out. In general, there's a lot of moving pieces with regulators around the world and a lot going on related to the App Store fees. So this is going to be a very important year, and we'll see how this plays out over the coming months related to all those discussions and considerations around the App Store fees."

About Hinge, our first goal at Hinge was to establish a strong subscription product, and then we have since launched 2 solid a la carte products. The Rose and Standouts, which is the equivalent of Super Likes on Tinder, and that has already surpassed the take rates relative to Super Likes on Tinder, for instance. Roses, interestingly, are not just a revenue product, they're actually a fairly effective engagement product that they're getting 2.5x more likely to lead to a conversation off the platform. 
So now ALC revenue at Hinge is already becoming a meaningful component of revenue. And it's important to note, at the beginning of 2020, it was basically 0. And so in 2021, there's a full road map to make, both the subscription product richer and then focus on making the overall product engagement features. The other thing, of course, for Hinge is user growth. And towards that end, in addition to the existing markets that we already play in, Hinge is testing a select few international markets, but with this broader view of a broader international rollout in 2022. All in all, we're very pleased at how Hinge has been executing on their plan, and all the confidence in the world that 2021 will be a great year for them. 
On IDFA, so obviously, since we're not an ad-supported business, the impact to us is mostly on the marketing spend and the user acquisition efficiency. And so there are a lot of puts and takes, and it is a little bit unclear how this all shakes out. For instance, if the targeting becomes weaker, it will have an impact on marketing efficiency. At the same time, it's unclear to what extent rates may or may not come down. 
In terms of how we measure and our spend -- and marketing spend attribution framework goes, we do have experience in evaluating brand spend like out-of-home and TV, et cetera. So net-net, I don't think we know quite how the market will sort itself out. I do believe it will eventually sort itself out. In the short term, what sort of dislocation happens is unclear, particularly in terms of what the impact will be to our marketing spend efficiency. So we're not really currently building it into our outlook yet.

I mean, Brent, you've watched us for a long time in terms of how we think about outlooks, and there's a lot of uncertainty as we come into this year. We're early in the year. And so naturally, we're trying to be thoughtful about not assuming too much goodness as the year goes on. We're hoping things improve, but as we provide ranges and so forth, we're trying to be cautious and thoughtful just because there are so many questions out there. 
So right now, when you look at kind of the year, for the first quarter, we gave specific expectations, which obviously assumes continued COVID headwinds. For the second quarter, we're still assuming some COVID headwinds, and it will be an easier comp in Q2 over last year because, obviously, there was severe impact from COVID in the second quarter. So that's something we're factoring into our growth thoughts for Q2. 
When we get to the back half of the year, which is obviously still pretty far out, we have assumed some reduction in the current COVID headwinds, but not a full return to normalcy for the back half of the year. And we certainly haven't assumed any major resurgence from pent-up demand for dating activity in the second half of the year. It's certainly possible that, that could happen. I know there are people who believe that that's what's going to happen. It's just too hard to predict. And so in our normal way of providing an outlook, we haven't assumed an abnormal level of dating activity, a major burst from pent-up demand in the back half of the year. 
So our plan is to kind of watch this all for a quarter or 2, see how the vaccine rollouts go, see how mobility starts to improve. Clearly, as mobility improves, we see dating activity improve and how the world starts to open up. And as the year progresses, if those trends start to be better than we had been expecting, we will adjust our outlook. But sitting here today, we felt that this was the right approach in terms of providing the outlook for the year. But it is something that could get adjusted later, depending on what trends we see."

So in addition to everything I said earlier about the importance of trust and safety in the digital world broadly, we have firsthand seen the effects of this on our category as we've developed this category over the last 15 years, right? And we know for a fact that it has an impact on category perception and penetration. And we've done a lot of work in this area, particularly in the Western markets. 
More recently, Japan is a good example of a market where we've been very active on this front from initiatives that we've done on our platforms with features like verifications, our enhanced community and customer care processes. We've worked with local regulators and authorities. We've done a lot of education and outreach through marketing and PR. And all of this work has very directly in Japan actually allowed us to open up new marketing channels. For instance, out-of-home, several digital channels. We're hoping we can unlock television advertising soon there as well. 
And so those are very sort of short-term definitive things we can point to. But overall, the perception changes are meaningful in the long term for a lot of these higher stigma markets. We're starting to do similar work in India, which is why I do think we will continue to focus on moderation and safety features, both internally on our platforms. But one of the things we're going to amplify this year is engaging more with outreach with other organizations, third-party technologies, partnerships with nonprofits, working with regulators and engaging law enforcement. I think it's important. I'm personally committed to this, and there is a lot of work and leadership we can provide in this area more generally for digital platforms."

We didn't make as much progress on that in 2020 as we would have liked. Because of COVID, we're probably in that 17%, 18% range. But Asia is still very strategically important to us. We think there's real opportunity there. We've got a lot of different ways of attacking it product-wise. And we think we ultimately will get there and perhaps surpass it. But I think the intermediate term goal is to kind of get to 25%. We had said that would be in 2023. I think maybe we've gotten 1 year delayed from COVID. We'll see how things kind of play out. 
When you look at it, I think Asia being such a big market, you've got to take it in pieces. And so as we did say, Japan is going extremely well for us. We've got a great team there on the ground, a great one-two punch with Tinder and Pairs. And we think there's much more opportunity. We've got a matrimony product as well, which we think makes a lot of sense in that market. And we think there's more opportunity in Japan to work with multiple brands. So that's a major focus for us. 
India also continues to be a big focus for us. It's a bit of a longer-term play. We've got Tinder there, which has been very successful as well as OkCupid. I think OkCupid has gotten good traction. But with all of the COVID cases in that market in 2020, we really didn't push as hard, but we are pushing hard again at the start of 2021 with our OkCupid business in India. And we remain optimistic that we have some good products to work in the India market. 
And then we've got other markets like South Korea. That's a market we haven't quite cracked with a product yet. We think there's real opportunity there, and we need to keep trying to find something that works. So there's a -- it's a multiproduct strategy, Pairs, Tinder, OkCupid, the matrimony product, Pairs Engage, across the Asian continent. And then we've got Hawaya, which we're still working on the product and feel very good about. That could be a real player in Asia over time, especially in countries where there's large Muslim populations like Indonesia, we think Hawaya could gain significant share there. So again, a bit of a longer-term play, but something that we are actively focused on and working on. 
And then we talked last year about Tinder rolling out in-app currency to focus on the Asia market, which we think is important to the Asian market and the way Asian users pay and use the products. We didn't roll that out in 2020 mostly because of COVID, but we are planning to resume that initiative for 2021 and expect to roll out in-app currency at first in a couple of Asian markets and kind of go from there. So again, something that got delayed because of COVID, but we are planning to bring that back in 2021. So a lot going on in Asia. Remains a big focus for us. Our goals remain the same, and we're hoping to make more progress as we just turn the corner here into 2021."

So as more of our lives are moving online, the opportunities for -- in real-life connections are decreasing. And meanwhile, loneliness is on the rise around the world. And there's been some interesting lessons we've learned both from Ablo, which was designed with the thesis that during these times, when the shift is going on, there are benefits to having deeper connections and conversations and communities with people online. And there's a feature on Ablo called around the world, which allows people to connect on themes like food and culture, local culture and travel and allows them to share their parts of the world with each other. And we're seeing people use that contacts to connect and chat and video chat one on one and have sort of deeper conversations with people around the world. And sometimes, these might result in relationships. 
The other big lesson for us was on POF Live. There's a few interesting anecdotes and stories, which sort of illustrate what it is that we're trying to do here. There was very recently one of the users on POF Live with a homeless man who started building a community, and his entire -- he's trying to turn his life around with the power of the message of positivity, and he's built a real community around it. He talks to people about positive thoughts. And he's made 100,000 on POF Live, and it's turned his life around. 
One of the other sort of top streamers there is an ex-vet who was suffering from deep PTSD, who's managed to turn that around and engage and build a network and a community on POF Live, and he attributes it to having saved his life. So this is the type of sort of human connection that we're trying to enable, which is in the context of our mission, which is of helping people make meaningful connections. So this is what's informing our belief that social discovery is going to -- which is already, by the way, popular in other parts of the world. We think this is going to become more and more popular broadly. And hence, we're looking into this space for expansion. 
In terms of monetization, we do believe this sort of a platform lends itself well to virtual currencies and consumables, people gifting one another, et cetera. And those are sort of the initial things we're testing out on Ablo. And of course, POF Live has a fairly well-established monetization by way of gifting, as we know. So we're -- it's still early days, and we're going to try a bunch of different things. We do obviously prefer direct-to-consumer revenue as opposed to ad-based models. And so that's going to be, of course, part of the work that we're going to do over the coming year. 
All right. With that, thank you all again for supporting us and being on the call today. My real hope is the vaccines come soon, we're out of this pandemic-fraught era soon. And thank you again."

Good morning, and thank you all for joining the call today. Since this is the first one of the year, I'm going to start out with sharing some of my thoughts, and then Gary is going to add a little more color to the financials. So 2020",925,"Thank you, Lance. Good morning, and thank you all for joining the call today. Since this is the first one of the year, I'm going to start out with sharing some of my thoughts, and then Gary is going to add a little more color to the financials. 
So 2020 was some year, and even though it feels like we're still dealing with some of the hangovers, all in all, I feel grateful for how we navigated the year, both as an organization and as a business. It is remarkable that despite COVID and lockdown having put a real damper to dating and meeting and socializing, we were still able to meet our goal of mid to high-teens growth we set out at the beginning of the year. Needless to say, without COVID, it would have been an even better year. 
The thing I wanted to point out is the strength of our portfolio strategy as well as our ability to pull different levers quickly, which is what allowed us to manage through different levels of volatility we saw throughout the year. And as you're probably aware, COVID has had a resurgence in the second half of Q4. And 7 large markets, U.K. being an example, where 4 of our largest brands have a meaningful presence, are seeing an outsized drag still. But despite all of that, every one of our key brands grew revenue again in Q4. And at the beginning of COVID back in March, April, I don't think I could have predicted exiting the year with a 19% revenue growth and, more importantly, fueled by all of our major brands. 
Investors should also take comfort in the institutional strength of the company. In addition to having delivered on business goals consistently these last 5 years of being a public company, in a year like 2020, with all of our global employees working remotely, we were also able to seamlessly navigate leadership changes and even a full separation to become an independent company. 
So as I look ahead, one thing I do see that 2020 has done, in particular, is a real step change in user behavior, not the least of which is how much of our lives and activity has moved online. And while I do think, as the world gets back to normal, some of this online, offline behavior will rebalance, but parts of this online shift is definitely here to stay. And this, of course, has implications to our products, both in terms of how we evolve the experiences on our apps as well as looking at new use cases we offer to help people connect, and we think this is going to be a big area for us this year. 
And again, while we set similar levels of goals for ourselves at the beginning of the year, it is important to keep in mind that the pandemic is still disrupting our lives and activities, and we continue to see volatility, which makes predicting this year particularly challenging. For instance, in many of our Western markets, we generally see a positive seasonality post-Christmas and into the new year. I always like to say single people going home for the holidays and getting nagged by their family is what causes this post-Christmas spike. This year, however, as you can imagine, it was less pronounced. 
That said, as in Q4, we're still expecting to see all of our major brands grow revenue again in Q1. And as we saw last summer and in countries that emerged from periods of lockdowns, I do expect that as vaccines roll out and things look better on the pandemic front, we will see more people pick up their dating activities and turn to our apps. One of the areas I wanted to talk about is an area of incremental investment and focus we're planning to make this year, which we called out in our letter. It's in our trust and safety efforts. This has been an existential area for our category since the very beginning, and here's how I think about it. 
In the real world, we've developed laws and enforcement tools and acceptable codes of behavior and rules over hundreds of years. The digital world by contrast is barely a couple of decades old, and its popularity really has only increased in the last decade. So it is going to take leadership from tech companies, regulators, law enforcement and the community at large to work through the acceptable rules and norms of this digital world. 
And so we're planning to increase investments in our own platforms. But more importantly, you will see us make an increased effort in broader initiatives, like partnerships with third-party organizations, technologies, nonprofits. You're going to see us have increased collaboration with law enforcement and regulators around the world in order to be -- continue to be a leading voice on trust and safety in the digital world. 
All in all, I feel good about our product and our portfolio strategy that gives us multiple levels of growth. The value proposition of our products remains strong. And I am hopeful that the vaccine rollouts are months away, and we will be looking at more normalcy later this year. And just as I am personally looking forward to getting on a plane and visiting with our teams again, I know our users will be out there dating and meeting with a renewed perspective of what connections and relationships mean to them. 
So with that, I'm going to hand it over to Gary."

Q4 saw our fastest top line growth of the year, 19% year-over-year, a 1 point acceleration from Q3 levels. Tinder grew direct revenue 13%, and the non-Tinder businesses continued to accelerate, with direct revenue up 28% year-over-year. All",1309,"Thanks, Shar. Q4 saw our fastest top line growth of the year, 19% year-over-year, a 1 point acceleration from Q3 levels. Tinder grew direct revenue 13%, and the non-Tinder businesses continued to accelerate, with direct revenue up 28% year-over-year. All major non-Tinder brands contributed year-over-year direct revenue growth in Q4. This was the third consecutive quarter of non-Tinder brands showing growth in aggregate. Pairs, as well as our newer brands, Hinge, Chispa, BLK and PlentyOfFish live streaming all grew rapidly in the quarter. 
We believe Q4 results would have been even better had COVID lockdowns not sent so many people back inside their homes, and colder weather limited people's activities in many parts of the globe. The growth in Q4 was very balanced by geography, with each of North America and international contributing 19% year-over-year direct revenue growth. Indirect revenue grew 35% year-over-year as many marketers looked to deploy unspent budgets in Q4. 
Average subscribers increased 1.1 million over the prior year to 10.9 million, representing 12% year-over-year growth, up 9% in North America and 14% internationally. Year-over-year, Tinder's average subscribers were up over 800,000 or 14%, and non-Tinder brands were up over 300,000 or 8%. Recall that Q4 tends to be our weakest quarter seasonally for subscriber growth. Virtually all of the sequential subscriber growth in Q4 came from Tinder. 
Subscriber growth, particularly at Tinder's broad global business, was impacted by COVID-related effects in a number of key markets, including India, Brazil and Western Europe, particularly the U.K. Total company ARPU was up 5% year-over-year to $0.62, up 7% in North America and 4% internationally. Tinder ARPU was down slightly year-over-year due to a softness in the a la carte revenue as COVID lockdowns increased and a deliberately slower-than-expected rollout of Tinder Platinum, which we decided to only make available to existing Tinder subscribers in Q4. 
Non-Tinder brand’s 16% year-over-year ARPU growth was remarkable. All major non-Tinder brands increased ARPU year-over-year in Q4. Pricing optimization at Hinge and OkCupid, the launch of a la carte features at Hinge and PlentyOfFish live streaming revenue were major contributors to the ARPU improvement in the quarter. 
Operating income grew 17% and EBITDA grew 13% year-over-year in Q4. EBITDA margins were 38%, 1.8 points lower than in Q4 '19, primarily because of higher cost of revenue and sales and marketing spend. Sales and marketing spend was up $34 million or 34% year-over-year as we try to take advantage of new channels in Japan and spent into the well-received Match Made in Hell campaign. 
Marketing spend represented 21% of total revenue in Q4, in line with Q3 levels, but up 3 points from the year ago period. Cost of revenue was impacted by higher IFPs, web hosting costs and fees related to live streaming video at PlentyOfFish. For the full year, we achieved nearly $2.4 billion of total revenue, up 17%, and almost $900 million of EBITDA, up 15%. Despite all the challenges posed by COVID, we delivered on the mid to high-teens revenue and EBITDA targets we set a year ago. 
Our gross and net leverage declined to 4.3x and 3.5x, respectively, down from 4.8x and 4.6x at the time of the separation from IAC. We are pleased to see net leverage already well below 4x. We ended the quarter with $739 million of cash on hand. Due to timing of certain payments, our EBITDA to free cash flow conversion rate was higher in Q4 than it had been year-to-date through September. As a result, our 2020 full year free cash flow conversion was similar to 2019 levels. 
As we discussed in our shareholder letter, there is much uncertainty as we begin 2021. We expect COVID will continue to be a headwind for subscriber growth in the first half of 2021, but are hoping for improvement as the vaccine rollout gains steam. Factoring this in, we believe we can generate $2.75 billion to $2.85 billion of total revenue in 2021, representing another year of mid to high-teens top line growth. We anticipate strong contributions to growth by both the Tinder and non-Tinder brands. We expect a combination of low double-digit subscriber growth and single-digit ARPU growth to drive company direct revenue growth. Our outlook also assumes indirect revenue is essentially flat year-over-year. 
While we expect Tinder subscriber net additions to gradually improve as 2021 progresses, our Q4 performance is testament to the fact that our growth is no longer dependent on Tinder subscriber additions. We now are a business with multiple growth drivers, and we expect the combination of these will drive strong growth in the foreseeable future. We expect 2021 EBITDA to exceed $1 billion with mid to high-teens year-over-year growth driven by the revenue growth and additional spend in product development, trust and safety and somewhat higher legal costs. The legal cost increase includes cost to defend the lawsuit by former Tinder employees, which is scheduled to go to trial late this year. 
Incremental product development spend will be focused in 3 buckets: one, continued investment in our emerging brands such as Ablo, Hawaya and Pairs Engage, the latter 2 of which are targeted primarily at growth in Asia; two, adding to our tech and video capabilities as we expand our product use cases; and three, supporting growth at Tinder, Hinge and our other key brands. 
Given the investments we think are appropriate, we may not expand margins this year. Underlying that is an assumption that conditions will create an environment where our anticipated spend levels, particularly in marketing, makes sense, and that is far from certain in the current tumultuous climate. We intend to continue to be flexible and adjust quickly as we have throughout the past year in the face of the pandemic. 
In 2021, we expect to again derive meaningful growth from newer brands, such as Hinge, Chispa and BLK, which have recently reached or are close to reaching profitability. As these brands continue to improve their margins, overall company margins will benefit as well. We continue to expect to gradually increase company margins in subsequent years to reach our long-term target of 40%. 
We expect 2021 capital expenditures of approximately $80 million as we build out new office space in New York and L.A. We expect free cash flow conversion levels in 2021 to be similar to those of the prior 2 years. We do not expect to be a full U.S. federal cash taxpayer until 2023. We expect stock-based compensation for the full year 2021 to be approximately $100 million, and depreciation and amortization to total approximately $45 million. 
For Q1, we expect total revenue of $645 million to $655 million, which will represent 18% to 20% year-over-year growth. In Q1, we expect continued 20-plus percent year-over-year revenue growth levels at the non-Tinder brands and slightly stronger year-over-year growth at Tinder than we saw in Q4. We expect EBITDA of $210 million to $215 million in Q1, which reflects margins that are consistent with our typical Q1 levels. 
Our ranges for Q1 and full year 2021 factor in anticipated impacts from Google's new requirement to use their in-app billing system beginning in September. The outlook does not include potential impact from changes to IDFA, which remains difficult to quantify at this time, nor any relief that might be achieved on App Store fees as a result of all the regulatory actions challenging Apple and Google's conduct or changes that the stores themselves may decide to impose. 
We are delighted to be able to provide an outlook which includes mid to high-teens revenue and EBITDA growth again for 2021 as we did for 2020 a year ago. We are hopeful that 2021 will gradually provide calmer waters on which we can execute our plan and deliver another solid year of performance for our shareholders. 
With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions."

So let me maybe first give a broader picture of how the second wave of COVID resurgence is playing out, and then I'll get into Tinder-specific impacts. So the second half of the -- of Q4 in particular and into the new year, as we saw, there's been a surge in COVID and lockdowns and reduced mobility in many markets. In fact, as I mentioned in my remarks, a normal peak season looks a little different this year. U.K., that we called out specifically, looks to be one of the worst impacted, a combination perhaps of both COVID and Brexit there, but there are also less severely impacted markets throughout Europe. 
Same story here in the U.S. As we saw before, California and New York, more impacted than Florida, Arizona, Texas, for instance. Again, few markets in Asia and LatAm have been impacted. And sort of similar to what we saw earlier in the year, the impacts are on both new users as well as propensity to pay, particularly a la carte. And it, of course, varies by market. So with all of that said broadly, Tinder specifically, obviously, the geographic exposure is greater. And so if you think about even just markets like India and Brazil alone could create 100,000 swing in subs at Tinder. And then there is the impact to a la carte, which is when propensity to pay goes down a little bit, it -- that's the first one that gets impacted, and it hurts Tinder more because it does have a higher portion of its revenue as a la carte compared to the other brands. 
So with that all said, that hopefully answers the question of what we saw in Q4. We do -- as I mentioned, the new year is seeing an impact from COVID, but we are optimistic that as the quarter goes, Tinder is going to see accelerated growth rates here on. The -- based on everything that we saw over summer and what we're seeing in markets like India, in particular, in more recent weeks as lockdowns ease and mobility increases, people do turn to our apps. 
On Platinum, we've always said it's an ARPU play, and because it is a higher-priced product, given the current environment, we have chosen to not roll it out to all users. In fact, it's currently available for current and previous subscribers only, and we will evaluate when it makes sense to roll it out to all users. For the user set that we've rolled it out to, it has gone as we expected. The good news is it has meaningfully improved the efficacy of the product in terms of driving messages and matches, which was the intention of this package tier. So we do believe it is a good product, and we will be watching to see the right time to roll it out fully."

First of all, just to kind of step back a little bit on what's going on with gross margins, I would say that, in general, our cost of revenue ex the IFPs is relatively stable. That's despite a lot of initiatives we have in there for video and other things. So we're seeing relative stability ex IF. 
On the IF side, first, naturally, we are seeing a little bit of an increase from the fact that we have a number of apps like Hinge, Chispa and BLK that are contributing increasing revenue and are growing quickly. And those are fully paying the 30% across the board to the App Store. So the mix of our brand contribution is having some impact on the overall IFPs as a percentage of revenue. 
That said, when we look at Apple, which is the largest component of our App Store fees, there's not really flexibility there from Apple, and so we'll have to see kind of how that plays out. There's a lot of scrutiny, as I'm sure you know, related to the App Store and conduct generally. And so we'll see how that plays out on the app front. 
On Google, more specifically, they have announced a change in policy. That would go effective in September, and that would have a meaningful impact on us if that policy change goes into effect later this year. We are having productive -- we have a productive relationship with them, and we're having good conversations. They understand the financial impact on us of their policy change, and so we're hopeful that we'll be able to find a solution that will avoid this added cost for us. 
Our ranges for the year contemplate the impact in Q4 from the Google change. So we'd be lower in the range if that played through and there was no solution, higher if there is. And so we'll see how this all plays out. In general, there's a lot of moving pieces with regulators around the world and a lot going on related to the App Store fees. So this is going to be a very important year, and we'll see how this plays out over the coming months related to all those discussions and considerations around the App Store fees."

About Hinge, our first goal at Hinge was to establish a strong subscription product, and then we have since launched 2 solid a la carte products. The Rose and Standouts, which is the equivalent of Super Likes on Tinder, and that has already surpassed the take rates relative to Super Likes on Tinder, for instance. Roses, interestingly, are not just a revenue product, they're actually a fairly effective engagement product that they're getting 2.5x more likely to lead to a conversation off the platform. 
So now ALC revenue at Hinge is already becoming a meaningful component of revenue. And it's important to note, at the beginning of 2020, it was basically 0. And so in 2021, there's a full road map to make, both the subscription product richer and then focus on making the overall product engagement features. The other thing, of course, for Hinge is user growth. And towards that end, in addition to the existing markets that we already play in, Hinge is testing a select few international markets, but with this broader view of a broader international rollout in 2022. All in all, we're very pleased at how Hinge has been executing on their plan, and all the confidence in the world that 2021 will be a great year for them. 
On IDFA, so obviously, since we're not an ad-supported business, the impact to us is mostly on the marketing spend and the user acquisition efficiency. And so there are a lot of puts and takes, and it is a little bit unclear how this all shakes out. For instance, if the targeting becomes weaker, it will have an impact on marketing efficiency. At the same time, it's unclear to what extent rates may or may not come down. 
In terms of how we measure and our spend -- and marketing spend attribution framework goes, we do have experience in evaluating brand spend like out-of-home and TV, et cetera. So net-net, I don't think we know quite how the market will sort itself out. I do believe it will eventually sort itself out. In the short term, what sort of dislocation happens is unclear, particularly in terms of what the impact will be to our marketing spend efficiency.

I mean, Brent, you've watched us for a long time in terms of how we think about outlooks, and there's a lot of uncertainty as we come into this year. We're early in the year. And so naturally, we're trying to be thoughtful about not assuming too much",375,"Yes. I mean, Brent, you've watched us for a long time in terms of how we think about outlooks, and there's a lot of uncertainty as we come into this year. We're early in the year. And so naturally, we're trying to be thoughtful about not assuming too much goodness as the year goes on. We're hoping things improve, but as we provide ranges and so forth, we're trying to be cautious and thoughtful just because there are so many questions out there. 
So right now, when you look at kind of the year, for the first quarter, we gave specific expectations, which obviously assumes continued COVID headwinds. For the second quarter, we're still assuming some COVID headwinds, and it will be an easier comp in Q2 over last year because, obviously, there was severe impact from COVID in the second quarter. So that's something we're factoring into our growth thoughts for Q2. 
When we get to the back half of the year, which is obviously still pretty far out, we have assumed some reduction in the current COVID headwinds, but not a full return to normalcy for the back half of the year. And we certainly haven't assumed any major resurgence from pent-up demand for dating activity in the second half of the year. It's certainly possible that, that could happen. I know there are people who believe that that's what's going to happen. It's just too hard to predict. And so in our normal way of providing an outlook, we haven't assumed an abnormal level of dating activity, a major burst from pent-up demand in the back half of the year. 
So our plan is to kind of watch this all for a quarter or 2, see how the vaccine rollouts go, see how mobility starts to improve. Clearly, as mobility improves, we see dating activity improve and how the world starts to open up. And as the year progresses, if those trends start to be better than we had been expecting, we will adjust our outlook. But sitting here today, we felt that this was the right approach in terms of providing the outlook for the year. But it is something that could get adjusted later, depending on what trends we see."

So in addition to everything I said earlier about the importance of trust and safety in the digital world broadly, we have firsthand seen the effects of this on our category as we've developed this category over the last 15 years, right? And we know for a fact that it has an impact on category perception and penetration. And we've done a lot of work in this area, particularly in the Western markets. 
More recently, Japan is a good example of a market where we've been very active on this front from initiatives that we've done on our platforms with features like verifications, our enhanced community and customer care processes. We've worked with local regulators and authorities. We've done a lot of education and outreach through marketing and PR. And all of this work has very directly in Japan actually allowed us to open up new marketing channels. For instance, out-of-home, several digital channels. We're hoping we can unlock television advertising soon there as well. 
And so those are very sort of short-term definitive things we can point to. But overall, the perception changes are meaningful in the long term for a lot of these higher stigma markets. We're starting to do similar work in India, which is why I do think we will continue to focus on moderation and safety features, both internally on our platforms. But one of the things we're going to amplify this year is engaging more with outreach with other organizations, third-party technologies, partnerships with nonprofits, working with regulators and engaging law enforcement. I think it's important. I'm personally committed to this, and there is a lot of work and leadership we can provide in this area more generally for digital platforms."

We didn't make as much progress on that in 2020 as we would have liked. Because of COVID, we're probably in that 17%, 18% range. But Asia is still very strategically important to us. We think there's real opportunity there. We've got a lot of different ways of attacking it product-wise. And we think we ultimately will get there and perhaps surpass it. But I think the intermediate term goal is to kind of get to 25%. We had said that would be in 2023. I think maybe we've gotten 1 year delayed from COVID. We'll see how things kind of play out. 
When you look at it, I think Asia being such a big market, you've got to take it in pieces. And so as we did say, Japan is going extremely well for us. We've got a great team there on the ground, a great one-two punch with Tinder and Pairs. And we think there's much more opportunity. We've got a matrimony product as well, which we think makes a lot of sense in that market. And we think there's more opportunity in Japan to work with multiple brands. So that's a major focus for us. 
India also continues to be a big focus for us. It's a bit of a longer-term play. We've got Tinder there, which has been very successful as well as OkCupid. I think OkCupid has gotten good traction. But with all of the COVID cases in that market in 2020, we really didn't push as hard, but we are pushing hard again at the start of 2021 with our OkCupid business in India. And we remain optimistic that we have some good products to work in the India market. 
And then we've got other markets like South Korea. That's a market we haven't quite cracked with a product yet. We think there's real opportunity there, and we need to keep trying to find something that works. So there's a -- it's a multiproduct strategy, Pairs, Tinder, OkCupid, the matrimony product, Pairs Engage, across the Asian continent. And then we've got Hawaya, which we're still working on the product and feel very good about. That could be a real player in Asia over time, especially in countries where there's large Muslim populations like Indonesia, we think Hawaya could gain significant share there. So again, a bit of a longer-term play, but something that we are actively focused on and working on. 
And then we talked last year about Tinder rolling out in-app currency to focus on the Asia market, which we think is important to the Asian market and the way Asian users pay and use the products. We didn't roll that out in 2020 mostly because of COVID, but we are planning to resume that initiative for 2021 and expect to roll out in-app currency at first in a couple of Asian markets and kind of go from there. So again, something that got delayed because of COVID, but we are planning to bring that back in 2021. So a lot going on in Asia. Remains a big focus for us. Our goals remain the same, and we're hoping to make more progress as we just turn the corner here into 2021."

So as more of our lives are moving online, the opportunities for -- in real-life connections are decreasing. And meanwhile, loneliness is on the rise around the world. And there's been some interesting lessons we've learned both from Ablo, which was designed with the thesis that during these times, when the shift is going on, there are benefits to having deeper connections and conversations and communities with people online. And there's a feature on Ablo called around the world, which allows people to connect on themes like food and culture, local culture and travel and allows them to share their parts of the world with each other. And we're seeing people use that contacts to connect and chat and video chat one on one and have sort of deeper conversations with people around the world. And sometimes, these might result in relationships. 
The other big lesson for us was on POF Live. There's a few interesting anecdotes and stories, which sort of illustrate what it is that we're trying to do here. There was very recently one of the users on POF Live with a homeless man who started building a community, and his entire -- he's trying to turn his life around with the power of the message of positivity, and he's built a real community around it. He talks to people about positive thoughts. And he's made 100,000 on POF Live, and it's turned his life around. 
One of the other sort of top streamers there is an ex-vet who was suffering from deep PTSD, who's managed to turn that around and engage and build a network and a community on POF Live, and he attributes it to having saved his life. So this is the type of sort of human connection that we're trying to enable, which is in the context of our mission, which is of helping people make meaningful connections. So this is what's informing our belief that social discovery is going to -- which is already, by the way, popular in other parts of the world. We think this is going to become more and more popular broadly. And hence, we're looking into this space for expansion. 
In terms of monetization, we do believe this sort of a platform lends itself well to virtual currencies and consumables, people gifting one another, et cetera. And those are sort of the initial things we're testing out on Ablo. And of course, POF Live has a fairly well-established monetization by way of gifting, as we know. So we're -- it's still early days, and we're going to try a bunch of different things. We do obviously prefer direct-to-consumer revenue as opposed to ad-based models. And so that's going to be, of course, part of the work that we're going to do over the coming year. 
All right. With that, thank you all again for supporting us and being on the call today. My real hope is the vaccines come soon, we're out of this pandemic-fraught era soon. And thank you again."

Good morning, and thank you all for joining the call today. Since this is the first one of the year, I'm going to start out with sharing some of my thoughts, and then Gary is going to add a little more color to the financials. 
So 2020 was some year, and even though it feels like we're still dealing with some of the hangovers, all in all, I feel grateful for how we navigated the year, both as an organization and as a business. It is remarkable that despite COVID and lockdown having put a real damper to dating and meeting and socializing, we were still able to meet our goal of mid to high-teens growth we set out at the beginning of the year. Needless to say, without COVID, it would have been an even better year. 
The thing I wanted to point out is the strength of our portfolio strategy as well as our ability to pull different levers quickly, which is what allowed us to manage through different levels of volatility we saw throughout the year. And as you're probably aware, COVID has had a resurgence in the second half of Q4. And 7 large markets, U.K. being an example, where 4 of our largest brands have a meaningful presence, are seeing an outsized drag still. But despite all of that, every one of our key brands grew revenue again in Q4. And at the beginning of COVID back in March, April, I don't think I could have predicted exiting the year with a 19% revenue growth and, more importantly, fueled by all of our major brands. 
Investors should also take comfort in the institutional strength of the company. In addition to having delivered on business goals consistently these last 5 years of being a public company, in a year like 2020, with all of our global employees working remotely, we were also able to seamlessly navigate leadership changes and even a full separation to become an independent company. 
So as I look ahead, one thing I do see that 2020 has done, in particular, is a real step change in user behavior, not the least of which is how much of our lives and activity has moved online. And while I do think, as the world gets back to normal, some of this online, offline behavior will rebalance, but parts of this online shift is definitely here to stay. And this, of course, has implications to our products, both in terms of how we evolve the experiences on our apps as well as looking at new use cases we offer to help people connect, and we think this is going to be a big area for us this year. 
And again, while we set similar levels of goals for ourselves at the beginning of the year, it is important to keep in mind that the pandemic is still disrupting our lives and activities, and we continue to see volatility, which makes predicting this year particularly challenging. For instance, in many of our Western markets, we generally see a positive seasonality post-Christmas and into the new year. I always like to say single people going home for the holidays and getting nagged by their family is what causes this post-Christmas spike. This year, however, as you can imagine, it was less pronounced. 
That said, as in Q4, we're still expecting to see all of our major brands grow revenue again in Q1. And as we saw last summer and in countries that emerged from periods of lockdowns, I do expect that as vaccines roll out and things look better on the pandemic front, we will see more people pick up their dating activities and turn to our apps. One of the areas I wanted to talk about is an area of incremental investment and focus we're planning to make this year, which we called out in our letter. It's in our trust and safety efforts. This has been an existential area for our category since the very beginning, and here's how I think about it. 
In the real world, we've developed laws and enforcement tools and acceptable codes of behavior and rules over hundreds of years. The digital world by contrast is barely a couple of decades old, and its popularity really has only increased in the last decade. So it is going to take leadership from tech companies, regulators, law enforcement and the community at large to work through the acceptable rules and norms of this digital world. 
And so we're planning to increase investments in our own platforms. But more importantly, you will see us make an increased effort in broader initiatives, like partnerships with third-party organizations, technologies, nonprofits. You're going to see us have increased collaboration with law enforcement and regulators around the world in order to be -- continue to be a leading voice on trust and safety in the digital world. 
All in all, I feel good about our product and our portfolio strategy that gives us multiple levels of growth. The value proposition of our products remains strong. And I am hopeful that the vaccine rollouts are months away, and we will be looking at more normalcy later this year. And just as I am personally looking forward to getting on a plane and visiting with our teams again, I know our users will be out there dating and meeting with a renewed perspective of what connections and relationships mean to them. 
So with that, I'm going to hand it over to Gary."

Tinder grew direct revenue 13%, and the non-Tinder businesses continued to accelerate, with direct revenue up 28% year-over-year. All major non-Tinder brands contributed year-over-year direct revenue growth in Q4. This was the third consecutive quarter of non-Tinder brands showing growth in aggregate. Pairs, as well as our newer brands, Hinge, Chispa, BLK and PlentyOfFish live streaming all grew rapidly in the quarter. 
We believe Q4 results would have been even better had COVID lockdowns not sent so many people back inside their homes, and colder weather limited people's activities in many parts of the globe. The growth in Q4 was very balanced by geography, with each of North America and international contributing 19% year-over-year direct revenue growth. Indirect revenue grew 35% year-over-year as many marketers looked to deploy unspent budgets in Q4. 
Average subscribers increased 1.1 million over the prior year to 10.9 million, representing 12% year-over-year growth, up 9% in North America and 14% internationally. Year-over-year, Tinder's average subscribers were up over 800,000 or 14%, and non-Tinder brands were up over 300,000 or 8%. Recall that Q4 tends to be our weakest quarter seasonally for subscriber growth. Virtually all of the sequential subscriber growth in Q4 came from Tinder. 
Subscriber growth, particularly at Tinder's broad global business, was impacted by COVID-related effects in a number of key markets, including India, Brazil and Western Europe, particularly the U.K. Total company ARPU was up 5% year-over-year to $0.62, up 7% in North America and 4% internationally. Tinder ARPU was down slightly year-over-year due to a softness in the a la carte revenue as COVID lockdowns increased and a deliberately slower-than-expected rollout of Tinder Platinum, which we decided to only make available to existing Tinder subscribers in Q4. 
Non-Tinder brand’s 16% year-over-year ARPU growth was remarkable. All major non-Tinder brands increased ARPU year-over-year in Q4. Pricing optimization at Hinge and OkCupid, the launch of a la carte features at Hinge and PlentyOfFish live streaming revenue were major contributors to the ARPU improvement in the quarter. 
Operating income grew 17% and EBITDA grew 13% year-over-year in Q4. EBITDA margins were 38%, 1.8 points lower than in Q4 '19, primarily because of higher cost of revenue and sales and marketing spend. Sales and marketing spend was up $34 million or 34% year-over-year as we try to take advantage of new channels in Japan and spent into the well-received Match Made in Hell campaign. 
Marketing spend represented 21% of total revenue in Q4, in line with Q3 levels, but up 3 points from the year ago period. Cost of revenue was impacted by higher IFPs, web hosting costs and fees related to live streaming video at PlentyOfFish. For the full year, we achieved nearly $2.4 billion of total revenue, up 17%, and almost $900 million of EBITDA, up 15%. Despite all the challenges posed by COVID, we delivered on the mid to high-teens revenue and EBITDA targets we set a year ago. 
Our gross and net leverage declined to 4.3x and 3.5x, respectively, down from 4.8x and 4.6x at the time of the separation from IAC. We are pleased to see net leverage already well below 4x. We ended the quarter with $739 million of cash on hand. Due to timing of certain payments, our EBITDA to free cash flow conversion rate was higher in Q4 than it had been year-to-date through September. As a result, our 2020 full year free cash flow conversion was similar to 2019 levels. 
As we discussed in our shareholder letter, there is much uncertainty as we begin 2021. We expect COVID will continue to be a headwind for subscriber growth in the first half of 2021, but are hoping for improvement as the vaccine rollout gains steam. Factoring this in, we believe we can generate $2.75 billion to $2.85 billion of total revenue in 2021, representing another year of mid to high-teens top line growth. We anticipate strong contributions to growth by both the Tinder and non-Tinder brands. We expect a combination of low double-digit subscriber growth and single-digit ARPU growth to drive company direct revenue growth. Our outlook also assumes indirect revenue is essentially flat year-over-year. 
While we expect Tinder subscriber net additions to gradually improve as 2021 progresses, our Q4 performance is testament to the fact that our growth is no longer dependent on Tinder subscriber additions. We now are a business with multiple growth drivers, and we expect the combination of these will drive strong growth in the foreseeable future. We expect 2021 EBITDA to exceed $1 billion with mid to high-teens year-over-year growth driven by the revenue growth and additional spend in product development, trust and safety and somewhat higher legal costs. The legal cost increase includes cost to defend the lawsuit by former Tinder employees, which is scheduled to go to trial late this year. 
Incremental product development spend will be focused in 3 buckets: one, continued investment in our emerging brands such as Ablo, Hawaya and Pairs Engage, the latter 2 of which are targeted primarily at growth in Asia; two, adding to our tech and video capabilities as we expand our product use cases; and three, supporting growth at Tinder, Hinge and our other key brands. 
Given the investments we think are appropriate, we may not expand margins this year. Underlying that is an assumption that conditions will create an environment where our anticipated spend levels, particularly in marketing, makes sense, and that is far from certain in the current tumultuous climate. We intend to continue to be flexible and adjust quickly as we have throughout the past year in the face of the pandemic. 
In 2021, we expect to again derive meaningful growth from newer brands, such as Hinge, Chispa and BLK, which have recently reached or are close to reaching profitability. As these brands continue to improve their margins, overall company margins will benefit as well. We continue to expect to gradually increase company margins in subsequent years to reach our long-term target of 40%. 
We expect 2021 capital expenditures of approximately $80 million as we build out new office space in New York and L.A. We expect free cash flow conversion levels in 2021 to be similar to those of the prior 2 years. We do not expect to be a full U.S. federal cash taxpayer until 2023. We expect stock-based compensation for the full year 2021 to be approximately $100 million, and depreciation and amortization to total approximately $45 million. 
For Q1, we expect total revenue of $645 million to $655 million, which will represent 18% to 20% year-over-year growth. In Q1, we expect continued 20-plus percent year-over-year revenue growth levels at the non-Tinder brands and slightly stronger year-over-year growth at Tinder than we saw in Q4. We expect EBITDA of $210 million to $215 million in Q1, which reflects margins that are consistent with our typical Q1 levels. 
Our ranges for Q1 and full year 2021 factor in anticipated impacts from Google's new requirement to use their in-app billing system beginning in September. The outlook does not include potential impact from changes to IDFA, which remains difficult to quantify at this time, nor any relief that might be achieved on App Store fees as a result of all the regulatory actions challenging Apple and Google's conduct or changes that the stores themselves may decide to impose. 
We are delighted to be able to provide an outlook which includes mid to high-teens revenue and EBITDA growth again for 2021 as we did for 2020 a year ago. We are hopeful that 2021 will gradually provide calmer waters on which we can execute our plan and deliver another solid year of performance for our shareholders. 
With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions."

So let me maybe first give a broader picture of how the second wave of COVID resurgence is playing out, and then I'll get into Tinder-specific impacts. So the second half of the -- of Q4 in particular and into the new year, as we saw, there's been a surge in COVID and lockdowns and reduced mobility in many markets. In fact, as I mentioned in my remarks, a normal peak season looks a little different this year. U.K., that we called out specifically, looks to be one of the worst impacted, a combination perhaps of both COVID and Brexit there, but there are also less severely impacted markets throughout Europe. 
Same story here in the U.S. As we saw before, California and New York, more impacted than Florida, Arizona, Texas, for instance. Again, few markets in Asia and LatAm have been impacted. And sort of similar to what we saw earlier in the year, the impacts are on both new users as well as propensity to pay, particularly a la carte. And it, of course, varies by market. So with all of that said broadly, Tinder specifically, obviously, the geographic exposure is greater. And so if you think about even just markets like India and Brazil alone could create 100,000 swing in subs at Tinder. And then there is the impact to a la carte, which is when propensity to pay goes down a little bit, it -- that's the first one that gets impacted, and it hurts Tinder more because it does have a higher portion of its revenue as a la carte compared to the other brands. 
So with that all said, that hopefully answers the question of what we saw in Q4. We do -- as I mentioned, the new year is seeing an impact from COVID, but we are optimistic that as the quarter goes, Tinder is going to see accelerated growth rates here on. The -- based on everything that we saw over summer and what we're seeing in markets like India, in particular, in more recent weeks as lockdowns ease and mobility increases, people do turn to our apps. 
On Platinum, we've always said it's an ARPU play, and because it is a higher-priced product, given the current environment, we have chosen to not roll it out to all users. In fact, it's currently available for current and previous subscribers only, and we will evaluate when it makes sense to roll it out to all users. For the user set that we've rolled it out to, it has gone as we expected. The good news is it has meaningfully improved the efficacy of the product in terms of driving messages and matches, which was the intention of this package tier. So we do believe it is a good product, and we will be watching to see the right time to roll it out fully."

We laid this out last quarter. Our non-Tinder performance is driven by 3 main vectors. First, the legacy brands, like Match, Meetic, OkCupid, North America, et cetera, they continue to accelerate through product and marketing work. Then there are the new brands, like Hinge, Chispa, BLK, which have seen tremendous user and monetization growth. Pairs has been a great contributor. It's opened new marketing channels, which pose -- which sort of puts it in a really good position for 2021. And then there are new revenue initiatives, like POF Live, which became meaningful contributors, and they -- basically, you had 0 revenue at the beginning of the year. 
So we do believe that all of these growth drivers and non-Tinder brands are sustainable, and they will continue to make strong contributions in 2021. And even beyond 2021, these brands are positioned to contribute a meaningful amount of our growth as our current drivers get further supplemented by emerging brands, like Hawaya, Ablo and Upward, for instance. So all in all, we feel very good about a broad set of drivers for growth within our portfolio."

First of all, just to kind of step back a little bit on what's going on with gross margins, I would say that, in general, our cost of revenue ex the IFPs is relatively stable. That's despite a lot of initiatives we have in there for video and other things. So we're seeing relative stability ex IF. 
On the IF side, first, naturally, we are seeing a little bit of an increase from the fact that we have a number of apps like Hinge, Chispa and BLK that are contributing increasing revenue and are growing quickly. And those are fully paying the 30% across the board to the App Store. So the mix of our brand contribution is having some impact on the overall IFPs as a percentage of revenue. 
That said, when we look at Apple, which is the largest component of our App Store fees, there's not really flexibility there from Apple, and so we'll have to see kind of how that plays out. There's a lot of scrutiny, as I'm sure you know, related to the App Store and conduct generally. And so we'll see how that plays out on the app front. 
On Google, more specifically, they have announced a change in policy. That would go effective in September, and that would have a meaningful impact on us if that policy change goes into effect later this year. We are having productive -- we have a productive relationship with them, and we're having good conversations. They understand the financial impact on us of their policy change, and so we're hopeful that we'll be able to find a solution that will avoid this added cost for us. 
Our ranges for the year contemplate the impact in Q4 from the Google change. So we'd be lower in the range if that played through and there was no solution, higher if there is. And so we'll see how this all plays out. In general, there's a lot of moving pieces with regulators around the world and a lot going on related to the App Store fees. So this is going to be a very important year, and we'll see how this plays out over the coming months related to all those discussions and considerations around the App Store fees."

About Hinge, our first goal at Hinge was to establish a strong subscription product, and then we have since launched 2 solid a la carte products. The Rose and Standouts, which is the equivalent of Super Likes on Tinder, and that has already surpassed the take rates relative to Super Likes on Tinder, for instance. Roses, interestingly, are not just a revenue product, they're actually a fairly effective engagement product that they're getting 2.5x more likely to lead to a conversation off the platform. 
So now ALC revenue at Hinge is already becoming a meaningful component of revenue. And it's important to note, at the beginning of 2020, it was basically 0. And so in 2021, there's a full road map to make, both the subscription product richer and then focus on making the overall product engagement features. The other thing, of course, for Hinge is user growth. And towards that end, in addition to the existing markets that we already play in, Hinge is testing a select few international markets, but with this broader view of a broader international rollout in 2022. All in all, we're very pleased at how Hinge has been executing on their plan, and all the confidence in the world that 2021 will be a great year for them. 
On IDFA, so obviously, since we're not an ad-supported business, the impact to us is mostly on the marketing spend and the user acquisition efficiency. And so there are a lot of puts and takes, and it is a little bit unclear how this all shakes out. For instance, if the targeting becomes weaker, it will have an impact on marketing efficiency. At the same time, it's unclear to what extent rates may or may not come down. 
In terms of how we measure and our spend -- and marketing spend attribution framework goes, we do have experience in evaluating brand spend like out-of-home and TV, et cetera. So net-net, I don't think we know quite how the market will sort itself out. I do believe it will eventually sort itself out. In the short term, what sort of dislocation happens is unclear, particularly in terms of what the impact will be to our marketing spend efficiency. So we're not really currently building it into our outlook yet.

I mean, Brent, you've watched us for a long time in terms of how we think about outlooks, and there's a lot of uncertainty as we come into this year. We're early in the year. And so naturally, we're trying to be thoughtful about not assuming too much goodness as the year goes on. We're hoping things improve, but as we provide ranges and so forth, we're trying to be cautious and thoughtful just because there are so many questions out there. 
So right now, when you look at kind of the year, for the first quarter, we gave specific expectations, which obviously assumes continued COVID headwinds. For the second quarter, we're still assuming some COVID headwinds, and it will be an easier comp in Q2 over last year because, obviously, there was severe impact from COVID in the second quarter. So that's something we're factoring into our growth thoughts for Q2. 
When we get to the back half of the year, which is obviously still pretty far out, we have assumed some reduction in the current COVID headwinds, but not a full return to normalcy for the back half of the year. And we certainly haven't assumed any major resurgence from pent-up demand for dating activity in the second half of the year. It's certainly possible that, that could happen. I know there are people who believe that that's what's going to happen. It's just too hard to predict. And so in our normal way of providing an outlook, we haven't assumed an abnormal level of dating activity, a major burst from pent-up demand in the back half of the year. 
So our plan is to kind of watch this all for a quarter or 2, see how the vaccine rollouts go, see how mobility starts to improve. Clearly, as mobility improves, we see dating activity improve and how the world starts to open up. And as the year progresses, if those trends start to be better than we had been expecting, we will adjust our outlook. But sitting here today, we felt that this was the right approach in terms of providing the outlook for the year. But it is something that could get adjusted later, depending on what trends we see."

So in addition to everything I said earlier about the importance of trust and safety in the digital world broadly, we have firsthand seen the effects of this on our category as we've developed this category over the last 15 years, right? And we know for a fact that it has an impact on category perception and penetration. And we've done a lot of work in this area, particularly in the Western markets. 
More recently, Japan is a good example of a market where we've been very active on this front from initiatives that we've done on our platforms with features like verifications, our enhanced community and customer care processes. We've worked with local regulators and authorities. We've done a lot of education and outreach through marketing and PR. And all of this work has very directly in Japan actually allowed us to open up new marketing channels. For instance, out-of-home, several digital channels. We're hoping we can unlock television advertising soon there as well. 
And so those are very sort of short-term definitive things we can point to. But overall, the perception changes are meaningful in the long term for a lot of these higher stigma markets. We're starting to do similar work in India, which is why I do think we will continue to focus on moderation and safety features, both internally on our platforms. But one of the things we're going to amplify this year is engaging more with outreach with other organizations, third-party technologies, partnerships with nonprofits, working with regulators and engaging law enforcement. I think it's important. I'm personally committed to this, and there is a lot of work and leadership we can provide in this area more generally for digital platforms."

We didn't make as much progress on that in 2020 as we would have liked. Because of COVID, we're probably in that 17%, 18% range. But Asia is still very strategically important to us. We think there's real opportunity there. We've got a lot of different ways of attacking it product-wise. And we think we ultimately will get there and perhaps surpass it. But I think the intermediate term goal is to kind of get to 25%. We had said that would be in 2023. I think maybe we've gotten 1 year delayed from COVID. We'll see how things kind of play out. 
When you look at it, I think Asia being such a big market, you've got to take it in pieces. And so as we did say, Japan is going extremely well for us. We've got a great team there on the ground, a great one-two punch with Tinder and Pairs. And we think there's much more opportunity. We've got a matrimony product as well, which we think makes a lot of sense in that market. And we think there's more opportunity in Japan to work with multiple brands. So that's a major focus for us. 
India also continues to be a big focus for us. It's a bit of a longer-term play. We've got Tinder there, which has been very successful as well as OkCupid. I think OkCupid has gotten good traction. But with all of the COVID cases in that market in 2020, we really didn't push as hard, but we are pushing hard again at the start of 2021 with our OkCupid business in India. And we remain optimistic that we have some good products to work in the India market. 
And then we've got other markets like South Korea. That's a market we haven't quite cracked with a product yet. We think there's real opportunity there, and we need to keep trying to find something that works. So there's a -- it's a multiproduct strategy, Pairs, Tinder, OkCupid, the matrimony product, Pairs Engage, across the Asian continent. And then we've got Hawaya, which we're still working on the product and feel very good about. That could be a real player in Asia over time, especially in countries where there's large Muslim populations like Indonesia, we think Hawaya could gain significant share there. So again, a bit of a longer-term play, but something that we are actively focused on and working on. 
And then we talked last year about Tinder rolling out in-app currency to focus on the Asia market, which we think is important to the Asian market and the way Asian users pay and use the products. We didn't roll that out in 2020 mostly because of COVID, but we are planning to resume that initiative for 2021 and expect to roll out in-app currency at first in a couple of Asian markets and kind of go from there. So again, something that got delayed because of COVID, but we are planning to bring that back in 2021. So a lot going on in Asia. Remains a big focus for us. Our goals remain the same, and we're hoping to make more progress as we just turn the corner here into 2021."

So as more of our lives are moving online, the opportunities for -- in real-life connections are decreasing. And meanwhile, loneliness is on the rise around the world. And there's been some interesting lessons we've learned both from Ablo, which was designed with the thesis that during these times, when the shift is going on, there are benefits to having deeper connections and conversations and communities with people online. And there's a feature on Ablo called around the world, which allows people to connect on themes like food and culture, local culture and travel and allows them to share their parts of the world with each other. And we're seeing people use that contacts to connect and chat and video chat one on one and have sort of deeper conversations with people around the world. And sometimes, these might result in relationships. 
The other big lesson for us was on POF Live. There's a few interesting anecdotes and stories, which sort of illustrate what it is that we're trying to do here. There was very recently one of the users on POF Live with a homeless man who started building a community, and his entire -- he's trying to turn his life around with the power of the message of positivity, and he's built a real community around it. He talks to people about positive thoughts. And he's made 100,000 on POF Live, and it's turned his life around. 
One of the other sort of top streamers there is an ex-vet who was suffering from deep PTSD, who's managed to turn that around and engage and build a network and a community on POF Live, and he attributes it to having saved his life. So this is the type of sort of human connection that we're trying to enable, which is in the context of our mission, which is of helping people make meaningful connections. So this is what's informing our belief that social discovery is going to -- which is already, by the way, popular in other parts of the world. We think this is going to become more and more popular broadly. And hence, we're looking into this space for expansion. 
In terms of monetization, we do believe this sort of a platform lends itself well to virtual currencies and consumables, people gifting one another, et cetera. And those are sort of the initial things we're testing out on Ablo. And of course, POF Live has a fairly well-established monetization by way of gifting, as we know. So we're -- it's still early days, and we're going to try a bunch of different things. We do obviously prefer direct-to-consumer revenue as opposed to ad-based models. And so that's going to be, of course, part of the work that we're going to do over the coming year. 
All right. With that, thank you all again for supporting us and being on the call today. My real hope is the vaccines come soon, we're out of this pandemic-fraught era soon. And thank you again."

For the first time in well over a year, Gary and I are actually doing this call from the same location. We're fully vaccinated. We've gotten on planes, which speaks to the optimism we're feeling about the situation here in the U.S. 
Our Q1 results reflect that. The 23% year-over-year growth in revenue came through reacceleration of Tinder with 18% growth and non-Tinder brands posting a growth rate of 30%, the highest those brands have achieved since our IPO in 2015. A big driver of this momentum is the U.S., where we have seen increases across all our brands as the quarter went on. The vaccination rates and control over the COVID cases these last few months have resulted in our users feeling more confident about their dating lives. 
However, I've also gotten a tough reminder that we're still not out of the woods with this pandemic. Just a couple of months ago, we were feeling very good about the trends in India, which, as you know, has suffered last year. These last few weeks, my days have all started with grim news from India, where we have a team, and I still personally have a lot of friends and family, including my parents. 
The dire situation in India and somewhat worsening conditions in countries like Brazil and even Japan that is going through its third emergency declaration is a reminder that we've not gotten past the pandemic in much of the world, and things could still turn on a dime. So we are still operating with a degree of uncertainty. 
But back to the parts we actually have more control over, Tinder made progress in Q1 across users, subscribers and ARPU, and the trends look good. But what's more exciting to me is the road map that Jim Lanzone, who's now been the CEO at Tinder since late summer last year, has laid out. It's a journey to transform the Tinder experience from a swipe, match, message funnel to a more multidimensional and richer one with more ways to self-express, discover, flirt and connect. And this, in turn, we think, will open up new opportunities for increased engagement and monetization through 2022 and beyond. 
Hinge. Hinge continues to gain traction in the English-speaking market that it is available in. In addition to the progress they've made on revenue recently, the focus for Hinge is on outcomes with its tagline, Designed to be Deleted. They have a track record of innovation that supports their brand promise of getting people off their phones and out on great dates with features such as photo prompts, most compatible, your turn, we met. And most recently, they introduced prompt packs into the video chat experience, which are being used in approximately 20% of video dates. 
Also this year, Hinge announced Hinge Labs, an in-house research team that is dedicated to helping daters be more successful. Research there is fueling what we believe will be an exciting second half of the year, focusing on, among other things, an expansion of its what works guidance program for users who need help getting out on great dates, again, in line with their focus on outcomes for their users. 
Finally, the team has been making progress on the plans for the pending Hyperconnect acquisition and post-closing integration, including the various regulatory approvals needed. We still hope to be able to close by the end of Q2. 
And while the growing trend of isolation and loneliness was already a thing across many parts of the world, the pandemic has really escalated its impacts on mental health. Growing popularity of social discovery category is a testament to the need for more human interaction, companionship, connections. And while our apps have traditionally focused on romantic connections, we do think we can lend our expertise in the area of making meaningful connections among people you don't know in this newer, evolving adjacent category. 
We think we can leverage our product jobs as well as our Western market experience combined with Hyperconnect's video and AI technology and their APAC market experience. And we have an opportunity to succeed in both solving a social need and expanding our business footprint. 
As we've said all year, we remain agile and ready to react to changing conditions. Sitting here today, there are many reasons for us to feel optimistic about our social lives and hence, our business although the situation in a few parts of the world gives us appropriate pause about the uncertainty that still exists. If nothing else, this past year has reinforced the urgency of our mission to work tirelessly on products that help people find meaningful connections, love and relationships around the world. 
And with that, I'm going to hand it over to Gary to talk more about the quarter."

It's great to be here in person with you and the team in Dallas today. It's been a long time coming. 
Before I jump into my remarks, I just want to point out that we adjusted the format of our quarterly disclosure this quarter. We combined our earnings release and shareholder letter into one document to improve convenience for shareholders and make understanding the company's results easier. I hope everyone likes the new format. And as always, we welcome any and all feedback. Additionally, we expect to make some further changes and enhancements to our disclosed financial metrics once the Hyperconnect acquisition closes to better reflect the key metrics of the combined business. I'll provide more details later this year. 
With that all said, I'm pleased to report that we had a very strong Q1 on essentially all metrics. Total revenue growth continued to accelerate to 23% year-over-year in Q1, up from 19% year-over-year in Q4 2020. Acceleration occurred at both Tinder, which grew revenue 18% and the non-Tinder brands, where direct revenue was up 30% year-over-year. 
All major non-Tinder brands contributed year-over-year direct revenue growth again in Q1. This was the fifth consecutive quarter of non-Tinder brands showing growth in aggregate. Pairs, PlentyOfFish on the strength of live streaming and our newer brands, Hinge, Chispa and BLK, all grew rapidly in the quarter. 
Our direct revenue was evenly split between North America, which grew 24% year-over-year and international, which grew 21% year-over-year. Indirect revenue grew 27% year-over-year, marking a second consecutive strong quarter as the advertising market continued to improve. 
Average subscribers increased 1.2 million over the prior year to 11.1 million, representing 12% year-over-year growth, up 9% in North America and 15% internationally. Tinder's average subscribers were up just under 900,000 year-over-year or 15% and came in just shy of 7 million in total. Non-Tinder brands average subscribers were up over 300,000 year-over-year or 8% for the second consecutive quarter. 
Total company ARPU was up 9% year-over-year to $0.64, up 13% in North America and 7% internationally. We did get about $0.02 or 3 points of growth in the quarter from foreign exchange impacts. Tinder ARPU was up 4% year-over-year driven by Platinum subscribers and additional a la carte sales. Non-Tinder brands' 18% year-over-year ARPU growth was remarkable, improving upon the 16% year-over-year growth we saw last quarter. 
All major brands increased ARPU year-over-year in Q1. The launch of several a la carte features and price optimization at Hinge as well as the PlentyOfFish live streaming revenue were major contributors to the ARPU improvement again in the quarter. As always, we continue to focus on overall revenue growth, not specifically on subscriber or ARPU growth. In Q1, we did achieve some ARPU growth at the expense of more robust subscriber growth at some of our brands, in particular, Hinge and OkCupid. 
Operating income grew 38%, and EBITDA grew 32% year-over-year in Q1. EBITDA margins were 34%, 2 points higher than in Q1 2020. Overall, expenses dropped 3 points as a percentage of revenue to 72% in Q1 '21 from 75% in Q1 '20. Cost of revenue grew 25% year-over-year, impacted by higher IFPs, web hosting costs and fees related to live streaming video at PlentyOfFish. 
Sales and marketing spend was up $20 million or 16% year-over-year and represented 22% of total revenue in Q1, slightly lower than typical levels. Product development costs grew 27% year-over-year as we increased headcount at several brands, notably Tinder and Hinge. 
G&A expense rose 11% year-over-year and comprised only 13% of revenue versus 15% in the prior period. G&A in Q1 also included $4 million of costs related to the acquisition of Hyperconnect. Our gross and net leverage declined to 4.1x and 3.2x, respectively, down steadily from 4.8x and 4.6x at the time of our separation from IAC. We're pleased to see net leverage already well below 4x. We ended the quarter with $846 million of cash on hand. 
For Q2, we expect total revenue of $680 million to $690 million, which would represent 22% to 24% year-over-year growth. In Q2, we expect above 20% year-over-year revenue growth at both the Tinder and non-Tinder brands in aggregate. We expect EBITDA of $255 million to $260 million in Q2. 
We expect to spend an additional $40 million year-over-year in sales and marketing in Q2 compared to the prior year period. Recall that spend levels were lower in Q2 2020 as the pandemic took hold, and we adjusted spending across a number of categories, most notably sales and marketing. Litigation costs were also lower in Q2 2020 as actions were delayed on account of the pandemic. 
Note that our outlook for Q2 '21 includes a few million dollars of legal and other expenses related to the Hyperconnect acquisition, which we expect to close in the quarter. Our outlook does not yet reflect any revenue or other contribution from Hyperconnect itself. 
We're delighted by the broad-based strength we saw in Q1 and our improving business momentum. To be sure, risks remain, and some caution in outlook is still warranted. The world is not recovering at an even pace with slower vaccine rollouts and higher case counts in many markets. Despite this, we're increasingly confident that we'll be able to deliver the high end of our previously communicated revenue and EBITDA ranges for 2021. 
With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions."

I'll take the opportunity to maybe give some more color on the broader COVID trends and impacts. So if you recall our Feb call, we spoke to how the peak season post-Christmas and into the new year was looking much different than normal years. But as the quarter went on and vaccination rates in the U.S., in particular, picked up speed, we saw real divergence in countries like U.S. and say, Israel and U.K., for instance, versus the rest of the world, where vaccination rates are still lower and case counts are seeing spikes. 
So the U.S. happens to be right now one of the few large markets where we are seeing mobility trends above pre-COVID levels. And some countries in Europe are starting to get close to that pre-COVID level, too. We've mentioned before that as we see lockdowns ease and mobility improve, dating activity follows, and so does propensity to pay. So as a result, we're seeing propensity to say -- to pay indicators like a la carte purchases trending in the right direction across U.S. and a few markets in Western Europe as lockdowns ease. 
So U.K., which we had highlighted as a down market back in Feb, they've also seen a solid recovery over the past month or so as the country emerges from lockdowns. On the other hand, what's going on in India right now can only be described as dire and tragic. And in Feb, we have called out that India was starting to rebound after a trying 2020. That rebound has obviously stalled with mobility rates plunging over the last month. 
Japan and Brazil are other markets to highlight that faced headwinds during the first quarter when lockdowns were reimposed, and they're both still very low on vaccine distribution. The situation is definitely more severe in Brazil. But Japan, with, as I mentioned, with its third emergency declaration has been, again, up and down quite a bit. 
All this to say, this gets to the general uncertainty around trying to project what is to come next to the pandemic. There are certainly some promising signs. But given the slow progress in vaccine distribution globally as well as COVID spikes in certain countries, new variants and mutations, it's still a somewhat fluid picture around the world. 
It's probably also maybe worthwhile to point out a couple of things that we're noticing as a result of COVID. We are seeing that normal seasonality patterns are not holding under COVID, and the other thing that's shaped up is the marketing landscape, which has changed. So we are seeing the pattern, the -- particularly among retailers who have shifted much more online, their spend has spread more evenly over the course of the year rather than concentrated around the holidays in Q4. And so this has changed the seasonality in marketing economics. So for instance, this year, in Q1, we did not see the typically lower rates that we normally do relative to Q4. And some of this has an impact on the Q4 to Q1, but I'm going to let Gary address that."
355279,711342272,2270207,"Match Group, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 05, 2021",2021-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Match Group, Inc.","Executives","Yes. I think if you look over the last few years actually, it's probably become a little bit outdated to think of our business as having this strong seasonality pattern in Q1 and a big jump sequentially from Q1 in terms of subs compared to Q4. I think tha",478,"Yes. I think if you look over the last few years actually, it's probably become a little bit outdated to think of our business as having this strong seasonality pattern in Q1 and a big jump sequentially from Q1 in terms of subs compared to Q4. I think that hasn't held actually in a while. 
The business is much more global now. There's different trends and factors. We do things all throughout the year. And so that way of thinking about the business probably isn't appropriate, which is why we encourage people to look at year-over-year trends of subscribers as opposed to looking at things sequentially. So I would discourage people from focusing too much on that. 
So I think that pattern was already breaking away. As Shar mentioned, COVID has only further muted that pattern. As everybody knows, in COVID, kind of every day is like Groundhog Day. There's not much difference in a day in January or February versus a day in November or December. So I think that, that has further come unraveled as part of COVID. 
And because of some of these changing dynamics, we adjusted our business slightly. As I mentioned in my remarks, we made some trade-offs, ARPU at the expense of some subscriber growth. And so you see that. We focus on delivering overall revenue growth. 
In the non-Tinder brands, we delivered 30% year-over-year revenue growth. In North America, we had high 20s revenue growth year-over-year. So we feel really good about the revenue growth we delivered. The components are going to vary depending on factors in the markets. 
As Shar also mentioned, we're seeing a more competitive marketing environment as a result of COVID with kind of always-on marketing spend by a lot of retailers and others who have moved their business online. So we haven't seen as many spend opportunities, and we've had to adjust to that, which is also affecting some of the trends in our business. 
So the good news is we have a very dynamic business. We're very nimble. We can adjust to the trends and things that are going on in the market, particularly around marketing spend. We did it when COVID first hit back last year in March and April. We've adjusted again throughout the year with COVID and again in the first quarter, and we'll continue to do that. And so you're going to see variability in our trends certainly, when you look sequentially as a result of us trying to manage for all of those factors and differences in behavior. And I'm sure we're going to see differences in behavior now as the reopening happens, you go into Q2 and Q3. And we're going to adjust our spend, something that's reflected, for example, in our guidance as we look at the Q2 expectations as well. Okay. Hopefully, that answers your questions, Cory."

We are in the business of helping people make meaningful connections with people you don't know. Our definition of meaningful connections generally implies a one-to-one connection. So on our dating platforms, t",760,"Okay. I can take it. So here's how I see it. We are in the business of helping people make meaningful connections with people you don't know. Our definition of meaningful connections generally implies a one-to-one connection. So on our dating platforms, these connections are generally with the objective of romantic relationships and the intent to meet in real life. And if you think about the traditional dating flow, it is discover through reviewing profiles, for instance, match and then message, chat, video chat now. And the ultimate goal is to get to a one-to-one conversation that hopefully leads to a date. 
But technology has finally come to a point that it's now enabling people to meet and interact with people more broadly and through much richer experiences online. And so social discovery, at least the bits that are interesting to us, is also ultimately about a one-to-one connection and conversation. But it is more platonic and does not have the necessary expectation of meeting in real life. It's not constrained by geography or even gender for that matter. But it also follows a similar discover, match, message, chat, video chat paradigm that we have on dating apps. 
The difference is because these apps are new, leveraging new technology, the way you discover people in order to match and chat with them is much more social, many to many, interactive, dynamic and in a lot of ways, much more akin to how people meet in the real world. So technology like live video, audio, et cetera, has allowed these apps to build experiences for people to meet in a more social and entertaining setting online. But eventually, they are -- at least the ones that are -- the use cases that are interesting to us are eventually optimized to help you meet someone that you share something with, find something interesting to talk about and want to continue a one-to-one conversation. 
And these social activities can be anything from audio forums to multiplayer games, to watch parties, to 2 streamers competing in a rap battle, all kinds of social activities that helps people engage and discover and learn about others and chat. So in some ways, it's -- the easy way to think about it is these are online analogs of meeting in parties and concerts and events. 
And if you -- as you can imagine, some of these multidimensional ways of discovering people also makes a lot of sense on some of our larger and more social dating platforms as we've proven out by POF Live. So recently, a record number of users on POF watched and engaged with the premier of our show through a partnership with Discovery Plus or they participate or watch a dating game called Next Date or they build a community around a cause or a streamer they like. And it is another way to more serendipitously discover people and then eventually match and chat. 
Swipe Night on Tinder was another somewhat similar construct. If you both covered for Gram, you certainly have something to talk about. And for those who don't have the specific Swipe Night reference, covering for Gram was not a very popular thing to do. 
So the other thing I'd say is while these social experiences are fun and entertaining, they are not designed to be entertainment for the sake of passive entertainment. Rather, they are fun and entertaining ways that serve as an alibi and an avenue to ultimately drive connections and conversations, which is really the point of interest for us. And that's why we think there's so much synergy in the technology between dating and social discovery, but also they are very distinct use cases. So hopefully, that gives a little bit more sort of broader view of how we think about it. Obviously, so much more on this to come as we close Hyperconnect, and we sort of foray into the various areas. 
About safety. So look, we -- safety has been existential to us since the beginning of our category. And as we mentioned in our letter, and I'm sure we'll talk more about it, we make huge investments in it. One of the reasons we like Hyperconnect as a business and technology is their very maniacal focus on safety and the technologies they've developed, specifically things like device side AI, which are privacy-friendly ways of helping with moderation and safety. So it is going to be a huge area for us, but this is an area that we feel we have real expertise in."

First of all, just generally, there's a lot going on in the global regulatory environment, the court system related to Google and Apple, as you probably know. It's a very fluid situation. It'",768,"Okay. Let me at least try the questions about Google and Apple. First of all, just generally, there's a lot going on in the global regulatory environment, the court system related to Google and Apple, as you probably know. It's a very fluid situation. It's really hard to predict exactly how this is going to play out or what comes next. But there's, I think a few things that are apparent. 
The first is that there's concern globally among regulators about the behavior of Apple and Google as it relates to their conduct with the app ecosystem. In the U.S., there was a hearing in the Senate subcommittee last week, and politicians in the U.S. rarely agree on anything. And the one thing they seem to agree on is there are significant concerns related to the app ecosystem as it relates to both Google and Apple. 
And we've seen the same kind of concerns come out of Australia. We've seen the same concerns coming out of the European Union. And frankly, we expect that they're going to continue to come from various jurisdictions around the world. 
Now we're realistic in that we know the pace of regulatory change is slow, and we don't know how long it's going to take to see change. What we would like to see is actually Apple and Google recognizing the valid concerns around their behaviors related to the app ecosystem and making proactive changes to address developers' and consumers' concerns about the app ecosystem. 
Don't know if that's going to happen. We're in conversations with Apple and Google about this. We're happy to share our thoughts whenever they want to listen to our thoughts on this. We think there are ways to improve the situation, but don't know how that's going to play out. 
In particular, as it relates to Google, they've announced the policy change effective later this year. We have been having discussions with them about the economic impact of that, and we continue to have those discussions. And we're hopeful that we're going to find a resolution that is compelling for both us and Google on that front. 
But given the fluidity of the situation, everything else, it's difficult to say how any of this is going to play out. We are watching it, obviously, with a lot of interest. 
The other thing that is a significant development that has happened in the iOS ecosystem really just this week is the changes they've made to the collection of IDFA, which is integrated into the 14.5 iOS update that has just started to roll out. And so we don't know yet. Adoption of that is still very low. We don't know yet exactly what the impacts or ramifications of that are going to be, and so we're monitoring that. 
And I would say we've been preparing for this for a while. We feel we're well equipped to manage through the changes. Fortunately, we're not significantly ad revenue-generating business. Most of our revenue comes directly from the consumer is not -- we're not ad-supported. So we're going to be less impacted than virtually anybody else out there. 
But we have been preparing. We've adopted the Apple SK ad network. And we also have a lot of history and experience in user acquisition without this level of attribution. We've been operating in TV and out-of-home for a long time. So we have a lot of tools and preparedness to handle the different environment. 
But admittedly, it's going to be a different environment with these changes to IDFA. Everyone is going to have to adjust, us included. We feel prepared for that, but we'll have to see how that all plays out. And I think it's going to be a little bit volatile in the user acquisition front for us and for others, frankly, over the coming weeks and months until some of this plays out. 
I would expect that there will be adjustments in the marketplace itself, changes to pricing and user acquisition efficiency as the market adjusts to a changing set of circumstances. But it's really difficult still to quantify or estimate what those impacts are going to be. But we'll learn a lot more over the coming quarter, and we'll come back on our next earnings call with a better update in terms of the changes to IDFA and the impact of all that. So a lot going on, on the Apple and Google front in a multitude of ways. And we are on top of it all as best we can, and we'll continue to update everybody on it."

So we said Hinge has moved from, I forget, 13 or so spot when we acquired them to 3. And they've tripled revenue last year. We're hoping they double revenue this year. All of that is driven by both user growth and improvements within subscription and a la carte. And this is just U.S., and there -- it's only currently available in English-speaking markets, a few English-speaking markets and U.S. being the most important market for them. 
However, the thing to remember about Hinge is it has really grown in the few of the largest cities in the U.S. and mostly on the backs of word of mouth. And word of mouth is really strong for Hinge because the product really resonates with its user base. 
So as I said in my opening remarks, as Hinge has generally done in the past, the second half road map for Hinge is, again, focused on helping users have greater outcomes on the app. And this, in turn, will help word-of-mouth marketing. And as the world opens up a little bit, people go hang out and talk to each other about their dating lives and successes, et cetera, all of that should be helpful to Hinge. 
The one other thing I would note for the U.S. itself, awareness of Hinge in smaller cities and the rest of U.S. is still quite low. So we do have an opportunity to target marketing spend into strengthening and broadening awareness more broadly across the U.S., which is something we're going to do this year as well.

On trust and safety, the $100 million that we spend is obviously a meaningful number because safety is a key component of what we do. We've been talking about it a lot recently, and it's always been a key focus of ours, keeping our users safe. Virtually all of the $100 million is recurring for us. We have some onetime projects here and there, but they're a very tiny component of the $100 million. 
And I think the way to think of the $100 million is there's the baseline safety things that we need to provide to our users. And so we've got product and engineering headcount. And we've got customer care agents and all sorts of things embedded into that number. And we also have a central safety team now that's making sure we maintain the standards across our brands that make sense to maintain. And we also contemplate new safety initiatives, groundbreaking things that we're doing on the safety front to keep pushing ourselves and the category forward. We announced a couple of those over the last little bit: one, to bring out background checks to our users; and another to enhance our processes and how we relate to our users. 
And we're going to keep doing that. There's going to be a number of flagship initiatives we're going to roll out across the brands as well as improvements to the safety baseline to continue to invest and to make sure we're keeping our users safe. We think that's not only mission-critical, but compelling, long-term strategic investment for us, and we're going to keep making it.

However, it is still mostly merchandised to subscribers who have experience with the product and they understand the value. And hence, most of the take rate is through upgrades to this premium tier, which is obviously a higher-priced tier. 
Platinum is already a meaningful contributor to ARPU and revenue. And it is on track to cross our goal of million subscribers this year. And so we do expect solid ARPU growth for Tinder for the rest of the year, definitely helped by Platinum and as well as other a la carte growth, et cetera. It does not contemplate any new major revenue features, however."

So we're obviously very happy with what's going on in the non-Tinder brands. 30% growth this year, the best we've seen since IPO, as Shar said, was really stellar. And I think it probably helps to unpack a little bit more what's going on inside what we aggregate as the non-Tinder brands. 
And really, I think you've got 2 categories of businesses in there. You've got what we could call the emerging ones, high-growth brands, Hinge, BLK, Chispa, to name a few. And we're seeing growth in that set of businesses that's probably approaching 100%, maybe it's 75% year-over-year or something like that. So those businesses are growing very rapidly. They're obviously newer, faster-growing and smaller businesses. 
And then you've got the long-standing brands, the Meetics and Matches and OkCupids of the world that have been around for a long time. They're generally larger businesses. And those businesses are also growing solidly double digits in aggregate. That's as a result of great product and marketing work that our teams have been doing as well as new initiatives that we've brought into some of those businesses, like live streaming at PlentyOfFish, international expansion at OkCupid, et cetera. All the brands in those buckets -- in that bucket are performing well. And so when you combine that, the emerging brands plus the longer standing brands growing strongly, you get to the 30% growth. 
Now over time, I think that we'll probably expect some moderation of growth in the long-standing brands bucket. Maybe that gets into the single digits somewhere, but we're obviously aspiring for more. And we've shown the ability to generate more. So we'll see how that ends up going. 
And then as the emerging businesses become larger, obviously, the growth rate will slow as well. But one of the things that we need to try to do is make some more bets for the future and innovate and come up with new things that can help drive growth in that bucket as well. So behind the Hinges, BLKs and Chispas of the world, we've got businesses like Ablo, like Hawaya in the Muslim markets that we are optimistic will generate growth in the future as well. And we'll continue to try to innovate in the emerging bucket. 
And so that's kind of the strategy. And as all that comes together, the goal is to achieve 15% to 20% top line growth in the non-Tinder brands as we kind of implement all the various strategies that I just went through. 
And one thing that we're thinking about is, frankly, how to adjust our disclosure to help make some of these pictures a little more clear and give you a little more insight into the various growth patterns inside the non-Tinder brands bucket. And so I mentioned in my earlier remarks that we're thinking through some changes on the disclosure front. And hopefully, we'll have some more for you as the year progresses. You can get a clearer sense quarter-to-quarter of the trends in some of these buckets inside the Tinder, the non-Tinder brands. So more of that to come, but I wanted to give you some of that color, so you could have a sense of some of the dynamics and trends overall across the non-Tinder brands. Hopefully, that was helpful."

So look, I think that we're optimistic about Q2 that the momentum is going to continue. We provided a range of estimated top line growth for Q2. And that range contemplates the potential for an acceleration into Q2 compared to Q1 on a year-over-year basis. 
As Shar said, there's still a lot of risk out there, and there's a lot of markets that are still challenging. So the guidance, I think, reflects that. But the U.S. is clearly giving us a nice tailwind, and we're optimistic that Europe is going to continue to get better. And so we feel very good about Q2, and I think the possibility for continued acceleration growth is absolutely there for us. And so there is a little bit of conservatism reflected in the outlook to be mindful of the uncertain world we're still operating in, but a path to reacceleration in Q2 is definitely on the table. 
As far as the EBITDA guide for Q2, look, the reality is that we are in kind of a unique moment in time where after people have been cooped up in their houses for 14, 15 months, we're starting to see a path to get back out there and socialize. And frankly, as someone who's been doing it for the last few days, it's -- after the vaccine, it feels pretty good, and people are going to want to do it. 
And so we want to spend into that opportunity, where people are going to go out there, and they're going to want to date and meet people and socialize. And that is what we are expert in. And so spending a little bit more money than we might have otherwise anticipated in this unique moment in time and encouraging people to go out and meet people is something we absolutely want to do. It's good long term for our business. And so that's why you see a $40 million increase in marketing spend in our numbers for Q2. 
And you have to remember, frankly, that last Q2 in 2020, we pulled back pretty hard on sales and marketing. So it's a big jump, but it was abnormally low in Q2 last year. And it's higher this year in part off the lower comp and in part because in this unique moment in time. 
And frankly, we might spend into Q3 as well. Last year, we had a great summer. The trends were really strong. And if we see people start to really get out there and socialize through Q3, we may spend a little more heavily into Q3 as well to take advantage of this moment in time as the economy expands and people feel happy and start socializing. 
So that's something that we are absolutely thinking about longer term as we turn the corner from Q2 to Q3 as well. And we think it positions our business to continue performing well from a top line perspective this year and frankly, into next year."

And then just to the implied guidance for the back half, if you do kind of like a 2-year average taking out the comps from last year, it does assume there's like a decel in the business even though on a 2-year comp, it's obviously the second quarter implies stability. So just asking if you're seeing anything behind that? Or is that just overall being conservative with the back half?"

Don't know how some of these international markets are going to recover. Don't know exactly how these trends are going to play out. And so we're going to watch and wait and see on that for a little bit more time. 
Plus, we did have a very good Q3 last year. So it does set up a tougher comp. People did get back out after the 2 months of lockdown, and we did have a strong performance. So you have to kind of bear that in mind as you look at how we can grow off of Q3. Q4 was a weaker number, and so I think there's more room for growth there. But Q3 is going to be interesting to see how that all plays out. And so we are being a little cautious on Qs 3 and 4 until we see a little bit more how that goes. 
Plus you have to remember, we did have some initiatives like live streaming that also make the comp a little tougher. We didn't have any live streaming revenue in Q3 or Q4 a year prior, and now we will have that to compare ourselves to. So there's some of that as well in the dynamics of the comparables that you have to factor in. So there's a few moving parts to it that I think you just have to be mindful as you look at Q3 and Q4 growth rates and what sort of reasonable to expect based on both the dynamics we saw in the market last year as well as the initiatives we rolled out and how we reacted to COVID, which is true both on an initiative standpoint and also, as I was saying to Brent and the answer to his question, on a spending standpoint as well."

For the first time in well over a year, Gary and I are actually doing this call from the same location. We're fully vaccinated. We've gotten on planes, which speaks to the optimism we're feeling about the situation here in the U.S.  
Our Q1 results reflect that. The 23% year-over-year growth in revenue came through reacceleration of Tinder with 18% growth and non-Tinder brands posting a growth rate of 30%, the highest those brands have achieved since our IPO in 2015. 
A big driver of this momentum is the U.S., where we have seen increases across all our brands as the quarter went on. The vaccination rates and control over the COVID cases these last few months have resulted in our users feeling more confident about their dating lives. However, I've also gotten a tough reminder that we're still not out of the woods with this pandemic. 
Just a couple of months ago, we were feeling very good about the trends in India, which, as you know, has suffered last year. These last few weeks, my days have all started with grim news from India, where we have a team, and I still personally have a lot of friends and family, including my parents. The dire situation in India, and somewhat worsening conditions in countries like Brazil and even Japan that is going through its third emergency declaration, is a reminder that we've not gotten past the pandemic in much of the world, and things could still turn on a dime. So we are still operating with a degree of uncertainty.  
But back to the parts we actually have more control over, Tinder made progress in Q1 across users, subscribers and ARPU, and the trends look good. But what's more exciting to me is the roadmap that Jim Lanzone, who's now been the CEO at Tinder since late summer last year, has laid out. It's a journey to transform the Tinder experience from a swipe, match, message funnel to a more multidimensional and richer one, with more ways to self-express, discover, flirt and connect. And this, in turn, we think, will open up new opportunities for increased engagement and monetization through 2022 and beyond. 
Hinge. Hinge continues to gain traction in the English-speaking market that it is available in. In addition to the progress they've made on revenue recently, the focus for Hinge is on outcomes with its tagline designed to be deleted. They have a track record of innovation that supports their brand promise of getting people off their phones and out on great dates, with features such as Photo Prompts, Most Compatible, Your Turn, We Met. And most recently, they introduced prompt packs into the video chat experience, which are being used on approximately 20% of video dates.  
Also this year, Hinge announced Hinge Labs, an in-house research team that is dedicated to helping daters be more successful. Research there is fueling what we believe will be an exciting second half of the year, focusing on, among other things, an expansion of its what works guidance program for users who need help getting out on great dates, again, in line with their focus on outcomes for their users.  
Finally, the team has been making progress on the plans for the pending Hyperconnect acquisition and post-closing integration, including the various regulatory approvals needed. We still hope to be able to close by the end of Q2.  
And while the growing trend of isolation and loneliness was already a thing across many parts of the world, the pandemic has really escalated its impacts on mental health. Growing popularity of social discovery category is a testament to the need for more human interaction, companionship, connections. And while our apps have traditionally focused on romantic connections, we do think we can lend our expertise in the area of making meaningful connections among people you don't know in this newer, evolving adjacent category.  
We think we can leverage our product jobs as well as our Western market experience combined with Hyperconnect's video and AI technology and their APAC market experience, and we have an opportunity to succeed in both solving a social need and expanding our business footprint. As we've said all year, we remain agile and ready to react to changing conditions. Sitting here today, there are many reasons for us to feel optimistic about our social lives and, hence, our business, although the situation in a few parts of the world gives us appropriate pause about the uncertainty that still exists. If nothing else, this past year has reinforced the urgency of our mission to work tirelessly on products that help people find meaningful connections, love and relationships around the world.  
And with that, I'm going to hand it over to Gary to talk more about the quarter."

It's great to be here in person with you and the team in Dallas today. It's been a long time coming.  
Before I jump into my remarks, I just want to point out that we adjusted the format of our quarterly disclosure this quarter. We combined our earnings release and shareholder letter into one document to improve convenience for shareholders and make understanding the company's results easier. I hope everyone likes the new format. And as always, we welcome any and all feedback. 
Additionally, we expect to make some further changes and enhancements to our disclosed financial metrics once the Hyperconnect acquisition closes to better reflect the key metrics of the combined business. I'll provide more details later this year.  
With that all said, I'm pleased to report that we had a very strong Q1 on essentially all metrics. Total revenue growth continued to accelerate to 23% year-over-year in Q1, up from 19% year-over-year in Q4 2020. Acceleration occurred at both Tinder, which grew revenue 18%, and the non-Tinder brands, where direct revenue was up 30% year-over-year.  
All major non-Tinder brands contributed year-over-year direct revenue growth again in Q1. This was the fifth consecutive quarter of non-Tinder brands showing growth in aggregate. Pairs; PlentyOfFish on the strength of live streaming; and our newer brands, Hinge, Chispa and BLK, all grew rapidly in the quarter.  
Our direct revenue was evenly split between North America, which grew 24% year-over-year, and international, which grew 21% year-over-year. Indirect revenue grew 27% year-over-year, marking a second consecutive strong quarter as the advertising market continued to improve.  
Average subscribers increased 1.2 million over the prior year to 11.1 million, representing 12% year-over-year growth, up 9% in North America and 15% internationally. Tinder's average subscribers were up just under 900,000 year-over-year, or 15%, and came in just shy of 7 million in total. Non-Tinder brands average subscribers were up over 300,000 year-over-year or 8% for the second consecutive quarter.  
Total company ARPU was up 9% year-over-year to $0.64, up 13% in North America and 7% internationally. We did get about $0.02 or 3 points of growth in the quarter from foreign exchange impacts. Tinder ARPU was up 4% year-over-year driven by Platinum subscribers and additional a la carte sales. Non-Tinder brands' 18% year-over-year ARPU growth was remarkable, improving upon the 16% year-over-year growth we saw last quarter.  
All major brands increased ARPU year-over-year in Q1. 
The launch of several a la carte features and price optimization at Hinge as well as the PlentyOfFish live streaming revenue were major contributors to the ARPU improvement again in the quarter. As always, we continue to focus on overall revenue growth, not specifically on subscriber or ARPU growth. In Q1, we did achieve some ARPU growth at the expense of more robust subscriber growth at some of our brands, in particular, Hinge and OkCupid.  
Operating income grew 38%, and EBITDA grew 32% year-over-year in Q1. EBITDA margins were 34%, 2 points higher than in Q1 2020. 
Overall, expenses dropped 3 points as a percentage of revenue to 72% in Q1 '21 from 75% in Q1 '20. Cost of revenue grew 25% year-over-year, impacted by higher IFPs, web hosting costs and fees related to live streaming video at PlentyOfFish.  
Sales and marketing spend was up $20 million or 16% year-over-year and represented 22% of total revenue in Q1, slightly lower than typical levels. Product development costs grew 27% year-over-year as we increased headcount at several brands, notably Tinder and Hinge.
G&A expense rose 11% year-over-year and comprised only 13% of revenue versus 15% in the prior period. G&A in Q1 also included $4 million of costs related to the acquisition of Hyperconnect. 
Our gross and net leverage declined to 4.1x and 3.2x, respectively, down steadily from 4.8x and 4.6x at the time of our separation from IAC. We're pleased to see net leverage already well below 4x. We ended the quarter with $846 million of cash on hand.  
For Q2, we expect total revenue of $680 million to $690 million, which would represent 22% to 24% year-over-year growth. In Q2, we expect above 20% year-over-year revenue growth at both the Tinder and non-Tinder brands in aggregate. We expect EBITDA of $255 million to $260 million in Q2. We expect to spend an additional $40 million year-over-year in sales and marketing in Q2 compared to the prior year period. 
Recall that spend levels were lower in Q2 2020, as the pandemic took hold, and we adjusted spending across a number of categories, most notably sales and marketing. Litigation costs were also lower in Q2 2020, as actions were delayed on account of the pandemic.  
Note that our outlook for Q2 '21 includes a few million dollars of legal and other expenses related to the Hyperconnect acquisition, which we expect to close in the quarter. Our outlook does not yet reflect any revenue or other contribution from Hyperconnect itself.  
We're delighted by the broad-based strength we saw in Q1 and our improving business momentum. To be sure, risks remain, and some caution in outlook is still warranted. The world is not recovering at an even pace, with slower vaccine rollouts and higher case counts in many markets. Despite this, we're increasingly confident that we'll be able to deliver the high end of our previously communicated revenue and EBITDA ranges for 2021.  
With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions."

I'll take the opportunity to maybe give some more color on the broader COVID trends and impacts. So if you recall our Feb call, we spoke to how the peak season post-Christmas and into the new year was looking much different than normal years. But as the quarter went on and vaccination rates in the U.S., in particular, picked up speed, we saw real divergence in countries like U.S. and, say, Israel and U.K., for instance, versus the rest of the world, where vaccination rates are still lower and case counts are seeing spikes.  
So the U.S. happens to be right now one of the few large markets where we are seeing mobility trends above pre-COVID levels, and some countries in Europe are starting to get close to that pre-COVID level, too. We've mentioned before that as we see lockdowns ease and mobility improve, dating activity follows, and so does propensity to pay. So as a result, we're seeing propensity to say -- to pay indicators like a la carte purchases trending in the right direction across U.S. and a few markets in Western Europe as lockdowns ease.  
So U.K., which we had highlighted as a down market back in Feb, they've also seen a solid recovery over the past month or so, as the country emerges from lockdowns. 
On the other hand, what's going on in India right now can only be described as dire and tragic. And in Feb, we have called out that India was starting to rebound after a trying 2020. That rebound has obviously stalled, with mobility rates plunging over the last month.  
Japan and Brazil are other markets to highlight that faced headwinds during the first quarter when lockdowns were reimposed, and they're both still very low on vaccine distribution. The situation is definitely more severe in Brazil. But Japan, with -- as I mentioned, with its third emergency declaration has been again up and down quite a bit.  
All this to say, this gets to the general uncertainty around trying to project what is to come next to the pandemic. There are certainly some promising signs. But given the slow progress in vaccine distribution globally as well as COVID spikes in certain countries, new variants and mutations, it's still a somewhat fluid picture around the world.  
It's probably also maybe worthwhile to point out a couple of things that we're noticing as a result of COVID. We are seeing that normal seasonality patterns are not holding under COVID, and the other thing that's shaped up is the marketing landscape, which has changed. So we are seeing the pattern, the -- particularly among retailers who have shifted much more online, their spend has spread more evenly over the course of the year rather than concentrated around the holidays in Q4. 
And so this has changed the seasonality in marketing economics. So for instance, this year, in Q1, we did not see the typically lower rates that we normally do relative to Q4. And some of this has an impact on the Q4 to Q1, but I'm going to let Gary address that."
355279,711342272,2270321,"Match Group, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 05, 2021",2021-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Match Group, Inc.","Executives","Yes. I think if you look over the last few years, actually, it's probably become a little bit outdated to think of our business as having this strong seasonality pattern in Q1 and a big jump sequentially from Q1 in terms of subs compared to Q4. I think th",478,"Yes. I think if you look over the last few years, actually, it's probably become a little bit outdated to think of our business as having this strong seasonality pattern in Q1 and a big jump sequentially from Q1 in terms of subs compared to Q4. I think that hasn't held actually in a while.  
The business is much more global now. There's different trends and factors. We do things all throughout the year. And so that way of thinking about the business probably isn't appropriate, which is why we encourage people to look at year-over-year trends of subscribers as opposed to looking at things sequentially. So I would discourage people from focusing too much on that.  
So I think that pattern was already breaking away. As Shar mentioned, COVID has only further muted that pattern. As everybody knows, in COVID, kind of every day is like Groundhog Day. There's not much difference in a day in January or February versus a day in November or December. So I think that, that has further come unraveled as part of COVID.  
And because of some of these changing dynamics, we adjusted our business slightly. As I mentioned in my remarks, we made some trade-offs, ARPU at the expense of some subscriber growth, and so you see that. We focus on delivering overall revenue growth.  
In the non-Tinder brands, we delivered 30% year-over-year revenue growth. In North America, we had high 20s revenue growth year-over-year. So we feel really good about the revenue growth we delivered. The components are going to vary depending on factors in the markets.  
As Shar also mentioned, we're seeing a more competitive marketing environment as a result of COVID with kind of always-on marketing spend by a lot of retailers and others who have moved their business online. So we haven't seen as many spend opportunities, and we've had to adjust to that, which is also affecting some of the trends in our business.  
So the good news is we have a very dynamic business. We're very nimble. We can adjust to the trends and things that are going on in the market, particularly around marketing spend. We did it when COVID first hit back last year in March and April. We've adjusted again throughout the year with COVID and again in the first quarter, and we'll continue to do that. 
And so you're going to see variability in our trends. certainly, when you look sequentially as a result of us trying to manage for all of those factors and differences in behavior. And I'm sure we're going to see differences in behavior now as the reopening happens, you go into Q2 and Q3. And we're going to adjust our spend, something that's reflected, for example, in our guidance as we look at the Q2 expectations as well. 
Okay. Hopefully, that answers your questions, Cory."

Our definition of meaningful connections generally implies a one-to-one connection. 
So on our dating platforms, these connections are generally with the objective of romantic relationships and the intent to meet in real life. And if you think about the traditional dating flow, it is discover through reviewing profiles, for instance, match and then message, chat, video chat now. And the ultimate goal is to get to a one-to-one conversation that hopefully leads to a date.  
But technology has finally come to a point that it's now enabling people to meet and interact with people more broadly and through much richer experiences online. And so social discovery, at least the bits that are interesting to us, is also ultimately about a one-to-one connection and conversation, but it is more platonic and does not have the necessary expectation of meeting in real life. It's not constrained by geography or even gender for that matter. But it also follows a similar discover, match, message, chat, video chat paradigm that we have on dating apps.  
The difference is because these apps are new, leveraging new technology, the way you discover people in order to match and chat with them is much more social, many to many, interactive, dynamic and, in a lot of ways, much more akin to how people meet in the real world. So technology like live video, audio, et cetera, has allowed these apps to build experiences for people to meet in a more social and entertaining setting online. But eventually, they are -- at least the ones that -- the use cases that are interesting to us are eventually optimized to help you meet someone that you share something with, find something interesting to talk about and want to continue a one-to-one conversation.  
And these social activities can be anything from audio forums to multiplayer games, to watch parties, to 2 streamers competing in a rap battle, all kinds of social activities that helps people engage and discover and learn about others and chat. So in some ways, it's -- the easy way to think about it is these are online analogs of meeting in parties and concerts and events.  
And if you -- as you can imagine, some of these multidimensional ways of discovering people also makes a lot of sense on some of our larger and more social dating platforms, as we've proven out by POF Live. So recently, a record number of users on POF watched and engaged with the premier of our show through a partnership with Discovery+ or they participate or watch a dating game called NextDate or they build a community around a cause or a streamer they like. And it is another way to more serendipitously discover people and then eventually match and chat.  
Swipe Night on Tinder was another somewhat similar construct. If you're both covered for Gram, you certainly have something to talk about. And for those who don't have the specific Swipe Night reference, covering for Gram was not a very popular thing to do. 
So the other thing I'd say is, while these social experiences are fun and entertaining, they are not designed to be entertainment for the sake of passive entertainment. Rather, they are fun and entertaining ways that serve as an alibi and an avenue to ultimately drive connections and conversations, which is really the point of interest for us. And that's why we think there's so much synergy in the technology between dating and social discovery, but also they are very distinct use cases. 
So hopefully, that gives a little bit more sort of broader view of how we think about it. Obviously, so much more on this to come as we close Hyperconnect, and we sort of foray into the various areas. 
About safety, so look, we -- safety has been existential to us since the beginning of our category. And as we mentioned in our letter, and I'm sure we'll talk more about it, we make huge investments in it. One of the reasons we like Hyperconnect as a business and technology is their very maniacal focus on safety and the technologies they've developed, specifically things like device side AI, which are privacy friendly ways of helping with moderation and safety. So it is going to be a huge area for us, but this is an area that we feel we have real expertise in."

First of all, just generally, there's a lot going on in the global regulatory environment, the court system related to Google and Apple, as you probably know. It's a very fluid situation. It'",768,"Okay. Let me at least try the questions about Google and Apple. First of all, just generally, there's a lot going on in the global regulatory environment, the court system related to Google and Apple, as you probably know. It's a very fluid situation. It's really hard to predict exactly how this is going to play out or what comes next. But there's, I think, a few things that are apparent. 
The first is that there's concern globally among regulators about the behavior of Apple and Google as it relates to their conduct with the app ecosystem. In the U.S., there was a hearing in the Senate subcommittee last week, and politicians in the U.S. rarely agree on anything. And the one thing they seem to agree on is there are significant concerns related to the app ecosystem as it relates to both Google and Apple. 
And we've seen the same kind of concerns come out of Australia. We've seen the same concerns coming out of the European Union. And frankly, we expect that they're going to continue to come from various jurisdictions around the world. 
Now we're realistic in that we know the pace of regulatory change is slow, and we don't know how long it's going to take to see change. What we would like to see is actually Apple and Google recognizing the valid concerns around their behaviors related to the app ecosystem and making proactive changes to address developers' and consumers' concerns about the app ecosystem. 
Don't know if that's going to happen. We're in conversations with Apple and Google about this. We're happy to share our thoughts whenever they want to listen to our thoughts on this. We think there are ways to improve the situation, but don't know how that's going to play out. 
In particular, as it relates to Google, they've announced the policy change effective later this year. We have been having discussions with them about the economic impact of that, and we continue to have those discussions. And we're hopeful that we're going to find a resolution that is compelling for both us and Google on that front. 
But given the fluidity of the situation and everything else, it's difficult to say how any of this is going to play out. We are watching it, obviously, with a lot of interest. 
The other thing that is a significant development that has happened in the iOS ecosystem really just this week is the changes they've made to the collection of IDFA, which is integrated into the 14.5 iOS update that has just started to roll out. And so we don't know yet. Adoption of that is still very low. We don't know yet exactly what the impacts or ramifications of that are going to be, and so we're monitoring that. 
And I would say we've been preparing for this for a while. We feel we're well equipped to manage through the changes. Fortunately, we're not a significantly ad revenue-generating business. Most of our revenue comes directly from the consumer, not -- and we're not ad-supported. So we're going to be less impacted than virtually anybody else out there. 
But we have been preparing. We've adopted the Apple SKAdNetwork, and we also have a lot of history and experience in user acquisition without this level of attribution. We've been operating in TV and out-of-home for a long time. So we have a lot of tools and preparedness to handle the different environment. 
But admittedly, it's going to be a different environment with these changes to IDFA. Everyone is going to have to adjust, us included. We feel prepared for that, but we'll have to see how that all plays out. And I think it's going to be a little bit volatile in the user acquisition front for us and for others, frankly, over the coming weeks and months until some of this plays out. 
I would expect that there will be adjustments in the marketplace itself, changes to pricing and user acquisition efficiency as the market adjusts to a changing set of circumstances. But it's really difficult still to quantify or estimate what those impacts are going to be. But we'll learn a lot more over the coming quarter, and we'll come back on our next earnings call with a better update in terms of the changes to IDFA and the impact of all that. 
So a lot going on, on the Apple and Google front in a multitude of ways. And we are on top of it all as best we can, and we'll continue to update everybody on it."

I just realized Shweta had asked a Hinge question, too, so maybe I'll address it a little bit more broadly. 
So we said Hinge has moved from, I forget, 13 or so spot when we acquired them to 3, and they've tripled revenue last year. We're hoping they double revenue this year. All of that is driven by both user growth and improvements within subscription and a la carte. And this is just U.S., and there -- it's only currently available in English-speaking markets -- a few English-speaking markets and U.S. being the most important market for them. 
However, the thing to remember about Hinge is it has really grown in the few of the largest cities in the U.S. and mostly on the backs of word of mouth. And word of mouth is really strong for Hinge because the product really resonates with its user base. 
So as I said in my opening remarks, as Hinge has generally done in the past, the second half roadmap for Hinge is, again, focused on helping users have greater outcomes on the app. And this, in turn, will help word-of-mouth marketing. And as the world opens up a little bit, people go hang out and talk to each other about their dating lives and successes, et cetera, all of that should be helpful to Hinge. 
The one other thing I would note for the U.S. itself, awareness of Hinge in smaller cities and the rest of U.S. is still quite low. So we do have an opportunity to target marketing spend into strengthening and broadening awareness more broadly across the U.S., which is something we're going to do this year as well. 
Gary, are you going to take that?"

On trust and safety, the $100 million that we spend is obviously a meaningful number because safety is a key component of what we do. We've been talking about it a lot recently, and it's always been a key focus of ours, keeping our users safe. Virtually all of the $100 million is recurring for us. We have some onetime projects here and there, but they're a very tiny component of the $100 million. 
And I think the way to think of the $100 million is there's the baseline safety things that we need to provide to our users. And so we've got product and engineering headcount. And we've got customer care agents and all sorts of things embedded into that number. And we also have a central safety team now that's making sure we maintain the standards across our brands that make sense to maintain. And we also contemplate new safety initiatives, groundbreaking things that we're doing on the safety front to keep pushing ourselves and the category forward. 
We announced a couple of those over the last little bit: one, to bring out background checks to our users; and another to enhance our processes and how we relate to our users. And we're going to keep doing that. There's going to be a number of flagship initiatives we're going to roll out across the brands as well as improvements to the safety baseline to continue to invest and to make sure we're keeping our users safe. 
We think that's not only mission-critical, but compelling, long-term strategic investment for us, and we're going to keep making it. So we expect that number to continue to grow as our business continues to grow."

However, it is still mostly merchandised to subscribers who have experience with the product and they understand the value. And hence, most of the take rate is through upgrades to this premium tier, which is obviously a higher-priced tier. 
Platinum is already a meaningful contributor to ARPU and revenue, and it is on track to cross our goal of million subscribers this year. And so we do expect solid ARPU growth for Tinder for the rest of the year, definitely helped by Platinum and as well as other a la carte growth, et cetera. It does not contemplate any new major revenue features, however."

So we're obviously very happy with what's going on in the non-Tinder brands. 30% growth this year, the best we've seen since IPO, as Shar said, was really stellar. And I think it probably helps to unpack a little bit more what's going on inside what we aggregate as the non-Tinder brands. 
And really, I think you've got 2 categories of businesses in there. You've got what we could call the emerging ones, high-growth brands, Hinge, BLK, Chispa, to name a few. And we're seeing growth in that set of businesses that's probably approaching 100%, maybe it's 75% year-over-year or something like that. So those businesses are growing very rapidly. They're obviously newer, faster-growing and smaller businesses. 
And then you've got the longstanding brands, the Meetics and Matches and OkCupids of the world that have been around for a long time. They're generally larger businesses, and those businesses are also growing solidly double digits in aggregate. That's as a result of great product and marketing work that our teams have been doing as well as new initiatives that we've brought into some of those businesses, like live streaming at PlentyOfFish, international expansion at OkCupid, et cetera. 
All the brands in those buckets -- in that bucket are performing well. And so when you combine that, the emerging brands plus the longer standing brands growing strongly, you get to the 30% growth. 
Now over time, I think that we'll probably expect some moderation of growth in the longstanding brands bucket. Maybe that gets into the single digits somewhere, but we're obviously aspiring for more. And we've shown the ability to generate more. So we'll see how that ends up going. 
And then as the emerging businesses become larger, obviously, the growth rate will slow as well. But one of the things that we need to try to do is make some more bets for the future and innovate and come up with new things that can help drive growth in that bucket as well. So behind the Hinges, BLKs and Chispas of the world, we've got businesses like Ablo, like Hawaya in the Muslim markets that we are optimistic will generate growth in the future as well. And we'll continue to try to innovate in the emerging bucket. 
And so that's kind of the strategy. And as all that comes together, the goal is to achieve 15% to 20% top line growth in the non-Tinder brands as we kind of implement all the various strategies that I just went through. 
And one thing that we're thinking about is, frankly, how to adjust our disclosure to help make some of these pictures a little more clear and give you a little more insight into the various growth patterns inside the non-Tinder brands bucket. And so I mentioned in my earlier remarks that we're thinking through some changes on the disclosure front. And hopefully, we'll have some more for you as the year progresses. 
You can get a clearer sense quarter to quarter of the trends in some of these buckets inside the Tinder -- the non-Tinder brands. So more of that to come, but I wanted to give you some of that color, so you could have a sense of some of the dynamics and trends overall across the non-Tinder brands. Hopefully, that was helpful."

So look, I think that we're optimistic about Q2 that the momentum is going to continue. We provided a range of estimated top line growth for Q2, and that range contemplates the potential for an acceleration into Q2 compared to Q1 on a year-over-year basis. 
As Shar said, there's still a lot of risk out there, and there's a lot of markets that are still challenging. So the guidance, I think, reflects that. But the U.S. is clearly giving us a nice tailwind, and we're optimistic that Europe is going to continue to get better. 
And so we feel very good about Q2, and I think the possibility for continued acceleration growth is absolutely there for us. And so there is a little bit of conservatism reflected in the outlook to be mindful of the uncertain world we're still operating in, but a path to reacceleration in Q2 is definitely on the table. 
As far as the EBITDA guide for Q2, look, the reality is that we are in kind of a unique moment in time where after people have been cooped up in their houses for 14, 15 months, we're starting to see a path to get back out there and socialize. And frankly, as someone who's been doing it for the last few days, it's -- after the vaccine, it feels pretty good, and people are going to want to do it. 
And so we want to spend into that opportunity, where people are going to go out there, and they're going to want to date and meet people and socialize, and that is what we are expert in. And so spending a little bit more money than we might have otherwise anticipated in this unique moment in time and encouraging people to go out and meet people is something we absolutely want to do. It's good long term for our business, and so that's why you see a $40 million increase in marketing spend in our numbers for Q2. 
And you have to remember, frankly, that last Q2 in 2020, we pulled back pretty hard on sales and marketing. So it's a big jump, but it was abnormally low in Q2 last year. And it's higher this year in part of the lower comp and in part because we are in this unique moment in time. 
And frankly, we might spend into Q3 as well. Last year, we had a great summer. The trends were really strong. And if we see people start to really get out there and socialize through Q3, we may spend a little more heavily into Q3 as well to take advantage of this moment in time as the economy expands and people feel happy and start socializing. 
So that's something that we are absolutely thinking about longer term as we turn the corner from Q2 to Q3 as well. And we think it positions our business to continue performing well from a top line perspective this year and, frankly, into next year."

Plus, we did have a very good Q3 last year, so it does set up a tougher comp. People did get back out after the 2 months of lockdown, and we did have a strong performance. So you have to kind of bear that in mind as you look at how we can grow off of Q3. 
Q4 was a weaker number, and so I think there's more room for growth there. But Q3 is going to be interesting to see how that all plays out. And so we are being a little cautious on Q3 and 4 until we see a little bit more how that goes.

We didn't have any live streaming revenue in Q3 or Q4 a year prior, and now we will have that to compare ourselves to. So there's some of that as well in the dynamics of the comparables that you have to factor in. 
So there's a few moving parts to it that I think you just have to be mindful as you look at Q3 and Q4 growth rates and what sort of reasonable to expect based on both the dynamics we saw in the market last year as well as the initiatives we rolled out and how we reacted to COVID, which is true both on an initiative standpoint and, also as I was saying to Brent and the answer to his question, on a spending standpoint as well."

Internationalization, including basic such as translation, does not yet exist on Hinge, and so that is something we are targeting for 2022, and that will come with plans to expand markets in non-English-speaking markets next year and beyond.

Gary and I are once again doing this from our offices here in Dallas. And while our offices are not fully open yet, we did resume some travel and in-person meetings in Q2 as the vast majority of our employees got vaccinated. And this optimism was also reflected in the sentiment of our users, particularly in the U.S. and parts of Europe. As a result, every one of our major brands grew revenue in Q2, collectively delivering 27% year-over-year growth. And we have solid momentum as we enter the second half of the year. 
As much as I'm ready for COVID to no longer be a topic of discussion, it does appear that we have to live with it for a little while longer. At the end of the day, widespread global vaccinations are really the only way out of this pandemic for us, which is why our brands have been particularly active these past few months collaborating with the White House in the U.S. and the governments in the U.K., France and Ireland on PSAs and vaccine information campaigns and even a [ summer rapid ] about the vaccine. 
Turns out, daters are open to and are getting vaccinated at higher rates than the average population, which is certainly a very good thing. And vaccine badges have become a very attractive feature on many of our platforms. 
In recent weeks, we have been monitoring the surge of the Delta variant and the various restrictions in countries, particularly in Asia. We've learned a lot these past 16 months about the impact of case surges and restrictions to mobility, uncertainty driving new cycles, et cetera, on our metrics and business in various parts of the world. And our confidence in the continued resilience of our business is based on what we've seen. People around the globe have continued to turn to our products for conversations, locations, first video dates, real-life dates. 
And for me, one of the exciting things about this quarter was Tinder's product launches, which are part of an app experience transformation journey that, quite frankly, we haven't undertaken since its very early days. The team there is executing really well, carefully testing the building blocks of this transformation road map. 
It's been super encouraging to see the promising engagement metrics with these new products. And Tinder subscribers/payer additions in Q2 were among some of the highest we've seen, and this momentum has continued into July. 
In the second quarter, we also closed the Hyperconnect deal. And even though travel restrictions have prevented us from meeting in person, our teams have quickly mobilized to collaborate on a number of exciting potential synergies. 
Near term, our priorities to both -- are to both help calibrate and collaborate to drive profitable growth for our Hyperconnect, Azar and Hakuna apps and lay out the broader strategy and road map for social discovery. We are also starting the work to roll out Hyperconnect's video, audio and AI technologies onto our platforms over the next several months. 
Longer term, there is much about this acquisition that excites us. We expect Asia Pacific will soon contribute over 20% of our overall revenue and still offers the biggest growth opportunity, given where the category awareness and penetration stands today. And Hyperconnect gives us a strong, talented team and footprint in the region. 
The more I learn about the AR, the conversational AI and other technologies their team and incubation lab has been working on, the more I'm excited about the ability to leverage this on our dating platforms to provide a richer, more akin to real-life experience online. Everything from self-expression to getting to know each other can be transformed. 
One of the holy grails for us in online dating has always been to bridge the disconnect that happens between people chatting online and then meeting someone in person. And these technologies will eventually allow us to build experiences that will help people determine if they have that much elusive chemistry or not. And so as I -- as we said in the letter, our ultimate vision here is for people to never have to go on a bad first date again. 
Finally, as part of our continuing journey as a fully independent company, we released our first impact report in Q2. I have always felt lucky to have spent much of my career at a company with such a fundamental and important social mission of bringing people together and helping them find dates and relationships and love and marriage. 
We've always been inspired by the success stories of our members, the millions of babies born and love that has been forged by our platforms. And in this annual report, in addition to the social work that we do, we are committed to sharing our performance on ESG metrics and progress and relevant impact areas, including the very important work to develop leading technology and solutions for online safety. 
I feel very good about where we are as a company, as a business. And I look forward to continuing to deliver on our vision and goals. And while the Delta variant surge is a reminder that we aren't fully out of the pandemic woods yet, we do have more data and understanding to be able to manage through it with agility. 
And with that, I will hand it over to Gary to talk more about the quarter."
355279,1673975317,2362204,"Match Group, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2021",2021-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Match Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Shar. It's great to be here again in person with you and the team in Dallas today.

It's great to be here again in person with you and the team in Dallas today. Seeing colleagues working together makes me very much look forward to days when the office will be filled with activity once again. 
We had a terrific Q2 with 27% year-over-year total revenue growth, the strongest growth the company has achieved since 2018. Non-Tinder brands grew direct revenue 28% year-over-year in the quarter, the sixth consecutive quarter where these brands grew in aggregate. 
Hinge, POF Live and our BLK and Chispa apps continued to perform very well. Hinge grew revenue nearly 150% in the quarter driven by strength in both subscription and a la carte, led by Roses and Standouts. 
At Tinder, propensity to pay has improved significantly, which you can see in the a la carte revenue strength as well as overall payer numbers. Tinder saw a notable acceleration in year-over-year direct revenue growth to 26% in Q2, up from 18% year-over-year growth last quarter and 13% year-over-year growth in Q4 2020. 
Our direct revenue grew 25% in the Americas, 28% in Europe and 31% in APAC and other. Our U.S. performance is exceptionally strong, and our performance in Europe is trailing slightly behind the U.S., consistent with the pace of the recovery there. 
APAC and other growth also was solid in Q2. But a number of markets there, including important ones for us like Japan, are now facing increased COVID restrictions. Note that we are now disclosing the performance of the business in 3 geographic regions to give investors better insight into our results. 
Indirect revenue grew 54% year-over-year, marking a third consecutive strong quarter as the advertising market generally and our direct sales specifically were very strong. Also note that we closed the acquisition of Hyperconnect in mid-June, so our metrics reflect about 2 weeks of contribution. Net of certain onetime purchase accounting adjustments, Hyperconnect contributed $4.3 million of revenue in Q2. We have broken this information out in the shareholder letter, so you can see what Match Group ex Hyperconnect and what Hyperconnect itself delivered in Q2. 
We have also moved to disclosing payers and monthly revenue per payer. In the quarter, total payers reached 15 million, which was an increase of 15% from Q2 2020. Growth was strong in all geographies, up 16% year-over-year in the Americas, 13% in Europe and 17% in APAC and other. 
Tinder payers were up 17% year-over-year in Q2. For comparison purposes, in Q2, average subscribers increased 1.3 million over the prior year to 11.4 million, representing 13% year-over-year growth. Tinder's average subscribers were up just under 1.1 million or 17% year-over-year and came in at 7.2 million in total. This was the best Tinder year-over-year subscriber growth since the pandemic began and was very strong sequentially as well. All other brand average subscribers were up 240,000 or 6% year-over-year. 
Revenue per payer increased 10% year-over-year to $15.46. It was up 8% in the Americas, 13% in Europe and 12% in APAC and other. RPP was up 8% year-over-year at Tinder. RPP derived 3 percentage points of growth, $0.53 from foreign exchange impacts in the quarter. 
At Tinder, Platinum sales and strength in a la carte contributed to RPP growth. Continued strong performance of PlentyOfFish's live streaming business and Hinge's a la carte features contributed to the strength in RPP at the established and emerging brands, respectively. 
Total company ARPU was up 10% year-over-year to $0.65. Non-Tinder brands ARPU growth was extremely strong again this quarter, up 16% year-over-year, and Tinder ARPU was up 7% year-over-year. Operating income grew 7%, and EBITDA grew 15% year-over-year in Q2. EBITDA margins were 37%. Net of purchase accounting adjustments, Hyperconnect reduced Match Group EBITDA by $3 million in Q2 from $266 million to $263 million. 
Overall expenses, including SBC expense, increased to 70% of revenue compared to 65% in Q2 '20 when we pulled back on spending as the pandemic took hold. Cost of revenue grew 30% year-over-year, impacted by higher IFPs, web hosting costs and fees related to live streaming video at PlentyOfFish. 
Sales and marketing spend was up $38 million or 42% year-over-year, close to what we had anticipated and represented 18% of total revenue in Q2 as many of our brands spent into reopenings. Product development costs grew 24% year-over-year as we increased headcount at several brands, mainly Tinder and Hinge. 
G&A expense rose 66% year-over-year and comprised 16% of revenue. G&A in Q2 included $4 million of professional fees and $9 million of stock-based comp expense, both related to the acquisition of Hyperconnect. Our gross leverage declined to 3.9x at the end of Q2, while our net leverage was 3.7x as we used cash on hand for a portion of the consideration in the Hyperconnect purchase. We're pleased to see both gross and net leverage below 4x, and we're on track for net leverage below 3x by the end of 2021. 
For Q3, we expect total revenue from Match Group of $790 million to $805 million, which would represent 23% to 26% year-over-year growth. That's solid growth off what was a very strong Q3 2020 as daters emerged from the initial wave of lockdowns in North America and Europe and Asia had COVID under control. 
We expect EBITDA of $275 million to $280 million in Q3. This reflects an additional $15 million of costs in the second half of the year versus our prior expectations for government relations and other advocacy related to app store practices and for legal matters, including the former Tinder employee litigation as we prepare for a fall trial. We think plaintiffs' claims in that case are totally without merit and are fully prepared to defend ourselves vigorously to the end. We currently expect that the trial will conclude by the end of the year, and the meaningful cost we've incurred related to this lawsuit should not recur beyond 2021. 
For the second half of the year, we expect Hyperconnect to contribute $125 million to $135 million of revenue. This outlook reflects some pullback primarily due to COVID as well as our decision to focus the Hyperconnect team on delivering video and other technology that we can implement across the rest of our portfolio. 
We expect at least 2 of our brands to make use of Hyperconnect technology before the end of 2021 and a number of others to implement Hyperconnect capabilities by year-end 2022. As a result of this focus on building tech that our other brands can use, we expect Hyperconnect to remain roughly breakeven from an EBITDA standpoint in Q3 and Q4 2021. 
For the company as a whole, we expect full year revenue of just above $3 billion, including Hyperconnect, exceeding the high end of our previously stated range. This reflects better-than-expected performance at our dating brands in the first half of 2021 and anticipate second half year-over-year growth north of 25%, approximately 20% at Tinder, single digits at the established brands and north of 100% at the emerging brands, including the contribution from Hyperconnect. 
From an EBITDA perspective, we now expect a range for the full year of $1.045 billion to $1.06 billion. This outlook incorporates Google's recent change in policy to enable our brands to opt out of mandatory in-app billing until at least March 2022. 
It also includes the previously mentioned additional legal costs and higher spend for government relations and advocacy to encourage the app stores to reduce their fees. We're increasingly confident that the lawsuits and investigations around the globe related to app store practices will result in changes to those policies in the not-too-distant future. 
We've had an outstanding first half of the year where we've accomplished a great deal. Tinder's growth has accelerated, and the product is evolving in exciting ways that we expect will present real revenue opportunities for us over time. 
Hinge and our other newer established -- newer apps continue to exceed our expectations, and our more established brands are performing well. Importantly, our services are now more in demand than ever as people around the world seek social connection online, whether in the form of companionship, romance or love. With Hyperconnect, our portfolio is increasingly well positioned to deliver on our mission of connecting people, which we expect will enable us to continue to deliver strong results for our stakeholders. 
With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions."

As vaccination rates gain steam first in the U.S. and then in Europe, we saw mobility increase, and it reflected in our business trends in Q2. 
In a few -- in actually several markets in Asia, even today, including Japan, which is our second largest revenue market, there are different degrees of lockdowns and restrictions in place. And that certainly impacts mobility and our metrics. 
With respect to what's going on in the U.S. with the Delta surges in recent weeks, so far, they don't appear to have any impact on mobility. And they may not, unless real restrictions are put in place. And generally, we don't see mask mandates as causing mobility restrictions. Mostly partial and full lockdown seem to. 
So for instance, in U.K., where the Delta surged and it has already peaked and it's on its way down because restrictions were using -- easing during this period, mobility kept increasing. And we didn't really see much impact to our metrics here. So that's kind of how we think about what's going on in the market today."

If you break it down further into the quarters, I think Q3 growth will probably be just under the 20% mark because last year, if you remember, Q3 was very strong. North America and Europe were coming out of the lockdowns, and people got back outside, started being active again. The weather was nice, and Asia had the virus under control. So you had really good conditions globally, which led to a strong Q3 last year. 
For Q4 this year, I'm expecting the growth to be comfortably above 20% year-over-year. But given Q4 is still a quarter away and Tinder has broad geographic exposure, the COVID risks that are still out there necessitate us being a little bit conservative. And so that's what you're seeing as we give our outlook for the back half of the year on Tinder growth."

But the letter is a little bit unclear, and so I wanted to clarify that each of the group of Swipe apps as well as the PlentyOfFish live streaming business are contributing at least $50 million of revenue to that $300 million this year. So Hinge is the balance of the $300 million after the 2 contributions of 50 plus. 
And as we've said before, Hinge is on track to more than double revenue in 2021 after it tripled. And we gave the performance for Hinge also in the second quarter of 150% revenue growth. So the $250 million, I think, is high. But I've given you the components that should enable you, I think, to determine kind of where we think Hinge is going to be roughly for the year."

More broadly though, the Tinder experience, as I said, is evolving to include these new multidimensional service areas in the app, where people have new ways to discover and connect and share interest and form communities. And if you think about most of the ALC features today, things like Boost and Super Like, for instance, they are designed to allow users to stand out in a one-to-one experience.

I want to try to run through it to make sure people understand. There are 2 reasons why payers are higher-than-average subscribers. The first is that payers captures nonsubscriber ALC payers. But there's another reason",269,"So this is a little bit complicated. I want to try to run through it to make sure people understand. There are 2 reasons why payers are higher-than-average subscribers. The first is that payers captures nonsubscriber ALC payers. But there's another reason, which is the definitions of average subscribers and payers. 
Average subscribers represent a daily average over the quarter, while payers is the number of unique payers in a given month and then it's averaged for the quarter. And so if you look at Match Group overall at our payer numbers, what you'll see is that the nonsubscriber ALC payers are actually a relatively small part of the difference between average subscribers and payers. It's more a function of the way payers are counted that accounts for payers being higher-than-average subscribers. So again, ALC payers that are nonsubscribers are a relatively small piece of that disparity. 
Now that being said, we do think that as we expand our ALC monetization efforts, we add virtual currency, especially in Asia Pacific. And now we bring on Hyperconnect, which has a lot of nonsubscriber ALC payers, the percentage of nonsubscriber ALC payers is going to increase. So you'll start to see that as we move forward into the year. 
I'd encourage you to look at the specific definitions, which we provided, of average subscribers as well as payers. And if you have further questions on this, we're happy to try to take this off-line and go through some examples because I know intuitively it's not that obvious. But again, the definitions are what's accounting for a large part of the gap."

And then we actually have relative price parity between Tinder and APAC and our other geographies. You don't see much of a disparity. And so those 2 things taken together, as a result, APAC RPP is pretty similar to the rest of the world. 
As far as kind of what the mix is, Pairs tends to be a subscription business as does Tinder in APAC today. However, as we've talked about, we're experimenting with ways to increase the a la carte consumption at Tinder through virtual currency and other product innovations. We're early days for all that, but we think we can improve payer penetration by adjusting our monetization strategies. And so that's something that you may very well see over time."

So we are -- there are a few things that are leading to somewhat lower growth at Hyperconnect this year than what we expected back in February. The first thing, which you rightly pointed out, was they have a large footprint in APAC. And as we've talked about and as well documented COVID has hit APAC much more heavily this year than it did in 2020. And so there is COVID impact that is being felt in their performance. 
There's also a much more challenging marketing environment. You've got IDFA, you've got a more crowded marketplace. And so as a result of these factors, the Hyperconnect team has been a bit less aggressive in some of their key markets this year than we were initially anticipating. 
On top of that, as Shar has talked about, we have become increasingly excited about the opportunities to apply various Hyperconnect technologies to our other platforms. And we see significant synergies and upside from that. And so that's become a higher priority for us and for the Hyperconnect team in the short term. And we've encouraged them to focus resources on the tech integration with Match Group. So we still expect Hyperconnect to perform well this year and post solid revenue growth, but it is going to be a little bit lower than we initially saw. 
As far as the costs, we communicated that we thought over time, margins of Hyperconnect could get into the upper 20s, 30% range. And nothing has really changed our view on that over the longer term. But as I just said, shorter term, we're not focused on margin. We believe the company will still operate at a breakeven pace, but we want to focus on the synergies. And so that's what we're focused on, certainly for the rest of this year and into next year. And then I expect that the margins will gradually start to improve as we make the turn through 2020. And we'll communicate more about that likely on our next call as we start to get some sense of what we think 2020 is going to -- 2022, I'm sorry, is going to be for the company."

And some of them like Match and Meetic, for instance, have shifted their business model from the hard paywall to more premium experiences, which has meaningfully increased engagement and conversion. 
And apps like POF have added new experiences like POF Live, which has created a new revenue stream. OkCupid continues to expand to new international markets. And generally, they've also sharpened their marketing to become more resonant and relevant to their core audience. So now as they continue to execute, they should be able to expand the category and their core user base and deliver modest growth, we think."

It was originally supposed to come into effect in the fourth quarter being pushed to March of '22. I think previously, you were embedding some impact from that change in the fourth quarter EBITDA guidance. So I just want to confirm that, that upside was sort of flow through and maybe the $15 million in incremental legal expenses offsetting that, but I just want to clarify that. And then generally, how you're feeling about that risk heading into March next year and any potential work around? 
And then secondly, just if you could give us your thoughts on the status of the former Tinder employee litigation and how you see that progressing through the course of the year?"
355279,1673975317,2362204,"Match Group, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2021",2021-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Match Group, Inc.","Executives","Sure. So on the Google fees in the fourth quarter, I think what we said previously is that where we ended up on our EBITDA ranges would be impacted on whether the Google change actually occurred or not.

So on the Google fees in the fourth quarter, I think what we said previously is that where we ended up on our EBITDA ranges would be impacted on whether the Google change actually occurred or not. And at this point, they've now -- about a few weeks ago, they basically said they're pushing back the deadline for compliance until March 31 next year. So that cost is obviously not going to hit us in Q4. 
And so now what we've done is we've given a more up-to-date EBITDA outlook the rest of the year, which reflects a lot of puts and takes. You've got the legal and GR costs that you mentioned, and there's more things moving around in there. And then Google is not in there anymore. And so this is our kind of our latest and greatest with everything we know sitting here today factored in. 
Frankly, I don't know for sure if that $15 million of extra legal and GR is going to get spent, but we've embedded it. So I think the costs are relatively fully loaded at this point for the rest of the year. 
Then in terms of potential workarounds, we continue to talk to Google. We have a good relationship with them. It's very collaborative, and so we'll see how that all evolves. 
That being said, as you probably know, there are many, many investigations and lawsuits and regulatory actions around the world in many jurisdictions in many countries related to app store practices generally. And so as a result of that, we're increasingly optimistic that there's going to be a change in app store policies one way or another at some point in the not-too-distant future. And so we'll see where we are as time here progresses, and we'll keep everybody updated on our latest thinking on this. 
As far as the Tinder former employee litigation goes, ultimately, it's an ongoing litigation. So there's not too much that we can really provide in terms of details on that. What I can say is that we ran a process that involved 2 globally recognized, highly regarded investment banks that listen to everything that is now plaintiffs in this case had to say about the business, went through an exhaustive analysis. And those banks ultimately came up with a valuation of Tinder at the time that was in line with where Wall Street analysts, like those who are on the phone, thought Tinder was valued. So wasn't particularly surprising from that standpoint. 
And so we're confident in our case and that we think their case is completely meritless. And so we're looking forward to getting to the trial later in the fall and fighting this to the end. And so that's our plan, and we remain optimistic."

So there's still plenty of room for both user and monetization growth in these limited English-speaking markets they currently are in. Our plan is in 2022 to translate and localize the app and start the journey of expansion into international markets. So longer term, it's a combination of further expansion in existing markets, increasing footprint in international markets and continued execution and monetization features that will drive strong growth in the coming years. 
And we're very excited for what is still to come at Hinge. It is a uniquely differentiated product that resonates to its audience that is a little serious intent and outcome-driven. This is why their tagline, Designed to be Deleted, resonates with this audience set. 
We have found very little evidence on cannibalization. Tinder is still the #1 dating app for anybody starting out dating, particularly among the young. But Hinge is a great alternative app and a second app for people who are looking for a more serious intent dating. And so we do think there is a real play for both Tinder and Hinge in our portfolio.

Gary and I are once again doing this from our offices here in Dallas. And while our offices are not fully open yet, we did resume some travel and in-person meetings in Q2 as the vast majority of our employees got vaccinated. 
And this optimism was also reflected in the sentiment of our users, particularly in the U.S. and parts of Europe. As a result, every one of our major brands grew revenue in Q2, collectively delivering 27% year-over-year growth. And we have solid momentum as we enter the second half of the year.
As much as I'm ready for COVID to no longer be a topic of discussion, it does appear that we have to live with it for a little while longer. At the end of the day, widespread global vaccinations are really the only way out of this pandemic for us, which is why our brands have been particularly active these past few months collaborating with the White House in the U.S. and the governments in the U.K., France and Ireland on PSAs and vaccine information campaigns and even a summer rap hit about the vaccine. Turns out, daters are open to and are getting vaccinated at higher rates than the average population, which is certainly a very good thing. And vaccine badges have become a very attractive feature on many of our platforms.
In recent weeks, we have been monitoring the surge of the Delta variant and the various restrictions in countries, particularly in Asia. We've learned a lot these past 16 months about the impact of case surges and restrictions to mobility, uncertainty driving new cycles, et cetera, on our metrics and business in various parts of the world. And our confidence in the continued resilience of our business is based on what we've seen. People around the globe have continued to turn to our products for conversations, flirtations, first video dates, real-life dates. 
And for me, one of the exciting things about this quarter was Tinder's product launches, which are part of an app experience transformation journey that, quite frankly, we haven't undertaken since its very early days. The team there is executing really well, carefully testing the building blocks of this transformation road map. It's been super encouraging to see the promising engagement metrics with these new products. And Tinder subscribers/payer additions in Q2 were among some of the highest we've seen, and this momentum has continued into July.
In the second quarter, we also closed the Hyperconnect deal. And even though travel restrictions have prevented us from meeting in person, our teams have quickly mobilized to collaborate on a number of exciting potential synergies.
Near term, our priorities to both -- are to both help calibrate and collaborate to drive profitable growth for Hyperconnect, Azar and Hakuna apps and lay out the broader strategy and road map for social discovery. We are also starting the work to roll out Hyperconnect's video, audio and AI technologies onto our platforms over the next several months.
Longer term, there is much about this acquisition that excites us. We expect Asia Pacific will soon contribute over 20% of our overall revenue and still offers the biggest growth opportunity, given where the category awareness and penetration stands today. And Hyperconnect gives us a strong, talented team and footprint in the region.
The more I learn about the AR, the conversational AI and other technologies their team and incubation lab has been working on, the more I'm excited about the ability to leverage this on our dating platforms to provide a richer, more akin to real-life experience online. Everything from self-expression to getting to know each other can be transformed. 
One of the Holy Grails for us in online dating has always been to bridge the disconnect that happens between people chatting online and then meeting someone in person. And these technologies will eventually allow us to build experiences that will help people determine if they have that much elusive chemistry or not. And so as I -- as we said in the letter, our ultimate vision here is for people to never have to go on a bad first date again.
Finally, as part of our continuing journey as a fully independent company, we released our first Impact Report in Q2. I have always felt lucky to have spent much of my career at a company with such a fundamental and important social mission of bringing people together and helping them find dates and relationships and love and marriage. We've always been inspired by the success stories of our members, the millions of babies born and love that has been forged by our platforms. And in this annual report, in addition to the social work that we do, we are committed to sharing our performance on ESG metrics and progress in relevant impact areas, including the very important work to develop leading technology and solutions for online safety.
I feel very good about where we are as a company, as a business. And I look forward to continuing to deliver on our vision and goals. And while the Delta variant surge is a reminder that we aren't fully out of the pandemic woods yet, we do have more data and understanding to be able to manage through it with agility.
And with that, I will hand it over to Gary to talk more about the quarter."

We had a terrific Q2 with 27% year-over-year total revenue growth, the strongest growth the company has achieved since 2018. Non-Tinder brands grew direct revenue 28% year-over-year in the quarter, the sixth consecutive quarter where these brands grew in aggregate. Hinge, POF Live! and our BLK and Chispa apps continued to perform very well. Hinge grew revenue nearly 150% in the quarter driven by strength in both subscription and a la carte, led by Roses and Standouts.
At Tinder, propensity to pay has improved significantly, which you can see in the a la carte revenue strength as well as overall payer numbers. Tinder saw a notable acceleration in year-over-year direct revenue growth to 26% in Q2, up from 18% year-over-year growth last quarter and 13% year-over-year growth in Q4 2020. 
Our direct revenue grew 25% in the Americas, 28% in Europe and 31% in APAC and Other. Our U.S. performance is exceptionally strong, and our performance in Europe is trailing slightly behind the U.S., consistent with the pace of the recovery there. 
APAC and Other growth also was solid in Q2. But a number of markets there, including important ones for us like Japan, are now facing increased COVID restrictions. Note that we are now disclosing the performance of the business in 3 geographic regions to give investors better insight into our results.
Indirect revenue grew 54% year-over-year, marking a third consecutive strong quarter as the advertising market generally and our direct sales specifically were very strong. Also note that we closed the acquisition of Hyperconnect in mid-June, so our metrics reflect about 2 weeks of contribution. Net of certain onetime purchase accounting adjustments, Hyperconnect contributed $4.3 million of revenue in Q2. We have broken this information out in the shareholder letter, so you can see what Match Group ex Hyperconnect and what Hyperconnect itself delivered in Q2.
We have also moved to disclosing payers and monthly revenue per payer. In the quarter, total payers reached 15 million, which was an increase of 15% from Q2 2020. Growth was strong in all geographies, up 16% year-over-year in the Americas, 13% in Europe and 17% in APAC and Other. Tinder payers were up 17% year-over-year in Q2. 
For comparison purposes, in Q2, average subscribers increased 1.3 million over the prior year to 11.4 million, representing 13% year-over-year growth. Tinder's average subscribers were up just under 1.1 million or 17% year-over-year and came in at 7.2 million in total. This was the best Tinder year-over-year subscriber growth since the pandemic began and was very strong sequentially as well. All other brand average subscribers were up 240,000 or 6% year-over-year.
Revenue per payer increased 10% year-over-year to $15.46. It was up 8% in the Americas, 13% in Europe and 12% in APAC and Other. RPP was up 8% year-over-year at Tinder. RPP derived 3 percentage points of growth, $0.53, from foreign exchange impacts in the quarter.
At Tinder, Platinum sales and strength in a la carte contributed to RPP growth. Continued strong performance of Plenty of Fish's live streaming business and Hinge's a la carte features contributed to the strength in RPP at the Established and Emerging Brands, respectively.
Total company ARPU was up 10% year-over-year to $0.65. Non-Tinder brands ARPU growth was extremely strong again this quarter, up 16% year-over-year, and Tinder ARPU was up 7% year-over-year. Operating income grew 7%, and EBITDA grew 15% year-over-year in Q2. EBITDA margins were 37%. Net of purchase accounting adjustments, Hyperconnect reduced Match Group EBITDA by $3 million in Q2 from $266 million to $263 million.
Overall expenses, including SBC expense, increased to 70% of revenue compared to 65% in Q2 '20 when we pulled back on spending as the pandemic took hold. Cost of revenue grew 30% year-over-year, impacted by higher IFPs, web hosting costs and fees related to live streaming video at Plenty of Fish.
Sales and marketing spend was up $38 million or 42% year-over-year, close to what we had anticipated, and represented 18% of total revenue in Q2 as many of our brands spent into reopenings. Product development costs grew 24% year-over-year as we increased headcount at several brands, mainly Tinder and Hinge. 
G&A expense rose 66% year-over-year and comprised 16% of revenue. G&A in Q2 included $4 million of professional fees and $9 million of stock-based comp expense, both related to the acquisition of Hyperconnect. Our gross leverage declined to 3.9x at the end of Q2, while our net leverage was 3.7x as we used cash on hand for a portion of the consideration in the Hyperconnect purchase. We're pleased to see both gross and net leverage below 4x, and we're on track for net leverage below 3x by the end of 2021.
For Q3, we expect total revenue from Match Group of $790 million to $805 million, which would represent 23% to 26% year-over-year growth. That's solid growth off what was a very strong Q3 2020 as daters emerged from the initial wave of lockdowns in North America and Europe and Asia had COVID under control.
We expect EBITDA of $275 million to $280 million in Q3. This reflects an additional $15 million of costs in the second half of the year versus our prior expectations for government relations and other advocacy related to app store practices and for legal matters, including the former Tinder employee litigation as we prepare for a fall trial. We think plaintiff's claims in that case are totally without merit and are fully prepared to defend ourselves vigorously to the end. We currently expect that the trial will conclude by the end of the year, and the meaningful cost we've incurred related to this lawsuit should not recur beyond 2021.
For the second half of the year, we expect Hyperconnect to contribute $125 million to $135 million of revenue. This outlook reflects some pullback primarily due to COVID as well as our decision to focus the Hyperconnect team on delivering video and other technology that we can implement across the rest of our portfolio. We expect at least 2 of our brands to make use of Hyperconnect technology before the end of 2021 and a number of others to implement Hyperconnect capabilities by year-end 2022. As a result of this focus on building tech that our other brands can use, we expect Hyperconnect to remain roughly breakeven from an EBITDA standpoint in Q3 and Q4 2021.
For the company as a whole, we expect full year revenue of just above $3 billion, including Hyperconnect, exceeding the high end of our previously stated range. This reflects better-than-expected performance at our dating brands in the first half of 2021 and anticipate second half year-over-year growth north of 25%: approximately 20% at Tinder, single digits at the Established Brands and north of 100% at the Emerging Brands, including the contribution from Hyperconnect.
From an EBITDA perspective, we now expect a range for the full year of $1.045 billion to $1.06 billion. This outlook incorporates Google's recent change in policy to enable our brands to opt out of mandatory in-app billing until at least March 2022.
It also includes the previously mentioned additional legal costs and higher spend for government relations and advocacy to encourage the app stores to reduce their fees. We're increasingly confident that the lawsuits and investigations around the globe related to app store practices will result in changes to those policies in the not-too-distant future.
We've had an outstanding first half of the year where we've accomplished a great deal. Tinder's growth has accelerated, and the product is evolving in exciting ways that we expect will present real revenue opportunities for us over time. Hinge and our other newer, established -- newer apps continue to exceed our expectations, and our more established brands are performing well. 
Importantly, our services are now more in demand than ever as people around the world seek social connection online, whether in the form of companionship, romance or love. With Hyperconnect, our portfolio is increasingly well positioned to deliver on our mission of connecting people, which we expect will enable us to continue to deliver strong results for our stakeholders.
With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions."

So one of the things to note is more than case surges itself, we're actually watching mobility trends and restrictions more closely because they seem to have a larger effect. As vaccination rates gain steam first in the U.S. and then in Europe, we saw mobility increase, and it reflected in our business trends in Q2.
In a few -- in actually several markets in Asia, even today, including Japan, which is our second largest revenue market, there are different degrees of lockdowns and restrictions in place. And that certainly impacts mobility and our metrics.
With respect to what's going on in the U.S. with the Delta surges in recent weeks, so far, they don't appear to have any impact on mobility. And they may not, unless real restrictions are put in place. And generally, we don't see mask mandates as causing mobility restrictions. Mostly partial and full lockdown seem to. 
So for instance, in U.K., where the Delta surged and it has already peaked and it's on its way down, because restrictions were using -- easing during this period, mobility kept increasing. And we didn't really see much impact to our metrics here. So that's kind of how we think about what's going on in the market today."

If you break it down further into the quarters, I think Q3 growth will probably be just under the 20% mark because last year, if you remember, Q3 was very strong. North America and Europe were coming out of the lockdowns, and people got back outside, started being active again. The weather was nice, and Asia had the virus under control. So you had really good conditions globally, which led to a strong Q3 last year. 
For Q4 this year, I'm expecting the growth to be comfortably above 20% year-over-year. But given Q4 is still a quarter away and Tinder has broad geographic exposure, the COVID risks that are still out there necessitate us being a little bit conservative. And so that's what you're seeing as we give our outlook for the back half of the year on Tinder growth."

But as I just said to Cory, there's still some uncertainty in the environment with COVID and Delta and potentially other variants and everything else that people know much about.

But the letter is a little bit unclear, and so I wanted to clarify that each of the group of Swipe apps as well as the Plenty Of Fish LIVE! streaming business are contributing at least $50 million of revenue to that $300 million this year. So Hinge is the balance of the $300 million after the 2 contributions of $50 million plus. 
And as we've said before, Hinge is on track to more than double revenue in 2021 after it tripled. And we gave the performance for Hinge also in the second quarter of 150% revenue growth. So the $250 million, I think, is high. But I've given you the components that should enable you, I think, to determine kind of where we think Hinge is going to be roughly for the year."

It is currently very limited in feature set that it covers. We are encouraged by what we've seen so far and will be expanding to additional markets and more feature coverage over the next few quarters. 
More broadly though, the Tinder experience, as I said, is evolving to include these new multidimensional service areas in the app, where people have new ways to discover and connect and share interest and form communities. And if you think about most of the ALC features today, things like Boost and Super Like, for instance, they are designed to allow users to stand out in a one-to-one experience. And we think there are some real interesting revenue opportunities to help people stand out in these many-to-many experiences on the app that we're building."

There are 2 reasons why payers are higher than average subscribers. The first is that payers captures nonsubscriber ALC payers. But there's another reason, which is the definitions of average subscribers and payers. 
Average subscribers represent a daily average over the quarter, while payers is the number of unique payers in a given month and then it's averaged for the quarter. And so if you look at Match Group overall, at our payer numbers, what you'll see is that the nonsubscriber ALC payers are actually a relatively small part of the difference between average subscribers and payers. It's more a function of the way payers are counted that accounts for payers being higher than average subscribers. So again, ALC payers that are nonsubscribers are a relatively small piece of that disparity. 
Now that being said, we do think that as we expand our ALC monetization efforts, we add virtual currency especially in Asia Pacific, and now we bring on Hyperconnect, which has a lot of nonsubscriber ALC payers, the percentage of nonsubscriber ALC payers is going to increase. So you'll start to see that as we move forward into the year. 
I'd encourage you to look at the specific definitions, which we've provided, of average subscribers as well as payers. And if you have further questions on this, we're happy to try to take this off-line and go through some examples, because I know intuitively it's not that obvious.

As far as kind of what the mix is, Pairs tends to be a subscription business as does Tinder in APAC today. However, as we've talked about, we're experimenting with ways to increase the a la carte consumption at Tinder through virtual currency and other product innovations. We're early days for all that, but we think we can improve payer penetration by adjusting our monetization strategies. And so that's something that you may very well see over time."

So we are -- there are a few things that are leading to somewhat lower growth at Hyperconnect this year than what we expected back in February. The first thing, which you rightly pointed out, was they have a large footprint in APAC. And as we've talked about and as well documented, COVID has hit APAC much more heavily this year than it did in 2020. And so there is COVID impact that is being felt in their performance.
There's also a much more challenging marketing environment. You've got IDFA. You've got a more crowded marketplace. And so as a result of these factors, the Hyperconnect team has been a bit less aggressive in some of their key markets this year than we were initially anticipating.
On top of that, as Shar has talked about, we have become increasingly excited about the opportunities to apply various Hyperconnect technologies to our other platforms. And we see significant synergies and upside from that. And so that's become a higher priority for us and for the Hyperconnect team in the short term. And we've encouraged them to focus resources on the tech integration with Match Group. So we still expect Hyperconnect to perform well this year and post solid revenue growth, but it is going to be a little bit lower than we initially saw. 
As far as the costs, we communicated that we thought over time, margins of Hyperconnect could get into the upper 20s, 30% range. And nothing has really changed our view on that over the longer term. But as I just said, shorter term, we're not focused on margin. We believe the company will still operate at a breakeven pace, but we want to focus on the synergies. And so that's what we're focused on, certainly for the rest of this year and into next year. And then I expect that the margins will gradually start to improve as we make the turn through 2020. And we'll communicate more about that likely on our next call as we start to get some sense of what we think 2020 is going to -- 2022, I'm sorry, is going to be for the company."

So with the Established Brands, there are a few different stories here. Keep in mind, the Established Brands used to be desktop-first brands, and they have all reimagined the product as mobile-first experiences. And some of them, like Match and Meetic, for instance, have shifted their business model from the hard paywall to more freemium experiences, which has meaningfully increased engagement and conversion. 
And apps like POF have added new experiences like POF Live!, which has created a new revenue stream. OkCupid continues to expand to new international markets. And generally, they've also sharpened their marketing to become more resonant and relevant to their core audience. So now as they continue to execute, they should be able to expand the category and their core user base and deliver modest growth, we think."

It was originally supposed to come into effect in the fourth quarter, being pushed to March of '22. I think previously, you were embedding some impact from that change in the fourth quarter EBITDA guide. So I just want to confirm that, that upside was sort of flowed through and maybe the $15 million in incremental legal expenses offsetting that. But I just want to clarify that. And then generally, how you're feeling about that risk heading into March next year and any potential work arounds? And then secondly, just if you could give us your thoughts on the status of the former Tinder employee litigation and how you see that progressing through the course of the year."
355279,1673975317,2362397,"Match Group, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2021",2021-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Match Group, Inc.","Executives","Sure. So on the Google fees in the fourth quarter, I think what we said previously is that where we ended up on our EBITDA ranges would be impacted on whether the Google change actually occurred or not. And at this point, they've now -- about a few weeks",466,"Sure. So on the Google fees in the fourth quarter, I think what we said previously is that where we ended up on our EBITDA ranges would be impacted on whether the Google change actually occurred or not. And at this point, they've now -- about a few weeks ago, they basically said they're pushing back the deadline for compliance until March 31 next year. So that cost is obviously not going to hit us in Q4.
And so now what we've done is we've given a more up-to-date EBITDA outlook the rest of the year, which reflects a lot of puts and takes. You've got the legal and GR costs that you mentioned, and there's more things moving around in there. And then Google is not in there anymore. And so this is our kind of our latest and greatest with everything we know sitting here today factored in.
Frankly, I don't know for sure if that $15 million of extra legal and GR is going to get spent, but we've embedded it. So I think the costs are relatively fully loaded at this point for the rest of the year. 
Then in terms of potential workarounds, we continue to talk to Google. We have a good relationship with them. It's very collaborative, and so we'll see how that all evolves.
That being said, as you probably know, there are many, many investigations and lawsuits and regulatory actions around the world in many jurisdictions, in many countries related to app store practices generally. And so as a result of that, we're increasingly optimistic that there's going to be a change in app store policies one way or another at some point in the not-too-distant future. And so we'll see where we are as time here progresses, and we'll keep everybody updated on our latest thinking on this.
As far as the Tinder former employee litigation goes, ultimately, it's an ongoing litigation. So there's not too much that we can really provide in terms of details on that. What I can say is that we ran a process that involved 2 globally recognized, highly regarded investment banks that listened to everything that this now plaintiffs in this case had to say about the business, went through an exhaustive analysis. And those banks ultimately came up with a valuation of Tinder at the time that was in line with where Wall Street analysts, like those who are on the phone, thought Tinder was valued. So it wasn't particularly surprising from that standpoint. 
And so we're confident in our case and that we think their case is completely meritless. And so we're looking forward to getting to the trial later in the fall and fighting this to the end. And so that's our plan, and we remain optimistic."

So much of 2021 revenue growth has largely been a combination of user growth, concentrated in medium and large cities in these markets as well as the really good work the team has done on developing monetization and revenue features. 
So there's still plenty of room for both user and monetization growth in these limited English-speaking markets they currently are in. Our plan is in 2022 to translate and localize the app and start the journey of expansion into international markets. So longer term, it's a combination of further expansion in existing markets, increasing footprint in international markets and continued execution and monetization features that will drive strong growth in the coming years. 
And we're very excited for what is still to come at Hinge. It is a uniquely differentiated product that resonates to its audience that is a little serious intent and outcome-driven. This is why their tagline, designed to be deleted, resonates with this audience set. 
We have found very little evidence on cannibalization. Tinder is still the #1 dating app for anybody starting out dating, particularly among the young. But Hinge is a great alternative app and a second app for people who are looking for a more serious intent dating. And so we do think there is a real play for both Tinder and Hinge in our portfolio.

Gary and I are once again doing this from our offices here in Dallas. And while our offices are not fully open yet, we did resume some travel and in-person meetings in Q2 as the vast majority of our employees got vaccinated. 
And this optimism was also reflected in the sentiment of our users, particularly in the U.S. and parts of Europe. As a result, every one of our major brands grew revenue in Q2, collectively delivering 27% year-over-year growth. And we have solid momentum as we enter the second half of the year.
As much as I'm ready for COVID to no longer be a topic of discussion, it does appear that we have to live with it for a little while longer. At the end of the day, widespread global vaccinations are really the only way out of this pandemic for us, which is why our brands have been particularly active these past few months collaborating with the White House in the U.S. and the governments in the U.K., France and Ireland on PSAs and vaccine information campaigns and even a summer rap hit about the vaccine. Turns out, daters are open to and are getting vaccinated at higher rates than the average population, which is certainly a very good thing. And vaccine badges have become a very attractive feature on many of our platforms.
In recent weeks, we have been monitoring the surge of the Delta variant and the various restrictions in countries, particularly in Asia. We've learned a lot these past 16 months about the impact of case surges and restrictions to mobility, uncertainty driving new cycles, et cetera, on our metrics and business in various parts of the world. And our confidence in the continued resilience of our business is based on what we've seen. People around the globe have continued to turn to our products for conversations, flirtations, first video dates, real-life dates. 
And for me, one of the exciting things about this quarter was Tinder's product launches, which are part of an app experience transformation journey that, quite frankly, we haven't undertaken since its very early days. The team there is executing really well, carefully testing the building blocks of this transformation road map. It's been super encouraging to see the promising engagement metrics with these new products. And Tinder subscriber/payer additions in Q2 were among some of the highest we've seen, and this momentum has continued into July.
In the second quarter, we also closed the Hyperconnect deal. And even though travel restrictions have prevented us from meeting in person, our teams have quickly mobilized to collaborate on a number of exciting potential synergies.
Near term, our priorities to both -- are to both help calibrate and collaborate to drive profitable growth for Hyperconnect’s Azar and Hakuna apps and lay out the broader strategy and road map for social discovery. We are also starting the work to roll out Hyperconnect's video, audio and AI technologies onto our platforms over the next several months.
Longer term, there is much about this acquisition that excites us. We expect Asia Pacific will soon contribute over 20% of our overall revenue and still offers the biggest growth opportunity given where the category awareness and penetration stands today. And Hyperconnect gives us a strong, talented team and footprint in the region.
The more I learn about the AR, the conversational AI and other technologies their team and incubation lab has been working on, the more I am excited about the ability to leverage this on our dating platforms to provide a richer, more akin to real-life experience online. Everything from self-expression to getting to know each other can be transformed. 
One of the Holy Grails for us in online dating has always been to bridge the disconnect that happens between people chatting online and then meeting someone in person. And these technologies will eventually allow us to build experiences that will help people determine if they have that much elusive chemistry or not. And so as I -- as we said in the letter, our ultimate vision here is for people to never have to go on a bad first date again.
Finally, as part of our continuing journey as a fully independent company, we released our first Impact Report in Q2. I have always felt lucky to have spent much of my career at a company with such a fundamental and important social mission of bringing people together and helping them find dates and relationships and love and marriage. We've always been inspired by the success stories of our members, the millions of babies born and love that has been forged by our platforms. And in this annual report, in addition to the social work that we do, we are committed to sharing our performance on ESG metrics and progress in relevant impact areas, including the very important work to develop leading technology and solutions for online safety.
I feel very good about where we are as a company, as a business. And I look forward to continuing to deliver on our vision and goals. And while the Delta variant surge is a reminder that we aren't fully out of the pandemic woods yet, we do have more data and understanding to be able to manage through it with agility.
And with that, I will hand it over to Gary to talk more about the quarter."

We had a terrific Q2 with 27% year-over-year total revenue growth, the strongest growth the company has achieved since 2018. Non-Tinder brands grew direct revenue 28% year-over-year in the quarter, the sixth consecutive quarter where these brands grew in aggregate. Hinge, POF Live! and our BLK and Chispa apps continued to perform very well. Hinge grew revenue nearly 150% in the quarter driven by strength in both subscription and a la carte, led by Roses and Standouts.
At Tinder, propensity to pay has improved significantly, which you can see in the a la carte revenue strength as well as overall payer numbers. Tinder saw a notable acceleration in year-over-year direct revenue growth to 26% in Q2, up from 18% year-over-year growth last quarter and 13% year-over-year growth in Q4 2020. 
Our direct revenue grew 25% in the Americas, 28% in Europe and 31% in APAC and Other. Our U.S. performance is exceptionally strong, and our performance in Europe is trailing slightly behind the U.S., consistent with the pace of the recovery there. 
APAC and Other growth also was solid in Q2. But a number of markets there, including important ones for us like Japan, are now facing increased COVID restrictions. Note that we are now disclosing the performance of the business in 3 geographic regions to give investors better insight into our results.
Indirect revenue grew 54% year-over-year, marking a third consecutive strong quarter as the advertising market generally and our direct sales specifically were very strong. Also note that we closed the acquisition of Hyperconnect in mid-June, so our metrics reflect about 2 weeks of contribution. Net of certain onetime purchase accounting adjustments, Hyperconnect contributed $4.3 million of revenue in Q2. We have broken this information out in the shareholder letter, so you can see what Match Group ex Hyperconnect and what Hyperconnect itself delivered in Q2.
We have also moved to disclosing Pairs and monthly revenue per payer. In the quarter, total payers reached 15 million, which was an increase of 15% from Q2 2020. Growth was strong in all geographies, up 16% year-over-year in the Americas, 13% in Europe and 17% in APAC and Other. Tinder payers were up 17% year-over-year in Q2. 
For comparison purposes, in Q2, average subscribers increased 1.3 million over the prior year to 11.4 million, representing 13% year-over-year growth. Tinder's average subscribers were up just under 1.1 million or 17% year-over-year and came in at 7.2 million in total. This was the best Tinder year-over-year subscriber growth since the pandemic began and was very strong sequentially as well. All other brand average subscribers were up 240,000 or 6% year-over-year.
Revenue per payer increased 10% year-over-year to $15.46. It was up 8% in the Americas, 13% in Europe and 12% in APAC and Other. RPP was up 8% year-over-year at Tinder. RPP derived 3 percentage points of growth, $0.53, from foreign exchange impacts in the quarter.
At Tinder, Platinum sales and strength in a la carte contributed to RPP growth. Continued strong performance of Plenty of Fish's LIVE! streaming business and Hinge's a la carte features contributed to the strength in RPP at the Established and Emerging Brands, respectively.
Total company ARPU was up 10% year-over-year to $0.65. Non-Tinder brands ARPU growth was extremely strong again this quarter, up 16% year-over-year, and Tinder ARPU was up 7% year-over-year. Operating income grew 7%, and EBITDA grew 15% year-over-year in Q2. EBITDA margins were 37%. Net of purchase accounting adjustments, Hyperconnect reduced Match Group EBITDA by $3 million in Q2 from $266 million to $263 million.
Overall expenses, including SBC expense, increased to 70% of revenue compared to 65% in Q2 '20 when we pulled back on spending as the pandemic took hold. Cost of revenue grew 30% year-over-year, impacted by higher in-app fees, web hosting costs and fees related to live streaming video at Plenty of Fish.
Sales and marketing spend was up $38 million or 42% year-over-year, close to what we had anticipated and represented 18% of total revenue in Q2 as many of our brands spent into reopenings. Product development costs grew 24% year-over-year as we increased head count at several brands, mainly Tinder and Hinge. 
G&A expense rose 66% year-over-year and comprised 16% of revenue. G&A in Q2 included $4 million of professional fees and $9 million of stock-based comp expense, both related to the acquisition of Hyperconnect. Our gross leverage declined to 3.9x at the end of Q2, while our net leverage was 3.7x as we use cash on hand for a portion of the consideration in the Hyperconnect purchase. We're pleased to see both gross and net leverage below 4x, and we're on track for net leverage below 3x by the end of 2021.
For Q3, we expect total revenue for Match Group of $790 million to $805 million, which would represent 23% to 26% year-over-year growth. That solid growth off what was a very strong Q3 2020 as daters emerged from the initial wave of lockdowns in North America and Europe and Asia had COVID under control.
We expect EBITDA of $275 million to $280 million in Q3. This reflects an additional $15 million of costs in the second half of the year versus our prior expectations for government relations and other advocacy related to app store practices and for legal matters, including the former Tinder employee litigation as we prepare for a fall trial. We think plaintiff's claims in that case are totally without merit and are fully prepared to defend ourselves vigorously to the end. We currently expect that the trial will conclude by the end of the year, and the meaningful cost we've incurred related to this lawsuit should not recur beyond 2021.
For the second half of the year, we expect Hyperconnect to contribute $125 million to $135 million of revenue. This outlook reflects some pullback primarily due to COVID as well as our decision to focus the Hyperconnect team on delivering video and other technology that we can implement across the rest of our portfolio. We expect at least 2 of our brands to make use of Hyperconnect technology before the end of 2021 and a number of others to implement Hyperconnect capabilities by year-end 2022. As a result of this focus on building tech that our other brands can use, we expect Hyperconnect to remain roughly breakeven from an EBITDA standpoint in Q3 and Q4 2021.
For the company as a whole, we expect full year revenue of just above $3 billion, including Hyperconnect, exceeding the high end of our previously stated range. This reflects better-than-expected performance at our dating brands in the first half of 2021 and anticipate second half year-over-year growth north of 25% -- approximately 20% at Tinder, single digits at the Established Brands and north of 100% at the Emerging Brands, including the contribution from Hyperconnect.
From an EBITDA perspective, we now expect a range for the full year of $1.045 billion to $1.06 billion. This outlook incorporates Google's recent change in policy to enable our brands to opt out of mandatory in-app billing until at least March 2022.
It also includes the previously mentioned additional legal costs and higher spend for government relations and advocacy to encourage the app stores to reduce their fees. We're increasingly confident that the lawsuits and investigations around the globe related to app store practices will result in changes to those policies in the not-too-distant future.
We've had an outstanding first half of the year where we've accomplished a great deal. Tinder's growth has accelerated, and the product is evolving in exciting ways that we expect will present real revenue opportunities for us over time. Hinge and our other newer, established -- newer apps continue to exceed our expectations, and our more established brands are performing well. 
Importantly, our services are now more in demand than ever as people around the world seek social connection online, whether in the form of companionship, romance or love. With Hyperconnect, our portfolio is increasingly well positioned to deliver on our mission of connecting people, which we expect will enable us to continue to deliver strong results for our stakeholders.
With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions."

So one of the things to note is more than case surges itself, we're actually watching mobility trends and restrictions more closely because they seem to have a larger effect. As vaccination rates gain steam first in the U.S. and then in Europe, we saw mobility increase, and it reflected in our business trends in Q2.
In a few -- in actually several markets in Asia even today, including Japan, which is our second largest revenue market, there are different degrees of lockdowns and restrictions in place. And that certainly impacts mobility and our metrics.
With respect to what's going on in the U.S. with the Delta surges in recent weeks, so far, they don't appear to have any impact on mobility. And they may not, unless real restrictions are put in place. And generally, we don't see mask mandates as causing mobility restrictions, mostly partial and full lockdown seem to. 
So for instance, in U.K., where the Delta surged and it has already peaked and it's on its way down because restrictions were using -- easing during this period, mobility kept increasing. And we didn't really see much impact to our metrics here. So that's kind of how we think about what's going on in the market today."

If you break it down further into the quarters, I think Q3 growth will probably be just under the 20% mark because last year, if you remember, Q3 was very strong. North America and Europe were coming out of the lockdowns, and people got back outside, started being active again. The weather was nice, and Asia had the virus under control. So you had really good conditions globally, which led to a strong Q3 last year. 
For Q4 this year, I'm expecting the growth to be comfortably above 20% year-over-year. But given Q4 is still a quarter away and Tinder has broad geographic exposure, the COVID risks that are still out there necessitate us being a little bit conservative. And so that's what you're seeing as we give our outlook for the back half of the year on Tinder growth."

So we feel really good about Q2 in particular, and I think we're very well set up for the rest of the year. 
So right now, sitting here, I think we have good visibility into Q3, and that is reflected in our specific guidance for the quarter. And then we're anticipating really solid sequential revenue growth going into Q4, which would mean that we should see accelerating year-over-year Q4 growth. 
But as I just said to Cory, there's still some uncertainty in the environment with COVID and Delta and potentially other variants and everything else that people know much about. And so we think that a little bit of conservatism is appropriate, especially the further out that we look. And so that's all factored into the guidance we've provided."

That's a good question, actually. So when you look at that chart that's in the letter related to the Swipe apps and Plenty of Fish LIVE! and Hinge, it really is impressive what we've been able to achieve getting those businesses from virtually nothing to $300-or-so million this year in aggregate. But the letter is a little bit unclear, and so I wanted to clarify that each of the group of Swipe apps as well as the Plenty of Fish LIVE! streaming business are contributing at least $50 million of revenue to that $300 million this year. So Hinge is the balance of the $300 million after the 2 contributions of $50 million plus. 
And as we've said before, Hinge is on track to more than double revenue in 2021 after it tripled. And we gave the performance for Hinge also in the second quarter of 150% revenue growth. So the $250 million, I think, is high. But I've given you the components. It should enable you, I think, to determine kind of where we think Hinge is going to be roughly for the year."

It is currently very limited in feature set that it covers. We are encouraged by what we've seen so far and will be expanding to additional markets and more feature coverage over the next few quarters. 
More broadly though, the Tinder experience, as I said, is evolving to include these new multidimensional surface areas in the app, where people have new ways to discover and connect and share interest and form communities. And if you think about most of the ALC features today, things like Boost and Super Like, for instance, they are designed to allow users to stand out in a one-to-one experience. And we think there are some real interesting revenue opportunities to help people stand out in these many-to-many experiences on the app that we're building."

There are 2 reasons why payers are higher than average subscribers. The first is that payers captures nonsubscriber ALC payers. But there's another reason, which is the definitions of average subscribers and payers. 
Average subscribers represent a daily average over the quarter, while payers is the number of unique payers in a given month and then it's averaged for the quarter. And so if you look at Match Group overall, at our payer numbers, what you'll see is that the nonsubscriber ALC payers are actually a relatively small part of the difference between average subscribers and payers. It's more a function of the way payers are counted that accounts for payers being higher than average subscribers. So again, ALC payers that are nonsubscribers are a relatively small piece of that disparity. 
Now that being said, we do think that as we expand our ALC monetization efforts, we add virtual currency especially in Asia Pacific, and now we bring on Hyperconnect, which has a lot of nonsubscriber ALC payers, the percentage of nonsubscriber ALC payers is going to increase. So you'll start to see that as we move forward into the year. 
I'd encourage you to look at the specific definitions, which we provided of average subscribers as well as payers. And if you have further questions on this, we're happy to try to take this off-line and go through some examples because I know intuitively it's not that obvious. But again, the definitions are what's accounting for a large part of the gap."

And then we actually have relative price parity between Tinder in APAC and our other geographies. You don't see much of a disparity. And so those 2 things taken together as a result, APAC RPP is pretty similar to the rest of the world. 
As far as kind of what the mix is, Pairs tends to be a subscription business as does Tinder in APAC today. However, as we've talked about, we're experimenting with ways to increase the a la carte consumption at Tinder through virtual currency and other product innovations. We're early days for all that, but we think we can improve payer penetration by adjusting our monetization strategies. And so that's something that you may very well see over time."

So we are -- there are a few things that are leading to somewhat lower growth at Hyperconnect this year than what we expected back in February. The first thing which you rightly pointed out was they have a large footprint in APAC. And as we've talked about and as well documented, COVID has hit APAC much more heavily this year than it did in 2020. And so there is COVID impact that is being felt in their performance.
There's also a much more challenging marketing environment. You've got IDFA. You've got a more crowded marketplace. And so as a result of these factors, the Hyperconnect team has been a bit less aggressive in some of their key markets this year than we were initially anticipating.
On top of that, as Shar has talked about, we have become increasingly excited about the opportunities to apply various Hyperconnect technologies to our other platforms. And we see significant synergies and upside from that. And so that's become a higher priority for us and for the Hyperconnect team in the short term. And we've encouraged them to focus resources on the tech integration with Match Group. So we still expect Hyperconnect to perform well this year and post solid revenue growth, but it is going to be a little bit lower than we initially saw. 
As far as the costs, we communicated that we thought over time, margins of Hyperconnect could get into the upper 20s, 30% range. And nothing has really changed our view on that over the longer term. But as I just said, shorter term, we're not focused on margin. We believe the company will still operate at a breakeven pace, but we want to focus on the synergies. And so that's what we're focused on, certainly for the rest of this year and into next year. And then I expect that the margins will gradually start to improve as we make the turn through 2020. And we'll communicate more about that likely on our next call as we start to get some sense of what we think 2020 is going to -- 2022, I'm sorry, is going to be for the company."

And then generally, how you're feeling about that risk heading into March next year and any potential work arounds? And then secondly, just if you could give us your thoughts on the status of the former Tinder employee litigation and how you see that progressing through the course of the year."

So on the Google fees in the fourth quarter, I think what we said previously is that where we ended up on our EBITDA ranges would be impacted on whether the Google change actually occurred or not. And at this point, they've now -- about a few weeks ago, they basically said they're pushing back the deadline for compliance until March 31 next year. So that cost is obviously not going to hit us in Q4.
And so now what we've done is we've given a more up-to-date EBITDA outlook the rest of the year, which reflects a lot of puts and takes. You've got legal and GR costs that you mentioned, and there's more things moving around in there. And then Google is not in there anymore. And so this is our kind of our latest and greatest with everything we know sitting here today factored in.
Frankly, I don't know for sure if that $15 million of extra legal and GR is going to get spent, but we've embedded it. So I think the costs are relatively fully loaded at this point for the rest of the year. Then in terms of potential workarounds, we continue to talk to Google. We have a good relationship with them. It's very collaborative, and so we'll see how that all evolves.
That being said, as you probably know, there are many, many investigations and lawsuits and regulatory actions around the world in many jurisdictions, in many countries related to app store practices generally. And so as a result of that, we're increasingly optimistic that there's going to be a change in app store policies one way or another at some point in the not-too-distant future. And so we'll see where we are as time here progresses, and we'll keep everybody updated on our latest thinking on this.
As far as the Tinder former employee litigation goes, ultimately, it's an ongoing litigation. So there's not too much that we can really provide in terms of details on that. What I can say is that we ran a process that involved 2 globally recognized, highly regarded investment banks that listen to everything that this now plaintiffs in this case had to say about the business, went through an exhaustive analysis. And those banks ultimately came up with a valuation of Tinder at the time that was in line with where Wall Street analysts, like those who are on the phone, thought Tinder was valued. So it wasn't particularly surprising from that standpoint. 
And so we're confident in our case and that we think their case is completely meritless. And so we're looking forward to getting to the trial later in the fall and fighting this to the end. And so that's our plan, and we remain optimistic."

So there's still plenty of room for both user and monetization growth in these limited English-speaking markets they currently are in. Our plan is in 2022 to translate and localize the app and start the journey of expansion into international markets. So longer term, it's a combination of further expansion in existing markets, increasing footprint in international markets and continued execution and monetization features that will drive strong growth in the coming years. 
And we're very excited for what is still to come at Hinge. It is a uniquely differentiated product that resonates to its audience that is of a little serious intent and outcome-driven. This is why their tagline, designed to be deleted, resonates with this audience set. 
We have found very little evidence on cannibalization. Tinder is still the #1 dating app for anybody starting out dating, particularly among the young. But Hinge is a great alternative app and a second app for people who are looking for a more serious intent dating.

Gary and I are once again doing this from our offices here in Dallas. And while our offices are not fully open yet, we did resume some travel and in-person meetings in Q2 as the vast majority of our employees got vaccinated. 
And this optimism was also reflected in the sentiment of our users, particularly in the U.S. and parts of Europe. As a result, every one of our major brands grew revenue in Q2, collectively delivering 27% year-over-year growth. And we have solid momentum as we enter the second half of the year.
As much as I'm ready for COVID to no longer be a topic of discussion, it does appear that we have to live with it for a little while longer. At the end of the day, widespread global vaccinations are really the only way out of this pandemic for us, which is why our brands have been particularly active these past few months collaborating with the White House in the U.S. and the governments in the U.K., France and Ireland on PSAs and vaccine information campaigns and even a summer rap hit about the vaccine. Turns out, daters are open to and are getting vaccinated at higher rates than the average population, which is certainly a very good thing. And vaccine badges have become a very attractive feature on many of our platforms.
In recent weeks, we have been monitoring the surge of the Delta variant and the various restrictions in countries, particularly in Asia. We've learned a lot these past 16 months about the impact of case surges and restrictions to mobility, uncertainty driving new cycles, et cetera, on our metrics and business in various parts of the world. And our confidence in the continued resilience of our business is based on what we've seen. People around the globe have continued to turn to our products for conversations, flirtations, first video dates, real-life dates. 
And for me, one of the exciting things about this quarter was Tinder's product launches, which are part of an app experience transformation journey that, quite frankly, we haven't undertaken since its very early days. The team there is executing really well, carefully testing the building blocks of this transformation road map. It's been super encouraging to see the promising engagement metrics with these new products. And Tinder subscriber/payer additions in Q2 were among some of the highest we've seen, and this momentum has continued into July.
In the second quarter, we also closed the Hyperconnect deal. And even though travel restrictions have prevented us from meeting in person, our teams have quickly mobilized to collaborate on a number of exciting potential synergies.
Near term, our priorities to both -- are to both help calibrate and collaborate to drive profitable growth for Hyperconnect’s Azar and Hakuna apps and lay out the broader strategy and road map for social discovery. We are also starting the work to roll out Hyperconnect's video, audio and AI technologies onto our platforms over the next several months.
Longer term, there is much about this acquisition that excites us. We expect Asia Pacific will soon contribute over 20% of our overall revenue and still offers the biggest growth opportunity given where the category awareness and penetration stands today. And Hyperconnect gives us a strong, talented team and footprint in the region.
The more I learn about the AR, the conversational AI and other technologies their team and incubation lab has been working on, the more I am excited about the ability to leverage this on our dating platforms to provide a richer, more akin to real-life experience online. Everything from self-expression to getting to know each other can be transformed. 
One of the Holy Grails for us in online dating has always been to bridge the disconnect that happens between people chatting online and then meeting someone in person. And these technologies will eventually allow us to build experiences that will help people determine if they have that much elusive chemistry or not. And so as I -- as we said in the letter, our ultimate vision here is for people to never have to go on a bad first date again.
Finally, as part of our continuing journey as a fully independent company, we released our first Impact Report in Q2. I have always felt lucky to have spent much of my career at a company with such a fundamental and important social mission of bringing people together and helping them find dates and relationships and love and marriage. We've always been inspired by the success stories of our members, the millions of babies born and love that has been forged by our platforms. And in this annual report, in addition to the social work that we do, we are committed to sharing our performance on ESG metrics and progress in relevant impact areas, including the very important work to develop leading technology and solutions for online safety.
I feel very good about where we are as a company, as a business. And I look forward to continuing to deliver on our vision and goals. And while the Delta variant surge is a reminder that we aren't fully out of the pandemic woods yet, we do have more data and understanding to be able to manage through it with agility.
And with that, I will hand it over to Gary to talk more about the quarter."
355279,1673975317,2363849,"Match Group, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2021",2021-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Match Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Shar.

It's great to be here again in person with you and the team in Dallas today. Seeing colleagues working together makes me very much look forward to days when the office will be filled with activity once again.
We had a terrific Q2 with 27% year-over-year total revenue growth, the strongest growth the company has achieved since 2018. Non-Tinder brands grew direct revenue 28% year-over-year in the quarter, the sixth consecutive quarter where these brands grew in aggregate. Hinge, POF Live! and our BLK and Chispa apps continued to perform very well. Hinge grew revenue nearly 150% in the quarter driven by strength in both subscription and a la carte, led by Roses and Standouts.
At Tinder, propensity to pay has improved significantly, which you can see in the a la carte revenue strength as well as overall payer numbers. Tinder saw a notable acceleration in year-over-year direct revenue growth to 26% in Q2, up from 18% year-over-year growth last quarter and 13% year-over-year growth in Q4 2020. 
Our direct revenue grew 25% in the Americas, 28% in Europe and 31% in APAC and Other. Our U.S. performance is exceptionally strong, and our performance in Europe is trailing slightly behind the U.S., consistent with the pace of the recovery there. 
APAC and Other growth also was solid in Q2. But a number of markets there, including important ones for us like Japan, are now facing increased COVID restrictions. Note that we are now disclosing the performance of the business in 3 geographic regions to give investors better insight into our results.
Indirect revenue grew 54% year-over-year, marking a third consecutive strong quarter as the advertising market generally and our direct sales specifically were very strong. Also note that we closed the acquisition of Hyperconnect in mid-June, so our metrics reflect about 2 weeks of contribution. Net of certain onetime purchase accounting adjustments, Hyperconnect contributed $4.3 million of revenue in Q2. We have broken this information out in the shareholder letter, so you can see what Match Group ex Hyperconnect and what Hyperconnect itself delivered in Q2.
We have also moved to disclosing Pairs and monthly revenue per payer. In the quarter, total payers reached 15 million, which was an increase of 15% from Q2 2020. Growth was strong in all geographies, up 16% year-over-year in the Americas, 13% in Europe and 17% in APAC and Other. Tinder payers were up 17% year-over-year in Q2. 
For comparison purposes, in Q2, average subscribers increased 1.3 million over the prior year to 11.4 million, representing 13% year-over-year growth. Tinder's average subscribers were up just under 1.1 million or 17% year-over-year and came in at 7.2 million in total. This was the best Tinder year-over-year subscriber growth since the pandemic began and was very strong sequentially as well. All other brand average subscribers were up 240,000 or 6% year-over-year.
Revenue per payer increased 10% year-over-year to $15.46. It was up 8% in the Americas, 13% in Europe and 12% in APAC and Other. RPP was up 8% year-over-year at Tinder. RPP derived 3 percentage points of growth, $0.53, from foreign exchange impacts in the quarter.
At Tinder, Platinum sales and strength in a la carte contributed to RPP growth. Continued strong performance of Plenty of Fish's LIVE! streaming business and Hinge's a la carte features contributed to the strength in RPP at the Established and Emerging Brands, respectively.
Total company ARPU was up 10% year-over-year to $0.65. Non-Tinder brands ARPU growth was extremely strong again this quarter, up 16% year-over-year, and Tinder ARPU was up 7% year-over-year. Operating income grew 7%, and EBITDA grew 15% year-over-year in Q2. EBITDA margins were 37%. Net of purchase accounting adjustments, Hyperconnect reduced Match Group EBITDA by $3 million in Q2 from $266 million to $263 million.
Overall expenses, including SBC expense, increased to 70% of revenue compared to 65% in Q2 '20 when we pulled back on spending as the pandemic took hold. Cost of revenue grew 30% year-over-year, impacted by higher in-app fees, web hosting costs and fees related to live streaming video at Plenty of Fish.
Sales and marketing spend was up $38 million or 42% year-over-year, close to what we had anticipated and represented 18% of total revenue in Q2 as many of our brands spent into reopenings. Product development costs grew 24% year-over-year as we increased head count at several brands, mainly Tinder and Hinge. 
G&A expense rose 66% year-over-year and comprised 16% of revenue. G&A in Q2 included $4 million of professional fees and $9 million of stock-based comp expense, both related to the acquisition of Hyperconnect. Our gross leverage declined to 3.9x at the end of Q2, while our net leverage was 3.7x as we use cash on hand for a portion of the consideration in the Hyperconnect purchase. We're pleased to see both gross and net leverage below 4x, and we're on track for net leverage below 3x by the end of 2021.
For Q3, we expect total revenue for Match Group of $790 million to $805 million, which would represent 23% to 26% year-over-year growth. That solid growth off what was a very strong Q3 2020 as daters emerged from the initial wave of lockdowns in North America and Europe and Asia had COVID under control.
We expect EBITDA of $275 million to $280 million in Q3. This reflects an additional $15 million of costs in the second half of the year versus our prior expectations for government relations and other advocacy related to app store practices and for legal matters, including the former Tinder employee litigation as we prepare for a fall trial. We think plaintiff's claims in that case are totally without merit and are fully prepared to defend ourselves vigorously to the end. We currently expect that the trial will conclude by the end of the year, and the meaningful cost we've incurred related to this lawsuit should not recur beyond 2021.
For the second half of the year, we expect Hyperconnect to contribute $125 million to $135 million of revenue. This outlook reflects some pullback primarily due to COVID as well as our decision to focus the Hyperconnect team on delivering video and other technology that we can implement across the rest of our portfolio. We expect at least 2 of our brands to make use of Hyperconnect technology before the end of 2021 and a number of others to implement Hyperconnect capabilities by year-end 2022. As a result of this focus on building tech that our other brands can use, we expect Hyperconnect to remain roughly breakeven from an EBITDA standpoint in Q3 and Q4 2021.
For the company as a whole, we expect full year revenue of just above $3 billion, including Hyperconnect, exceeding the high end of our previously stated range. This reflects better-than-expected performance at our dating brands in the first half of 2021 and anticipate second half year-over-year growth north of 25% -- approximately 20% at Tinder, single digits at the Established Brands and north of 100% at the Emerging Brands, including the contribution from Hyperconnect.
From an EBITDA perspective, we now expect a range for the full year of $1.045 billion to $1.06 billion. This outlook incorporates Google's recent change in policy to enable our brands to opt out of mandatory in-app billing until at least March 2022.
It also includes the previously mentioned additional legal costs and higher spend for government relations and advocacy to encourage the app stores to reduce their fees. We're increasingly confident that the lawsuits and investigations around the globe related to app store practices will result in changes to those policies in the not-too-distant future.
We've had an outstanding first half of the year where we've accomplished a great deal. Tinder's growth has accelerated, and the product is evolving in exciting ways that we expect will present real revenue opportunities for us over time. Hinge and our other newer, established -- newer apps continue to exceed our expectations, and our more established brands are performing well. 
Importantly, our services are now more in demand than ever as people around the world seek social connection online, whether in the form of companionship, romance or love. With Hyperconnect, our portfolio is increasingly well positioned to deliver on our mission of connecting people, which we expect will enable us to continue to deliver strong results for our stakeholders.
With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions."

So one of the things to note is more than case surges itself, we're actually watching mobility trends and restrictions more closely because they seem to have a larger effect. As vaccination rates gain steam first in the U.S. and then in Europe, we saw mobility increase, and it reflected in our business trends in Q2.
In a few -- in actually several markets in Asia even today, including Japan, which is our second largest revenue market, there are different degrees of lockdowns and restrictions in place. And that certainly impacts mobility and our metrics.
With respect to what's going on in the U.S. with the Delta surges in recent weeks, so far, they don't appear to have any impact on mobility. And they may not, unless real restrictions are put in place. And generally, we don't see mask mandates as causing mobility restrictions, mostly partial and full lockdown seem to. 
So for instance, in U.K., where the Delta surged and it has already peaked and it's on its way down because restrictions were using -- easing during this period, mobility kept increasing. And we didn't really see much impact to our metrics here. So that's kind of how we think about what's going on in the market today."

If you break it down further into the quarters, I think Q3 growth will probably be just under the 20% mark because last year, if you remember, Q3 was very strong. North America and Europe were coming out of the lockdowns, and people got back outside, started being active again. The weather was nice, and Asia had the virus under control. So you had really good conditions globally, which led to a strong Q3 last year. 
For Q4 this year, I'm expecting the growth to be comfortably above 20% year-over-year. But given Q4 is still a quarter away and Tinder has broad geographic exposure, the COVID risks that are still out there necessitate us being a little bit conservative. And so that's what you're seeing as we give our outlook for the back half of the year on Tinder growth."

But as I just said to Cory, there's still some uncertainty in the environment with COVID and Delta and potentially other variants and everything else that people know much about.

But the letter is a little bit unclear, and so I wanted to clarify that each of the group of Swipe apps as well as the Plenty of Fish LIVE! streaming business are contributing at least $50 million of revenue to that $300 million this year. So Hinge is the balance of the $300 million after the 2 contributions of $50 million plus. 
And as we've said before, Hinge is on track to more than double revenue in 2021 after it tripled. And we gave the performance for Hinge also in the second quarter of 150% revenue growth. So the $250 million, I think, is high. But I've given you the components. It should enable you, I think, to determine kind of where we think Hinge is going to be roughly for the year."

It is currently very limited in feature set that it covers. We are encouraged by what we've seen so far and will be expanding to additional markets and more feature coverage over the next few quarters. 
More broadly though, the Tinder experience, as I said, is evolving to include these new multidimensional surface areas in the app, where people have new ways to discover and connect and share interest and form communities. And if you think about most of the ALC features today, things like Boost and Super Like, for instance, they are designed to allow users to stand out in a one-to-one experience. And we think there are some real interesting revenue opportunities to help people stand out in these many-to-many experiences on the app that we're building."

There are 2 reasons why payers are higher than average subscribers. The first is that payers captures nonsubscriber ALC payers. But there's another reason, which is the definitions of average subscribers and payers. 
Average subscribers represent a daily average over the quarter, while payers is the number of unique payers in a given month and then it's averaged for the quarter. And so if you look at Match Group overall, at our payer numbers, what you'll see is that the nonsubscriber ALC payers are actually a relatively small part of the difference between average subscribers and payers. It's more a function of the way payers are counted that accounts for payers being higher than average subscribers. So again, ALC payers that are nonsubscribers are a relatively small piece of that disparity. 
Now that being said, we do think that as we expand our ALC monetization efforts, we add virtual currency especially in Asia Pacific, and now we bring on Hyperconnect, which has a lot of nonsubscriber ALC payers, the percentage of nonsubscriber ALC payers is going to increase. So you'll start to see that as we move forward into the year. 
I'd encourage you to look at the specific definitions, which we provided of average subscribers as well as payers. And if you have further questions on this, we're happy to try to take this off-line and go through some examples because I know intuitively it's not that obvious. But again, the definitions are what's accounting for a large part of the gap."

One is that Pairs in Japan is our highest RPP dating business. So that's definitely helping on the RPP in APAC. And then we actually have relative price parity between Tinder in APAC and our other geographies. You don't see much of a disparity. And so those 2 things taken together as a result, APAC RPP is pretty similar to the rest of the world. 
As far as kind of what the mix is, Pairs tends to be a subscription business as does Tinder in APAC today. However, as we've talked about, we're experimenting with ways to increase the a la carte consumption at Tinder through virtual currency and other product innovations. We're early days for all that, but we think we can improve payer penetration by adjusting our monetization strategies. And so that's something that you may very well see over time."

In fact, Hakuna was a HyperX incubation. 
I am actually really excited about some of the technology elements they've been working on: AR features, self-expression tools, conversational AI and a number of what we would consider metaverse elements, which have the element to transform the online meeting and ""getting to know each other"" process. And so the technology areas of innovation at HyperX is actually very incremental and additive to Match Group. And we do believe it will have a significant impact, both as on their apps as stand-alone business, but also as a technology enabler for our other platforms and businesses."

So we are -- there are a few things that are leading to somewhat lower growth at Hyperconnect this year than what we expected back in February. The first thing which you rightly pointed out was they have a large footprint in APAC. And as we've talked about and as well documented, COVID has hit APAC much more heavily this year than it did in 2020. And so there is COVID impact that is being felt in their performance.
There's also a much more challenging marketing environment. You've got IDFA. You've got a more crowded marketplace. And so as a result of these factors, the Hyperconnect team has been a bit less aggressive in some of their key markets this year than we were initially anticipating.
On top of that, as Shar has talked about, we have become increasingly excited about the opportunities to apply various Hyperconnect technologies to our other platforms. And we see significant synergies and upside from that. And so that's become a higher priority for us and for the Hyperconnect team in the short term. And we've encouraged them to focus resources on the tech integration with Match Group. So we still expect Hyperconnect to perform well this year and post solid revenue growth, but it is going to be a little bit lower than we initially saw. 
As far as the costs, we communicated that we thought over time, margins of Hyperconnect could get into the upper 20s, 30% range. And nothing has really changed our view on that over the longer term. But as I just said, shorter term, we're not focused on margin. We believe the company will still operate at a breakeven pace, but we want to focus on the synergies. And so that's what we're focused on, certainly for the rest of this year and into next year. And then I expect that the margins will gradually start to improve as we make the turn through 2020. And we'll communicate more about that likely on our next call as we start to get some sense of what we think 2020 is going to -- 2022, I'm sorry, is going to be for the company."

So with the Established Brands, there are a few different stories here. Keep in mind, the Established Brands used to be desktop-first brands, and they have all reimagined the product as mobile-first experiences. And some of them, like Match and Meetic, for instance, have shifted their business model from the hard paywall to more freemium experiences, which has meaningfully increased engagement and conversion. 
And apps like POF have added new experiences like POF Live!, which has created a new revenue stream. OkCupid continues to expand to new international markets. And generally, they've also sharpened their marketing to become more resonant and relevant to their core audience. So now as they continue to execute, they should be able to expand the category and their core user base and deliver modest growth, we think."

It was originally supposed to come into effect in the fourth quarter being pushed to March of '22. I think previously, you were embedding some impact from that change in the fourth quarter EBITDA guide. So just want to confirm that that upside was sort of flowed through and maybe the $15 million in incremental legal expense is offsetting that, but just want to clarify that. 
And then generally, how you're feeling about that risk heading into March next year and any potential work arounds? And then secondly, just if you could give us your thoughts on the status of the former Tinder employee litigation and how you see that progressing through the course of the year."
355279,1673975317,2363849,"Match Group, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2021",2021-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Match Group, Inc.","Executives","Sure. So on the Google fees in the fourth quarter, I think what we said previously is that where we ended up on our EBITDA ranges would be impacted on whether the Google change actually occurred or not. And at this point, they've now -- about a few weeks",465,"Sure. So on the Google fees in the fourth quarter, I think what we said previously is that where we ended up on our EBITDA ranges would be impacted on whether the Google change actually occurred or not. And at this point, they've now -- about a few weeks ago, they basically said they're pushing back the deadline for compliance until March 31 next year. So that cost is obviously not going to hit us in Q4.
And so now what we've done is we've given a more up-to-date EBITDA outlook the rest of the year, which reflects a lot of puts and takes. You've got legal and GR costs that you mentioned, and there's more things moving around in there. And then Google is not in there anymore. And so this is our kind of our latest and greatest with everything we know sitting here today factored in.
Frankly, I don't know for sure if that $15 million of extra legal and GR is going to get spent, but we've embedded it. So I think the costs are relatively fully loaded at this point for the rest of the year. Then in terms of potential workarounds, we continue to talk to Google. We have a good relationship with them. It's very collaborative, and so we'll see how that all evolves.
That being said, as you probably know, there are many, many investigations and lawsuits and regulatory actions around the world in many jurisdictions, in many countries related to app store practices generally. And so as a result of that, we're increasingly optimistic that there's going to be a change in app store policies one way or another at some point in the not-too-distant future. And so we'll see where we are as time here progresses, and we'll keep everybody updated on our latest thinking on this.
As far as the Tinder former employee litigation goes, ultimately, it's an ongoing litigation. So there's not too much that we can really provide in terms of details on that. What I can say is that we ran a process that involved 2 globally recognized, highly regarded investment banks that listen to everything that this now plaintiffs in this case had to say about the business, went through an exhaustive analysis. And those banks ultimately came up with a valuation of Tinder at the time that was in line with where Wall Street analysts, like those who are on the phone, thought Tinder was valued. So it wasn't particularly surprising from that standpoint. 
And so we're confident in our case and that we think their case is completely meritless. And so we're looking forward to getting to the trial later in the fall and fighting this to the end. And so that's our plan, and we remain optimistic."

So much of 2021 revenue growth has largely been a combination of user growth, concentrated in medium and large cities in these markets as well as the really good work the team has done on developing monetization and revenue features. 
So there's still plenty of room for both user and monetization growth in these limited English-speaking markets they currently are in. Our plan is in 2022 to translate and localize the app and start the journey of expansion into international markets. So longer term, it's a combination of further expansion in existing markets, increasing footprint in international markets and continued execution and monetization features that will drive strong growth in the coming years. 
And we're very excited for what is still to come at Hinge. It is a uniquely differentiated product that resonates to its audience that is of a little serious intent and outcome-driven. This is why their tagline, designed to be deleted, resonates with this audience set. 
We have found very little evidence on cannibalization. Tinder is still the #1 dating app for anybody starting out dating, particularly among the young. But Hinge is a great alternative app and a second app for people who are looking for a more serious intent dating. And so we do think there is a real play for both Tinder and Hinge in our portfolio.

Today, Gary and I are doing this call from our brand-new offices in New York. 
We had another strong quarter with over 25% year-over-year revenue growth, also a record EBITDA quarter for us. Tinder, in particular, showed real strength with not only 20-plus percent revenue growth, but also adding a record number of subscribers and payers this quarter. It is a historical high for Tinder, even higher than the quarter when Tinder Gold rolled out. 
I'm also excited to have our first woman CEO at Tinder. Renate has seamlessly taken over the helm there, and the team hasn't missed a beat in their journey to transform the Tinder experience. 
Explore, which is a new surface area within the Tinder app, rolled out globally a couple of weeks ago. It is a dynamic interface, which allows users to connect with others through new experiences beyond the swipe that used to be Tinder. These experiences can be tailored by market, it keeps Tinder at the center of culture, give users new reasons to keep coming back, increases engagement and activity. 
In fact, our successful Swipe Night series is coming to Tinder on Explore in a brand-new series starting November 7. Not only is it a very compelling Gen Z who's done its story line, this time, it has a bunch of features like fast chat built in that should amplify the conversations that follow on Tinder. 
Hinge had another great quarter across all metrics, doubling revenue again. The one business that is seeing an unexpected softness is the main revenue-driving app at Hyperconnect, Azar. It's had a few months of headwinds in some key markets in Asia. Some of it is COVID, some of it is marketing performance, some product-related delays. 
However, South Korea has finally opened up to international travel, and our teams were able to meet over the last couple of weeks in person. We're working closely with them now on marketing the product road map in order to reverse the trend. I am extremely optimistic about this team and technology assets as a long-term value creator for our portfolio, especially as we enter what we described in the shareholder letter as the next phase of Match Group's evolution in the dating category. 
In fact, my long-term thesis was further validated in the last couple of weeks when the team there walked me through a new concept they're beta testing on some college campuses in Seoul. It's called Single Town. It is a platform where your digital self in the form of real-time audio-powered avatar can serendipitously meet others in virtual spaces, like a bar or they -- you can sit down with someone in a park bench to have one-on-one or group conversation. 
There is, for instance, a piano bar where people's digital selves are gathering around, but they're actually playing their pianos at home and jamming with others. You can overhear conversations, join conversations. You can tap into the digital avatars to see more of that profile, and you have basically a richer set of signals to help connect with someone. 
It is metaverse experiences coming to life in a way that is transformative to how people meet and get to know each other on a dating or social discovery platform and is much more akin to how people interact in the real world. It is super early, but we are seeing some encouraging early signals in terms of engagement among Gen Z in Seoul. 
Already, the average daily time spend is about an hour and growing. Some cultures are forming. It is resonating with both genders. And as we talked about in our letter, this next phase of dating apps, in particular, is going to be all about richer, more organic and more akin to real-life ways of discovering, meeting and getting to know people. 
Technology is finally getting down. And this underlying technology platform Hyperconnect has built that power Single Town has been built in a way that it can be leveraged by other platforms easily. So my long-term view on what this talented team and technology brings to the portfolio is ever stronger. 
Finally, based on everything we're hearing and seeing, this coming season should be a strong one as people are ready to shake off the COVID malaise and get out there and date and meet. It's also shaping up to be one of the busiest wedding seasons. 
I feel good about a reenergized and much more social holiday season. These social interactions are incredibly important for our collective mental health and well-being. So I, for one, I'm rooting for a hell of a holiday season and a post-holiday peak season for us as we enter the new year. 
And with that, I will hand it over to Gary to provide some more color on the quarter."

We had a strong Q3 with total revenue of $802 million, up 25% year-over-year. Our businesses, excluding Hyperconnect, produced total revenue of $748 million, up 17% year-over-year. Total payers reached 16.3 million in Q3, an increase of 16%",1472,"Thanks, Shar. We had a strong Q3 with total revenue of $802 million, up 25% year-over-year. Our businesses, excluding Hyperconnect, produced total revenue of $748 million, up 17% year-over-year. Total payers reached 16.3 million in Q3, an increase of 16% from the prior year quarter. 
Growth was strong in all geographies, up 11% year-over-year in the Americas, 13% in Europe and 36% in APAC and other, where the count reflects a full quarter of contribution from Hyperconnect. RPP was up 8% year-over-year to $16.06 in Q3, up 5% in the Americas, 6% in Europe and 17% in APAC and other, again, reflecting a full quarter from Hyperconnect, where RPP exceeded $30. 
Our direct revenue grew 17% in the Americas, 20% in Europe and 59% in APAC and other, again due to full quarter Hyperconnect results. APAC and other now comprises approximately 22% of our direct revenue. 
Tinder was a standout in the quarter, delivering direct revenue of $434 million, up 20% year -- over 20% year-over-year. Tinder has phenomenal payers growth, up 19% year-over-year, adding 1.7 million payers, the most in its history, reaching 10.4 million. 
Some of this growth did come at the expense of RPP, which grew 1% year-over-year in the quarter. Tinder had a number of conversion wins in the quarter, particularly in the lower-priced subscription tier. Tinder Platinum adoption is ahead of schedule with total Platinum subscribers reaching nearly 1 million. Tinder engagement also remains very strong with both swipe activity and daily average messages significantly above pre-pandemic levels. 
All other brands grew direct revenue 32% year-over-year in Q3. In this group, Hinge was the standout, growing direct revenue over 100% driven by RPP growth of north of 70% and payers growth of 20%. BLK, Chispa [indiscernible] in aggregate grew direct revenue over 80% year-over-year in Q3. 
Hyperconnect contributed $53 million of total revenue in the quarter, below our expected range. Hyperconnect is facing pressure in its largest revenue-generating app Azar, especially in certain Middle Eastern markets. It also faced delays in rolling out certain product initiatives and a challenging marketing environment. We're working diligently with the Hyperconnect team to improve performance and deliver sustainable long-term growth. 
Indirect revenue reached $16 million, the highest ever in the quarter, up 40% year-over-year. It appears our strong brands, relatively lower ad loads and contextual targeting have been especially appealing to advertisers in the current environment. 
Operating income grew 10% year-over-year to $221 million, and EBITDA grew 15% year-over-year to $285 million in Q3. EBITDA margins were 36%, but would have been 39% ex Hyperconnect. 
Overall expenses, including SBC expense, grew 32% year-over-year in Q3 with more than half of the total increase resulting from the acquisition of Hyperconnect. Excluding the impact of Hyperconnect, cost of revenue grew 20% year-over-year due to higher [ IP ] fees and represented 27% of total revenue. 
Sales and marketing spend, excluding Hyperconnect, was up $5 million due to slightly higher marketing spend across our portfolio, but was down 2 points year-over-year as a percent of total revenue to 18%. G&A expense, ex Hyperconnect, rose 8% year-over-year primarily due to an increase in legal fees and was 13% of revenue, down 1 point year-over-year. 
Product development costs at Hyperconnect grew 37% year-over-year and were 7% of revenue as we increased headcount at several brands, mainly Tinder and Hinge. Our gross leverage declined to 3.8x trailing EBITDA, and our net leverage was 3.3x at the end of Q3. We believe our target of below 3x net leverage by the end of 2021 is within reach. 
In a complex series of related transactions, we repurchased $414 million aggregate principal amount of our 2022 exchangeable notes for approximately $1.5 billion in cash, using the proceeds from issuing 5.5 million shares of common stock, $500 million of new 3.625% 10-year unsecured debt and the unwind of the related bond hedges and warrants. These transactions, which were executed in the third quarter but sales in the fourth quarter created an embedded derivative on which we recorded a $39 million loss in Q3, but also on which we expect to recognize a $24 million gain in Q4. 
We had operating cash flow of $667 million in the quarter and free cash flow of $614 million. We ended the quarter with $523 million of cash and short-term investments on hand. 
For Q4, we expect total revenue for Match Group of $810 million to $820 million, which would represent 24% to 26% year-over-year growth. Building off the conversion strength achieved in Q3, we expect Tinder's year-over-year direct revenue growth to accelerate towards the mid-20s percent range in Q4. 
Our expectation is that Hyperconnect will deliver revenue in Q4 at similar levels to Q3. Between weaker Q3 performance and lowered expectations for Q4, we have reduced Hyperconnect's revenue contribution by approximately $20 million for full year 2021. We expect full year stand-alone Hyperconnect revenue to be about $210 million. 
Despite softer performance at Hyperconnect, strength at Tinder and Hinge position us to deliver around $3 billion of total revenue in full year 2021, representing 25% year-over-year growth. Notably, we expect Tinder direct revenue growth to be above 20% in full year 2021. 
We expect EBITDA of $285 million to $290 million in Q4, representing 16% to 18% year-over-year growth and margins, ex Hyperconnect, roughly in line with the prior year quarter. For the full year, we expect EBITDA to be above our previously communicated high end of the range of $1.060 billion, up nearly 20% year-over-year. 
Typically, we provide some initial thoughts on the upcoming year on our Q3 call. For the past several years, our initial outlook has been mid- to high teens revenue growth. For 2022, we expect our businesses, ex Hyperconnect, to once again deliver that level of growth driven by another strong year for Tinder and for Hinge as it begins expansion into non-English-speaking markets. 
With the full year of Hyperconnect revenue contribution included, we expect the company to grow total revenue closer to 20% year-over-year in 2022. We will provide a more precise revenue outlook on our February call once we see how the strategic changes in Hyperconnect and the new product initiatives across the portfolio begin to take hold. 
Excluding impacts from IF policy changes that go into effect in 2022, we expect to see about 1 point of margin improvement at our businesses ex Hyperconnect and for Hyperconnect to achieve mid-single-digit EBITDA margins next year. While we anticipate legal expenses to be meaningfully lower next year, we plan to reinvest a portion of that savings into important safety and corporate and social responsibility initiatives. 
Also, given the highly competitive job market, we may reinvest to attract and retain crucial talent. The level of investments we choose to make in these areas will impact the actual amount of margin expansion we achieve. 
The biggest swing factor in our 2022 EBITDA outlook is what happens with App Store fees, which are an increasingly large percent of our revenue, up from 17% in 2020 to an estimated 19% in 2021, totaling over $550 million. There are numerous actions across the globe scrutinizing Apple and Google's requirement that we use their payment system and pay a 30% fee. A reduction in these fees would have numerous positive consequences, including enabling us to pass along benefits to consumers. 
Google has agreed to reduce fees for subscriptions, though not a la carte from 30% to 15% starting January 1, 2022. But they also still have a policy change to require use of their billing system scheduled to go into effect at the end of March 2022. 
There are many unknowns regarding Apple's plans for IFP, including weather and how they intend to comply with the law banning mandatory IP in South Korea and the injunction in the Epic decision, which requires them to eliminate the antisteering provision by December 9, 2021. We're going to watch these developments around the App Stores for at least another few months before we provide our EBITDA outlook for next year. We're optimistic more changes in the ecosystem are likely. 
There is a lot going on across our business, including a meaningful product evolution at Tinder and many of our other brands. We're excited to execute on our product road map and to continue evolving the experience for our users. 
We recognize that people around the world are increasingly turning to digital products to meet and socialize. Our job is to continue to build new and exciting products and experiences that enable people to connect, something we have been a leader at for more than 25 years. We're confident that if we remain focused on delivering outstanding products, we'll continue to deliver strong growth and financial results for our stakeholders for many more years to come. 
With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions."

So generally, Q3 is a good quarter for payer ads. But this one was in the historically high for Tinder. And it's across all regions mostly because a lot of the growth in payers in Q3 came as a result of what we normally referred to as under-the-hood revenue optimization. So a combination of merchandising and paywall optimizations drove conversion and payer growth. 
Some of this increased conversion was in lower-priced tiers, which were dilutive to RPP as Gary mentioned. The one thing I want to emphasize, we generally always focus on revenue growth. Sometimes it comes through payer growth and sometimes through RPP, sometimes both. And so we don't worry too much about the cadence necessarily, but we're definitely always focused on revenue features to increase revenue overall."

In terms of Explore, it is new. It's only been out for a couple of weeks, but we have early evidence of this. And we expect the Explore experiences should increase engagement and reactivation. And this, in turn, ought to provide more revenue optimization opportunities over time, both in terms of conversion as well as RPP growth, meaning both conversion from new payers but also a la carte revenue opportunities on -- through that interface."

I would say generally, Tinder has really been performing very strongly and increasingly strongly as the year has gone on. And the engagement with the product is really even well stronger than it was pre-pandemic. So we really feel good about the dynamics overall at Tinder. 
And what we're expecting is that in Q4, we're going to see both payer and RPP growth. The momentum that we had on the payer growth should continue into Q4. So I'm expecting a similar level of year-over-year payer growth in Q4 as we saw in Q3. 
And I think we'll also be able to achieve some RPP growth as well, which we didn't see as much in Q3, but I think we'll see that in Q4. So when you combine the additional RPP growth with similar level of payer growth, you're going to get overall direct revenue growth in kind of approaching the mid-20s at Tinder as I said earlier. So we feel very good about that. 
The 1 thing that I just would remind people is that seasonally, Q4 tends to be weaker for Tinder around payer growth. Especially when we've seen a very strong Q3, it does make kind of the sequential payer increase more challenging. So that's the thing we are expecting to see from a sequential perspective in Q4. But year-over-year, I'm expecting similar levels of growth on payers as what we saw in Q3. 
And just last reminder would be we don't really manage the business specifically around RPP growth or payers growth. We're looking for direct revenue or overall revenue growth. So we don't get as focused on one metric versus the other. There's obviously trade-offs as we saw in Q3, but we continue to manage to drive a strong level of revenue growth. And we're positioned to do that in Q4."

You know what, I'm going to take the opportunity to talk about the App Store a little bit more broadly and all the puts and takes that we're seeing and what we think is likely to happen. So now that there's been a flurry of activity on the App Store",526,"Yes. You know what, I'm going to take the opportunity to talk about the App Store a little bit more broadly and all the puts and takes that we're seeing and what we think is likely to happen. So now that there's been a flurry of activity on the App Store front, particularly in the last few months. 
South Korea became the first country to outlaw mandatory IF. Additionally, at this point, there are either active investigations, litigation or proposed legislation across the globe, including countries in Europe, U.K., Japan, India, Australia and the U.S. so [indiscernible] would we see at a practical level. 
Google appears to be complying with the South Korea law. That does not seem to be the case with Apple yet. Google has reduced its fees on subscriptions, but not on a la carte from 30% to 15%, which is going to be effective January 1, 2022. 
Now recall, Google had a while ago announced that they will be enforcing mandatory IF, and they delayed that decision to March 31, 2022. And we are as of now unsure where they stand on that policy change. 
Interestingly, for -- it's been a while since the Apple and Google App Store economics are not in sync. And so we have to see how Apple responds to the Google change in rates for subscription. 
All the antisteering provision injunction ordered by the judge on the Epic case, Apple has appealed it, but -- and they have not yet communicated how they intend to comply with it. So all that to say, there was a lot of things sort of have happened, happened, about to happen. It is meaningful for us. 
As we said in the letter, our 2021 IFPs are expected to be north of $550 million, and it will be materially higher in 2022. About 70% of our revenue comes from subscription. And since Google does not yet require mandatory IF, approximately 80% of our IF fees actually goes to Apple. 
So a lot of moving parts, and we have not yet attempted for any impact from changes to IFPs in our outlook. Generally, in Q4, we expect very, very minimal impact. But depending on -- given all the scrutiny that's going around the world and some of the developments in the last few months, I do think this will continue to break. And it will be a beneficial change to consumers and to developers. 
And depending on when and what and how this breaks, the outcome for us is pretty varied. So we're watching some of these milestones that are coming up in the next few months. Hopefully, it will give us some more clarity, and we will be able to communicate a little better in our next call. 
The -- my final thought on this is I've never seen a point in this IF App Store ratio where there's been so much activity around the world. And at some point, Apple has to take a step back and ask themselves whether this is still the right thing to do. And so another reason why I think this will change in some way."

On the litigation, unfortunately, there's really not much that we can say about that right now. It's an active litigation, jury -- it's a jury trial. And the jury selection started at the beginning of this week, and open",622,"Sure. Let me take a crack at that. On the litigation, unfortunately, there's really not much that we can say about that right now. It's an active litigation, jury -- it's a jury trial. And the jury selection started at the beginning of this week, and opening statements are going to be next Monday, this coming Monday. So this is occurring right now here in New York. 
And look, there's always uncertainty in a jury trial, but we feel extremely good about our position and that the plaintiff case is meritless. And we're going to go in and defend ourselves vigorously. So we'll be watching that as it plays out over the coming weeks. 
As far as the APAC trends go, I can say a lot more about that. And what I would say is, really, Japan is the biggest area of focus for us in Asia because that is our #2 market. We derive significant revenue in the Japanese market. 
And really, they only recently lifted their fourth state of emergency. They had the Olympics, and after the Olympics, they had pretty significant spike in COVID from their perspective. And they've taken some pretty significant actions and really some restrictions on dining and other socializing really only lifted last week. 
So that geography continues to be impacted by COVID in a pretty significant way. And we have not yet seen a return to normal levels of socializing in that market. And that is impacting our business in a significant way. 
We have the #1 and #2 apps in Japan in Pairs and Tinder. And so we have meaningful presence there. Notably, the trends are not just affecting us. They're affecting all the dating apps in that market. But because we are so large in that market, it is affecting us significantly. 
So we're optimistic that the drivers that make Japan a great dating market with lots of potential growth continue to be there. And we think this will resolve itself over time as people in Japan start to go back out and get COVID further behind them. 
But it's going to take a little bit of time. We're watching it, and we're optimistic, but I think it needs a little bit of time to play out. 
And while Japan is the market in Asia that's the most significant impact for us, there's other markets in Asia that are also still affected mostly in East Asia, but you've got Singapore, Taiwan that are still affected as well by trends as a result of COVID. So given the geographic footprint of our business, which does have a significant presence in Asia, we are still dealing with impact there. 
And I would say if you look at kind of what's happened around the globe given our overall global exposure, the Americas has recovered well, especially the U.S. And Europe is a little bit behind, but [indiscernible] as well. And then Asia is further behind. 
So if you look at the trends that we've seen in the U.S., I think that over time, that's going to play through in these other markets. It really is a question of timing more than anything else. And so we'll see how that plays out. 
Another market to just point to is India. India was really impacted by COVID at steps, and we saw a significant impact in our business. We have seen a meaningful recovery in India as a result of improvement in the COVID situation there. 
So it is very much market by market depending on what actions the government has taken and what the level of COVID issues is. But we are seeing gradual kind of step-by-step recovery as we look at markets around the world."

Let me take a crack at that one, too, and Shar can certainly jump in. But as I went through and I make sure I mentioned as well, there are really kind of 3 things that have led to the lower-than-expected revenue for Hyperconnect. And it's really focused on the main revenue-generating app Azar, which is a one-to-one video experience. 
The first is COVID. Hyperconnect and Azar have significant presence in Asia and the Middle East. And as I just talked about, COVID continues to be an issue in many of those markets. 
And you've got a lot of people living at home with their family, spending a lot of time at home. And it has changed the interaction of the consumer with the one-to-one video chat app at Azar. And so we're looking to evolve the app in ways that change the experience and make it more conducive in the current environment. I think that's kind of the first piece of it. 
The second piece of it is on the marketing front. Azar, there's a lot of performance marketing as we've talked about in other context. The marketing environment has become both more competitive and also more challenging as a result of changes that Apple has made around IDFA. So that's the second piece of what's going on. 
And then the third piece is they've had some product initiatives that have been delayed, and the take-up has not been as quick as we had hoped. And so there's some product things that are happening there as well. 
So all 3 of those things have impacted the Azar performance, the Hyperconnect performance. I would tell you that we're not happy at all that we missed our expectations for Q3 and that we had to lower them for Q4. 
As Shar mentioned, we sent a team over there finally and spent a couple of weeks with Hyperconnect working through product road maps, marketing road maps and adjusting things to reverse the trends. We're confident that working closely with them, we're going to be able to return the business to growth. But it's going to take some time. 
I think the current trends are going to persist into the first part of 2022. And we're expecting that there'll be some return to growth in the latter part of next year. 
As Shar also said in her remarks, even with that short-term softness, we're still very optimistic about the long-term prospects for Hyperconnect. It can contribute extremely significantly to the long-term growth of the overall Match Group. 
There's many ways that we can do that. We think that we can leverage video, audio, AI capabilities that they've got, things in moderation and safety. So there's a number of things that we're working very hard at leveraging. 
And so we're really trying to do both things at once, both adjust the product and marketing road maps around their existing apps and also leverage their capabilities across our portfolio. And then you've got Single Town and some of the new metaverse elements and the experience that we're seeing in that beta test. And that is something that potentially we can build into either a stand-alone app and/or potentially leverage that user experience into some of our apps in the portfolio. 
So there are a lot of things going on in Hyperconnect. We need to make progress in all 3 of those areas. We're working extremely diligently on it. The team there is working extremely diligently on it. 
And so even though there's some short-term pressure on the business, our long-term thesis and excitement around it remains completely intact, if not even stronger than it was months ago when we first made the acquisition. So we just got work to do, and we're working away at it."

We're going to start the international expansion for Hinge next year. It will likely begin in some markets in Europe and then a more broader global rollout over time.

So next year is going to be exciting for Hinge."

The first thing is we have some really bold and big initiatives planned for Tinder next year, especially around virtual goods and some other areas as well. 
And the outlook that we've given doesn't assume a meaningful step function impact, a home run or really meaningful impact from any of those initiatives. So we're waiting to see as we roll these initiatives out how they evolve, how they perform, and then we can adjust accordingly depending on that. 
But the way we approach our outlook is to not factor in something that's kind of off the charts unexpected that we haven't seen previously or have -- or don't have reasons to expect. So we'll see how it goes, and we obviously always update as we see improving trends in the business. 
And the second thing is around COVID, and I'm sure we're all tired of talking about it and hearing about it and everything else. But the reality is the dating category as a whole remains impacted by the fact that people's socializing behaviors, how much they're going out, how much they're meeting other people, how much risk there was to take in going out with people has not returned to pre-COVID levels. 
I'm sure you and everyone else on the phone knows this from their own experiences. You're going out more than you were, but not as much as you used to. You are traveling more, but not as much as you used to. 
And so we're waiting to see how the behavior has evolved and where we get to versus the pre-COVID levels, and it varies by country. I talked about Japan and the U.S. and certain parts of the U.S., certainly, it is stronger than in other parts. Some people would take more risk and are more comfortable than other people. 
So we want to see where the world kind of normalizes back to if you can use that term, and that will affect our outlook for 2022 and our performance for 2022. Right now, the way we have forecasted really assumes that current behaviors don't change that much, but the levels of socializing that are going on now kind of stay this way through the course of next year. 
Maybe they improved slightly depending on markets. But in general, we're not assuming a massive change versus current behaviors. That could prove to be too conservative. But right now, we don't see a full bounce back occurring at the moment. And so we're not assuming a change in that for 2022. 
So we'll see how this evolves. It's something that we're watching very closely. But that's another place where we could see some improvement versus our current outlook depending on how people's behaviors start to adjust."

I mean, on the second question around labor costs, we, like many companies, are seeing a very competitive job market, especially for tech talent, especially for engineers. It varies by market, but there certainly are markets where we're seeing a significant amount of pressure. And we're having to react to that and want to protect our franchise. We want to retain our key talent and then hiring new talent, either to grow the business or as a replacement for people who may leave has become much more competitive, and costs are going up. 
So we've seen that occur throughout 2021. And right now, we don't see any significant shift in that trend as we head into 2022. So you never know what the future holds, but sitting here today, as we've put together our initial outlook for 2022, we're assuming that those trends are going to persist. And we're going to need to continue to invest in our talent to continue to build the business we want to build. And we're prepared to do that because that is long term critical to our business and its success. So that is something that we are dealing with as many companies are, and we'll continue to be thoughtful around it. 
As far as your first question, the mid- to high-teens growth, I described a little bit about something that could drive to the upside. And look, our expectation is for Tinder to continue to perform very, very well, for Hinge as it both expands into international market, non-English-speaking markets. But also, there's significant opportunity for it in its current markets. 
So we think both businesses should drive significant levels of growth next year. We've talked about the more Established Brands growing a modest amount. That is still our goal for next year as well. 
We've also talked about some pressures we're facing, for example, in the Japanese market and how that's going to evolve. That's important to our Pairs business and the performance of Pairs for next year and a little bit remains to be seen how the Japanese consumer evolves and how they emerge out of COVID. So that's another factor in our business. 
We also have talked a little bit about rolling out live streaming at a number of our businesses and how that takes place in OkCupid and BLK and other business where we plan to roll out live streaming. So there's a number of things that we've made some assumptions around. 
We've tried to make the most realistic assumptions we can. But general trends like COVID or recovering markets like Japan are certainly open for interpretation as are the success of our initiatives, whether they're at Tinder or whether they're some of our new initiatives like live streaming and a couple of our brands. 
So we're going to see how that all plays out, which is why we always give this initial outlook here on our Q3 call sort of tell you what we think we're going to see next year. But we'll give you a much more precise view of things when we get to February after we've seen some of these initiatives start to roll out and once we have 3 more months of performance and COVID recovery and everything else. 
So it's the best we can do now. It's our best set of assumptions sitting here today, but subject to refinement as there are many, many moving parts. And that's before you can get to the EBITDA side with App Stores and everything else that's happening that we've talked about extensively. So we try to give our best outlook, and that's what we've done today. But we will refine it as we get closer to the beginning of next year."

So the virtual currency or the coin is something we think of as an infrastructure thing that's going to be necessary eventually for virtual goods. And that particular component is currently testing, and we should have it sorted out in the next few months. 
Now virtual goods, the team is working on a very Tinder-specific version of virtual goods that will help users with both self-expression as well as the ability to stand out, particularly in a one-to-many surface area that Explore experiences will enable. And so the way we envision virtual goods is it is something that users will be able to collect as well as give and gift to others. 
And so there's a lot of -- in addition to this virtual currency, which is going to be a big component of what enables virtual goods, we do have to get the categorization of the goods and the design of it right. We have to create a value structure and a currency for these goods. And most importantly, to build the right experience that allows users to showcase them on the app in the right way. 
And so all of that is the plan for 2022, and the plan is we build all of this out, test it out, learn it, refine it, work out the teams in a couple of markets. And then if we get this right, I do think this could be a multiyear revenue vector for Tinder, which doesn't exist today. And so a lot of work done, but we're very optimistic that this is going to be a really fun thing on Tinder.

Today, Gary and I are doing this call from our brand-new offices in New York. 
We had another strong quarter with over 25% year-over-year revenue growth, also a record EBITDA quarter for us. Tinder, in particular, showed real strength with not only 20-plus percent revenue growth, but also adding a record number of subscribers and payers this quarter. It is a historical high for Tinder, even higher than the quarter when Tinder Gold rolled out. I'm also excited to have our first woman CEO at Tinder. Renate has seamlessly taken over the helm there, and the team hasn't missed a beat in their journey to transform the Tinder experience. 
Explore, which is a new surface area within the Tinder app, rolled out globally a couple of weeks ago. It is a dynamic interface, which allows users to connect with others through new experiences beyond the swipe that used to be Tinder. These experiences can be tailored by market, it keeps Tinder at the center of culture, give users new reasons to keep coming back, increases engagement and activity. In fact, our successful Swipe Night Series is coming to Tinder on Explore in a brand-new series starting November 7. Not only is it a very compelling Gen Z who's done its story line, this time, it has a bunch of features like fast chat built in that should amplify the conversations that follow on Tinder. 
Hinge had another great quarter across all metrics, doubling revenue again. The one business that is seeing an unexpected softness is the main revenue-driving app at Hyperconnect, Azar. It's had a few months of headwinds in some key markets in Asia. Some of it is COVID, some of it is marketing performance, some product-related delays. However, South Korea has finally opened up to international travel, and our teams were able to meet over the last couple of weeks in person. We're working closely with them now on marketing the product road map in order to reverse the trend. I am extremely optimistic about this team and technology assets as a long-term value creator for our portfolio, especially as we enter what we described in the shareholder letter as the next phase of Match Group's evolution in the dating category. 
In fact, my long-term thesis was further validated in the last couple of weeks when the team there walked me through a new concept they're beta testing on some college campuses in Seoul. It's called Single Town. It is a platform where your digital self, in the form of real-time audio-powered avatar, can serendipitously meet others in virtual spaces, like a bar or they -- you can sit down with someone in a park bench to have one-on-one or group conversation. There is, for instance, a piano bar where people's digital selves are gathering around, but they're actually playing their pianos at home and jamming with others. You can overhear conversations, join conversations. You can tap into the digital avatars to see more of that profile, and you have basically a richer set of signals to help connect with someone. 
It is metaverse experiences coming to life in a way that is transformative to how people meet and get to know each other on a dating or social discovery platform and is much more akin to how people interact in the real world. It is super early, but we are seeing some encouraging early signals in terms of engagement among Gen Z in Seoul. Already, the average daily time spend is about an hour and growing. Some cultures are forming. It is resonating with both genders. And as we talked about in our letter, this next phase of dating apps, in particular, is going to be all about richer, more organic and more akin to real-life ways of discovering, meeting and getting to know people. 
Technology is finally getting down. And this underlying technology platform, Hyperconnect, has built that power Single Town has been built in a way that it can be leveraged by other platforms easily. So my long-term view on what this talented team and technology brings to the portfolio is ever stronger. Finally, based on everything we're hearing and seeing, this coming season should be a strong one as people are ready to shake off the COVID malaise and get out there and date and meet. It's also shaping up to be one of the busiest wedding seasons. 
I feel good about a reenergized and much more social holiday season. These social interactions are incredibly important for our collective mental health and well-being. So I, for one, I'm rooting for a hell of a holiday season and a post-holiday peak season for us as we enter the new year. And with that, I will hand it over to Gary to provide some more color on the quarter."

We had a strong Q3 with total revenue of $802 million, up 25% year-over-year. Our businesses, excluding Hyperconnect, produced total revenue of $748 million, up 17% year-over-year. Total payers reached 16.3 million in Q3, an increase of 16%",1473,"Thanks, Shar. We had a strong Q3 with total revenue of $802 million, up 25% year-over-year. Our businesses, excluding Hyperconnect, produced total revenue of $748 million, up 17% year-over-year. Total payers reached 16.3 million in Q3, an increase of 16% from the prior year quarter. Growth was strong in all geographies, up 11% year-over-year in the Americas, 13% in Europe and 36% in APAC and other, where the count reflects a full quarter of contribution from Hyperconnect. RPP was up 8% year-over-year to $16.06 in Q3, up 5% in the Americas, 6% in Europe and 17% in APAC and other, again, reflecting a full quarter from Hyperconnect, where RPP exceeded $30. 
Our direct revenue grew 17% in the Americas, 20% in Europe and 59% in APAC and other, again due to full quarter Hyperconnect results. APAC and other now comprises approximately 22% of our direct revenue. Tinder was a standout in the quarter, delivering direct revenue of $434 million, up 20% year -- over 20% year-over-year. Tinder has phenomenal payers growth, up 19% year-over-year, adding 1.7 million payers, the most in its history, reaching 10.4 million. 
Some of this growth did come at the expense of RPP, which grew 1% year-over-year in the quarter. Tinder had a number of conversion wins in the quarter, particularly in the lower-priced subscription tier. Tinder Platinum adoption is ahead of schedule with total Platinum subscribers reaching nearly 1 million. Tinder engagement also remains very strong with both swipe activity and daily average messages significantly above pre-pandemic levels. 
All other brands grew direct revenue 32% year-over-year in Q3. In this group, Hinge was the standout, growing direct revenue over 100% driven by RPP growth of north of 70% and payers growth of 20%. BLK, Chispa and Upward in aggregate grew direct revenue over 80% year-over-year in Q3. Hyperconnect contributed $53 million of total revenue in the quarter, below our expected range. Hyperconnect is facing pressure in its largest revenue-generating app Azar, especially in certain Middle Eastern markets. It also faced delays in rolling out certain product initiatives and a challenging marketing environment. We're working diligently with the Hyperconnect team to improve performance and deliver sustainable long-term growth. 
Indirect revenue reached $16 million, the highest ever in the quarter, up 40% year-over-year. It appears our strong brands, relatively lower ad loads and contextual targeting have been especially appealing to advertisers in the current environment. Operating income grew 10% year-over-year to $221 million, and EBITDA grew 15% year-over-year to $285 million in Q3. EBITDA margins were 36%, but would have been 39% ex Hyperconnect. Overall expenses, including SBC expense, grew 32% year-over-year in Q3 with more than half of the total increase resulting from the acquisition of Hyperconnect. Excluding the impact of Hyperconnect, cost of revenue grew 20% year-over-year, due to higher [ IAP ] fees and represented 27% of total revenue. 
Sales and marketing spend, excluding Hyperconnect, was up $5 million due to slightly higher marketing spend across our portfolio, but was down 2 points year-over-year as a percent of total revenue to 18%. G&A expense, ex Hyperconnect, rose 8% year-over-year primarily due to an increase in legal fees and was 13% of revenue, down 1 point year-over-year. Product development costs, ex Hyperconnect, grew 37% year-over-year and were 7% of revenue as we increased headcount at several brands, mainly Tinder and Hinge. Our gross leverage declined to 3.8x trailing EBITDA, and our net leverage was 3.3x at the end of Q3. We believe our target of below 3x net leverage by the end of 2021 is within reach. 
In a complex series of related transactions, we've repurchased $414 million aggregate principal amount of our 2022 exchangeable notes for approximately $1.5 billion in cash, using the proceeds from issuing 5.5 million shares of common stock, $500 million of new 3.625% 10-year unsecured debt and the unwind of the related bond hedges and warrants. These transactions, which were executed in the third quarter but sales in the fourth quarter, created an embedded derivative on which we recorded a $39 million loss in Q3, but also on which we expect to recognize a $24 million gain in Q4. 
We had operating cash flow of $667 million in the quarter and free cash flow of $614 million. We ended the quarter with $523 million of cash and short-term investments on hand. For Q4, we expect total revenue for Match Group of $810 million to $820 million, which would represent 24% to 26% year-over-year growth. Building off the conversion strength achieved in Q3, we expect Tinder's year-over-year direct revenue growth to accelerate towards the mid-20s percent range in Q4. Our expectation is that Hyperconnect will deliver revenue in Q4 at similar levels to Q3. Between weaker Q3 performance and lowered expectations for Q4, we have reduced Hyperconnect's revenue contribution by approximately $20 million for full year 2021. We expect full year stand-alone Hyperconnect revenue to be about $210 million. 
Despite softer performance at Hyperconnect, strength at Tinder and Hinge position us to deliver around $3 billion of total revenue in full year 2021, representing 25% year-over-year growth. Notably, we expect Tinder's direct revenue growth to be above 20% in full year 2021. We expect EBITDA of $285 million to $290 million in Q4, representing 16% to 18% year-over-year growth and margins, ex Hyperconnect, roughly in line with the prior year quarter. For the full year, we expect EBITDA to be above our previously communicated high end of the range of $1.060 billion, up nearly 20% year-over-year. 
Typically, we provide some initial thoughts on the upcoming year on our Q3 call. For the past several years, our initial outlook has been mid- to high teens revenue growth. For 2022, we expect our businesses, ex Hyperconnect, to once again deliver that level of growth driven by another strong year for Tinder and for Hinge as it begins expansion into non-English-speaking markets. 
With the full year of Hyperconnect revenue contribution included, we expect the company to grow total revenue closer to 20% year-over-year in 2022. We will provide a more precise revenue outlook on our February call, once we see how the strategic changes in Hyperconnect and the new product initiatives across the portfolio begin to take hold. 
Excluding impacts from IF policy changes that go into effect in 2022, we expect to see about 1 point of margin improvement at our businesses ex Hyperconnect and for Hyperconnect to achieve mid-single-digit EBITDA margins next year. While we anticipate legal expenses to be meaningfully lower next year, we plan to reinvest a portion of that savings into important safety and corporate and social responsibility initiatives. Also, given the highly competitive job market, we may reinvest to attract and retain crucial talent. The level of investments we choose to make in these areas will impact the actual amount of margin expansion we achieve. 
The biggest swing factor in our 2022 EBITDA outlook is what happens with App Store fees, which are an increasingly large percent of our revenue, up from 17% in 2020 to an estimated 19% in 2021, totaling over $550 million. There are numerous actions across the globe scrutinizing Apple and Google's requirement that we use their payment system and pay a 30% fee. A reduction in these fees would have numerous positive consequences, including enabling us to pass along benefits to consumers. Google has agreed to reduce fees for subscriptions, though not a la carte from 30% to 15% starting January 1, 2022. But they also still have a policy change to require use of their billing system scheduled to go into effect at the end of March 2022. 
There are many unknowns regarding Apple's plans for IAP, including weather and how they intend to comply with the law banning mandatory IAP in South Korea and the injunction in the Epic decision, which requires them to eliminate the anti-steering provision by December 9, 2021. We're going to watch these developments around the App Stores for at least another few months before we provide our EBITDA outlook for next year. We're optimistic more changes in the ecosystem are likely. 
There is a lot going on across our business, including a meaningful product evolution at Tinder and many of our other brands. We're excited to execute on our product road map and to continue evolving the experience for our users. We recognize that people around the world are increasingly turning to digital products to meet and socialize. Our job is to continue to build new and exciting products and experiences that enable people to connect, something we have been a leader at for more than 25 years. We're confident that if we remain focused on delivering outstanding products, we'll continue to deliver strong growth and financial results for our stakeholders for many more years to come.

So a combination of merchandising and paywall optimizations drove conversion and payer growth. Some of this increased conversion was in lower-priced tiers, which were dilutive to RPP as Gary mentioned. The one thing I want to emphasize, we generally always focus on revenue growth. Sometimes, it comes through payer growth and sometimes through RPP, sometimes both. And so we don't worry too much about the cadence necessarily, but we're definitely always focused on revenue features to increase revenue overall."

It's only been out for a couple of weeks, but we have early evidence of this. And we expect the Explore experiences should increase engagement and reactivation. And this, in turn, ought to provide more revenue optimization opportunities over time, both in terms of conversion as well as RPP growth, meaning both conversion from new payers but also a la carte revenue opportunities on -- through that interface."

I would say generally, Tinder has really been performing very strongly and increasingly strongly as the year has gone on.

I would say generally, Tinder has really been performing very strongly and increasingly strongly as the year has gone on. And the engagement with the product is really even well stronger than it was pre-pandemic. So we really feel good about the dynamics overall at Tinder. And what we're expecting is that in Q4, we're going to see both payer and RPP growth. The momentum that we had on the payer growth should continue into Q4. So I'm expecting a similar level of year-over-year payer growth in Q4 as we saw in Q3. 
And I think we'll also be able to achieve some RPP growth as well, which we didn't see as much in Q3, but I think we'll see that in Q4. So when you combine the additional RPP growth with similar level of payer growth, you're going to get overall direct revenue growth in kind of approaching the mid-20s at Tinder as I said earlier. So we feel very good about that. The one thing that I just would remind people is that seasonally, Q4 tends to be weaker for Tinder around payer growth. Especially when we've seen a very strong Q3, it does make kind of the sequential payer increase more challenging. So that's the thing we are expecting to see from a sequential perspective in Q4. But year-over-year, I'm expecting similar levels of growth on payers as what we saw in Q3. 
And just last reminder would be we don't really manage the business specifically around RPP growth or payers growth. We're looking for direct revenue or overall revenue growth. So we don't get as focused on one metric versus the other. There's obviously trade-offs as we saw in Q3, but we continue to manage to drive a strong level of revenue growth. And we're positioned to do that in Q4."

You know what, I'm going to take the opportunity to talk about the App Store a little bit more broadly and all the puts and takes that we're seeing and what we think is likely to happen. So now that there's been a flurry of activity on the App Store",528,"Yes. You know what, I'm going to take the opportunity to talk about the App Store a little bit more broadly and all the puts and takes that we're seeing and what we think is likely to happen. So now that there's been a flurry of activity on the App Store front, particularly in the last few months. South Korea became the first country to outlaw mandatory IAP. Additionally, at this point, there are either active investigations, litigation or proposed legislation across the globe, including countries in Europe, U.K., Japan, India, Australia and the U.S. so  here's what we see at a practical level. 
Google appears to be complying with the South Korea law. That does not seem to be the case with Apple yet. Google has reduced its fees on subscriptions, but not on a la carte from 30% to 15%, which is going to be effective January 1, 2022. 
Now recall, Google had a while ago announced that they will be enforcing mandatory IAP, and they delayed that decision to March 31, 2022. And we are as of now unsure where they stand on that policy change. Interestingly, for -- it's been a while since the Apple and Google App Store economics are not in sync. And so we have to see how Apple responds to the Google change in rates for subscription. All the anti-steering provision injunction ordered by the judge on the Epic case, Apple has appealed it, but -- and they have not yet communicated how they intend to comply with it. So all that to say, there was a lot of things sort of have happened, happened, about to happen. It is meaningful for us. 
As we said in the letter, our 2021 IAP fees are expected to be north of $550 million, and it will be materially higher in 2022. About 70% of our revenue comes from subscription. And since Google does not yet require mandatory IAP, approximately 80% of our IF fees actually goes to Apple. So a lot of moving parts, and we have not yet accounted for any impact from changes to IAP fees in our outlook. Generally in Q4, we expect very, very minimal impact. But depending on -- given all the scrutiny that's going around the world and some of the developments in the last few months, I do think this will continue to break. And it will be a beneficial change to consumers and to developers. 
And depending on when and what and how this breaks, the outcome for us is pretty varied. So we're watching some of these milestones that are coming up in the next few months. Hopefully, it will give us some more clarity, and we will be able to communicate a little better in our next call. The -- my final thought on this is I've never seen a point in this IAP App Store issue where there's been so much activity around the world. And at some point, Apple has to take a step back and ask themselves whether this is still the right thing to do. And so another reason why I think this will change in some way."

On the litigation, unfortunately, there's really not much that we can say about that right now. It's an active litigation, jury -- it's a jury trial. And the jury selection started at the beginning of this week, and open",624,"Sure. Let me take a crack at that. On the litigation, unfortunately, there's really not much that we can say about that right now. It's an active litigation, jury -- it's a jury trial. And the jury selection started at the beginning of this week, and opening statements are going to be next Monday, this coming Monday. So this is occurring right now here in New York. And look, there's always uncertainty in a jury trial, but we feel extremely good about our position and that the plaintiff case is meritless. And we're going to go in and defend ourselves vigorously. So we'll be watching that as it plays out over the coming weeks. 
As far as the APAC trends go, I can say a lot more about that. And what I would say is, really, Japan is the biggest area of focus for us in Asia because that is our #2 market. We derive significant revenue in the Japanese market. And really, they only recently lifted their fourth state of emergency. They had the Olympics, and after the Olympics, they had pretty significant spike in COVID from their perspective. And they've taken some pretty significant actions and really some restrictions on dining and other socializing really only lifted last week. 
So that geography continues to be impacted by COVID in a pretty significant way. And we have not yet seen a return to normal levels of socializing in that market. And that is impacting our business in a significant way. We have the #1 and #2 apps in Japan in Pairs and Tinder. And so we have meaningful presence there. Notably, the trends are not just affecting us. They're affecting all the dating apps in that market. But because we are so large in that market, it is affecting us significantly. 
So we're optimistic that the drivers that make Japan a great dating market with lots of potential growth continue to be there. And we think this will resolve itself over time as people in Japan start to go back out and get COVID further behind them. But it's going to take a little bit of time. We're watching it, and we're optimistic, but I think it needs a little bit of time to play out. And while Japan is the market in Asia that's the most significant impact for us, there's other markets in Asia that are also still affected mostly in East Asia, but you've got Singapore, Taiwan that are still affected as well by trends as a result of COVID. So given the geographic footprint of our business, which does have a significant presence in Asia, we are still dealing with impact there. 
And I would say if you look at kind of what's happened around the globe given our overall global exposure, the Americas has recovered well, especially the U.S. And Europe is a little bit behind, but [indiscernible] for us as well. And then Asia is further behind. So if you look at the trends that we've seen in the U.S., I think that over time, that's going to play through in these other markets. It really is a question of timing more than anything else. And so we'll see how that plays out. 
Another market to just point to is India. India was really impacted by COVID at [indiscernible], and we saw a significant impact in our business. We have seen a meaningful recovery in India as a result of improvement in the COVID situation there. So it is very much market by market depending on what actions the government has taken and what the level of COVID issues is. But we are seeing gradual kind of step-by-step recovery as we look at markets around the world."

Let me take a crack at that one, too, and Shar can certainly jump in. But as I went through and Shar mentioned as well, there are really kind of 3 things that have led to the lower-than-expected revenue for Hyperconnect. And it's really focused on the main revenue-generating app, Azar, which is a one-to-one video experience. The first is COVID. Hyperconnect and Azar have significant presence in Asia and the Middle East. And as I just talked about, COVID continues to be an issue in many of those markets. And you've got a lot of people living at home with their family, spending a lot of time at home. And it has changed the interaction of the consumer with the one-to-one video chat app at Azar. And so we're looking to evolve the app in ways that change the experience and make it more conducive in the current environment. I think that's kind of the first piece of it. 
The second piece of it is on the marketing front. Azar, there's a lot of performance marketing as we've talked about in other context. The marketing environment has become both more competitive and also more challenging as a result of changes that Apple has made around IDFA. So that's the second piece of what's going on. And then the third piece is they've had some product initiatives that have been delayed, and the take-up has not been as quick as we had hoped. And so there's some product things that are happening there as well. 
So all 3 of those things have impacted the Azar performance, the Hyperconnect performance. I would tell you that we're not happy at all that we missed our expectations for Q3 and that we had to lower them for Q4. As Shar mentioned, we sent a team over there finally and spent a couple of weeks with Hyperconnect working through product road maps, marketing road maps and adjusting things to reverse the trends. We're confident that working closely with them, we're going to be able to return the business to growth. But it's going to take some time. 
I think the current trends are going to persist into the first part of 2022. And we're expecting that there'll be some return to growth in the latter part of next year. As Shar also said in her remarks, even with that short-term softness, we're still very optimistic about the long-term prospects for Hyperconnect. It can contribute extremely significantly to the long-term growth of the overall Match Group. There's many ways that we can do that. We think that we can leverage video, audio, AI capabilities that they've got, things in moderation and safety. So there's a number of things that we're working very hard at leveraging. 
And so we're really trying to do both things at once, both adjust the product and marketing road maps around their existing apps and also leverage their capabilities across our portfolio. And then you've got Single Town and some of the new metaverse elements and the experience that we're seeing in that beta test. And that is something that potentially we can build into either a stand-alone app and/or potentially leverage that user experience into some of our apps in the portfolio. So there are a lot of things going on in Hyperconnect. We need to make progress in all 3 of those areas. We're working extremely diligently on it. The team there is working extremely diligently on it. 
And so even though there's some short-term pressure on the business, our long-term thesis and excitement around it remains completely intact, if not even stronger than it was months ago when we first made the acquisition. So we just got work to do, and we're working away at it."

The first thing is we have some really bold and big initiatives planned for Tinder next year, especially around virtual goods and some other areas as well. 
And the outlook that we've given doesn't assume a meaningful step function impact, a home run or really meaningful impact from any of those initiatives. So we're waiting to see as we roll these initiatives out how they evolve, how they perform, and then we can adjust accordingly depending on that. 
But the way we approach our outlook is to not factor in something that's kind of off the charts unexpected that we haven't seen previously or have -- or don't have reasons to expect. So we'll see how it goes, and we obviously always update as we see improving trends in the business. And the second thing is around COVID, and I'm sure we're all tired of talking about it and hearing about it and everything else. But the reality is the dating category as a whole remains impacted by the fact that people's socializing behaviors, how much they're going out, how much they're meeting other people, how much risk there was to take in going out with people has not returned to pre-COVID levels. 
I'm sure you and everyone else on the phone knows this from their own experiences. You're going out more than you were, but not as much as you used to. You are traveling more, but not as much as you used to.  And so we're waiting to see how the behavior has evolved and where we get to versus the pre-COVID levels, and it varies by country. I talked about Japan and the U.S. and certain parts of the U.S., certainly, it is stronger than in other parts. Some people would take more risk and are more comfortable than other people. So we want to see where the world kind of normalizes back to if you can use that term, and that will affect our outlook for 2022 and our performance for 2022. Right now, the way we have forecasted really assumes that current behaviors don't change that much, but the levels of socializing that are going on now kind of stay this way through the course of next year. 
Maybe they improved slightly depending on markets. But in general, we're not assuming a massive change versus current behaviors. That could prove to be too conservative. But right now, we don't see a full bounce back occurring at the moment. And so we're not assuming a change in that for 2022. So we'll see how this evolves. It's something that we're watching very closely. But that's another place where we could see some improvement versus our current outlook depending on how people's behaviors start to adjust."

355279,1685063063,2423387,"Match Group, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2021",2021-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Match Group, Inc.","Executives","Yes. I mean, on the second question around labor costs. We, like many companies, are seeing a very competitive job market, especially for tech talent, especially for engineers. It varies by market, but there certainly are markets where we're seeing a sign",626,"Yes. I mean, on the second question around labor costs. We, like many companies, are seeing a very competitive job market, especially for tech talent, especially for engineers. It varies by market, but there certainly are markets where we're seeing a significant amount of pressure. And we're having to react to that and want to protect our franchise. We want to retain our key talent and then hiring new talent, either to grow the business or as a replacement for people who may leave has become much more competitive, and costs are going up. 
So we've seen that occur throughout 2021. And right now, we don't see any significant shift in that trend as we head into 2022. So you never know what the future holds, but sitting here today, as we've put together our initial outlook for 2022, we're assuming that those trends are going to persist. And we're going to need to continue to invest in our talent to continue to build the business we want to build. And we're prepared to do that because that is long term critical to our business and its success. So that is something that we are dealing with as many companies are, and we'll continue to be thoughtful around it. 
As far as your first question, the mid- to high-teens growth. I described a little bit about something that could drive to the upside. And look, our expectation is for Tinder to continue to perform very, very well. For Hinge, as it both expands into international market, non-English-speaking markets. But also, there's significant opportunity for it in its current markets. So we think both businesses should drive significant levels of growth next year. We've talked about the more Established Brands growing a modest amount. That is still our goal for next year as well. 
We've also talked about some pressures we're facing, for example, in the Japanese market and how that's going to evolve. That's important to our Pairs business and the performance of Pairs for next year, and a little bit remains to be seen how the Japanese consumer evolves and how they emerge out of COVID. So that's another factor in our business. We also have talked a little bit about rolling out live streaming at a number of our businesses and how that takes place in OkCupid and BLK and other business where we plan to roll out live streaming. So there's a number of things that we've made some assumptions around. 
We've tried to make the most realistic assumptions we can. But general trends like COVID or recovering markets like Japan are certainly open for interpretation as are the success of our initiatives, whether they're at Tinder or whether they're some of our new initiatives like live streaming and a couple of our brands. So we're going to see how that all plays out, which is why we always give this initial outlook here on our Q3 call, sort of tell you what we think we're going to see next year. But we'll give you a much more precise view of things when we get to February after we've seen some of these initiatives start to roll out and once we have 3 more months of performance and COVID recovery and everything else. 
So it's the best we can do now. It's our best set of assumptions sitting here today, but subject to refinement as there are many, many moving parts. And that's before you can get to the EBITDA side with App Stores and everything else that's happening that we've talked about extensively. So we try to give our best outlook, and that's what we've done today. But we will refine it as we get closer to the beginning of next year."

So the virtual currency or the coin is something we think of as an infrastructure thing that's going to be necessary eventually for virtual goods. And that particular component is currently testing, and we should have it sorted out in the next few months. 
Now virtual goods, the team is working on a very Tinder-specific version of virtual goods that will help users with both self-expression as well as the ability to stand out, particularly in a one-to-many surface area that Explore experiences will enable. And so the way we envision virtual goods is it is something that users will be able to collect as well as give and gift to others. And so there's a lot of -- in addition to this virtual currency, which is going to be a big component of what enables virtual goods, we do have to get the categorization of the goods and the design of it right. We have to create a value structure and a currency for these goods. And most importantly, to build the right experience that allows users to showcase them on the app in the right way. 
And so all of that is the plan for 2022, and the plan is we build all of this out, test it out, learn it, refine it, work out the teams in a couple of markets. And then if we get this right, I do think this could be a multiyear revenue vector for Tinder, which doesn't exist today. And so a lot of work done, but we're very optimistic that this is going to be a really fun thing on Tinder. 
I think that was the last call for us. Thank you all very much. Have a wonderful holiday season, and thanks again for joining us today."

Today, Gary and I are doing this call from our brand-new offices in New York. 
We had another strong quarter with over 25% year-over-year revenue growth, also a record EBITDA quarter for us. Tinder, in particular, showed real strength with not only 20-plus percent revenue growth but also adding a record number of subscribers and payers this quarter. It is a historical high for Tinder, even higher than the quarter when Tinder Gold rolled out. I'm also excited to have our first woman CEO at Tinder. Renate has seamlessly taken over the helm there, and the team hasn't missed a beat in their journey to transform the Tinder experience. 
Explore, which is a new surface area within the Tinder app, rolled out globally a couple of weeks ago. It is a dynamic interface, which allows users to connect with others through new experiences beyond the swipe that used to be Tinder. These experiences can be tailored by market. It keeps Tinder at the center of culture, gives users new reasons to keep coming back, increases engagement and activity. In fact, our successful Swipe Night Series is coming to Tinder on Explore in a brand-new series starting November 7. Not only is it a very compelling Gen Z who done it storyline, this time, it has a bunch of features like fast chat built in that should amplify the conversations that follow on Tinder. 
Hinge had another great quarter across all metrics, doubling revenue again. The one business that is seeing an unexpected softness is the main revenue-driving app at Hyperconnect, Azar. It's had a few months of headwinds in some key markets in Asia. Some of it is COVID, some of it is marketing performance, some product-related delays. However, South Korea has finally opened up to international travel, and our teams were able to meet over the last couple of weeks in person. We're working closely with them now on marketing the product road map in order to reverse the trend. I am extremely optimistic about this team and technology asset as a long-term value creator for our portfolio, especially as we enter what we described in the shareholder letter as the next phase of Match Group's evolution in the dating category. 
In fact, my long-term thesis was further validated in the last couple of weeks when the team there walked me through a new concept they're beta testing on some college campuses in Seoul. It's called Single Town. It is a platform where your digital self in the form of real-time, audio-powered avatars can serendipitously meet others in virtual spaces, like a bar or they -- you can sit down with someone in a park bench to have one-on-one or group conversation. There is, for instance, a piano bar where people's digital selves are gathering around, but they're actually playing their pianos at home and jamming with others. You can overhear conversations, join conversations. You can tap into the digital avatars to see more of their profiles, and you have basically a richer set of signals to help connect with someone. 
It is metaverse experiences coming to life in a way that is transformative to how people meet and get to know each other on a dating or social discovery platform and is much more akin to how people interact in the real world. It is super early, but we are seeing some encouraging early signals in terms of engagement among Gen Z in Seoul. Already, the average daily time spend is about an hour and growing. Subcultures are forming. It is resonating with both genders. And as we talked about in our letter, this next phase of dating apps, in particular, is going to be all about richer, more organic and more akin to real-life ways of discovering, meeting and getting to know people. 
Technology is finally getting down. And this underlying technology platform, Hyperconnect, has built that power Single Town has been built in a way that it can be leveraged by other platforms easily. So my long-term view on what this talented team and technology brings to the portfolio is ever stronger. Finally, based on everything we're hearing and seeing, this cuffing season should be a strong one as people are ready to shake off the COVID malaise and get out there and date and meet. It's also shaping up to be one of the busiest wedding seasons. 
I feel good about a reenergized and much more social holiday season. These social interactions are incredibly important for our collective mental health and well-being. So I, for one, I'm rooting for a hell of a holiday season and a post-holiday peak season for us as we enter the new year. 
And with that, I will hand it over to Gary to provide some more color on the quarter."

We had a strong Q3 with total revenue of $802 million, up 25% year-over-year. Our businesses, excluding Hyperconnect, produced total revenue of $748 million, up 17% year-over-year. Total payers reached 16.3 million in Q3, an increase of 16%",1475,"Thanks, Shar. We had a strong Q3 with total revenue of $802 million, up 25% year-over-year. Our businesses, excluding Hyperconnect, produced total revenue of $748 million, up 17% year-over-year. Total payers reached 16.3 million in Q3, an increase of 16% from the prior year quarter. Growth was strong in all geographies, up 11% year-over-year in the Americas, 13% in Europe and 36% in APAC and Other, where the count reflects a full quarter of contribution from Hyperconnect. RPP was up 8% year-over-year to $16.06 in Q3, up 5% in the Americas, 6% in Europe and 17% in APAC and Other, again, reflecting a full quarter from Hyperconnect, where RPP exceeded $30. 
Our direct revenue grew 17% in the Americas, 20% in Europe and 59% in APAC and Other, again due to full quarter of Hyperconnect results. APAC and Other now comprises approximately 22% of our direct revenue. 
Tinder was a standout in the quarter, delivering direct revenue of $434 million, up 20% year -- up over 20% year-over-year. Tinder has phenomenal payers growth, up 19% year-over-year, adding 1.7 million payers, the most in its history, reaching 10.4 million. 
Some of this growth did come at the expense of RPP, which grew 1% year-over-year in the quarter. Tinder had a number of conversion wins in the quarter, particularly in the lower-priced subscription tier. Tinder Platinum adoption is ahead of schedule with total Platinum subscribers reaching nearly 1 million. Tinder engagement also remains very strong with both swipe activity and daily average messages significantly above pre-pandemic levels. 
All other brands grew direct revenue 32% year-over-year in Q3. In this group, Hinge was the standout, growing direct revenue over 100% driven by RPP growth of north of 70% and payers growth of 20%. BLK, Chispa and Upward in aggregate grew direct revenue over 80% year-over-year in Q3. Hyperconnect contributed $53 million of total revenue in the quarter, below our expected range. Hyperconnect is facing pressure in its largest revenue-generating app, Azar, especially in certain Middle Eastern markets. It also faced delays in rolling out certain product initiatives and a challenging marketing environment. We're working diligently with the Hyperconnect team to improve performance and deliver sustainable long-term growth. 
Indirect revenue reached $16 million, the highest ever in the quarter, up 40% year-over-year. It appears our strong brands, relatively lower ad loads and contextual targeting have been especially appealing to advertisers in the current environment. Operating income grew 10% year-over-year to $221 million, and EBITDA grew 15% year-over-year to $285 million in Q3. EBITDA margins were 36% but would have been 39% ex Hyperconnect. Overall expenses, including SBC expense, grew 32% year-over-year in Q3 with more than half of the total increase resulting from the acquisition of Hyperconnect. Excluding the impact of Hyperconnect, cost of revenue grew 20% year-over-year due to higher IAP fees and represented 27% of total revenue. 
Sales and marketing spend, excluding Hyperconnect, was up $5 million due to slightly higher marketing spend across our portfolio but was down 2 points year-over-year as a percent of total revenue to 18%. G&A expense, ex Hyperconnect, rose 8% year-over-year primarily due to an increase in legal fees and was 13% of revenue, down 1 point year-over-year. Product development costs, ex Hyperconnect, grew 37% year-over-year and were 7% of revenue as we increased head count at several brands, mainly Tinder and Hinge. Our gross leverage declined to 3.8x trailing EBITDA, and our net leverage was 3.3x at the end of Q3. We believe our target of below 3x net leverage by the end of 2021 is within reach. 
In a complex series of related transactions, we've repurchased $414 million aggregate principal amount of our 2022 exchangeable notes for approximately $1.5 billion in cash, using the proceeds from issuing 5.5 million shares of common stock, $500 million of new 3.625% 10-year unsecured debt and the unwind of the related bond hedges and warrants. These transactions, which were executed in the third quarter but sales in the fourth quarter, created an embedded derivative on which we recorded a $39 million loss in Q3, but also on which we expect to recognize a $24 million gain in Q4. 
We had operating cash flow of $667 million in the quarter and free cash flow of $614 million. We ended the quarter with $523 million of cash and short-term investments on hand. For Q4, we expect total revenue for Match Group of $810 million to $820 million, which would represent 24% to 26% year-over-year growth. Building off the conversion strength achieved in Q3, we expect Tinder's year-over-year direct revenue growth to accelerate towards the mid-20s percent range in Q4. Our expectation is that Hyperconnect will deliver revenue in Q4 at similar levels to Q3. Between weaker Q3 performance and lowered expectations for Q4, we have reduced Hyperconnect's revenue contribution by approximately $20 million for full year 2021. We expect full year stand-alone Hyperconnect revenue to be about $210 million. 
Despite softer performance at Hyperconnect, strength at Tinder and Hinge position us to deliver around $3 billion of total revenue in full year 2021, representing 25% year-over-year growth. Notably, we expect Tinder's direct revenue growth to be above 20% in full year 2021. We expect EBITDA of $285 million to $290 million in Q4, representing 16% to 18% year-over-year growth and margins, ex Hyperconnect, roughly in line with the prior year quarter. For the full year, we expect EBITDA to be above our previously communicated high end of the range of $1.060 billion, up nearly 20% year-over-year. 
Typically, we provide some initial thoughts on the upcoming year on our Q3 call. For the past several years, our initial outlook has been mid- to high teens revenue growth. For 2022, we expect our businesses, ex Hyperconnect, to once again deliver that level of growth driven by another strong year for Tinder and for Hinge as it begins expansion into non-English-speaking markets. 
With the full year of Hyperconnect revenue contribution included, we expect the company to grow total revenue closer to 20% year-over-year in 2022. We will provide a more precise revenue outlook on our February call once we see how the strategic changes in Hyperconnect and the new product initiatives across the portfolio begin to take hold. 
Excluding impacts from IAP policy changes that go into effect in 2022, we expect to see about 1 point of margin improvement at our businesses ex Hyperconnect and for Hyperconnect to achieve mid-single-digit EBITDA margins next year. While we anticipate legal expenses to be meaningfully lower next year, we plan to reinvest a portion of that savings into important safety and corporate and social responsibility initiatives. Also, given the highly competitive job market, we may reinvest to attract and retain crucial talent. The level of investments we choose to make in these areas will impact the actual amount of margin expansion we achieve. 
The biggest swing factor in our 2022 EBITDA outlook is what happens with App Store fees, which are an increasingly large percent of our revenue, up from 17% in 2020 to an estimated 19% in 2021, totaling over $550 million. There are numerous actions across the globe scrutinizing Apple and Google's requirement that we use their payment system and pay a 30% fee. A reduction in these fees would have numerous positive consequences, including enabling us to pass along benefits to consumers. Google has agreed to reduce fees for subscriptions, though not a la carte, and from 30% to 15% starting January 1, 2022. But they also still have a policy change to require use of their billing system scheduled to go into effect at the end of March 2022. 
There are many unknowns regarding Apple's plans for IAP, including weather and how they intend to comply with the law banning mandatory IAP in South Korea and the injunction in the Epic decision, which requires them to eliminate the anti-steering provision by December 9, 2021. We're going to watch these developments around the App Stores for at least another few months before we provide our EBITDA outlook for next year. We're optimistic more changes in the ecosystem are likely. 
There is a lot going on across our business, including a meaningful product evolution at Tinder and many of our other brands. We're excited to execute on our product road map and to continue evolving the experience for our users. We recognize that people around the world are increasingly turning to digital products to meet and socialize. Our job is to continue to build new and exciting products and experiences that enable people to connect, something we have been a leader at for more than 25 years. We're confident that if we remain focused on delivering outstanding products, we'll continue to deliver strong growth and financial results for our stakeholders for many more years to come.

And it's across all regions mostly because a lot of the growth in payers in Q3 came as a result of what we normally referred to as under-the-hood revenue optimization. So a combination of merchandising and paywall optimizations drove conversion and payer growth. Some of this increased conversion was in lower-priced tiers, which were dilutive to RPP as Gary mentioned. The one thing I want to emphasize, we generally always focus on revenue growth. Sometimes, it comes through payer growth and sometimes through RPP, sometimes both. And so we don't worry too much about the cadence necessarily, but we're definitely always focused on revenue features to increase revenue overall."

I would say generally, Tinder has really been performing very strongly and increasingly strongly as the year has gone on. And the engagement with the product is really even well stronger than it was pre-pandemic. So we really feel good about the dynamics overall at Tinder. And what we're expecting is that in Q4, we're going to see both payer and RPP growth. The momentum that we had on the payer growth should continue into Q4. So I'm expecting a similar level of year-over-year payer growth in Q4 as we saw in Q3. 
And I think we'll also be able to achieve some RPP growth as well, which we didn't see as much in Q3, but I think we'll see that in Q4. So when you combine the additional RPP growth with similar level of payer growth, you're going to get overall direct revenue growth in kind of approaching the mid-20s at Tinder as I said earlier. So we feel very good about that. The one thing that I just would remind people is that seasonally, Q4 tends to be weaker for Tinder around payer growth. Especially when we've seen a very strong Q3, it does make kind of the sequential payer increase more challenging. So that's the thing we are expecting to see from a sequential perspective in Q4. But year-over-year, I'm expecting similar levels of growth on payers as what we saw in Q3. 
And just last reminder would be we don't really manage the business specifically around RPP growth or payers growth. We're looking for direct revenue or overall revenue growth. So we don't get as focused on one metric versus the other. There's obviously trade-offs as we saw in Q3, but we continue to manage to drive a strong level of revenue growth. And we're positioned to do that in Q4."

I'm going to take the opportunity to talk about the App Store a little bit more broadly and all the puts and takes that we're seeing and what we think is likely to happen. So there's been a flurry of activity on the App Store front, pa",526,"Yes. You know what? I'm going to take the opportunity to talk about the App Store a little bit more broadly and all the puts and takes that we're seeing and what we think is likely to happen. So there's been a flurry of activity on the App Store front, particularly in the last few months. South Korea became the first country to outlaw mandatory IAP. Additionally, at this point, there are either active investigations, litigation or proposed legislation across the globe, including countries in Europe, U.K., Japan, India, Australia and the U.S. 
So here's what we see at a practical level. Google appears to be complying with the South Korea law. That does not seem to be the case with Apple yet. Google has reduced its fees on subscriptions but not on a la carte from 30% to 15%, which is going to be effective January 1, 2022. Now recall, Google had a while ago announced that they will be enforcing mandatory IAP, and they delayed that decision to March 31, 2022. And we are as of now unsure where they stand on that policy change. Interestingly, for -- it's been a while since the Apple and Google App Store economics are not in sync. And so we have to see how Apple responds to the Google change in rates for subscription. All the anti-steering provision injunction ordered by the judge on the Epic case, Apple has appealed it, but -- and they have not yet communicated how they intend to comply with it. So all that to say, there was a lot of things sort of have happened, happened, about to happen. It is meaningful for us. 
As we said in the letter, our 2021 IAP fees are expected to be north of $550 million, and it will be materially higher in 2022. About 70% of our revenue comes from subscription. And since Google does not yet require mandatory IAP, approximately 80% of our IAP fees actually goes to Apple. So a lot of moving parts, and we have not yet accounted for any impact from changes to IAP fees in our outlook. Generally, in Q4, we expect very, very minimal impact. But depending on -- given all the scrutiny that's going around the world and some of the developments in the last few months, I do think this will continue to break. And it will be a beneficial change to consumers and to developers. 
And depending on when and what and how this breaks, the outcome for us is pretty varied. So we're watching some of these milestones that are coming up in the next few months. Hopefully, it will give us some more clarity, and we will be able to communicate a little better in our next call. The -- my final thought on this is I've never seen a point in this IAP App Store issue where there's been so much activity around the world. And at some point, Apple has to take a step back and ask themselves whether this is still the right thing to do. And so another reason why I think this will change in some way."

On the litigation, unfortunately, there's really not much that we can say about that right now. It's an active litigation. Jury -- it's a jury trial. And the jury selection started at the beginning of this week, and open",624,"Sure. Let me take a crack at that. On the litigation, unfortunately, there's really not much that we can say about that right now. It's an active litigation. Jury -- it's a jury trial. And the jury selection started at the beginning of this week, and opening statements are going to be next Monday, this coming Monday. So this is occurring right now here in New York. And look, there's always uncertainty in a jury trial, but we feel extremely good about our position and that the plaintiff's case is meritless. And we're going to go in and defend ourselves vigorously. So we'll be watching that as it plays out over the coming weeks. 
As far as the APAC trends go, I can say a lot more about that. And what I would say is, really, Japan is the biggest area of focus for us in Asia because that is our #2 market. We derive significant revenue in the Japanese market. And really, they only recently lifted their fourth state of emergency. They had the Olympics, and after the Olympics, they had pretty significant spike in COVID from their perspective. And they've taken some pretty significant actions. And really, some restrictions on dining and other socializing really only lifted last week. 
So that geography continues to be impacted by COVID in a pretty significant way. And we have not yet seen a return to normal levels of socializing in that market. And that is impacting our business in a significant way. We have the #1 and #2 apps in Japan in Pairs and Tinder. And so we have meaningful presence there. Notably, the trends are not just affecting us. They're affecting all of the dating apps in that market. But because we are so large in that market, it is affecting us significantly. 
So we're optimistic that the drivers that make Japan a great dating market with lots of potential growth continue to be there. And we think this will resolve itself over time as people in Japan start to go back out and get COVID further behind them. But it's going to take a little bit of time. We're watching it, and we're optimistic, but I think it needs a little bit of time to play out. And while Japan is the market in Asia that's the most significant impact there for us, there's other markets in Asia that are also still affected mostly in East Asia, but you've got Singapore, Taiwan, that are still affected as well by trends as a result of COVID. So given the geographic footprint of our business, which does have a significant presence in Asia, we are still dealing with impact there. 
And I would say if you look at kind of what's happened around the globe given our overall global exposure, the Americas has recovered well, especially the U.S. And Europe is a little bit behind, but making progress as well. And then Asia is further behind. So if you look at the trends that we've seen in the U.S., I think that over time, that's going to play through these other markets. It really is a question of timing more than anything else. And so we'll see how that plays out. 
Another market to just point to is India. India was really impacted by COVID at depths, and we saw a significant impact in our business. We have seen a meaningful recovery in India as a result of improvement in the COVID situation there. So it is very much market by market depending on what actions the government has taken and what the level of COVID issues is. But we are seeing gradual kind of step-by-step recovery as we look at markets around the world."

But as I went through and Shar mentioned as well, there are really kind of 3 things that have led to the lower-than-expected revenue for Hyperconnect. And it's really focused",630,"All right. Let me take a crack at that one, too, and Shar can certainly jump in. But as I went through and Shar mentioned as well, there are really kind of 3 things that have led to the lower-than-expected revenue for Hyperconnect. And it's really focused on the main revenue-generating app, Azar, which is a one-to-one video experience. The first is COVID. Hyperconnect and Azar have significant presence in Asia and the Middle East. And as I just talked about, COVID continues to be an issue in many of those markets. And you've got a lot of people living at home with their family, spending a lot of time at home. And it has changed the interaction of the consumer with the one-to-one video chat app at Azar. And so we're looking to evolve the app in ways that change the experience and make it more conducive in the current environment. I think that's kind of the first piece of it. 
The second piece of it is on the marketing front. Azar, there's a lot of performance marketing as we've talked about in other context. The marketing environment has become both more competitive and also more challenging as a result of changes that Apple has made around IDFA. So that's the second piece of what's going on. And then the third piece is they've had some product initiatives that have been delayed, and the take-up has not been as quick as we had hoped. And so there's some product things that are happening there as well. 
So all 3 of those things have impacted the Azar performance, the Hyperconnect performance. I would tell you that we're not happy at all that we missed our expectations for Q3 and that we had to lower them for Q4. As Shar mentioned, we sent a team over there finally and spent a couple of weeks with Hyperconnect working through product road maps, marketing road maps and adjusting things to reverse the trends. We're confident that working closely with them, we're going to be able to return the business to growth. But it's going to take some time. 
I think the current trends are going to persist into the first part of 2022. And we're expecting that there'll be some return to growth in the latter part of next year. As Shar also said in her remarks, even with that short-term softness, we're still very optimistic about the long-term prospects for Hyperconnect. It can contribute extremely significantly to the long-term growth of the overall Match Group. There's many ways that we can do that. We think that we can leverage video, audio, AI capabilities that they've got, things in moderation and safety. So there's a number of things that we're working very hard at leveraging. 
And so we're really trying to do both things at once, both adjust the product and marketing road maps around their existing apps and also leverage their capabilities across our portfolio. And then you've got Single Town and some of the new metaverse elements and the experience that we're seeing in that beta test. And that is something that potentially we can build into either a stand-alone app and/or potentially leverage that user experience into some of our apps in the portfolio. So there are a lot of things going on in Hyperconnect. We need to make progress in all 3 of those areas. We're working extremely diligently on it. The team there is working extremely diligently on it. 
And so even though there's some short-term pressure on the business, our long-term thesis and excitement around it remains completely intact, if not even stronger than it was months ago when we first made the acquisition. So we just got work to do, and we're working away at it."

We're going to start the international expansion for Hinge next year. It will likely begin in some markets in Europe and then a more broader global rollout over time.

The first thing is we have some really bold and big initiatives planned for Tinder next year, especially around virtual goods and some other areas as well. 
And the outlook that we've given doesn't assume a meaningful step function impact, a home run or really meaningful impact from any of those initiatives. So we're waiting to see as we roll these initiatives out how they evolve, how they perform, and then we can adjust accordingly depending on that. But the way we approach our outlook is to not factor in something that's kind of off the charts unexpected that we haven't seen previously or have -- or don't have reasons to expect. So we'll see how it goes, and we obviously always update as we see improving trends in the business. 
And the second thing is around COVID, and I'm sure we're all tired of talking about it and hearing about it and everything else. But the reality is the dating category as a whole remains impacted by the fact that people's socializing behaviors, how much they're going out, how much they're meeting other people, how much risk there was to take in going out with people has not returned to pre-COVID levels. 
I'm sure you and everyone else on the phone knows this from their own experiences. You're going out more than you were, but not as much as you used to. You are traveling more but not as much as you used to.  And so we're waiting to see how the behavior has evolved and where we get to versus the pre-COVID levels, and it varies by country. I talked a little about Japan and the U.S. In certain parts of the U.S., certainly, it is stronger than in other parts. Some people would take more risk and are more comfortable than other people. So we want to see where the world kind of normalizes back to, if you can use that term, and that will affect our outlook for 2022 and our performance for 2022. Right now, the way we have forecasted really assumes that current behaviors don't change that much, but the levels of socializing that are going on now kind of stay this way through the course of next year. 
Maybe they improved slightly depending on markets. But in general, we're not assuming a massive change versus current behaviors. That could prove to be too conservative. But right now, we don't see a full bounce back occurring at the moment. And so we're not assuming a change in that for 2022. So we'll see how this evolves. It's something that we're watching very closely. But that's another place where we could be -- see some improvement versus our current outlook depending on how people's behaviors start to adjust."

I mean on the second question around labor costs, we, like many companies, are seeing a very competitive job market, especially for tech talent, especially for engineers. It varies by market, but there certainly are markets where we're seeing a significant amount of pressure. And we're having to react to that and want to protect our franchise, want to retain our key talent. And then hiring new talent either to grow the business or as a replacement for people who may leave has become much more competitive, and costs are going up. 
So we've seen that occur throughout 2021. And right now, we don't see any significant shift in that trend as we head into 2022. So you never know what the future holds, but sitting here today, as we've put together our initial outlook for 2022, we're assuming that those trends are going to persist. And we're going to need to continue to invest in our talent to continue to build the business we want to build. And we're prepared to do that because that is long term critical to our business and its success. So that is something that we are dealing with as many companies are, and we'll continue to be thoughtful around it. 
As far as your first question, the mid- to high-teens growth, I described a little bit about something that could drive to the upside. And look, our expectation is for Tinder to continue to perform very, very well; for Hinge, as it both expands into international market, non-English-speaking markets. But also, there's significant opportunity for it in its current markets. So we think both businesses should drive significant levels of growth next year. We've talked about the more Established Brands growing a modest amount. That is still our goal for next year as well. 
We've also talked about some pressures we're facing, for example, in the Japanese market and how that's going to evolve. That's important to our Pairs business and the performance of Pairs for next year, and a little bit remains to be seen how the Japanese consumer evolves and how they emerge out of COVID. So that's another factor in our business. We also have talked a little bit about rolling out live streaming at a number of our businesses and how that takes place in OkCupid and BLK and other business where we plan to roll out live streaming. 
So there's a number of things that we've made some assumptions around. We've tried to make the most realistic assumptions we can. But general trends like COVID or recovering markets like Japan are certainly open for interpretation as are the success of our initiatives, whether they're at Tinder or whether they're some of our new initiatives like live streaming and a couple of our brands. So we're going to see how that all plays out, which is why we always give this initial outlook here on our Q3 call, sort of tell you what we think we're going to see next year. But we'll give you a much more precise view of things when we get to February after we've seen some of these initiatives start to roll out and once we have 3 more months of performance and COVID recovery and everything else. 
So it's the best we can do now. It's our best set of assumptions sitting here today but subject to refinement as there are many, many moving parts. And that's before you can get to the EBITDA side with App Stores and everything else that's happening that we've talked about extensively. So we try to give our best outlook, and that's what we've done today. But we will refine it as we get closer to the beginning of next year."

So the virtual currency or the coin is something we think of as an infrastructure thing that's going to be necessary eventually for virtual goods. And that particular component is currently testing, and we should have it sorted out in the next few months. 
Now virtual goods, the team is working on a very Tinder-specific version of virtual goods that will help users with both self-expression as well as the ability to stand out, particularly in a one-to-many surface area that Explore experiences will enable. And so the way we envision virtual goods is it is something that users will be able to collect as well as give and gift to others. And so there's a lot of -- in addition to this virtual currency, which is going to be a big component of what enables virtual goods, we do have to get the categorization of the goods and the design of it right. We have to create a value structure and a currency for these goods and, most importantly, to build the right experiences that allows users to showcase them on the app in the right way. 
And so all of that is the plan for 2022, and the plan is we build all of this out, test it out, learn it, refine it, work out the teams in a couple of markets. And then if we get this right, I do think this could be a multiyear revenue vector for Tinder, which doesn't exist today. And so a lot of work done, but we're very optimistic that this is going to be a really fun thing on Tinder. 
I think that was the last call for us. Thank you all very much. Have a wonderful holiday season, and thanks again for joining us today."

Today, Gary and I are doing this call from our brand-new offices in New York. 
We had another strong quarter with over 25% year-over-year revenue growth, also a record EBITDA quarter for us. Tinder, in particular, showed real strength with not only 20-plus percent revenue growth but also adding a record number of subscribers and payers this quarter. It is a historical high for Tinder, even higher than the quarter when Tinder Gold rolled out. I'm also excited to have our first woman CEO at Tinder. Renate has seamlessly taken over the helm there, and the team hasn't missed a beat in their journey to transform the Tinder experience. 
Explore, which is a new surface area within the Tinder app, rolled out globally a couple of weeks ago. It is a dynamic interface, which allows users to connect with others through new experiences beyond the swipe that used to be Tinder. These experiences can be tailored by market. It keeps Tinder at the center of culture, gives users new reasons to keep coming back, increases engagement and activity. In fact, our successful Swipe Night Series is coming to Tinder on Explore in a brand-new series starting November 7. Not only is it a very compelling Gen Z who done it storyline, this time, it has a bunch of features like fast chat built in that should amplify the conversations that follow on Tinder. 
Hinge had another great quarter across all metrics, doubling revenue again. The one business that is seeing an unexpected softness is the main revenue-driving app at Hyperconnect, Azar. It's had a few months of headwinds in some key markets in Asia. Some of it is COVID, some of it is marketing performance, some product-related delays. However, South Korea has finally opened up to international travel, and our teams were able to meet over the last couple of weeks in person. We're working closely with them now on marketing the product road map in order to reverse the trend. I am extremely optimistic about this team and technology asset as a long-term value creator for our portfolio, especially as we enter what we described in the shareholder letter as the next phase of Match Group's evolution in the dating category. 
In fact, my long-term thesis was further validated in the last couple of weeks when the team there walked me through a new concept they're beta testing on some college campuses in Seoul. It's called Single Town. It is a platform where your digital self in the form of real-time, audio-powered avatars can serendipitously meet others in virtual spaces, like a bar or they -- you can sit down with someone in a park bench to have one-on-one or group conversation. There is, for instance, a piano bar where people's digital selves are gathering around, but they're actually playing their pianos at home and jamming with others. You can overhear conversations, join conversations. You can tap into the digital avatars to see more of their profiles, and you have basically a richer set of signals to help connect with someone. 
It is metaverse experiences coming to life in a way that is transformative to how people meet and get to know each other on a dating or social discovery platform and is much more akin to how people interact in the real world. It is super early, but we are seeing some encouraging early signals in terms of engagement among Gen Z in Seoul. Already, the average daily time spend is about an hour and growing. Subcultures are forming. It is resonating with both genders. And as we talked about in our letter, this next phase of dating apps, in particular, is going to be all about richer, more organic and more akin to real-life ways of discovering, meeting and getting to know people. 
Technology is finally getting down. And this underlying technology platform, Hyperconnect, has built that power Single Town has been built in a way that it can be leveraged by other platforms easily. So my long-term view on what this talented team and technology brings to the portfolio is ever stronger. Finally, based on everything we're hearing and seeing, this cuffing season should be a strong one as people are ready to shake off the COVID malaise and get out there and date and meet. It's also shaping up to be one of the busiest wedding seasons. 
I feel good about a reenergized and much more social holiday season. These social interactions are incredibly important for our collective mental health and well-being. So I, for one, I'm rooting for a hell of a holiday season and a post-holiday peak season for us as we enter the new year. 
And with that, I will hand it over to Gary to provide some more color on the quarter."

We had a strong Q3 with total revenue of $802 million, up 25% year-over-year. Our businesses, excluding Hyperconnect, produced total revenue of $748 million, up 17% year-over-year. Total payers reached 16.3 million in Q3, an increase of 16%",1475,"Thanks, Shar. We had a strong Q3 with total revenue of $802 million, up 25% year-over-year. Our businesses, excluding Hyperconnect, produced total revenue of $748 million, up 17% year-over-year. Total payers reached 16.3 million in Q3, an increase of 16% from the prior year quarter. Growth was strong in all geographies, up 11% year-over-year in the Americas, 13% in Europe and 36% in APAC and Other, where the count reflects a full quarter of contribution from Hyperconnect. RPP was up 8% year-over-year to $16.06 in Q3, up 5% in the Americas, 6% in Europe and 17% in APAC and Other, again, reflecting a full quarter from Hyperconnect, where RPP exceeded $30. 
Our direct revenue grew 17% in the Americas, 20% in Europe and 59% in APAC and Other, again due to full quarter of Hyperconnect results. APAC and Other now comprises approximately 22% of our direct revenue. 
Tinder was a standout in the quarter, delivering direct revenue of $434 million, up 20% year -- up over 20% year-over-year. Tinder has phenomenal payers growth, up 19% year-over-year, adding 1.7 million payers, the most in its history, reaching 10.4 million. 
Some of this growth did come at the expense of RPP, which grew 1% year-over-year in the quarter. Tinder had a number of conversion wins in the quarter, particularly in the lower-priced subscription tier. Tinder Platinum adoption is ahead of schedule with total Platinum subscribers reaching nearly 1 million. Tinder engagement also remains very strong with both swipe activity and daily average messages significantly above pre-pandemic levels. 
All other brands grew direct revenue 32% year-over-year in Q3. In this group, Hinge was the standout, growing direct revenue over 100% driven by RPP growth of north of 70% and payers growth of 20%. BLK, Chispa and Upward in aggregate grew direct revenue over 80% year-over-year in Q3. Hyperconnect contributed $53 million of total revenue in the quarter, below our expected range. Hyperconnect is facing pressure in its largest revenue-generating app, Azar, especially in certain Middle Eastern markets. It also faced delays in rolling out certain product initiatives and a challenging marketing environment. We're working diligently with the Hyperconnect team to improve performance and deliver sustainable long-term growth. 
Indirect revenue reached $16 million, the highest ever in the quarter, up 40% year-over-year. It appears our strong brands, relatively lower ad loads and contextual targeting have been especially appealing to advertisers in the current environment. Operating income grew 10% year-over-year to $221 million, and EBITDA grew 15% year-over-year to $285 million in Q3. EBITDA margins were 36% but would have been 39% ex Hyperconnect. Overall expenses, including SBC expense, grew 32% year-over-year in Q3 with more than half of the total increase resulting from the acquisition of Hyperconnect. Excluding the impact of Hyperconnect, cost of revenue grew 20% year-over-year due to higher IAP fees and represented 27% of total revenue. 
Sales and marketing spend, excluding Hyperconnect, was up $5 million due to slightly higher marketing spend across our portfolio but was down 2 points year-over-year as a percent of total revenue to 18%. G&A expense, ex Hyperconnect, rose 8% year-over-year primarily due to an increase in legal fees and was 13% of revenue, down 1 point year-over-year. Product development costs, ex Hyperconnect, grew 37% year-over-year and were 7% of revenue as we increased head count at several brands, mainly Tinder and Hinge. Our gross leverage declined to 3.8x trailing EBITDA, and our net leverage was 3.3x at the end of Q3. We believe our target of below 3x net leverage by the end of 2021 is within reach. 
In a complex series of related transactions, we've repurchased $414 million aggregate principal amount of our 2022 exchangeable notes for approximately $1.5 billion in cash, using the proceeds from issuing 5.5 million shares of common stock, $500 million of new 3.625% 10-year unsecured debt and the unwind of the related bond hedges and warrants. These transactions, which were executed in the third quarter but sales in the fourth quarter, created an embedded derivative on which we recorded a $39 million loss in Q3, but also on which we expect to recognize a $24 million gain in Q4. 
We had operating cash flow of $667 million in the quarter and free cash flow of $614 million. We ended the quarter with $523 million of cash and short-term investments on hand. For Q4, we expect total revenue for Match Group of $810 million to $820 million, which would represent 24% to 26% year-over-year growth. Building off the conversion strength achieved in Q3, we expect Tinder's year-over-year direct revenue growth to accelerate towards the mid-20s percent range in Q4. Our expectation is that Hyperconnect will deliver revenue in Q4 at similar levels to Q3. Between weaker Q3 performance and lowered expectations for Q4, we have reduced Hyperconnect's revenue contribution by approximately $20 million for full year 2021. We expect full year stand-alone Hyperconnect revenue to be about $210 million. 
Despite softer performance at Hyperconnect, strength at Tinder and Hinge position us to deliver around $3 billion of total revenue in full year 2021, representing 25% year-over-year growth. Notably, we expect Tinder's direct revenue growth to be above 20% in full year 2021. We expect EBITDA of $285 million to $290 million in Q4, representing 16% to 18% year-over-year growth and margins, ex Hyperconnect, roughly in line with the prior year quarter. For the full year, we expect EBITDA to be above our previously communicated high end of the range of $1.060 billion, up nearly 20% year-over-year. 
Typically, we provide some initial thoughts on the upcoming year on our Q3 call. For the past several years, our initial outlook has been mid- to high teens revenue growth. For 2022, we expect our businesses, ex Hyperconnect, to once again deliver that level of growth driven by another strong year for Tinder and for Hinge as it begins expansion into non-English-speaking markets. 
With the full year of Hyperconnect revenue contribution included, we expect the company to grow total revenue closer to 20% year-over-year in 2022. We will provide a more precise revenue outlook on our February call once we see how the strategic changes in Hyperconnect and the new product initiatives across the portfolio begin to take hold. 
Excluding impacts from IAP policy changes that go into effect in 2022, we expect to see about 1 point of margin improvement at our businesses ex Hyperconnect and for Hyperconnect to achieve mid-single-digit EBITDA margins next year. While we anticipate legal expenses to be meaningfully lower next year, we plan to reinvest a portion of that savings into important safety and corporate and social responsibility initiatives. Also, given the highly competitive job market, we may reinvest to attract and retain crucial talent. The level of investments we choose to make in these areas will impact the actual amount of margin expansion we achieve. 
The biggest swing factor in our 2022 EBITDA outlook is what happens with App Store fees, which are an increasingly large percent of our revenue, up from 17% in 2020 to an estimated 19% in 2021, totaling over $550 million. There are numerous actions across the globe scrutinizing Apple and Google's requirement that we use their payment system and pay a 30% fee. A reduction in these fees would have numerous positive consequences, including enabling us to pass along benefits to consumers. Google has agreed to reduce fees for subscriptions, though not a la carte, and from 30% to 15% starting January 1, 2022. But they also still have a policy change to require use of their billing system scheduled to go into effect at the end of March 2022. 
There are many unknowns regarding Apple's plans for IAP, including weather and how they intend to comply with the law banning mandatory IAP in South Korea and the injunction in the Epic decision, which requires them to eliminate the anti-steering provision by December 9, 2021. We're going to watch these developments around the App Stores for at least another few months before we provide our EBITDA outlook for next year. We're optimistic more changes in the ecosystem are likely. 
There is a lot going on across our business, including a meaningful product evolution at Tinder and many of our other brands. We're excited to execute on our product road map and to continue evolving the experience for our users. We recognize that people around the world are increasingly turning to digital products to meet and socialize. Our job is to continue to build new and exciting products and experiences that enable people to connect, something we have been a leader at for more than 25 years. We're confident that if we remain focused on delivering outstanding products, we'll continue to deliver strong growth and financial results for our stakeholders for many more years to come.

And it's across all regions mostly because a lot of the growth in payers in Q3 came as a result of what we normally referred to as under-the-hood revenue optimization. So a combination of merchandising and paywall optimizations drove conversion and payer growth. Some of this increased conversion was in lower-priced tiers, which were dilutive to RPP as Gary mentioned. The one thing I want to emphasize, we generally always focus on revenue growth. Sometimes, it comes through payer growth and sometimes through RPP, sometimes both. And so we don't worry too much about the cadence necessarily, but we're definitely always focused on revenue features to increase revenue overall."

I would say generally, Tinder has really been performing very strongly and increasingly strongly as the year has gone on. And the engagement with the product is really even well stronger than it was pre-pandemic. So we really feel good about the dynamics overall at Tinder. And what we're expecting is that in Q4, we're going to see both payer and RPP growth. The momentum that we had on the payer growth should continue into Q4. So I'm expecting a similar level of year-over-year payer growth in Q4 as we saw in Q3. 
And I think we'll also be able to achieve some RPP growth as well, which we didn't see as much in Q3, but I think we'll see that in Q4. So when you combine the additional RPP growth with similar level of payer growth, you're going to get overall direct revenue growth in kind of approaching the mid-20s at Tinder as I said earlier. So we feel very good about that. The one thing that I just would remind people is that seasonally, Q4 tends to be weaker for Tinder around payer growth. Especially when we've seen a very strong Q3, it does make kind of the sequential payer increase more challenging. So that's the thing we are expecting to see from a sequential perspective in Q4. But year-over-year, I'm expecting similar levels of growth on payers as what we saw in Q3. 
And just last reminder would be we don't really manage the business specifically around RPP growth or payers growth. We're looking for direct revenue or overall revenue growth. So we don't get as focused on one metric versus the other. There's obviously trade-offs as we saw in Q3, but we continue to manage to drive a strong level of revenue growth. And we're positioned to do that in Q4."

I'm going to take the opportunity to talk about the App Store a little bit more broadly and all the puts and takes that we're seeing and what we think is likely to happen. So there's been a flurry of activity on the App Store front, particularly in the last few months. South Korea became the first country to outlaw mandatory IAP. Additionally, at this point, there are either active investigations, litigation or proposed legislation across the globe, including countries in Europe, U.K., Japan, India, Australia and the U.S. 
So here's what we see at a practical level. Google appears to be complying with the South Korea law. That does not seem to be the case with Apple yet. Google has reduced its fees on subscriptions but not on a la carte from 30% to 15%, which is going to be effective January 1, 2022. Now recall, Google had a while ago announced that they will be enforcing mandatory IAP, and they delayed that decision to March 31, 2022. And we are as of now unsure where they stand on that policy change. Interestingly, for -- it's been a while since the Apple and Google App Store economics are not in sync. And so we have to see how Apple responds to the Google change in rates for subscription. All the anti-steering provision injunction ordered by the judge on the Epic case, Apple has appealed it, but -- and they have not yet communicated how they intend to comply with it. So all that to say, there was a lot of things sort of have happened, happened, about to happen. It is meaningful for us. 
As we said in the letter, our 2021 IAP fees are expected to be north of $550 million, and it will be materially higher in 2022. About 70% of our revenue comes from subscription. And since Google does not yet require mandatory IAP, approximately 80% of our IAP fees actually goes to Apple. So a lot of moving parts, and we have not yet accounted for any impact from changes to IAP fees in our outlook. Generally, in Q4, we expect very, very minimal impact. But depending on -- given all the scrutiny that's going around the world and some of the developments in the last few months, I do think this will continue to break. And it will be a beneficial change to consumers and to developers. 
And depending on when and what and how this breaks, the outcome for us is pretty varied. So we're watching some of these milestones that are coming up in the next few months. Hopefully, it will give us some more clarity, and we will be able to communicate a little better in our next call. The -- my final thought on this is I've never seen a point in this IAP App Store issue where there's been so much activity around the world. And at some point, Apple has to take a step back and ask themselves whether this is still the right thing to do. And so another reason why I think this will change in some way."

On the litigation, unfortunately, there's really not much that we can say about that right now. It's an active litigation. Jury -- it's a jury trial. And the jury selection started at the beginning of this week, and open",624,"Sure. Let me take a crack at that. On the litigation, unfortunately, there's really not much that we can say about that right now. It's an active litigation. Jury -- it's a jury trial. And the jury selection started at the beginning of this week, and opening statements are going to be next Monday, this coming Monday. So this is occurring right now here in New York. And look, there's always uncertainty in a jury trial, but we feel extremely good about our position and that the plaintiff's case is meritless. And we're going to go in and defend ourselves vigorously. So we'll be watching that as it plays out over the coming weeks. 
As far as the APAC trends go, I can say a lot more about that. And what I would say is, really, Japan is the biggest area of focus for us in Asia because that is our #2 market. We derive significant revenue in the Japanese market. And really, they only recently lifted their fourth state of emergency. They had the Olympics, and after the Olympics, they had pretty significant spike in COVID from their perspective. And they've taken some pretty significant actions. And really, some restrictions on dining and other socializing really only lifted last week. 
So that geography continues to be impacted by COVID in a pretty significant way. And we have not yet seen a return to normal levels of socializing in that market. And that is impacting our business in a significant way. We have the #1 and #2 apps in Japan in Pairs and Tinder. And so we have meaningful presence there. Notably, the trends are not just affecting us. They're affecting all of the dating apps in that market. But because we are so large in that market, it is affecting us significantly. 
So we're optimistic that the drivers that make Japan a great dating market with lots of potential growth continue to be there. And we think this will resolve itself over time as people in Japan start to go back out and get COVID further behind them. But it's going to take a little bit of time. We're watching it, and we're optimistic, but I think it needs a little bit of time to play out. And while Japan is the market in Asia that's the most significant impact there for us, there's other markets in Asia that are also still affected mostly in East Asia, but you've got Singapore, Taiwan, that are still affected as well by trends as a result of COVID. So given the geographic footprint of our business, which does have a significant presence in Asia, we are still dealing with impact there. 
And I would say if you look at kind of what's happened around the globe given our overall global exposure, the Americas has recovered well, especially the U.S. And Europe is a little bit behind, but making progress as well. And then Asia is further behind. So if you look at the trends that we've seen in the U.S., I think that over time, that's going to play through these other markets. It really is a question of timing more than anything else. And so we'll see how that plays out. 
Another market to just point to is India. India was really impacted by COVID at depths, and we saw a significant impact in our business. We have seen a meaningful recovery in India as a result of improvement in the COVID situation there. So it is very much market by market depending on what actions the government has taken and what the level of COVID issues is. But we are seeing gradual kind of step-by-step recovery as we look at markets around the world."

But as I went through and Shar mentioned as well, there are really kind of 3 things that have led to the lower-than-expected revenue for Hyperconnect. And it's really focused",630,"All right. Let me take a crack at that one, too, and Shar can certainly jump in. But as I went through and Shar mentioned as well, there are really kind of 3 things that have led to the lower-than-expected revenue for Hyperconnect. And it's really focused on the main revenue-generating app, Azar, which is a one-to-one video experience. The first is COVID. Hyperconnect and Azar have significant presence in Asia and the Middle East. And as I just talked about, COVID continues to be an issue in many of those markets. And you've got a lot of people living at home with their family, spending a lot of time at home. And it has changed the interaction of the consumer with the one-to-one video chat app at Azar. And so we're looking to evolve the app in ways that change the experience and make it more conducive in the current environment. I think that's kind of the first piece of it. 
The second piece of it is on the marketing front. Azar, there's a lot of performance marketing as we've talked about in other context. The marketing environment has become both more competitive and also more challenging as a result of changes that Apple has made around IDFA. So that's the second piece of what's going on. And then the third piece is they've had some product initiatives that have been delayed, and the take-up has not been as quick as we had hoped. And so there's some product things that are happening there as well. 
So all 3 of those things have impacted the Azar performance, the Hyperconnect performance. I would tell you that we're not happy at all that we missed our expectations for Q3 and that we had to lower them for Q4. As Shar mentioned, we sent a team over there finally and spent a couple of weeks with Hyperconnect working through product road maps, marketing road maps and adjusting things to reverse the trends. We're confident that working closely with them, we're going to be able to return the business to growth. But it's going to take some time. 
I think the current trends are going to persist into the first part of 2022. And we're expecting that there'll be some return to growth in the latter part of next year. As Shar also said in her remarks, even with that short-term softness, we're still very optimistic about the long-term prospects for Hyperconnect. It can contribute extremely significantly to the long-term growth of the overall Match Group. There's many ways that we can do that. We think that we can leverage video, audio, AI capabilities that they've got, things in moderation and safety. So there's a number of things that we're working very hard at leveraging. 
And so we're really trying to do both things at once, both adjust the product and marketing road maps around their existing apps and also leverage their capabilities across our portfolio. And then you've got Single Town and some of the new metaverse elements and the experience that we're seeing in that beta test. And that is something that potentially we can build into either a stand-alone app and/or potentially leverage that user experience into some of our apps in the portfolio. So there are a lot of things going on in Hyperconnect. We need to make progress in all 3 of those areas. We're working extremely diligently on it. The team there is working extremely diligently on it. 
And so even though there's some short-term pressure on the business, our long-term thesis and excitement around it remains completely intact, if not even stronger than it was months ago when we first made the acquisition. So we just got work to do, and we're working away at it."

So all that baked into our numbers and our performance that you're seeing for this year and our outlook for Q4 and into next year, we've included all that. It's not very significant to us, but there is some impact. And we're not able to outrun it completely, but through creativity and some good solves and adjusting channels and so forth, we're able to offset some of the impacts.

We're going to start the international expansion for Hinge next year. It will likely begin in some markets in Europe and then a more broader global rollout over time. As you mentioned, their marketing campaigns and particularly, the design to be deleted tagline has really resonated with consumers. And the Hinge team continues to differentiate themselves on the product. And we do think that product experience Hinge is building is very well suited for international markets.

The first thing is we have some really bold and big initiatives planned for Tinder next year, especially around virtual goods and some other areas as well. 
And the outlook that we've given doesn't assume a meaningful step function impact, a home run or really meaningful impact from any of those initiatives. So we're waiting to see as we roll these initiatives out how they evolve, how they perform, and then we can adjust accordingly depending on that. But the way we approach our outlook is to not factor in something that's kind of off the charts unexpected that we haven't seen previously or have -- or don't have reasons to expect. So we'll see how it goes, and we obviously always update as we see improving trends in the business. 
And the second thing is around COVID, and I'm sure we're all tired of talking about it and hearing about it and everything else. But the reality is the dating category as a whole remains impacted by the fact that people's socializing behaviors, how much they're going out, how much they're meeting other people, how much risk there was to take in going out with people has not returned to pre-COVID levels. 
I'm sure you and everyone else on the phone knows this from their own experiences. You're going out more than you were, but not as much as you used to. You are traveling more but not as much as you used to.  And so we're waiting to see how the behavior has evolved and where we get to versus the pre-COVID levels, and it varies by country. I talked a little about Japan and the U.S. In certain parts of the U.S., certainly, it is stronger than in other parts. Some people would take more risk and are more comfortable than other people. So we want to see where the world kind of normalizes back to, if you can use that term, and that will affect our outlook for 2022 and our performance for 2022. Right now, the way we have forecasted really assumes that current behaviors don't change that much, but the levels of socializing that are going on now kind of stay this way through the course of next year. 
Maybe they improved slightly depending on markets. But in general, we're not assuming a massive change versus current behaviors. That could prove to be too conservative. But right now, we don't see a full bounce back occurring at the moment. And so we're not assuming a change in that for 2022. So we'll see how this evolves. It's something that we're watching very closely. But that's another place where we could be -- see some improvement versus our current outlook depending on how people's behaviors start to adjust."

I mean on the second question around labor costs, we, like many companies, are seeing a very competitive job market, especially for tech talent, especially for engineers. It varies by market, but there certainly are markets where we're seeing a significant amount of pressure. And we're having to react to that and want to protect our franchise, want to retain our key talent. And then hiring new talent either to grow the business or as a replacement for people who may leave has become much more competitive, and costs are going up. 
So we've seen that occur throughout 2021. And right now, we don't see any significant shift in that trend as we head into 2022. So you never know what the future holds, but sitting here today, as we've put together our initial outlook for 2022, we're assuming that those trends are going to persist. And we're going to need to continue to invest in our talent to continue to build the business we want to build. And we're prepared to do that because that is long term critical to our business and its success. So that is something that we are dealing with as many companies are, and we'll continue to be thoughtful around it. 
As far as your first question, the mid- to high-teens growth, I described a little bit about something that could drive to the upside. And look, our expectation is for Tinder to continue to perform very, very well; for Hinge, as it both expands into international market, non-English-speaking markets. But also, there's significant opportunity for it in its current markets. So we think both businesses should drive significant levels of growth next year. We've talked about the more Established Brands growing a modest amount. That is still our goal for next year as well. 
We've also talked about some pressures we're facing, for example, in the Japanese market and how that's going to evolve. That's important to our Pairs business and the performance of Pairs for next year, and a little bit remains to be seen how the Japanese consumer evolves and how they emerge out of COVID. So that's another factor in our business. We also have talked a little bit about rolling out live streaming at a number of our businesses and how that takes place in OkCupid and BLK and other business where we plan to roll out live streaming. 
So there's a number of things that we've made some assumptions around. We've tried to make the most realistic assumptions we can. But general trends like COVID or recovering markets like Japan are certainly open for interpretation as are the success of our initiatives, whether they're at Tinder or whether they're some of our new initiatives like live streaming and a couple of our brands. So we're going to see how that all plays out, which is why we always give this initial outlook here on our Q3 call, sort of tell you what we think we're going to see next year. But we'll give you a much more precise view of things when we get to February after we've seen some of these initiatives start to roll out and once we have 3 more months of performance and COVID recovery and everything else. 
So it's the best we can do now. It's our best set of assumptions sitting here today but subject to refinement as there are many, many moving parts. And that's before you can get to the EBITDA side with App Stores and everything else that's happening that we've talked about extensively. So we try to give our best outlook, and that's what we've done today. But we will refine it as we get closer to the beginning of next year."

Now virtual goods, the team is working on a very Tinder-specific version of virtual goods that will help users with both self-expression as well as the ability to stand out, particularly in a one-to-many surface area that Explore experiences will enable. And so the way we envision virtual goods is it is something that users will be able to collect as well as give and gift to others. And so there's a lot of -- in addition to this virtual currency, which is going to be a big component of what enables virtual goods, we do have to get the categorization of the goods and the design of it right. We have to create a value structure and a currency for these goods and, most importantly, to build the right experiences that allows users to showcase them on the app in the right way. 
And so all of that is the plan for 2022, and the plan is we build all of this out, test it out, learn it, refine it, work out the teams in a couple of markets. And then if we get this right, I do think this could be a multiyear revenue vector for Tinder, which doesn't exist today. And so a lot of work done, but we're very optimistic that this is going to be a really fun thing on Tinder.
