It's hard to believe it's been almost a year since the COVID-19 pandemic started here in the U.S. And while there's now light at the end of the tunnel with the vaccine starting to be distributed across the globe, we are still very much in a period of uncertainty and volatility. 
As painful as the pandemic has been for everyone, I'm very proud of how Raymond James has performed. Who would have predicted when we lost 40% of our earnings to the rate cuts in March that we would be talking about records today. This is a testament, not only to the resiliency of the U.S. economy, but also to Raymond James, our advisers and their associates. 
As you can see on Slide 3, our unwavering focus on serving clients resulted in fantastic financial results during the quarter, starting off fiscal 2021 with record quarterly revenues and earnings, driven by strength across our businesses. 
In the fiscal first quarter, the firm reported record net revenues of $2.22 billion, which were up 11% over the prior year's fiscal first quarter and 7% over the prior record set in the preceding quarter. 
Record net income of $312 million or $2.23 per diluted share increased 16% over the prior record of net income set a year ago quarter and 49% over the preceding quarter. 
Excluding expenses of $2 million associated with the completed acquisition of NWPS Holdings and the pending acquisition of Financeco, adjusted quarterly net income was $314 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share was $2.24, both records. 
Annualized return on equity for the quarter was 17.2% and return on tangible common equity was 19%, an impressive result, especially in this near-0 rate environment and given our very strong capital position. 
Record quarterly results were primarily attributable to higher asset management and related administrative fees, record investment banking revenues, strong fixed income brokerage revenues and disciplined expense management, which were more than offset the negative impact of lower short-term interest rates on the net interest income and RJBDP fees. 
The record results and broad-based strengths in our businesses and this near-0 rate interest environment, which included record results for capital markets and asset management segments during the quarter, reinforced the value of our diverse and complementary businesses, sometimes something underappreciated in different market cycles. 
Moving to Slide 4. We ended the quarter with records for total client assets under administration of $1.02 trillion, PCG assets and fee-based accounts of $533 billion and financial assets under management of $170 billion. 
Client assets crossing the $1 trillion mark for the first time is a testament to the consistent growth that we've achieved by focusing on retaining our existing advisers while also recruiting high-quality financial advisers. And when you step back, this is quite an achievement. In December of 2010, we had around $260 billion of client assets. So we have experienced around a 15% compounded annual growth and essentially quadrupled client assets over a 10-year period, and the vast majority of that was organic growth. 
We ended the quarter with 8,233 financial advisers. A net increase of 173 over the prior year, but a slight net decrease of 6 sequentially. A flat adviser count is not unusual for this quarter as we typically see an elevated number of retirements at the year-end, where assets are typically retained at Raymond James by their successor. 
We are still optimistic about all of our recruiting pipelines across our affiliation options, but there are a few trends we are seeing in the industry. On the independent side of the business, we continue to experience strong recruiting activity, and we're seeing more interest from both external internal advisers in the RIA custody affiliation option, particularly for much larger teams who have the scale and appetite to assume the regulatory and supervision responsibilities and risks. 
We have been beneficiaries of this trend and our rebranded RIA and custody services division, or RCS. And we believe we'll continue to benefit from the trend given major consolidation and disruption in the RIA custody industry. However, it's important to note that when an RIA affiliates with RCS, whether it be an internal transfer from our other affiliation option or external additions, we do not count the advisers of the RIA firms in our adviser count, but their assets are still included in client assets under administration. 
On the employee side, there has been a modest slowdown in recruiting due to the challenges brought on by COVID and also increased competition for experienced advisers for even our regional competitors have significantly increased their recruiting packages. 
In response to what we have seen, we have also enhanced our recruiting packages to be more competitive, while also ensuring attractive returns to our shareholders. 
Also impacting adviser count this year, we temporarily decreased the size of our new adviser training class this year by about 35 trainees, allowing us to dedicate more time and attention to newer advisers as they seek to overcome the challenges presented by this current virtual environment. 
While this will negatively impact the growth in adviser count when compared to prior years, when the training class was larger, it really shouldn't have a significant impact on client assets. We believe our recruiting will continue to thrive as advisers are attracted to our supportive culture and client-first values. 
Looking at recruiting results over the prior 4 quarters, financial advisers with nearly $270 million of trailing 12 production and nearly $40 billion of assets at their prior firms affiliated with Raymond James domestically. 
As for our net organic growth results in the Private Client Group, we generated domestic PCG net new assets of $42 billion over the 4 quarters ending in December 31, 2020, representing more than 5% of domestic PCG client assets at the beginning of the period.  And remember, this is net of client fees. 
We are very pleased with our consistent organic growth, especially given the disruption associated with the COVID-19 pandemic during the year. And as you know, we did not benefit from the surge in self-directed online business during the year. 
Moving to segment results on Slide 5. The Private Client Group generated quarterly net revenues of $1.47 billion and pretax income of $140 million. Quarterly net revenues grew 5% over the preceding quarter, predominantly driven by higher asset management and related administrative fees, reflecting higher assets in fee-based accounts, which will continue to be a tailwind in the second quarter. 
This strong revenue growth helped PCG's pretax income grow 12% sequentially, although it's still down 8% on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to the negative impact of lower short-term interest rates. 
Capital Markets segment generated record quarterly net revenues of $452 million and pretax income of $129 million, an extraordinary result, a strong quarter for the segment, driven by broad-based strength across global equities and investment banking as well as fixed income. 
During the quarter, record investment banking revenues were driven by record M&A revenues, along with continued strength in debt and equity underwriting. 
Fixed income brokerage revenues were strong as client activity levels remained robust. While we certainly would caution you against annualizing the record results of Capital Markets segment this quarter, I do think the results reflect the significant investments we have made to strengthen our platform over the last 10 years. And we are continuing to make those investments, as I will discuss shortly. 
The Asset Management segment generated record net revenues of $195 million and pretax income of $83 million. Record results were driven by the growth of financial assets under management as equity market appreciation and the net inflows into PCG fee-based accounts more than offset the modest net outflows for Carillon Tower Advisers. 
Lastly, Raymond James Bank generated quarterly net revenues of $167 million and pretax income of $71 million. Compared to a year ago quarter, net revenues declined primarily due to the impact of lower short-term interest rates on net interest income. Sequentially, quarterly net revenues grew 4%, as higher asset balances more than offset the 7 basis point decline in the bank's net interest margin in the quarter, which was primarily attributable to the growth in the Agency MBS portfolio. 
The credit quality of the bank's portfolio remains healthy, with most trends continuing to improve. Nonperforming assets remained low at 9 basis points of total assets and the amount of criticized loans declined 4% during the quarter. The quarterly bank loan provision for credit losses of $14 million declined sequentially and was driven mostly by macroeconomic model inputs, now under the CECL methodology, which Paul Shoukry will cover in more detail. 
Moving to Slide 6. As you've heard me say many times, we remain focused on long-term growth and are committed to deploying excess capital to generate attractive returns to our shareholders. Good example of that commitment are the 2 acquisitions we announced during the quarter. The first, which closed in late December, is NWPS. NWPS is a provider of retirement plan administration, consulting, actuarial and administrative services based in Seattle, Washington. The addition of NWPS allows Raymond James to expand our retirement services offerings, including retirement plan administration services to advisers and clients. 
Many of our advisers serve clients with small businesses and offering this retirement solution is another attractive way to help advisers develop deeper and stronger relationship with our clients. 
The second pending acquisition, Financo, is a consumer-focused M&A advisory firm, which allows us to strategically grow our capabilities in an attractive vertical with industry-leading team. We anticipate this transaction to close in the March or April time frame. Both of these firms represent great cultural and strategic fits, and we're excited about welcoming them to the Raymond James family. 
While we are not going to discuss the terms of these 2 transactions, in total, over time, these 2 acquisitions represent consideration, retention and earn-out potential to the sellers of approximately $320 million. So is a meaningful and attractive use of cash and capital. 
We will continue to actively pursue additional acquisitions that are both the cultural and strategic fit. And now for a more detailed review of the financial results, I'm going to turn this over to Paul Shoukry. Paul?"

Record quarterly net revenues of $2.22 billion grew 11% and year-over-year and 7% sequentially. 
Asset management fees grew 12% on a year-over-year basis and 6% sequentially, commensurate with the growth of fee-based assets. Private Client Group assets and fee-based accounts were up 12% during the fiscal first quarter, which will provide a tailwind for this line item for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. However, given fewer billable days in the March quarter, I would expect asset management fees in PCG to increase about 10% sequentially. 
Consolidated brokerage revenues of $528 million grew 15% over the prior year and represented a record. These revenues are inherently difficult to predict, but our clients are still engaged in both the Private Client Group and Capital Markets segments given the current market and interest rate environment. 
Account and service fees of $145 million declined 19% year-over-year, almost entirely due to the decrease in RJBDP fees from third-party banks due to lower short-term interest rates, which I will discuss, along with net interest income, in more detail on the next 2 slides. 
Consolidated investment banking revenues of $261 million grew 85% year-over-year and 18% sequentially, achieving a record result, driven by record M&A advisory revenues and strong debt and equity underwriting. 
Based on the pipeline and activity levels, we anticipate second quarter to be healthy, but not as strong as a remarkable result achieved in the first quarter. As you all know, these revenues are very difficult to predict. But for the rest of the fiscal year, we would be very pleased to achieve the pace of the average quarterly investment banking revenues from the annual record we set in fiscal 2020, which would be roughly $160 million to $165 million per quarter on average. 
Turning to other revenues, which were $56 million for the quarter. This line included $24 million of private equity valuation gains during the quarter, of which approximately $10 million were attributable to noncontrolling interest reflected in other expenses. 
Moving to Slide 9. Client domestic cash sweep balances ended the quarter at a record $61.6 billion, increasing 11% sequentially and representing 6.7% of domestic PCG client assets. As we continue to experience growing cash balances and less demand from third party banks, more client cash is being held in the client interest program at the broker dealer. 
You can see those balances grew to $8.8 billion, and most of that growth has been used to purchase short-term treasuries to meet the associated reserve requirement. Over time, that cash could be redeployed to our bank or third-party banks as capacity becomes available, which would hopefully earn a higher spread than we currently earn on short-term treasuries. 
On Slide 10, the top chart displays our firm-wide net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks on a combined basis. Related, based on your feedback, we have updated our net interest table in the earnings release to incorporate all of the firm's interest-earning assets and liabilities instead of those balances for just Raymond James Bank. We hope you find this update helpful. And as always, we thank you for your suggestions to continue enhancing our disclosures. 
As you can see on Slide 10, while lower rates have put significant pressure on these revenues since the Fed rate cuts in March 2020, we did experience a slight uptick in these revenues sequentially, helped by the aforementioned growth in client cash balances and higher asset balances at Raymond James Bank, which more than offset the sequential NIM compression you see on the bottom left portion of this slide. 
Given prepayment speeds of higher-yielding securities and mortgages, we would expect the bank's NIM to decline another 10 basis points or so throughout the year. However, we are hoping that growth in the bank's earning assets will more than offset the NIM compression and result in continued growth of the firm's net interest income. 
I will provide a bit more color on the bank's balance sheet growth in a few slides. 
Moving to consolidated expenses on Slide 11. First, compensation expense, which is by far our largest expense, the compensation ratio decreased sequentially from 68.1% to 67.5% during the quarter, primarily due to record revenues in the Capital Markets segment, which had a 56% compensation ratio during the quarter and the benefit from the private equity valuation gain, which doesn't have direct compensation associated with it. 
As we said last quarter, given the near-0 short-term interest rates and the successful implementation of the expense initiative we announced last quarter, we are confident we can maintain a compensation ratio of 70% or better, which we still believe is an appropriate target. 
And as we experienced this quarter, very strong Capital Markets results in any particular quarter could result in a compensation ratio below 70%. 
Non-compensation expenses of $323 million increased $24 million or 8% compared to last year's first quarter and almost all of that increase could be explained by the $14 million bank loan provision for credit losses compared to the $2 million benefit in the year-ago period and $13 million of noncontrolling interest and other expenses, most of which offsets a portion of the $24 million private equity valuation gain reflected in other revenues. 
As we explained, and as you can see in these results, we have been very focused on the disciplined management of all compensation and noncompensation-related expenses, while still investing in growth and ensuring high service levels for advisers and their clients. 
Slide 12 shows the pretax margin trend over the past 5 quarters. Pretax margin was 18% in the fiscal first quarter of 2021, which was boosted by the record Capital Markets results as that segment generated a record 29% pretax margin. 
Last quarter, we talked about generating a 14% to 15% pretax margin on a consolidated basis in this near-0 interest rate environment, which, again, we believe is still a reasonable target. But as we experienced this quarter, there's upside to the margins capital markets results are so strong. 
On Slide 13, at the end of fiscal first quarter, total assets were approximately $53.7 billion, a 13% sequential increase, reflecting the dynamic I explained earlier with growth in client cash balances and associated reserves at the broker dealer. This growth of client cash balances on the balance sheet caused our Tier 1 leverage ratio to decrease to 12.9%, which is still well above the regulatory requirement. Liquidity remains very strong with $1.8 billion of cash at the parent, leaving us with plenty of flexibility to be both defensive and opportunistic. 
Slide 14 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past 5 quarters. In December, in addition to increasing the quarterly dividend 5% to $0.39 per share, the Board of Directors authorized share repurchases of up to $750 million, which replaced the previous authorization. And $740 million remains available under the new authorization. 
In the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 108,000 shares for $10 million, an average price of approximately $92.80 per share. This fell short of our $50 million quarterly target, which we plan on making up for in the subsequent quarters as we are committed to repurchasing at least $200 million to offset share-based compensation dilution during the fiscal year. 
One thing many of you have asked us to be more explicit on is our plans for deploying capital, which is something we hope to discuss with you in much more detail at our Analyst Investor Day, tentatively planned to be held virtually in May. 
But at a high level, what I would share with you now is that our goal is to manage down the firm's Tier 1 leverage ratio closer to 10% over time through a combination of balance sheet growth, primarily at the bank, as well as more deliberate deployment of capital through a combination of organic growth, acquisitions and share repurchases. 
We are not ready to share a specific time line to achieve this objective and doing so in the middle of a pandemic is probably not the best time to do so, but I want to be clear that we are fully committed to managing our capital levels, balancing our objectives of optimizing returns to shareholders while ensuring a significant balance sheet flexibility and conservatism. 
On the next 2 slides, we provide additional detail on the bank's loan portfolio, starting on Slide 15, with some detail on Raymond James Bank's asset composition. 
In the pie chart, you can see we broke out CRE and REIT loans into separate categories with the implementation of CECL this quarter. The only other thing I would point out on this slide is, we have a very well diversified balance sheet at the bank. 
The bank's total assets grew 3% sequentially, led by 4% growth in the bank's loan portfolio, about 60% of which was attributable to securities-based loans to Private Client Group clients. We have decelerated the growth of the securities portfolio at the bank and will likely continue to do so over the near-term as spreads for agency mortgage-backed securities have gotten extremely tight. 
Meanwhile, we have resumed growth in certain sectors in the corporate loan portfolio that we believe are less directly exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Lastly, on Slide 16, we provide key credit metrics for Raymond James Bank. First, let me briefly discuss CECL. We implemented CECL on October 1, which increased our allowances by approximately $45 million, with the majority of that increase attributable to recruiting and retention-related loans to financial advisers in the Private Client Group segment, which now require a larger allowance under CECL than under the incurred loss method. 
About $10 million of that day 1 impact was related to outstanding bank loans. And remember, all $45 million hit the balance sheet directly and did not go through the P&L. 
We had no charge-offs in the quarter. The quarterly bank loan provision for credit losses was $14 million, largely attributable to the macroeconomic model inputs we use from a third party vendor, which assumed a greater decline in commercial real estate prices in the near-term with a longer recovery period, resulting in higher allowances for the CRE portfolio from 3.25% to 4.2% at the end of the quarter. 
The bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percent of total loans ended the quarter at 1.71%. So we believe we are adequately reserved, but that could change rapidly if economic conditions deteriorate. But currently, we are pleased with the credit quality and the positive trends we are seeing with the loan portfolio and the broader economy. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Paul Reilly to discuss our outlook. Paul?"

As for our outlook, we remain well positioned entering the second fiscal quarter with the strong capital ratios and record client assets. However, we'll continue to face headwinds from a full year of lower short-term interest rates, and there's still a high degree of uncertainty given the COVID-19 pandemic and the rollout of the vaccine and a new administration. 
In the Private Client Group segment, while recruiting environment is extremely competitive, and we face some challenges in a largely virtual environment, our adviser recruiting pipeline is strong across all of our affiliation options, and this segment is going to benefit by starting the fiscal second quarter with strong sequential growth in fee-based accounts. 
Private Client Group fee-based assets were up 12%, which should be a good tailwind and result in a 10% increase in the associated revenues. In the Capital Markets segment, there is still a significant amount of economic uncertainty due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, the investment banking pipeline is currently strong, and we expect fixed income brokerage results to remain elevated given the current interest rate and economic conditions. 
In the asset management segment, results will be positively impacted by the 11% increase in assets under management, but those assets are built throughout the quarter. 
At Raymond James Bank, we should continue to benefit from the attractive growth of securities-based loans and mortgages to PCG clients. And as we decelerate the growth of the securities portfolio, we are cautiously adding to corporate loans in the less COVID-impacted sectors. We continue to focus on long-term growth, and our priorities remain unchanged. Our top priority is serving clients, and we're focused on organic growth, which is primarily driven by retaining and recruiting advisers in the Private Client Group. 
Additionally, we're continuing to add senior talent in our other businesses, such as investment banking. 
As you observed this quarter, we will continue to actively pursue acquisitions. But we are still focused on being and only pursuing transactions that have a great cultural and strategic fit and at prices that can deliver attractive returns to our shareholders. 
We started fiscal 2021 with very strong results, and I believe we are well positioned to drive profitable growth in the coming quarters across all of our businesses. But we are also fully aware that we are still in the middle of a global health pandemic, and we should all be prepared for much more economic turbulence and market volatility over the next several months.

And certainly, on the employee side as people have the transition assistance to be more trying to grow their private client group businesses we did. And that gap just got bigger and bigger and bigger where I think that people even wanting to join just said the economic gap was too big. 
And as we really analyzed it, that if we can get by upping -- we don't have to match. We've proven that over history, but being more competitive because of the environment, what we offer advisers, we can get a good return now. And if interest rate spreads gap out again in the future, those recruiting deals from our standpoint will even be better. So we've got more aggressive. Yes, there's a little bit of lag, but we think we can get it going. 
We did cut the adviser class going in on a cost cut and then during the pandemic and as we ramp back up the training, which we expect to once we get out of -- as we're kind of exiting the total virtual environment that will help also. 
So again, last year, we had good recruiting stats this quarter, but it isn't unusual. If you go back to the year before that it was flattish. I think we were up 2 in a record recruiting year. So we'll get it back on track, and maybe we're a little slow to act. 
But recruiting overall has been good. And then we're going to have to figure out how to give you better numbers. Because people are in the RIA channel, we don't count them at all. And so you're not really seeing overall recruiting, although they are in the asset number. So we're going to work on how to give you a better metric on that, too. So you can compare it more apples-to-apples as channels may shift over time."

Is there any way you can just help refresh us how to think about the capacity of the bank growth or the size of the bank within Raymond James? I appreciate that you're going to be opportunistic and can't really give a time line of expanding the bank balance sheet. But how should we think about based on whether it's third-party bank deposits and client interest program, capacity to fund growth or the size of the bank within the overall firm?

And we have, as you can see, with the cash at third-party banks and now in CIP at the broker dealer, we have a lot of funding capacity and plenty of capital capacity to grow the bank. So the biggest constraint now is just finding assets with good risk-adjusted returns over a long period of time. 
The way we're thinking about balance sheet growth overall as a firm which includes -- primarily most of the growth in the balance sheet would come from the bank going forward, is that Tier 1 leverage ratio that Paul mentioned, which we hope to target around a 10% take that ratio down to somewhere around 10% over time. 
Now it could go under 10% if we're just accommodating client cash balances and investing it in -- parking it at the Fed or investing it in treasuries. But on a more normalized basis, I think 10% is a conservative place to be at a holding company overall. 
And so that's how we're thinking about the bank growth. Some of the metrics in the past that we shared with you around percentage of equity and percentage of cash balances, those were metrics that were established when we're primarily a corporate loan bank essentially. 
And so we were -- those metrics were intended to contain the size of the credit exposure to our overall balance sheet. Now that we have agency mortgage-backed securities, and we have securities-based loans and mortgages to Private Client Group clients, some of those metrics aren't as relevant as they were 5 years ago. So that is going to be a part of the discussion that we hope to share more details with you on at our upcoming Analyst Investor Day."

You quoted an M&A figure, which implied about 5% organic growth in the quarter. Slightly below the 6% to 7% you recorded over the last 2.

And I believe we'll continue that. Advisers want to be here. We have great tools, great technology and a great culture that supports them. 
So we just maybe got a little uncompetitive and thought during the pandemic, it didn't make sense. But as we really dug into the economics, we had a lot of room to go up. So we did go up modestly. And I still think there'll be very good returns, and we just -- it's a hard choice for advisers and they come down to 2 places when someone's going to pay them 50% more. 
So we're just going to have to close that gap and still be a good economic return for the firm. So there's always a lag when you do this and when the count comes up, but recruiting isn't bad in the employee channel at all. It's just down from kind of a series of records. We just need to get it back up where it can be. Certainly, where it should be given what we think we offer in our platform. So I'm still very optimistic about it.

But you're -- in general, in that custody type of platform, the return on assets may be a little lower and the margins are higher, but you're calculating it on a different revenue stream. So it's a little bit complex there. 
And traditionally, in that business a lot of it was trading fees, which have gone away and interest spreads, which are hopefully temporary gone away. So the economics in that business with interest spreads are a little more challenged, but I think they're fairly compelling when you get it back. 
Our platform, the competitive part of our platform is that is an RIA custodian not only do we have a firm with an investment-grade background, which makes us a great competitor, but we also can offer kind of full systems, platforms and other firms use third-party platforms. So our goal would be not to allow our platforms to be used for people who want the turnkey as well as integrating third-party platforms and also access to our other services, such as lending and other things that we do through our bank and access to the other help that we give and through our support centers, which I think are much more robust than most RIA platform. 
So I think it's a strong alternative. We've shown growth. We've been in it a while. We just talked about it less. And we've seen both with the market as trading fees have gone away as regulation best interest for some of the larger advisers felt it was just easier to be under the kind of the SEC versus FINRA and some of all the rules and they could take on the compliance and risk of chosen to do that and so I think it's a long-term trend. 
It's been a long-term trend. It's just picking up for certain advisers. And I think we'll be competitive in that platform, too. We just -- we got a lot of growth ahead of us to get us in scale there, but so far, so good."

I do think when we really dug into the economics that even though it was like packages, we thought with this interest rate environment made no sense if you structure them right, we believe you can get a good return and the spreads do come back, they'll be very, very good investments in those recruiting packages. 
So we always kind of modeled our returns to current environment where we were conservative when we had high spreads, assuming they're going back to normal or historical averages. 
In our packages, we were assuming, they just stayed more like where they are now, which I think was probably over punitive. So we're a little behind. We had room to increase it, and we'll do fine and the competitive. It's always been competitive. We've always recruited people that had better, higher offers than other firms, and we've been very successful. 
So will we lose some people because of it? Yes. We just felt that we got a little out of the market in the last couple of quarters. So we'll correct it. There will still be a good return for the firm. And the other channels have been doing fine. We've had it in one channel, but we had this happen in other channels and kind to make adjustments and rebounded. So the business is always competitive. We've never had it -- we've never had an easy road, right? So..."

The spreads now are really tight. I mean we're talking about 50 basis points or so for 3 years of duration. Again, you're getting really paid a lot to take that 3 years of duration. So -- but if you just do the math on that, that's what if rates don't change for the next year or 2, that's where the yield on that portfolio would bottom out, assuming things don't improve in terms of yield for the securities portfolio, which is why we decelerated the growth of that this quarter and plan on the near-term sort of running in place with that portfolio until we see maybe some improvement in those spreads."

It's hard to believe it's been almost a year since the COVID-19 pandemic started here in the U.S. And while there's now light at the end of the tunnel with the vaccine starting to be distributed across the globe, we are still very much in a period of uncertainty and volatility.
As painful as the pandemic has been for everyone, I'm very proud of how Raymond James has performed. Who would have predicted when we lost 40% of our earnings to the rate cuts in March that we would be talking about records today. This is a testament, not only to the resiliency of the U.S. economy but also to Raymond James, our advisers and their associates.
As you can see on Slide 3, our unwavering focus on serving clients resulted in fantastic financial results during the quarter. starting off fiscal 2021 with record quarterly revenues and earnings, driven by strength across our businesses.
In the fiscal first quarter, the firm reported record net revenues of $2.22 billion, which were up 11% over the prior year's fiscal first quarter and 7% over the prior record set in the preceding quarter. Record net income of $312 million or $2.23 per diluted share increased 16% over the prior record of net income set a year ago quarter and 49% over the preceding quarter.
Excluding expenses of $2 million associated with the completed acquisition of NWPS Holdings and the pending acquisition of Financo, adjusted quarterly net income was $314 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share was $2.24, both records. Annualized return on equity for the quarter was 17.2% and return on tangible common equity was 19%, an impressive result, especially in this near-0 rate environment and given our very strong capital position.
Record quarterly results were primarily attributable to higher asset management and related administrative fees, record investment banking revenues, strong fixed income brokerage revenues and disciplined expense management, which were more than offset the negative impact of lower short-term interest rates on the net interest income and RJBDP fees.
The record results and broad-based strengths in our businesses in this near-0 rate interest environment, which included record results for capital markets and asset management segments during the quarter, reinforced the value of our diverse and complementary businesses, sometimes something underappreciated in different market cycles.
Moving to Slide 4. We ended the quarter with records for total client assets under administration of $1.02 trillion, PCG assets and fee-based accounts of $533 billion and financial assets under management of $170 billion.
Client assets crossing the $1 trillion mark for the first time is a testament to the consistent growth that we've achieved by focusing on retaining our existing advisers while also recruiting high-quality financial advisers. And when you step back, this is quite an achievement. In December of 2010, we had around $260 billion of client assets. So we have experienced around a 15% compounded annual growth and essentially quadrupled client assets over a 10-year period, and the vast majority of that was organic growth.
We ended the quarter with 8,233 financial advisers, a net increase of 173 over the prior year, but a slight net decrease of 6 sequentially. A flat adviser count is not unusual for this quarter as we typically see an elevated number of retirements at the year-end, where assets are typically retained at Raymond James by their successor.
We are still optimistic about all of our recruiting pipelines across our affiliation options, but there are a few trends we are seeing in the industry. On the independent side of the business, we continue to experience strong recruiting activity, and we're seeing more interest from both external and internal advisers in the RIA custody affiliation option, particularly for much larger teams who have the scale and appetite to assume the regulatory and supervision responsibilities and risks.
We have been beneficiaries of this trend and our rebranded RIA & Custody Services division, or RCS. And we believe we'll continue to benefit from the trend, given major consolidation and disruption in the RIA custody industry. However, it's important to note that when an RIA affiliates with RCS, whether it be an internal transfer from our other affiliation option or external additions, we do not count the advisers of the RIA firms in our adviser count, but their assets are still included in client assets under administration.
On the employee side, there has been a modest slowdown in recruiting due to the challenges brought on by COVID and also increased competition for experienced advisers where even our regional competitors have significantly increased their recruiting packages. In response to what we have seen, we have also enhanced our recruiting packages to be more competitive, while also ensuring attractive returns to our shareholders.
Also impacting adviser count this year, we temporarily decreased the size of our new adviser training class this year by about 35 trainees, allowing us to dedicate more time and attention to newer advisers as they seek to overcome the challenges presented by this current virtual environment. While this will negatively impact the growth in adviser count when compared to prior years when the training class was larger, it really shouldn't have a significant impact on client assets.
We believe our recruiting will continue to thrive as advisers are attracted to our supportive culture and client-first values. Looking at recruiting results over the prior 4 quarters, financial advisers with nearly $270 million of trailing 12 production and nearly $40 billion of assets at their prior firms affiliated with Raymond James domestically.
As for our net organic growth results in the Private Client Group, we generated domestic PCG net new assets of $42 billion over the 4 quarters ending in December 31, 2020, representing more than 5% of domestic PCG client assets at the beginning of the period. And remember, this is net of client fees.
We are very pleased with our consistent organic growth, especially given the disruption associated with the COVID-19 pandemic during the year. And as you know, we did not benefit from the surge in self-directed online business during the year.
Moving to segment results on Slide 5. The Private Client Group generated quarterly net revenues of $1.47 billion and pretax income of $140 million. Quarterly net revenues grew 5% over the preceding quarter, predominantly driven by higher asset management and related administrative fees, reflecting higher assets in fee-based accounts, which will continue to be a tailwind in the second quarter. This strong revenue growth helped PCG's pretax income grow 12% sequentially, although it's still down 8% on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to the negative impact of lower short-term interest rates.
Capital Markets segment generated record quarterly net revenues of $452 million and pretax income of $129 million, an extraordinary result, a strong quarter for the segment, driven by broad-based strength across global equities and investment banking as well as fixed income. During the quarter, record investment banking revenues were driven by record M&A revenues, along with continued strength in debt and equity underwriting.
Fixed income brokerage revenues were strong as client activity levels remained robust. While we certainly would caution you against annualizing the record results of Capital Markets segment this quarter, I do think the results reflect the significant investments we have made to strengthen our platform over the last 10 years. And we are continuing to make those investments, as I will discuss shortly.
The Asset Management segment generated record net revenues of $195 million and pretax income of $83 million. Record results were driven by the growth of financial assets under management as equity market appreciation and the net inflows into PCG fee-based accounts more than offset the modest net outflows for Carillon Tower Advisers.
Lastly, Raymond James Bank generated quarterly net revenues of $167 million and pretax income of $71 million. Compared to a year ago quarter, net revenues declined primarily due to the impact of lower short-term interest rates on net interest income. Sequentially, quarterly net revenues grew 4%, as higher asset balances more than offset the 7 basis point decline in the bank's net interest margin in the quarter, which was primarily attributable to the growth in the agency MBS portfolio.
The credit quality of the bank's portfolio remains healthy, with most trends continuing to improve. Nonperforming assets remained low at 9 basis points of total assets and the amount of criticized loans declined 4% during the quarter. The quarterly bank loan provision for credit losses of $14 million declined sequentially and was driven mostly by macroeconomic model inputs, now under the CECL methodology, which Paul Shoukry will cover in more detail.
Moving to Slide 6. As you've heard me say many times, we remain focused on long-term growth and are committed to deploying excess capital to generate attractive returns to our shareholders. Good example of that commitment are the 2 acquisitions we announced during the quarter. The first, which closed in late December, is NWPS. NWPS is a provider of retirement plan administration, consulting, actuarial and administrative services based in Seattle, Washington.
The addition of NWPS allows Raymond James to expand our retirement services offerings, including retirement plan administration services to advisers and clients. Many of our advisers serve clients with small businesses, and offering this retirement solution is another attractive way to help advisers develop deeper and stronger relationship with our clients.
The second pending acquisition, Financo, is a consumer-focused M&A advisory firm, which allows us to strategically grow our capabilities in an attractive vertical with industry-leading team. We anticipate this transaction to close in the March or April time frame. Both of these firms represent great cultural and strategic fits, and we're excited about welcoming them to the Raymond James family.
While we are not going to discuss the terms of these 2 transactions, in total, over time, these 2 acquisitions represent consideration, retention and earn-out potential to the sellers of approximately $320 million. So it is a meaningful and attractive use of cash and capital. We will continue to actively pursue additional acquisitions that are both the cultural and strategic fit.
And now for a more detailed review of the financial results, I'm going to turn this over to Paul Shoukry. Paul?"

I'll begin with consolidated revenues on Slide 8. Record quarterly net revenues of $2.22 billion grew 11% and year-over-year and 7% sequentially.

Record quarterly net revenues of $2.22 billion grew 11% and year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Asset management fees grew 12% on a year-over-year basis and 6% sequentially, commensurate with the growth of fee-based assets. Private Client Group assets and fee-based accounts were up 12% during the fiscal first quarter, which will provide a tailwind for this line item for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. However, given fewer billable days in the March quarter, I would expect asset management fees in PCG to increase about 10% sequentially.
Consolidated brokerage revenues of $528 million grew 15% over the prior year and represented a record. These revenues are inherently difficult to predict, but our clients are still engaged in both the Private Client Group and Capital Markets segments, given the current market and interest rate environment.
Account service fees of $145 million declined 19% year-over-year, almost entirely due to the decrease in RJBDP fees from third-party banks due to lower short-term interest rates, which I will discuss along with net interest income in more detail on the next 2 slides.
Consolidated investment banking revenues of $261 million grew 85% year-over-year and 18% sequentially, achieving a record result, driven by record M&A advisory revenues and strong debt and equity underwriting. Based on the pipeline and activity levels, we anticipate second quarter to be healthy, but not as strong as a remarkable result achieved in the first quarter.
As you all know, these revenues are very difficult to predict. But for the rest of the fiscal year, we would be very pleased to achieve the pace of the average quarterly investment banking revenues from the annual record we set in fiscal 2020, which would be roughly $160 million to $165 million per quarter on average.
Turning to other revenues, which were $56 million for the quarter. This line included $24 million of private equity valuation gains during the quarter, of which approximately $10 million were attributable to noncontrolling interest reflected in other expenses.
Moving to Slide 9. Clients' domestic cash sweep balances ended the quarter at a record $61.6 billion, increasing 11% sequentially and representing 6.7% of domestic PCG client assets. As we continue to experience growing cash balances and less demand from third-party banks, more client cash is being held in the client interest program at the broker dealer. You can see those balances grew to $8.8 billion, and most of that growth has been used to purchase short-term treasuries to meet the associated reserve requirement. Over time, that cash could be redeployed to our bank or third-party banks as capacity becomes available, which would hopefully earn a higher spread than we currently earn on short-term treasuries.
On Slide 10, the top chart displays our firm-wide net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks on a combined basis. Related, based on your feedback, we have updated our net interest table in the earnings release to incorporate all of the firm's interest-earning assets and liabilities instead of those balances for just Raymond James Bank. We hope you find this update helpful. And as always, we thank you for your suggestions to continue enhancing our disclosures.
As you can see on Slide 10, while lower rates have put significant pressure on these revenues since the Fed rate cuts in March 2020, we did experience a slight uptick in these revenues sequentially, helped by the aforementioned growth in client cash balances and higher asset balances at Raymond James Bank, which more than offset the sequential NIM compression you see on the bottom left portion of this slide.
Given prepayment speeds of higher-yielding securities and mortgages, we would expect the bank's NIM to decline another 10 basis points or so throughout the year. However, we are hoping that growth in the bank's earning assets will more than offset the NIM compression and result in continued growth of the firm's net interest income. I will provide a bit more color on the bank's balance sheet growth in a few slides.
Moving to consolidated expenses on Slide 11. First, compensation expense, which is by far our largest expense, the compensation ratio decreased sequentially from 68.1% to 67.5% during the quarter, primarily due to record revenues in the Capital Markets segment, which had a 56% compensation ratio during the quarter and the benefit from the private equity valuation gain, which doesn't have direct compensation associated with it.
As we said last quarter, given the near-0 short-term interest rates and the successful implementation of the expense initiative we announced last quarter, we are confident we can maintain a compensation ratio of 70% or better, which we still believe is an appropriate target. And as we experienced this quarter, very strong Capital Markets results in any particular quarter could result in a compensation ratio below 70%.
Non-compensation expenses of $323 million increased $24 million or 8% compared to last year's first quarter and almost all of that increase could be explained by the $14 million bank loan provision for credit losses compared to the $2 million benefit in the year-ago period and $13 million of noncontrolling interest in other expenses, most of which offsets a portion of the $24 million private equity valuation gain reflected in other revenues. As we explained and as you can see in these results, we have been very focused on the disciplined management of all compensation and noncompensation-related expenses, while still investing in growth and ensuring high service levels for advisers and their clients.
Slide 12 shows the pretax margin trend over the past 5 quarters. Pretax margin was 18% in the fiscal first quarter of 2021, which was boosted by the record Capital Markets results as that segment generated a record 29% pretax margin. Last quarter, we talked about generating a 14% to 15% pretax margin on a consolidated basis in this near-0 interest rate environment, which, again, we believe is still a reasonable target. But as we experienced this quarter, there's upside to the margins when the Capital Markets results are so strong.
On Slide 13, at the end of fiscal first quarter, total assets were approximately $53.7 billion, a 13% sequential increase, reflecting the dynamic I explained earlier with growth in client cash balances and associated reserves at the broker dealer. This growth of client cash balances on the balance sheet caused our Tier 1 leverage ratio to decrease to 12.9%, which is still well above the regulatory requirement. Liquidity remained very strong with $1.8 billion of cash at the parent, leaving us with plenty of flexibility to be both defensive and opportunistic.
Slide 14 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past 5 quarters. In December, in addition to increasing the quarterly dividend 5% to $0.39 per share, the Board of Directors authorized share repurchases of up to $750 million, which replaced the previous authorization. And $740 million remains available under the new authorization.
In the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 108,000 shares for $10 million, an average price of approximately $92.80 per share. This fell short of our $50 million quarterly target, which we plan on making up for in the subsequent quarters as we are committed to repurchasing at least $200 million to offset share-based compensation dilution during the fiscal year.
One thing many of you have asked us to be more explicit on is our plans for deploying capital, which is something we hope to discuss with you in much more detail at our Analyst Investor Day, tentatively planned to be held virtually in May. But at a high level, what I would share with you now is that our goal is to manage down the firm's Tier 1 leverage ratio closer to 10% over time through a combination of balance sheet growth, primarily at the bank as well as more deliberate deployment of capital through a combination of organic growth, acquisitions and share repurchases.
We are not ready to share a specific time line to achieve this objective and doing so in the middle of a pandemic is probably not the best time to do so, but I want to be clear that we are fully committed to managing our capital levels, balancing our objectives of optimizing returns to shareholders while ensuring a significant balance sheet flexibility and conservatism.
On the next 2 slides, we provide additional detail on the bank's loan portfolio, starting on Slide 15, with some detail on Raymond James Bank's asset composition. In the pie chart, you can see we broke out CRE and REIT loans into separate categories with the implementation of CECL this quarter. The only other thing I would point out on this slide is we have a very well diversified balance sheet at the bank.
The bank's total assets grew 3% sequentially, led by 4% growth in the bank's loan portfolio, about 60% of which was attributable to securities-based loans to Private Client Group clients. We have decelerated the growth of the securities portfolio at the bank and will likely continue to do so over the near term as spreads for agency mortgage-backed securities have gotten extremely tight. Meanwhile, we have resumed growth in certain sectors in the corporate loan portfolio that we believe are less directly exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Lastly, on Slide 16, we provide key credit metrics for Raymond James Bank. First, let me briefly discuss CECL. We implemented CECL on October 1, which increased our allowances by approximately $45 million, with the majority of that increase attributable to recruiting and retention-related loans to financial advisers in the Private Client Group segment, which now require a larger allowance under CECL than under the incurred loss method. About $10 million of that day 1 impact was related to outstanding bank loans. And remember, all $45 million hit the balance sheet directly and did not go through the P&L.
We had no charge-offs in the quarter. The quarterly bank loan provision for credit losses was $14 million, largely attributable to the macroeconomic model inputs we use from a third party vendor, which assumed a greater decline in commercial real estate prices in the near term with a longer recovery period, resulting in higher allowances for the CRE portfolio from 3.25% to 4.2% at the end of the quarter.
The bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percent of total loans ended the quarter at 1.71%. So we believe we are adequately reserved, but that could change rapidly if economic conditions deteriorate. But currently, we are pleased with the credit quality and the positive trends we are seeing with the loan portfolio and the broader economy.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Paul Reilly to discuss our outlook. Paul?"

As for our outlook, we remain well positioned entering the second fiscal quarter with the strong capital ratios and record client assets. However, we'll continue to face headwinds from a full year of lower short-term interest rates, and there's still a high degree of uncertainty given the COVID-19 pandemic and the rollout of the vaccine and a new administration.
In the Private Client Group segment, while recruiting environment is extremely competitive, and we face some challenges in a largely virtual environment, our adviser recruiting pipeline is strong across all of our affiliation options, and this segment is going to benefit by starting the fiscal second quarter with strong sequential growth in fee-based accounts. Private Client Group fee-based assets were up 12%, which should be a good tailwind and result in a 10% increase in the associated revenues.
In the Capital Markets segment, there is still a significant amount of economic uncertainty due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, the investment banking pipeline is currently strong, and we expect fixed income brokerage results to remain elevated given the current interest rate and economic conditions.
In the Asset Management segment, results will be positively impacted by the 11% increase in assets under management, but those assets are built throughout the quarter.
At Raymond James Bank, we should continue to benefit from the attractive growth of securities-based loans and mortgages to PCG clients. And as we decelerate the growth of the securities portfolio, we are cautiously adding to corporate loans in the less COVID-impacted sectors.
We continue to focus on long-term growth, and our priorities remain unchanged. Our top priority is serving clients, and we're focused on organic growth, which is primarily driven by retaining and recruiting advisers in the Private Client Group. Additionally, we're continuing to add senior talent in our other businesses, such as investment banking.
As you observed this quarter, we will continue to actively pursue acquisitions. But we are still focused on being and only pursuing transactions that have a great cultural and strategic fit and at prices that can deliver attractive returns to our shareholders.
We started fiscal 2021 with very strong results, and I believe we are well positioned to drive profitable growth in the coming quarters across all of our businesses. But we are also fully aware that we are still in the middle of a global health pandemic, and we should all be prepared for much more economic turbulence and market volatility over the next several months.

Obviously, you guys have been alluding to some increased competition in recent months. So I just want to dig in a little bit because it seems like over time, recruiting competition kind of ebbs and flows. And so I'm kind of curious what do you think is driving that right now?
And I guess, I just want to make sure that I understand the full message here. I guess, my takeaway is that independent adviser recruiting is still very strong, and that's the expectation on the employee side. Pricing has become more competitive, but it sounds like Raymond James will be -- or already is increasing kind of pricing competitiveness.
So should we expect that the recruiting on the employee side will remain active, but just they cost a bit more? Or I guess, want to make sure taking the right takeaway here?"

And certainly, on the employee side as people [ have opt ] the transition assistance to be more trying to grow their private client group businesses we did. And that gap just got bigger and bigger and bigger where I think that people even wanting to join just said the economic gap was too big.
And as we really analyzed it, that if we can get by upping -- we don't have to match. We've proven that over history. But being more competitive because of the environment, what we offer advisers, we can get a good return now. And if interest rate spreads gap out again in the future, those recruiting deals from our standpoint will even be better. So we've got more aggressive. Yes, there's a little bit of lag, but we think we can get it going.
We did cut the adviser class going in on a cost cut and then during the pandemic and as we ramp back up the training, which we expect to once we get out of -- as we're kind of exiting the total virtual environment that will help also.
So again, last year, we had good recruiting stats that quarter, but it isn't unusual. If you go back to the year before that it was flattish. I think we were up too in a record recruiting year. So we'll get it back on track, and maybe we're a little slow to act.
But recruiting overall has been good. And then we're going to have to figure out how to give you better numbers. Because people are in the RIA channel, we don't count them at all. And so you're not really seeing overall recruiting, although they are in the asset number. So we're going to work on how to give you a better metric on that, too. So you can compare it more apples-to-apples as channels may shift over time."

And we have, as you can see with the cash at third-party banks and now in CIP at the broker dealer, we have a lot of funding capacity and plenty of capital capacity to grow the bank. So the biggest constraint now is just finding assets with good risk-adjusted returns over a long period of time.
The way we're thinking about balance sheet growth overall as a firm which includes -- primarily most of the growth in the balance sheet would come from the bank going forward, is that Tier 1 leverage ratio that Paul mentioned, which we hope to target around a 10% take that ratio down to somewhere around 10% over time.
Now it could go under 10% if we're just accommodating client cash balances and investing it in -- parking it at the Fed or investing it in treasuries. But on a more normalized basis, I think 10% is a conservative place to be at as a holding company overall. And so that's how we're thinking about the bank growth. Some of the metrics in the past that we shared with you around percentage of equity and percentage of cash balances, those were metrics that were established when we're primarily a corporate loan bank essentially.
And so we were -- those metrics were intended to contain the size of the credit exposure to our overall balance sheet. Now that we have agency mortgage-backed securities, and we have securities-based loans and mortgages to Private Client Group clients, some of those metrics aren't as relevant as they were 5 years ago. So that is going to be a part of the discussion that we hope to share more details with you on at our upcoming Analyst Investor Day."

I appreciate the nuance commentary around the recruiting backdrop and some of the color around the different channels and what you're seeing.
You quoted an NNA figure, which implied about 5% organic growth in the quarter. Slightly below the 6% to 7% you recorded over the last 2. And as you look ahead, just given the heightened competition within the employee channel, what pace of NNA growth are you comfortable underwriting or we should be contemplating at least in the near to intermediate term, given some of the competitive dynamics that you cited?"

We've had quarters where this has happened where recruiting trailed off in different channels and we've adjusted, and we've been right back as kind of a benchmark for recruiting across our channels. And I believe we'll continue that.
Advisers want to be here. We have great tools, great technology and a great culture that supports them. So we just maybe got a little uncompetitive and thought during the pandemic, it didn't make sense.
But as we really dug into the economics, we had a lot of room to go up. So we did go up modestly. And I still think there'll be very good returns, and we just -- it's a hard choice for advisers when they come down to 2 places when someone's going to pay them 50% more. So we're just going to have to close that gap and still be a good economic return for the firm.
So there's always a lag between when you do this and when the count comes up, but recruiting isn't bad in the employee channel at all. It's just down from kind of a series of records. We just need to get it back up where it can be, certainly where it should be, given what we think we offer on our platform. So I'm still very optimistic about it. It's been robust in all the other channels. And we've had channels go up and down before for a quarter or 2, and we've always rebounded.

And we plan, again, on Investor Day to try to get better metrics because we aren't disclosing all of that at current. But you're -- in general, in that custody type of platform, the return on assets may be a little lower and the margins are higher, but you're calculating it on a different revenue stream. So it's a little bit complex there.
And traditionally, in that business, a lot of it was trading fees, which have gone away and interest spreads, which are hopefully temporary gone away. So the economics in that business with interest spreads are a little more challenged, but I think they're fairly compelling when you get it back.
Our platform, the competitive part of our platform is that is an RIA custodian not only do we have a firm with an investment-grade background, which makes us a great competitor, but we also can offer kind of full systems, platforms and other firms use third-party platforms. So our goal would be not to allow our platforms to be used for people want the turnkey as well as integrating third-party platforms and also access to our other services, such as lending and other things that we do through our bank and access to the other help that we give and through our support centers, which I think are much more robust than most RIA platform.
So I think it's a strong alternative. We've shown growth. We've been in it a while. We just talked about it less. And we've seen both with the market as trading fees have gone away as regulation best interest for some of the larger advisers felt it was just easier to be under the kind of the SEC versus FINRA and some of all the rules and they could take on the compliance and risk of chosen to do that and so I think it's a long-term trend.
It's been a long-term trend. It's just picking up for certain advisers. And I think we'll be competitive in that platform, too. We just -- we got a lot of growth ahead of us to get us in scale there, but so far, so good."

So we'll see how business travel recovers as we progress throughout the calendar year. But overall, we're really focused, as you can tell, on managing all of the noncomp line items.
Some of them grow naturally with business growth. Subadvisory fees grow with fee-based assets in PCG, for example, and those were up 12% sequentially. So you're going to see some natural growth. But the ones that are controllable are ones that we're really focused on managing."

So it's gotten a little more broad based as some of the regional firms have joined into the fray. So it's a little more competitive in that area.
I do think when we really dug into the economics that even though it was like packages, we thought with this interest rate environment made no sense. If you structure them right, we believe you can get a good return and the spreads do come back, they'll be very, very good investments in those recruiting packages. So we always kind of modeled our returns to current environment where we were conservative when we had high spreads, assuming they're going back to normal or historical averages.
In our packages, we were assuming, they just stayed more like where they are now, which I think was probably over punitive. So we're a little behind. We had room to increase it, and we'll do fine. And the competitive -- it's always been competitive. We've always recruited people that had better, higher offers than other firms, and we've been very successful.
So will we lose some people because of it? Yes. We just felt that we got a little out of the market in the last couple of quarters. So we'll correct it.

And with this, the NIM compression in those 2 categories. As Paul said earlier, we're also focused on opportunistically growing the corporate loan portfolio. So I think our focus is growing net interest income through asset growth to offset the NIM compression going forward. That's kind of the way we're thinking about the bank's balance sheet."

We continue to talk to folks. And without the cultural fit or some of the deal prices, we've walked from some things. I mean these aren't the only 2 deals we've looked at.
And the third area that I think we're spending more focus on are things like our plan administrator who is taking businesses we do today and helping to monetize them and give great service to our clients and advisers.

We've done that now within WPS, and we plan to keep looking at areas like that, that use technology and service and practices that both create a service and a value to clients and value to us.

It's hard to believe it's been almost a year since the COVID-19 pandemic started here in the U.S. And while there's now light at the end of the tunnel with the vaccine starting to be distributed across the globe, we are still very much in a period of uncertainty and volatility.
As painful as the pandemic has been for everyone, I'm very proud of how Raymond James has performed. Who would have predicted when we lost 40% of our earnings to the rate cuts in March that we would be talking about records today. This is a testament, not only to the resiliency of the U.S. economy but also to Raymond James, our advisers and their associates.
As you can see on Slide 3, our unwavering focus on serving clients resulted in fantastic financial results during the quarter. starting off fiscal 2021 with record quarterly revenues and earnings, driven by strength across our businesses.
In the fiscal first quarter, the firm reported record net revenues of $2.22 billion, which were up 11% over the prior year's fiscal first quarter and 7% over the prior record set in the preceding quarter. Record net income of $312 million or $2.23 per diluted share increased 16% over the prior record of net income set a year ago quarter and 49% over the preceding quarter.
Excluding expenses of $2 million associated with the completed acquisition of NWPS Holdings and the pending acquisition of Financo, adjusted quarterly net income was $314 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share was $2.24, both records. Annualized return on equity for the quarter was 17.2% and return on tangible common equity was 19%, an impressive result, especially in this near-0 rate environment and given our very strong capital position.
Record quarterly results were primarily attributable to higher asset management and related administrative fees, record investment banking revenues, strong fixed income brokerage revenues and disciplined expense management, which were more than offset the negative impact of lower short-term interest rates on the net interest income and RJBDP fees.
The record results and broad-based strengths in our businesses in this near-0 rate interest environment, which included record results for capital markets and asset management segments during the quarter, reinforced the value of our diverse and complementary businesses, sometimes something underappreciated in different market cycles.
Moving to Slide 4. We ended the quarter with records for total client assets under administration of $1.02 trillion, PCG assets and fee-based accounts of $533 billion and financial assets under management of $170 billion.
Client assets crossing the $1 trillion mark for the first time is a testament to the consistent growth that we've achieved by focusing on retaining our existing advisers while also recruiting high-quality financial advisers. And when you step back, this is quite an achievement. In December of 2010, we had around $260 billion of client assets. So we have experienced around a 15% compounded annual growth and essentially quadrupled client assets over a 10-year period, and the vast majority of that was organic growth.
We ended the quarter with 8,233 financial advisers, a net increase of 173 over the prior year, but a slight net decrease of 6 sequentially. A flat adviser count is not unusual for this quarter as we typically see an elevated number of retirements at the year-end, where assets are typically retained at Raymond James by their successor.
We are still optimistic about all of our recruiting pipelines across our affiliation options, but there are a few trends we are seeing in the industry. On the independent side of the business, we continue to experience strong recruiting activity, and we're seeing more interest from both external and internal advisers in the RIA custody affiliation option, particularly for much larger teams who have the scale and appetite to assume the regulatory and supervision responsibilities and risks.
We have been beneficiaries of this trend and our rebranded RIA & Custody Services division, or RCS. And we believe we'll continue to benefit from the trend, given major consolidation and disruption in the RIA custody industry. However, it's important to note that when an RIA affiliates with RCS, whether it be an internal transfer from our other affiliation option or external additions, we do not count the advisers of the RIA firms in our adviser count, but their assets are still included in client assets under administration.
On the employee side, there has been a modest slowdown in recruiting due to the challenges brought on by COVID and also increased competition for experienced advisers where even our regional competitors have significantly increased their recruiting packages. In response to what we have seen, we have also enhanced our recruiting packages to be more competitive, while also ensuring attractive returns to our shareholders.
Also impacting adviser count this year, we temporarily decreased the size of our new adviser training class this year by about 35 trainees, allowing us to dedicate more time and attention to newer advisers as they seek to overcome the challenges presented by this current virtual environment. While this will negatively impact the growth in adviser count when compared to prior years when the training class was larger, it really shouldn't have a significant impact on client assets.
We believe our recruiting will continue to thrive as advisers are attracted to our supportive culture and client-first values. Looking at recruiting results over the prior 4 quarters, financial advisers with nearly $270 million of trailing 12 production and nearly $40 billion of assets at their prior firms affiliated with Raymond James domestically.
As for our net organic growth results in the Private Client Group, we generated domestic PCG net new assets of $42 billion over the 4 quarters ending in December 31, 2020, representing more than 5% of domestic PCG client assets at the beginning of the period. And remember, this is net of client fees.
We are very pleased with our consistent organic growth, especially given the disruption associated with the COVID-19 pandemic during the year. And as you know, we did not benefit from the surge in self-directed online business during the year.
Moving to segment results on Slide 5. The Private Client Group generated quarterly net revenues of $1.47 billion and pretax income of $140 million. Quarterly net revenues grew 5% over the preceding quarter, predominantly driven by higher asset management and related administrative fees, reflecting higher assets in fee-based accounts, which will continue to be a tailwind in the second quarter. This strong revenue growth helped PCG's pretax income grow 12% sequentially, although it's still down 8% on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to the negative impact of lower short-term interest rates.
Capital Markets segment generated record quarterly net revenues of $452 million and pretax income of $129 million, an extraordinary result, a strong quarter for the segment, driven by broad-based strength across global equities and investment banking as well as fixed income. During the quarter, record investment banking revenues were driven by record M&A revenues, along with continued strength in debt and equity underwriting.
Fixed income brokerage revenues were strong as client activity levels remained robust. While we certainly would caution you against annualizing the record results of Capital Markets segment this quarter, I do think the results reflect the significant investments we have made to strengthen our platform over the last 10 years. And we are continuing to make those investments, as I will discuss shortly.
The Asset Management segment generated record net revenues of $195 million and pretax income of $83 million. Record results were driven by the growth of financial assets under management as equity market appreciation and the net inflows into PCG fee-based accounts more than offset the modest net outflows for Carillon Tower Advisers.
Lastly, Raymond James Bank generated quarterly net revenues of $167 million and pretax income of $71 million. Compared to a year ago quarter, net revenues declined primarily due to the impact of lower short-term interest rates on net interest income. Sequentially, quarterly net revenues grew 4%, as higher asset balances more than offset the 7 basis point decline in the bank's net interest margin in the quarter, which was primarily attributable to the growth in the agency MBS portfolio.
The credit quality of the bank's portfolio remains healthy, with most trends continuing to improve. Nonperforming assets remained low at 9 basis points of total assets and the amount of criticized loans declined 4% during the quarter. The quarterly bank loan provision for credit losses of $14 million declined sequentially and was driven mostly by macroeconomic model inputs, now under the CECL methodology, which Paul Shoukry will cover in more detail.
Moving to Slide 6. As you've heard me say many times, we remain focused on long-term growth and are committed to deploying excess capital to generate attractive returns to our shareholders. Good example of that commitment are the 2 acquisitions we announced during the quarter. The first, which closed in late December, is NWPS. NWPS is a provider of retirement plan administration, consulting, actuarial and administrative services based in Seattle, Washington.
The addition of NWPS allows Raymond James to expand our retirement services offerings, including retirement plan administration services to advisers and clients. Many of our advisers serve clients with small businesses, and offering this retirement solution is another attractive way to help advisers develop deeper and stronger relationship with our clients.
The second pending acquisition, Financo, is a consumer-focused M&A advisory firm, which allows us to strategically grow our capabilities in an attractive vertical with industry-leading team. We anticipate this transaction to close in the March or April time frame. Both of these firms represent great cultural and strategic fits, and we're excited about welcoming them to the Raymond James family.
While we are not going to discuss the terms of these 2 transactions, in total, over time, these 2 acquisitions represent consideration, retention and earn-out potential to the sellers of approximately $320 million. So it is a meaningful and attractive use of cash and capital. We will continue to actively pursue additional acquisitions that are both the cultural and strategic fit.
And now for a more detailed review of the financial results, I'm going to turn this over to Paul Shoukry. Paul?"

Record quarterly net revenues of $2.22 billion grew 11% and year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Asset management fees grew 12% on a year-over-year basis and 6% sequentially, commensurate with the growth of fee-based assets. Private Client Group assets and fee-based accounts were up 12% during the fiscal first quarter, which will provide a tailwind for this line item for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. However, given fewer billable days in the March quarter, I would expect asset management fees in PCG to increase about 10% sequentially.
Consolidated brokerage revenues of $528 million grew 15% over the prior year and represented a record. These revenues are inherently difficult to predict, but our clients are still engaged in both the Private Client Group and Capital Markets segments, given the current market and interest rate environment.
Account service fees of $145 million declined 19% year-over-year, almost entirely due to the decrease in RJBDP fees from third-party banks due to lower short-term interest rates, which I will discuss along with net interest income in more detail on the next 2 slides.
Consolidated investment banking revenues of $261 million grew 85% year-over-year and 18% sequentially, achieving a record result, driven by record M&A advisory revenues and strong debt and equity underwriting. Based on the pipeline and activity levels, we anticipate second quarter to be healthy, but not as strong as a remarkable result achieved in the first quarter.
As you all know, these revenues are very difficult to predict. But for the rest of the fiscal year, we would be very pleased to achieve the pace of the average quarterly investment banking revenues from the annual record we set in fiscal 2020, which would be roughly $160 million to $165 million per quarter on average.
Turning to other revenues, which were $56 million for the quarter. This line included $24 million of private equity valuation gains during the quarter, of which approximately $10 million were attributable to noncontrolling interest reflected in other expenses.
Moving to Slide 9. Clients' domestic cash sweep balances ended the quarter at a record $61.6 billion, increasing 11% sequentially and representing 6.7% of domestic PCG client assets. As we continue to experience growing cash balances and less demand from third-party banks, more client cash is being held in the client interest program at the broker dealer. You can see those balances grew to $8.8 billion, and most of that growth has been used to purchase short-term treasuries to meet the associated reserve requirement. Over time, that cash could be redeployed to our bank or third-party banks as capacity becomes available, which would hopefully earn a higher spread than we currently earn on short-term treasuries.
On Slide 10, the top chart displays our firm-wide net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks on a combined basis. Related, based on your feedback, we have updated our net interest table in the earnings release to incorporate all of the firm's interest-earning assets and liabilities instead of those balances for just Raymond James Bank. We hope you find this update helpful. And as always, we thank you for your suggestions to continue enhancing our disclosures.
As you can see on Slide 10, while lower rates have put significant pressure on these revenues since the Fed rate cuts in March 2020, we did experience a slight uptick in these revenues sequentially, helped by the aforementioned growth in client cash balances and higher asset balances at Raymond James Bank, which more than offset the sequential NIM compression you see on the bottom left portion of this slide.
Given prepayment speeds of higher-yielding securities and mortgages, we would expect the bank's NIM to decline another 10 basis points or so throughout the year. However, we are hoping that growth in the bank's earning assets will more than offset the NIM compression and result in continued growth of the firm's net interest income. I will provide a bit more color on the bank's balance sheet growth in a few slides.
Moving to consolidated expenses on Slide 11. First, compensation expense, which is by far our largest expense, the compensation ratio decreased sequentially from 68.1% to 67.5% during the quarter, primarily due to record revenues in the Capital Markets segment, which had a 56% compensation ratio during the quarter and the benefit from the private equity valuation gain, which doesn't have direct compensation associated with it.
As we said last quarter, given the near-0 short-term interest rates and the successful implementation of the expense initiative we announced last quarter, we are confident we can maintain a compensation ratio of 70% or better, which we still believe is an appropriate target. And as we experienced this quarter, very strong Capital Markets results in any particular quarter could result in a compensation ratio below 70%.
Non-compensation expenses of $323 million increased $24 million or 8% compared to last year's first quarter and almost all of that increase could be explained by the $14 million bank loan provision for credit losses compared to the $2 million benefit in the year-ago period and $13 million of noncontrolling interest in other expenses, most of which offsets a portion of the $24 million private equity valuation gain reflected in other revenues. As we explained and as you can see in these results, we have been very focused on the disciplined management of all compensation and noncompensation-related expenses, while still investing in growth and ensuring high service levels for advisers and their clients.
Slide 12 shows the pretax margin trend over the past 5 quarters. Pretax margin was 18% in the fiscal first quarter of 2021, which was boosted by the record Capital Markets results as that segment generated a record 29% pretax margin. Last quarter, we talked about generating a 14% to 15% pretax margin on a consolidated basis in this near-0 interest rate environment, which, again, we believe is still a reasonable target. But as we experienced this quarter, there's upside to the margins when the Capital Markets results are so strong.
On Slide 13, at the end of fiscal first quarter, total assets were approximately $53.7 billion, a 13% sequential increase, reflecting the dynamic I explained earlier with growth in client cash balances and associated reserves at the broker dealer. This growth of client cash balances on the balance sheet caused our Tier 1 leverage ratio to decrease to 12.9%, which is still well above the regulatory requirement. Liquidity remained very strong with $1.8 billion of cash at the parent, leaving us with plenty of flexibility to be both defensive and opportunistic.
Slide 14 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past 5 quarters. In December, in addition to increasing the quarterly dividend 5% to $0.39 per share, the Board of Directors authorized share repurchases of up to $750 million, which replaced the previous authorization. And $740 million remains available under the new authorization.
In the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 108,000 shares for $10 million, an average price of approximately $92.80 per share. This fell short of our $50 million quarterly target, which we plan on making up for in the subsequent quarters as we are committed to repurchasing at least $200 million to offset share-based compensation dilution during the fiscal year.
One thing many of you have asked us to be more explicit on is our plans for deploying capital, which is something we hope to discuss with you in much more detail at our Analyst Investor Day, tentatively planned to be held virtually in May. But at a high level, what I would share with you now is that our goal is to manage down the firm's Tier 1 leverage ratio closer to 10% over time through a combination of balance sheet growth, primarily at the bank as well as more deliberate deployment of capital through a combination of organic growth, acquisitions and share repurchases.
We are not ready to share a specific time line to achieve this objective and doing so in the middle of a pandemic is probably not the best time to do so, but I want to be clear that we are fully committed to managing our capital levels, balancing our objectives of optimizing returns to shareholders while ensuring a significant balance sheet flexibility and conservatism.
On the next 2 slides, we provide additional detail on the bank's loan portfolio, starting on Slide 15, with some detail on Raymond James Bank's asset composition. In the pie chart, you can see we broke out CRE and REIT loans into separate categories with the implementation of CECL this quarter. The only other thing I would point out on this slide is we have a very well diversified balance sheet at the bank.
The bank's total assets grew 3% sequentially, led by 4% growth in the bank's loan portfolio, about 60% of which was attributable to securities-based loans to Private Client Group clients. We have decelerated the growth of the securities portfolio at the bank and will likely continue to do so over the near term as spreads for agency mortgage-backed securities have gotten extremely tight. Meanwhile, we have resumed growth in certain sectors in the corporate loan portfolio that we believe are less directly exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Lastly, on Slide 16, we provide key credit metrics for Raymond James Bank. First, let me briefly discuss CECL. We implemented CECL on October 1, which increased our allowances by approximately $45 million, with the majority of that increase attributable to recruiting and retention-related loans to financial advisers in the Private Client Group segment, which now require a larger allowance under CECL than under the incurred loss method. About $10 million of that day 1 impact was related to outstanding bank loans. And remember, all $45 million hit the balance sheet directly and did not go through the P&L.
We had no charge-offs in the quarter. The quarterly bank loan provision for credit losses was $14 million, largely attributable to the macroeconomic model inputs we use from a third party vendor, which assumed a greater decline in commercial real estate prices in the near term with a longer recovery period, resulting in higher allowances for the CRE portfolio from 3.25% to 4.2% at the end of the quarter.
The bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percent of total loans ended the quarter at 1.71%. So we believe we are adequately reserved, but that could change rapidly if economic conditions deteriorate. But currently, we are pleased with the credit quality and the positive trends we are seeing with the loan portfolio and the broader economy.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Paul Reilly to discuss our outlook. Paul?"

As for our outlook, we remain well positioned entering the second fiscal quarter with the strong capital ratios and record client assets. However, we'll continue to face headwinds from a full year of lower short-term interest rates, and there's still a high degree of uncertainty given the COVID-19 pandemic and the rollout of the vaccine and a new administration.
In the Private Client Group segment, while recruiting environment is extremely competitive, and we face some challenges in a largely virtual environment, our adviser recruiting pipeline is strong across all of our affiliation options, and this segment is going to benefit by starting the fiscal second quarter with strong sequential growth in fee-based accounts. Private Client Group fee-based assets were up 12%, which should be a good tailwind and result in a 10% increase in the associated revenues.
In the Capital Markets segment, there is still a significant amount of economic uncertainty due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, the investment banking pipeline is currently strong, and we expect fixed income brokerage results to remain elevated given the current interest rate and economic conditions.
In the Asset Management segment, results will be positively impacted by the 11% increase in assets under management, but those assets are built throughout the quarter.
At Raymond James Bank, we should continue to benefit from the attractive growth of securities-based loans and mortgages to PCG clients. And as we decelerate the growth of the securities portfolio, we are cautiously adding to corporate loans in the less COVID-impacted sectors.
We continue to focus on long-term growth, and our priorities remain unchanged. Our top priority is serving clients, and we're focused on organic growth, which is primarily driven by retaining and recruiting advisers in the Private Client Group. Additionally, we're continuing to add senior talent in our other businesses, such as investment banking.
As you observed this quarter, we will continue to actively pursue acquisitions. But we are still focused on being and only pursuing transactions that have a great cultural and strategic fit and at prices that can deliver attractive returns to our shareholders.
We started fiscal 2021 with very strong results, and I believe we are well positioned to drive profitable growth in the coming quarters across all of our businesses. But we are also fully aware that we are still in the middle of a global health pandemic, and we should all be prepared for much more economic turbulence and market volatility over the next several months.

Obviously, you guys have been alluding to some increased competition in recent months. So I just want to dig in a little bit because it seems like over time, recruiting competition kind of ebbs and flows. And so I'm kind of curious what do you think is driving that right now?
And I guess, I just want to make sure that I understand the full message here. I guess, my takeaway is that independent adviser recruiting is still very strong, and that's the expectation on the employee side. Pricing has become more competitive, but it sounds like Raymond James will be -- or already is increasing kind of pricing competitiveness.
So should we expect that the recruiting on the employee side will remain active, but just they cost a bit more? Or I guess, want to make sure taking the right takeaway here?"

And certainly, on the employee side as people [ have opt ] the transition assistance to be more trying to grow their private client group businesses we did. And that gap just got bigger and bigger and bigger where I think that people even wanting to join just said the economic gap was too big.
And as we really analyzed it, that if we can get by upping -- we don't have to match. We've proven that over history. But being more competitive because of the environment, what we offer advisers, we can get a good return now. And if interest rate spreads gap out again in the future, those recruiting deals from our standpoint will even be better. So we've got more aggressive. Yes, there's a little bit of lag, but we think we can get it going.
We did cut the adviser class going in on a cost cut and then during the pandemic and as we ramp back up the training, which we expect to once we get out of -- as we're kind of exiting the total virtual environment that will help also.
So again, last year, we had good recruiting stats that quarter, but it isn't unusual. If you go back to the year before that it was flattish. I think we were up too in a record recruiting year. So we'll get it back on track, and maybe we're a little slow to act.
But recruiting overall has been good. And then we're going to have to figure out how to give you better numbers. Because people are in the RIA channel, we don't count them at all. And so you're not really seeing overall recruiting, although they are in the asset number. So we're going to work on how to give you a better metric on that, too. So you can compare it more apples-to-apples as channels may shift over time."

And we have, as you can see with the cash at third-party banks and now in CIP at the broker dealer, we have a lot of funding capacity and plenty of capital capacity to grow the bank. So the biggest constraint now is just finding assets with good risk-adjusted returns over a long period of time.
The way we're thinking about balance sheet growth overall as a firm which includes -- primarily most of the growth in the balance sheet would come from the bank going forward, is that Tier 1 leverage ratio that Paul mentioned, which we hope to target around a 10% take that ratio down to somewhere around 10% over time.
Now it could go under 10% if we're just accommodating client cash balances and investing it in -- parking it at the Fed or investing it in treasuries. But on a more normalized basis, I think 10% is a conservative place to be at as a holding company overall. And so that's how we're thinking about the bank growth. Some of the metrics in the past that we shared with you around percentage of equity and percentage of cash balances, those were metrics that were established when we're primarily a corporate loan bank essentially.
And so we were -- those metrics were intended to contain the size of the credit exposure to our overall balance sheet. Now that we have agency mortgage-backed securities, and we have securities-based loans and mortgages to Private Client Group clients, some of those metrics aren't as relevant as they were 5 years ago. So that is going to be a part of the discussion that we hope to share more details with you on at our upcoming Analyst Investor Day."

Advisers want to be here. We have great tools, great technology and a great culture that supports them. So we just maybe got a little uncompetitive and thought during the pandemic, it didn't make sense.
But as we really dug into the economics, we had a lot of room to go up. So we did go up modestly. And I still think there'll be very good returns, and we just -- it's a hard choice for advisers when they come down to 2 places when someone's going to pay them 50% more. So we're just going to have to close that gap and still be a good economic return for the firm.
So there's always a lag between when you do this and when the count comes up, but recruiting isn't bad in the employee channel at all. It's just down from kind of a series of records. We just need to get it back up where it can be, certainly where it should be, given what we think we offer on our platform. So I'm still very optimistic about it.

And we plan, again, on Investor Day to try to get better metrics because we aren't disclosing all of that at current. But you're -- in general, in that custody type of platform, the return on assets may be a little lower and the margins are higher, but you're calculating it on a different revenue stream. So it's a little bit complex there.
And traditionally, in that business, a lot of it was trading fees, which have gone away and interest spreads, which are hopefully temporary gone away. So the economics in that business with interest spreads are a little more challenged, but I think they're fairly compelling when you get it back.
Our platform, the competitive part of our platform is that is an RIA custodian not only do we have a firm with an investment-grade background, which makes us a great competitor, but we also can offer kind of full systems, platforms and other firms use third-party platforms. So our goal would be not to allow our platforms to be used for people want the turnkey as well as integrating third-party platforms and also access to our other services, such as lending and other things that we do through our bank and access to the other help that we give and through our support centers, which I think are much more robust than most RIA platform.
So I think it's a strong alternative. We've shown growth. We've been in it a while. We just talked about it less. And we've seen both with the market as trading fees have gone away as regulation best interest for some of the larger advisers felt it was just easier to be under the kind of the SEC versus FINRA and some of all the rules and they could take on the compliance and risk of chosen to do that and so I think it's a long-term trend.
It's been a long-term trend. It's just picking up for certain advisers. And I think we'll be competitive in that platform, too. We just -- we got a lot of growth ahead of us to get us in scale there, but so far, so good."

And Paul, you gave kind of updated thoughts around the comp rate and again, hopefully, it could be better than 70% with a robust Capital Markets backdrop.

You guys have been running at a little bit over $300 million this quarter and last quarter on those kind of combination of those lines, again, excluding credit provisions. How do you guys envision that evolving through the rest of the fiscal year? And I guess to what extent sort of the higher recruiting TA packages will push that number higher?

And that included some NCI expense as well.
The only thing that is harder to project is what business development expenses are going to do throughout the year. They're down 50% year-over-year, almost $20 million for the quarter. So we'll see how business travel recovers as we progress throughout the calendar year. But overall, we're really focused, as you can tell, on managing all of the noncomp line items.
Some of them grow naturally with business growth. Subadvisory fees grow with fee-based assets in PCG, for example, and those were up 12% sequentially. So you're going to see some natural growth. But the ones that are controllable are ones that we're really focused on managing."

So they're still well managed. We're managing them very closely, this part of it, and plan to do that, but we will add people with growth. I mean you recruit an adviser, you've got to hire a system.

We've always had -- well, we always had outliers, 1 or 2 people offering larger pack -- kind of outsized packages we give to economics. So it's gotten a little more broad based as some of the regional firms have joined into the fray. So it's a little more competitive in that area.
I do think when we really dug into the economics that even though it was like packages, we thought with this interest rate environment made no sense. If you structure them right, we believe you can get a good return and the spreads do come back, they'll be very, very good investments in those recruiting packages. So we always kind of modeled our returns to current environment where we were conservative when we had high spreads, assuming they're going back to normal or historical averages.
In our packages, we were assuming, they just stayed more like where they are now, which I think was probably over punitive. So we're a little behind. We had room to increase it, and we'll do fine. And the competitive -- it's always been competitive. We've always recruited people that had better, higher offers than other firms, and we've been very successful.
So will we lose some people because of it? Yes. We just felt that we got a little out of the market in the last couple of quarters. So we'll correct it. There will still be a good return for the firm. And the other channels have been doing fine. We've had it in one channel, but we had this happen in other channels and try to make adjustments as it rebounded. So the business is always competitive.

So -- but if you just do the math on that, that's what if rates don't change for the next year or 2, that's where the yield on that portfolio would bottom out, assuming things don't improve in terms of yield for the securities portfolio, which is why we decelerated the growth of that this quarter and plan on the near term sort of running in place with that portfolio until we see maybe some improvement in those spreads."

It's hard to believe it's been almost a year since the COVID-19 pandemic started here in the U.S. And while there's now light at the end of the tunnel with the vaccine starting to be distributed across the globe, we are still very much in a period of uncertainty and volatility.
As painful as the pandemic has been for everyone, I'm very proud of how Raymond James has performed. Who would have predicted when we lost 40% of our earnings to the rate cuts in March that we would be talking about records today. This is a testament, not only to the resiliency of the U.S. economy but also to Raymond James, our advisers and their associates.
As you can see on Slide 3, our unwavering focus on serving clients resulted in fantastic financial results during the quarter. starting off fiscal 2021 with record quarterly revenues and earnings, driven by strength across our businesses.
In the fiscal first quarter, the firm reported record net revenues of $2.22 billion, which were up 11% over the prior year's fiscal first quarter and 7% over the prior record set in the preceding quarter. Record net income of $312 million or $2.23 per diluted share increased 16% over the prior record of net income set a year ago quarter and 49% over the preceding quarter.
Excluding expenses of $2 million associated with the completed acquisition of NWPS Holdings and the pending acquisition of Financo, adjusted quarterly net income was $314 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share was $2.24, both records. Annualized return on equity for the quarter was 17.2% and return on tangible common equity was 19%, an impressive result, especially in this near-0 rate environment and given our very strong capital position.
Record quarterly results were primarily attributable to higher asset management and related administrative fees, record investment banking revenues, strong fixed income brokerage revenues and disciplined expense management, which were more than offset the negative impact of lower short-term interest rates on the net interest income and RJBDP fees.
The record results and broad-based strengths in our businesses in this near-0 rate interest environment, which included record results for capital markets and asset management segments during the quarter, reinforced the value of our diverse and complementary businesses, sometimes something underappreciated in different market cycles.
Moving to Slide 4. We ended the quarter with records for total client assets under administration of $1.02 trillion, PCG assets and fee-based accounts of $533 billion and financial assets under management of $170 billion.
Client assets crossing the $1 trillion mark for the first time is a testament to the consistent growth that we've achieved by focusing on retaining our existing advisers while also recruiting high-quality financial advisers. And when you step back, this is quite an achievement. In December of 2010, we had around $260 billion of client assets. So we have experienced around a 15% compounded annual growth and essentially quadrupled client assets over a 10-year period, and the vast majority of that was organic growth.
We ended the quarter with 8,233 financial advisers, a net increase of 173 over the prior year, but a slight net decrease of 6 sequentially. A flat adviser count is not unusual for this quarter as we typically see an elevated number of retirements at the year-end, where assets are typically retained at Raymond James by their successor.
We are still optimistic about all of our recruiting pipelines across our affiliation options, but there are a few trends we are seeing in the industry. On the independent side of the business, we continue to experience strong recruiting activity, and we're seeing more interest from both external and internal advisers in the RIA custody affiliation option, particularly for much larger teams who have the scale and appetite to assume the regulatory and supervision responsibilities and risks.
We have been beneficiaries of this trend and our rebranded RIA & Custody Services division, or RCS. And we believe we'll continue to benefit from the trend, given major consolidation and disruption in the RIA custody industry. However, it's important to note that when an RIA affiliates with RCS, whether it be an internal transfer from our other affiliation option or external additions, we do not count the advisers of the RIA firms in our adviser count, but their assets are still included in client assets under administration.
On the employee side, there has been a modest slowdown in recruiting due to the challenges brought on by COVID and also increased competition for experienced advisers where even our regional competitors have significantly increased their recruiting packages. In response to what we have seen, we have also enhanced our recruiting packages to be more competitive, while also ensuring attractive returns to our shareholders.
Also impacting adviser count this year, we temporarily decreased the size of our new adviser training class this year by about 35 trainees, allowing us to dedicate more time and attention to newer advisers as they seek to overcome the challenges presented by this current virtual environment. While this will negatively impact the growth in adviser count when compared to prior years when the training class was larger, it really shouldn't have a significant impact on client assets.
We believe our recruiting will continue to thrive as advisers are attracted to our supportive culture and client-first values. Looking at recruiting results over the prior 4 quarters, financial advisers with nearly $270 million of trailing 12 production and nearly $40 billion of assets at their prior firms affiliated with Raymond James domestically.
As for our net organic growth results in the Private Client Group, we generated domestic PCG net new assets of $42 billion over the 4 quarters ending in December 31, 2020, representing more than 5% of domestic PCG client assets at the beginning of the period. And remember, this is net of client fees.
We are very pleased with our consistent organic growth, especially given the disruption associated with the COVID-19 pandemic during the year. And as you know, we did not benefit from the surge in self-directed online business during the year.
Moving to segment results on Slide 5. The Private Client Group generated quarterly net revenues of $1.47 billion and pretax income of $140 million. Quarterly net revenues grew 5% over the preceding quarter, predominantly driven by higher asset management and related administrative fees, reflecting higher assets in fee-based accounts, which will continue to be a tailwind in the second quarter. This strong revenue growth helped PCG's pretax income grow 12% sequentially, although it's still down 8% on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to the negative impact of lower short-term interest rates.
Capital Markets segment generated record quarterly net revenues of $452 million and pretax income of $129 million, an extraordinary result, a strong quarter for the segment, driven by broad-based strength across global equities and investment banking as well as fixed income. During the quarter, record investment banking revenues were driven by record M&A revenues, along with continued strength in debt and equity underwriting.
Fixed income brokerage revenues were strong as client activity levels remained robust. While we certainly would caution you against annualizing the record results of Capital Markets segment this quarter, I do think the results reflect the significant investments we have made to strengthen our platform over the last 10 years. And we are continuing to make those investments, as I will discuss shortly.
The Asset Management segment generated record net revenues of $195 million and pretax income of $83 million. Record results were driven by the growth of financial assets under management as equity market appreciation and the net inflows into PCG fee-based accounts more than offset the modest net outflows for Carillon Tower Advisers.
Lastly, Raymond James Bank generated quarterly net revenues of $167 million and pretax income of $71 million. Compared to a year ago quarter, net revenues declined primarily due to the impact of lower short-term interest rates on net interest income. Sequentially, quarterly net revenues grew 4%, as higher asset balances more than offset the 7 basis point decline in the bank's net interest margin in the quarter, which was primarily attributable to the growth in the agency MBS portfolio.
The credit quality of the bank's portfolio remains healthy, with most trends continuing to improve. Nonperforming assets remained low at 9 basis points of total assets and the amount of criticized loans declined 4% during the quarter. The quarterly bank loan provision for credit losses of $14 million declined sequentially and was driven mostly by macroeconomic model inputs, now under the CECL methodology, which Paul Shoukry will cover in more detail.
Moving to Slide 6. As you've heard me say many times, we remain focused on long-term growth and are committed to deploying excess capital to generate attractive returns to our shareholders. Good example of that commitment are the 2 acquisitions we announced during the quarter. The first, which closed in late December, is NWPS. NWPS is a provider of retirement plan administration, consulting, actuarial and administrative services based in Seattle, Washington.
The addition of NWPS allows Raymond James to expand our retirement services offerings, including retirement plan administration services to advisers and clients. Many of our advisers serve clients with small businesses, and offering this retirement solution is another attractive way to help advisers develop deeper and stronger relationship with our clients.
The second pending acquisition, Financo, is a consumer-focused M&A advisory firm, which allows us to strategically grow our capabilities in an attractive vertical with industry-leading team. We anticipate this transaction to close in the March or April time frame. Both of these firms represent great cultural and strategic fits, and we're excited about welcoming them to the Raymond James family.
While we are not going to discuss the terms of these 2 transactions, in total, over time, these 2 acquisitions represent consideration, retention and earn-out potential to the sellers of approximately $320 million. So it is a meaningful and attractive use of cash and capital. We will continue to actively pursue additional acquisitions that are both the cultural and strategic fit.
And now for a more detailed review of the financial results, I'm going to turn this over to Paul Shoukry. Paul?"
22623,701768314,2252280,"Raymond James Financial, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2021",2021-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Raymond James Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Paul.

Record quarterly net revenues of $2.22 billion grew 11% and year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Asset management fees grew 12% on a year-over-year basis and 6% sequentially, commensurate with the growth of fee-based assets. Private Client Group assets and fee-based accounts were up 12% during the fiscal first quarter, which will provide a tailwind for this line item for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. However, given fewer billable days in the March quarter, I would expect asset management fees in PCG to increase about 10% sequentially.
Consolidated brokerage revenues of $528 million grew 15% over the prior year and represented a record. These revenues are inherently difficult to predict, but our clients are still engaged in both the Private Client Group and Capital Markets segments, given the current market and interest rate environment.
Account service fees of $145 million declined 19% year-over-year, almost entirely due to the decrease in RJBDP fees from third-party banks due to lower short-term interest rates, which I will discuss along with net interest income in more detail on the next 2 slides.
Consolidated investment banking revenues of $261 million grew 85% year-over-year and 18% sequentially, achieving a record result, driven by record M&A advisory revenues and strong debt and equity underwriting. Based on the pipeline and activity levels, we anticipate second quarter to be healthy, but not as strong as a remarkable result achieved in the first quarter.
As you all know, these revenues are very difficult to predict. But for the rest of the fiscal year, we would be very pleased to achieve the pace of the average quarterly investment banking revenues from the annual record we set in fiscal 2020, which would be roughly $160 million to $165 million per quarter on average.
Turning to other revenues, which were $56 million for the quarter. This line included $24 million of private equity valuation gains during the quarter, of which approximately $10 million were attributable to noncontrolling interest reflected in other expenses.
Moving to Slide 9. Clients' domestic cash sweep balances ended the quarter at a record $61.6 billion, increasing 11% sequentially and representing 6.7% of domestic PCG client assets. As we continue to experience growing cash balances and less demand from third-party banks, more client cash is being held in the client interest program at the broker dealer. You can see those balances grew to $8.8 billion, and most of that growth has been used to purchase short-term treasuries to meet the associated reserve requirement. Over time, that cash could be redeployed to our bank or third-party banks as capacity becomes available, which would hopefully earn a higher spread than we currently earn on short-term treasuries.
On Slide 10, the top chart displays our firm-wide net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks on a combined basis. Related, based on your feedback, we have updated our net interest table in the earnings release to incorporate all of the firm's interest-earning assets and liabilities instead of those balances for just Raymond James Bank. We hope you find this update helpful. And as always, we thank you for your suggestions to continue enhancing our disclosures.
As you can see on Slide 10, while lower rates have put significant pressure on these revenues since the Fed rate cuts in March 2020, we did experience a slight uptick in these revenues sequentially, helped by the aforementioned growth in client cash balances and higher asset balances at Raymond James Bank, which more than offset the sequential NIM compression you see on the bottom left portion of this slide.
Given prepayment speeds of higher-yielding securities and mortgages, we would expect the bank's NIM to decline another 10 basis points or so throughout the year. However, we are hoping that growth in the bank's earning assets will more than offset the NIM compression and result in continued growth of the firm's net interest income. I will provide a bit more color on the bank's balance sheet growth in a few slides.
Moving to consolidated expenses on Slide 11. First, compensation expense, which is by far our largest expense, the compensation ratio decreased sequentially from 68.1% to 67.5% during the quarter, primarily due to record revenues in the Capital Markets segment, which had a 56% compensation ratio during the quarter and the benefit from the private equity valuation gain, which doesn't have direct compensation associated with it.
As we said last quarter, given the near-0 short-term interest rates and the successful implementation of the expense initiative we announced last quarter, we are confident we can maintain a compensation ratio of 70% or better, which we still believe is an appropriate target. And as we experienced this quarter, very strong Capital Markets results in any particular quarter could result in a compensation ratio below 70%.
Non-compensation expenses of $323 million increased $24 million or 8% compared to last year's first quarter and almost all of that increase could be explained by the $14 million bank loan provision for credit losses compared to the $2 million benefit in the year-ago period and $13 million of noncontrolling interest in other expenses, most of which offsets a portion of the $24 million private equity valuation gain reflected in other revenues. As we explained and as you can see in these results, we have been very focused on the disciplined management of all compensation and noncompensation-related expenses, while still investing in growth and ensuring high service levels for advisers and their clients.
Slide 12 shows the pretax margin trend over the past 5 quarters. Pretax margin was 18% in the fiscal first quarter of 2021, which was boosted by the record Capital Markets results as that segment generated a record 29% pretax margin. Last quarter, we talked about generating a 14% to 15% pretax margin on a consolidated basis in this near-0 interest rate environment, which, again, we believe is still a reasonable target. But as we experienced this quarter, there's upside to the margins when the Capital Markets results are so strong.
On Slide 13, at the end of fiscal first quarter, total assets were approximately $53.7 billion, a 13% sequential increase, reflecting the dynamic I explained earlier with growth in client cash balances and associated reserves at the broker dealer. This growth of client cash balances on the balance sheet caused our Tier 1 leverage ratio to decrease to 12.9%, which is still well above the regulatory requirement. Liquidity remained very strong with $1.8 billion of cash at the parent, leaving us with plenty of flexibility to be both defensive and opportunistic.
Slide 14 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past 5 quarters. In December, in addition to increasing the quarterly dividend 5% to $0.39 per share, the Board of Directors authorized share repurchases of up to $750 million, which replaced the previous authorization. And $740 million remains available under the new authorization.
In the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 108,000 shares for $10 million, an average price of approximately $92.80 per share. This fell short of our $50 million quarterly target, which we plan on making up for in the subsequent quarters as we are committed to repurchasing at least $200 million to offset share-based compensation dilution during the fiscal year.
One thing many of you have asked us to be more explicit on is our plans for deploying capital, which is something we hope to discuss with you in much more detail at our Analyst Investor Day, tentatively planned to be held virtually in May. But at a high level, what I would share with you now is that our goal is to manage down the firm's Tier 1 leverage ratio closer to 10% over time through a combination of balance sheet growth, primarily at the bank as well as more deliberate deployment of capital through a combination of organic growth, acquisitions and share repurchases.
We are not ready to share a specific time line to achieve this objective and doing so in the middle of a pandemic is probably not the best time to do so, but I want to be clear that we are fully committed to managing our capital levels, balancing our objectives of optimizing returns to shareholders while ensuring a significant balance sheet flexibility and conservatism.
On the next 2 slides, we provide additional detail on the bank's loan portfolio, starting on Slide 15, with some detail on Raymond James Bank's asset composition. In the pie chart, you can see we broke out CRE and REIT loans into separate categories with the implementation of CECL this quarter. The only other thing I would point out on this slide is we have a very well diversified balance sheet at the bank.
The bank's total assets grew 3% sequentially, led by 4% growth in the bank's loan portfolio, about 60% of which was attributable to securities-based loans to Private Client Group clients. We have decelerated the growth of the securities portfolio at the bank and will likely continue to do so over the near term as spreads for agency mortgage-backed securities have gotten extremely tight. Meanwhile, we have resumed growth in certain sectors in the corporate loan portfolio that we believe are less directly exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Lastly, on Slide 16, we provide key credit metrics for Raymond James Bank. First, let me briefly discuss CECL. We implemented CECL on October 1, which increased our allowances by approximately $45 million, with the majority of that increase attributable to recruiting and retention-related loans to financial advisers in the Private Client Group segment, which now require a larger allowance under CECL than under the incurred loss method. About $10 million of that day 1 impact was related to outstanding bank loans. And remember, all $45 million hit the balance sheet directly and did not go through the P&L.
We had no charge-offs in the quarter. The quarterly bank loan provision for credit losses was $14 million, largely attributable to the macroeconomic model inputs we use from a third party vendor, which assumed a greater decline in commercial real estate prices in the near term with a longer recovery period, resulting in higher allowances for the CRE portfolio from 3.25% to 4.2% at the end of the quarter.
The bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percent of total loans ended the quarter at 1.71%. So we believe we are adequately reserved, but that could change rapidly if economic conditions deteriorate. But currently, we are pleased with the credit quality and the positive trends we are seeing with the loan portfolio and the broader economy.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Paul Reilly to discuss our outlook. Paul?"

As for our outlook, we remain well positioned entering the second fiscal quarter with the strong capital ratios and record client assets. However, we'll continue to face headwinds from a full year of lower short-term interest rates, and there's still a high degree of uncertainty given the COVID-19 pandemic and the rollout of the vaccine and a new administration.
In the Private Client Group segment, while recruiting environment is extremely competitive, and we face some challenges in a largely virtual environment, our adviser recruiting pipeline is strong across all of our affiliation options, and this segment is going to benefit by starting the fiscal second quarter with strong sequential growth in fee-based accounts. Private Client Group fee-based assets were up 12%, which should be a good tailwind and result in a 10% increase in the associated revenues.
In the Capital Markets segment, there is still a significant amount of economic uncertainty due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, the investment banking pipeline is currently strong, and we expect fixed income brokerage results to remain elevated given the current interest rate and economic conditions.
In the Asset Management segment, results will be positively impacted by the 11% increase in assets under management, but those assets are built throughout the quarter.
At Raymond James Bank, we should continue to benefit from the attractive growth of securities-based loans and mortgages to PCG clients. And as we decelerate the growth of the securities portfolio, we are cautiously adding to corporate loans in the less COVID-impacted sectors.
We continue to focus on long-term growth, and our priorities remain unchanged. Our top priority is serving clients, and we're focused on organic growth, which is primarily driven by retaining and recruiting advisers in the Private Client Group. Additionally, we're continuing to add senior talent in our other businesses, such as investment banking.
As you observed this quarter, we will continue to actively pursue acquisitions. But we are still focused on being and only pursuing transactions that have a great cultural and strategic fit and at prices that can deliver attractive returns to our shareholders.
We started fiscal 2021 with very strong results, and I believe we are well positioned to drive profitable growth in the coming quarters across all of our businesses. But we are also fully aware that we are still in the middle of a global health pandemic, and we should all be prepared for much more economic turbulence and market volatility over the next several months.

Obviously, you guys have been alluding to some increased competition in recent months.

And I guess, I just want to make sure that I understand the full message here. I guess, my takeaway is that independent adviser recruiting is still very strong, and that's the expectation on the employee side. Pricing has become more competitive, but it sounds like Raymond James will be -- or already is increasing kind of pricing competitiveness.
So should we expect that the recruiting on the employee side will remain active, but just they cost a bit more? Or I guess, want to make sure taking the right takeaway here?"

And as we really analyzed it, that if we can get by upping -- we don't have to match. We've proven that over history.

And if interest rate spreads gap out again in the future, those recruiting deals from our standpoint will even be better. So we've got more aggressive. Yes, there's a little bit of lag, but we think we can get it going.
We did cut the adviser class going in on a cost cut and then during the pandemic and as we ramp back up the training, which we expect to once we get out of -- as we're kind of exiting the total virtual environment that will help also.
So again, last year, we had good recruiting stats that quarter, but it isn't unusual. If you go back to the year before that it was flattish. I think we were up too in a record recruiting year. So we'll get it back on track, and maybe we're a little slow to act.
But recruiting overall has been good. And then we're going to have to figure out how to give you better numbers. Because people are in the RIA channel, we don't count them at all. And so you're not really seeing overall recruiting, although they are in the asset number. So we're going to work on how to give you a better metric on that, too. So you can compare it more apples-to-apples as channels may shift over time."

Is there any way you can just help refresh us how to think about the capacity of the bank growth or the size of the bank within Raymond James? I appreciate that you're going to be opportunistic and can't really give a time line of expanding the bank balance sheet. But how should we think about based on whether it's third-party bank deposits and client interest program, capacity to fund growth or the size of the bank within the overall firm? How are you guys thinking about maybe the upper band of capacity without giving us a time line of exactly how you'll get there?"

And we have, as you can see with the cash at third-party banks and now in CIP at the broker dealer, we have a lot of funding capacity and plenty of capital capacity to grow the bank. So the biggest constraint now is just finding assets with good risk-adjusted returns over a long period of time.
The way we're thinking about balance sheet growth overall as a firm which includes -- primarily most of the growth in the balance sheet would come from the bank going forward, is that Tier 1 leverage ratio that Paul mentioned, which we hope to target around a 10% take that ratio down to somewhere around 10% over time.
Now it could go under 10% if we're just accommodating client cash balances and investing it in -- parking it at the Fed or investing it in treasuries. But on a more normalized basis, I think 10% is a conservative place to be at as a holding company overall. And so that's how we're thinking about the bank growth. Some of the metrics in the past that we shared with you around percentage of equity and percentage of cash balances, those were metrics that were established when we're primarily a corporate loan bank essentially.
And so we were -- those metrics were intended to contain the size of the credit exposure to our overall balance sheet. Now that we have agency mortgage-backed securities, and we have securities-based loans and mortgages to Private Client Group clients, some of those metrics aren't as relevant as they were 5 years ago. So that is going to be a part of the discussion that we hope to share more details with you on at our upcoming Analyst Investor Day."

You quoted an NNA figure, which implied about 5% organic growth in the quarter. Slightly below the 6% to 7% you recorded over the last 2. And as you look ahead, just given the heightened competition within the employee channel, what pace of NNA growth are you comfortable underwriting or we should be contemplating at least in the near to intermediate term, given some of the competitive dynamics that you cited?"

We've had quarters where this has happened where recruiting trailed off in different channels and we've adjusted, and we've been right back as kind of a benchmark for recruiting across our channels. And I believe we'll continue that.
Advisers want to be here. We have great tools, great technology and a great culture that supports them. So we just maybe got a little uncompetitive and thought during the pandemic, it didn't make sense.
But as we really dug into the economics, we had a lot of room to go up. So we did go up modestly. And I still think there'll be very good returns, and we just -- it's a hard choice for advisers when they come down to 2 places when someone's going to pay them 50% more. So we're just going to have to close that gap and still be a good economic return for the firm.
So there's always a lag between when you do this and when the count comes up, but recruiting isn't bad in the employee channel at all. It's just down from kind of a series of records. We just need to get it back up where it can be, certainly where it should be, given what we think we offer on our platform. So I'm still very optimistic about it. It's been robust in all the other channels. And we've had channels go up and down before for a quarter or 2, and we've always rebounded.

But you're -- in general, in that custody type of platform, the return on assets may be a little lower and the margins are higher, but you're calculating it on a different revenue stream. So it's a little bit complex there.
And traditionally, in that business, a lot of it was trading fees, which have gone away and interest spreads, which are hopefully temporary gone away. So the economics in that business with interest spreads are a little more challenged, but I think they're fairly compelling when you get it back.
Our platform, the competitive part of our platform is that is an RIA custodian not only do we have a firm with an investment-grade background, which makes us a great competitor, but we also can offer kind of full systems, platforms and other firms use third-party platforms. So our goal would be not to allow our platforms to be used for people want the turnkey as well as integrating third-party platforms and also access to our other services, such as lending and other things that we do through our bank and access to the other help that we give and through our support centers, which I think are much more robust than most RIA platform.
So I think it's a strong alternative. We've shown growth. We've been in it a while. We just talked about it less. And we've seen both with the market as trading fees have gone away as regulation best interest for some of the larger advisers felt it was just easier to be under the kind of the SEC versus FINRA and some of all the rules and they could take on the compliance and risk of chosen to do that and so I think it's a long-term trend.
It's been a long-term trend. It's just picking up for certain advisers. And I think we'll be competitive in that platform, too. We just -- we got a lot of growth ahead of us to get us in scale there, but so far, so good."

I do think when we really dug into the economics that even though it was like packages, we thought with this interest rate environment made no sense. If you structure them right, we believe you can get a good return and the spreads do come back, they'll be very, very good investments in those recruiting packages. So we always kind of modeled our returns to current environment where we were conservative when we had high spreads, assuming they're going back to normal or historical averages.
In our packages, we were assuming, they just stayed more like where they are now, which I think was probably over punitive. So we're a little behind. We had room to increase it, and we'll do fine. And the competitive -- it's always been competitive. We've always recruited people that had better, higher offers than other firms, and we've been very successful.
So will we lose some people because of it? Yes. We just felt that we got a little out of the market in the last couple of quarters. So we'll correct it.

And right now, with the Fed buying, I think, $40 billion a month is what they committed -- recommitted to yesterday. The spreads now are really tight. I mean we're talking about 50 basis points or so for 3 years of duration. Again, you see that you're out and getting really paid a lot to take that 3 years of duration.
So -- but if you just do the math on that, that's what if rates don't change for the next year or 2, that's where the yield on that portfolio would bottom out, assuming things don't improve in terms of yield for the securities portfolio, which is why we decelerated the growth of that this quarter and plan on the near term sort of running in place with that portfolio until we see maybe some improvement in those spreads."

We continue to talk to folks. And without the cultural fit or some of the deal prices, we've walked from some things. I mean these aren't the only 2 deals we've looked at.

It has been a year since the financial markets bottomed, and the Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates to near 0. That move reduced our pretax run rate by 40%. The stock market has seen an incredible run since 2020, with the S&P 500 up 54% year-over-year. While that tailwind has certainly helped fuel our strong results, the records we generated during the quarter and first half of the fiscal year have also been driven by our unwavering commitment to providing excellent service to advisers and their clients during this difficult and unprecedented time.
It's a testament to our advisers who have shepherded their clients through the pandemic and the wherewithal of our associates who have worked so hard to service our advisers and their clients, our strong balance sheet and our ability to grow both in constructive and challenging markets. Certainly, a year we will never forget on many levels.
Starting on Slide 3. The fiscal second quarter was another record quarter. The firm reported record net revenues of $2.37 billion, which were up 15% over the prior year's fiscal second quarter and 7% over the preceding quarter. Record net income of $355 million or $2.51 per diluted share increased 110% over net income in the year ago quarter and 14% over the preceding quarter.
Annualized return on equity for the quarter was 19%, and return on tangible common equity was 21.2%, an extremely impressive result especially in this near 0 rate environment and given our strong capital position.
Record quarterly revenues were primarily driven by higher asset management and related administrative fees, investment banking revenues and record brokerage revenues, which more than offset the negative impact of lower short-term interest rates on both the net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks.
Record quarterly net income was attributable to the record revenues, disciplined management of controllable expenses, the bank loan loss benefit of $32 million reflecting improving economic conditions and subdued business development expenses given the lack of business travel and conferences.
Moving to Slide 4. We ended the quarter with record total client assets under administration of $1.09 trillion, which were up 40% on a year-over-year basis and 6% sequentially. We also achieved records for PCG assets and fee-based accounts of $568 billion, a 7% sequential improvement, which will benefit the third quarter, and financial assets under management of $178 billion.
We ended the quarter with a record 8,327 financial advisers, a net increase of 179 over the prior year's period and 94 over the preceding quarter. This represents a solid improvement over the prior quarter and reflects our strong retention and the continued strength of our recruiting pipelines across all of our affiliation options. Our recruiting momentum in the independent side of the business continues to be strong.
On the employee side, as we mentioned last quarter, in response to the increased recruiting packages by competitors, we enhanced our recruiting packages to be more competitive, while also ensuring attractive returns to our shareholders. And while recruiting momentum and this business has increased greatly, employee advisory count is down slightly from the prior quarter as improved recruiting was offset by a higher number of retirements where assets are typically retained at the firm as well as the smaller training class. However, the number of advisers scheduled to join is up significantly, not only in our employee channel, but across all of our affiliation options.
Looking at our recruiting results. Over the prior 4 quarters, financial advisers with approximately $285 million of trailing 12 months production and nearly $44 billion of assets at their prior firms affiliated with Raymond James domestically. As for our net organic growth results in the Private Client Group, we generated domestic PCG net new assets of nearly $54 billion over the 4 quarters ending on March 31, 2021, representing more than a 7.5% of domestic PCG assets at the beginning of the period. And remember, this is net of client fees. And this trend has accelerated during the first half of the fiscal year closer to a 9% annualized rate. We are very pleased with our consistent organic growth, especially given disruption associated with the COVID-19 pandemic during the year.
Now let's move to the segment results on Slide 5. The Private Client Group generated record quarterly net revenues of $1.65 billion and pretax income of $192 million, an 11.7% pretax margins, reflecting significant operating leverage despite being in a near 0 rate environment. Quarterly net revenues grew 12% over the preceding quarter, predominantly driven by higher asset management and related administrative fees, reflecting higher assets in fee-based accounts, which will continue to be a tailwind in the third quarter. Higher brokerage revenues also contributed to the quarterly revenue growth.
The Capital Markets segment generated quarterly net revenues of $433 million and pretax income of $105 million, driven by record brokerage revenue, record equity underwriting and strong M&A revenues. Despite not topping the extraordinarily strong and record-breaking first quarter results, the results this quarter were very strong, driven by broad-based strength across global equities and investment banking and fixed income businesses. The strong results reflect the significant investments we have made to strengthen our platform over the last 10 years, and we are continuing to make investments, including the recent acquisition of the consumer-focused M&A advisory firm, Financo, which closed at the end of the quarter, and we welcome Financo to the Raymond James family.
The Asset Management segment generated record net revenues of $209 million and record pretax income of $87 million. Record results were primarily due to growth of financial assets under management, driven by equity market appreciation and net inflows into fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group. Carillon Tower advisers also generated significant net inflows during the quarter.
Lastly, Raymond James Bank generated quarterly net revenues of $160 million and pretax income of $111 million. Quarterly net revenues declined 24% compared to a year ago quarter, primarily due to the impact of lower short-term interest rates. Sequentially, quarterly net revenues declined 4% as higher asset balances were offset by the expected 8 basis points decline in the Bank's net interest margin during the quarter, which was also largely attributable to the agency-backed securities portfolio. Pretax income growth was primarily due to the loan loss reserve release in the quarter compared to the provision for credit losses in both of the comparative periods. The credit quality of the Bank's portfolio remains healthy, as Paul Shoukry will cover in more detail in his remarks.
Looking at the fiscal year-to-date results on Slide 6. We generated record net revenues of $4.59 billion during the first 6 months of the fiscal 2021, up 13% over the same period. Record earnings per diluted share of $4.74 increased 53% compared to the first 6 months of fiscal 2020, primarily due to the revenue growth, along with the loan loss reserve release compared to the provision for credit losses in the comparative period.
Moving to the fiscal year-to-date results on Slide 7. The Private Client Group, Capital Markets and Asset Management segments generated record net revenues and record pretax income during the first 6 months of the fiscal year. In fact, Capital Markets segment's pretax income for the first half of the fiscal year of $234 million actually exceeded the annual record of $225 million set in fiscal 2020. Again, these results reinforce the value of our diverse and complementary businesses.
And now for a more detailed review of the financial results, I'll turn the call over to Paul Shoukry. Paul?"

Record quarterly net revenues of $2.37 billion grew 15% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. As expected, Asset Management fees grew 10% sequentially, a bit lower than the 12% growth of fee-based assets during the preceding quarter, primarily due to 2 fewer billable days during the quarter.
Private Client Group assets and fee-based accounts were up 7% during the fiscal second quarter, providing a tailwind for this line item for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. Consolidated brokerage revenues of $591 million grew 15% over the prior year and represents a record, driven by continued strength in institutional fixed income as well as strong brokerage revenues in the Private Client Group, reflecting healthy client activity levels and higher asset values.
Account and service fees of $159 million declined 8% year-over-year, almost entirely due to the decrease in RJBDP fees from third-party banks given lower short-term interest rates, which I will discuss along with net interest income in more detail on the next 2 slides.
The 10% sequential increase was largely attributable to higher asset balances and revenues from our recent acquisition of NWPS, most of which are reflected in the client account and other fees line in the PCG segment. Consolidated investment banking revenues of $242 million grew 64% year-over-year, driven by strong M&A advisory revenues and record equity underwriting revenues. For the first half of the year, investment banking revenues were 74% higher than the first half of fiscal 2020. Our investment banking pipelines remain strong, so we would be really pleased to finish the fiscal year averaging $200 million or better of investment banking revenues per quarter if market conditions remain conducive.
Other revenues of $44 million are down 21% sequentially, primarily due to lower private equity valuation gains during the quarter, partially offset by a strong quarter for the tax credit funds business.
Moving to Slide 10. Clients' domestic cash sweep balances, which are the primary source of funding for our interest-earning assets and the balances with third-party banks that generate RJBDP fees, ended with a quarter end record of $62.8 billion, increasing 2% sequentially and representing 6.5% of domestic PCG client assets. As we continue to experience growing cash balances and less demand from third-party banks, more client cash is being held in the client interest program at the broker dealer. You can see those balances grew to $9.5 billion, and most of that growth has been used to purchase short-term treasuries to meet the associated reserve requirement. Over time, that cash could be redeployed to our bank or third-party banks as capacity becomes available, which would hopefully earn a higher spread than we currently earn on short-term treasuries.
On Slide 11, the top chart displays our firm-wide net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks on a combined basis, as these 2 items are directly impacted by change in short-term interest rates. Related, we have updated the net interest margin, or NIM, chart on the bottom left portion of this slide to show NIM for both Raymond James Bank and the firm overall.
The combined net interest income and BDP fees from third-party banks declined a bit sequentially, largely due to fewer days during the quarter and NIM compression at the bank. As I mentioned on the last quarter's call, we would expect the bank's NIM to decline to around 1.9% over the next 2 quarters as the new agency security purchases have lower yield than the runoff, but still represent a higher yield than we are earning from third-party banks or in short-term treasuries.
We also believe the average yield on RJBDP balances with third-party banks will remain close to 30 basis points for the rest of the fiscal year. But that could experience downward pressure in fiscal 2022, if banks demand for deposits doesn't improve from current levels.
Moving to consolidated expenses on Slide 12. First, compensation expense, which is by far our largest expense. As expected, the compensation ratio increased sequentially from 67.5% to 69.5%, largely due to the revenue mix shift towards higher compensable revenues in the PCG segment as financial adviser payouts, particularly on the independent contractor side of the business where they cover most of their overhead costs, are typically much higher than the associated compensation in the other businesses. On a sequential basis, the compensation ratio was also impacted by the reset of payroll taxes that occurs in the first calendar quarter of each year.
As we explained on the last call, given our current revenue mix and disciplined management of expenses, we are confident we can maintain a compensation ratio of 70% or better in this near 0 short-term interest rate environment. Non-compensation expenses of $277 million decreased 32% compared to last year's second quarter and 14% sequentially, primarily driven by the $32 million bank loan loss benefit compared to provisions in the comparative periods.
Business development expenses also remain subdued. But we expect those to increase over the next few quarters as business travel picks back up in conferences and recognition trips resume.
Overall, you can see we have been really focused on managing controllable expenses while still investing in growth and ensuring high service levels for advisers and their clients.
Slide 13 shows the pretax margin trend over the past 5 quarters. Pretax margin was 18.8% in fiscal second quarter of 2021, which was boosted by record revenues, the loan loss reserve release and subdued business development expenses.
On the last call, we talked about generating a 14% to 15% pretax margin in this near 0 interest rate environment. But as we experienced during the first half of the fiscal year, there's meaningful upside to our margin when capital markets results are so strong.
On Slide 14, at the end of the quarter, total assets were $56.1 billion, a 4% sequential increase, reflecting the dynamic I explained earlier with growth in client cash balances and associated segregated assets at the broker-dealer as well as solid growth of corporate loans and security based loans at Raymond James Bank. This balance sheet growth caused our Tier 1 leverage ratio to decrease to 12.2%, which is still well above the regulatory requirements and our more conservative target of 10%. Liquidity remains very strong with $1.7 billion of cash at the parent at the end of the quarter, leaving us with plenty of flexibility to be defensive and opportunistic.
During the quarter, we announced a debt offering, which closed at the beginning of our fiscal third quarter, so it was not reflected in any of the second quarter's numbers. To take advantage of the low rate environment, we raised $750 million of 30-year senior notes at 3.75%, and utilized the proceeds and cash on hand to early redeem our next 2 senior note maturities, effectively resulting in the same amount of senior notes outstanding, but with a much longer-term stable funding profile.
In the third quarter, we expect to record losses associated with the early extinguishment of these notes, which should total somewhere around $90 million. To help with comparability, we will break those losses out as a non-GAAP adjustment in the fiscal third quarter.
Slide 15 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past 5 quarters. In the second quarter, we repurchased 500,000 shares for $60 million, an average price of approximately $120 per share. Over the first 2 quarters of the fiscal year, we repurchased shares for $70 million, and we remain committed to repurchasing a total of at least $200 million in fiscal 2021 to offset share-based compensation dilution. As of April 28, $680 million remain under the current share repurchase authorization.
Lastly, on Slide 16, we provide key credit metrics for Raymond James Bank. The credit quality of the bank's loan portfolio remains healthy with most trends continuing to improve. Nonperforming assets remained low at 9 basis points of total assets. However, criticized loans increased due to a handful of credit downgrades within our REIT portfolio, particularly in the hospitality sector. While all of those credits we downgraded continue to perform, have large cash balances and are starting to see improvement in their portfolios, we thought it was prudent to downgrade those credits.
We had net charge-offs of $2 million in the quarter, which were related to opportunistic loan sales of $95 million at nearly 99% of par value. The bank loan loss benefit of $32 million was largely attributable to the macroeconomic inputs in the CECL model, which reflect an improved outlook, particularly for the commercial real estate and residential mortgage loan portfolios.
Due to reserve releases and the loan growth during the quarter, the bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans declined from 1.71% to 1.50% at quarter end. For the corporate loan portfolios, these allowances are higher at around 2.6%. We believe we are adequately reserved, but that could change if economic conditions deteriorate.
Our strong balance sheet and long-term focus was recently cited as a strength by Fitch ratings, who launched its long-term senior unsecured rating for Raymond James Financial of A- with a stable outlook. Now I'll turn the call back over to Paul Reilly to discuss our outlook. Paul?"

So overall, a year into the global health pandemic, with near 0 short-term interest rates and during a quarter with lots of seasonal headwinds, such as fewer billable days and the reset of payroll taxes, I could not be more pleased with our record top and bottom line results this quarter. As for our outlook, we remained well positioned entering the third fiscal quarter with records for all of our key business metrics, strong financial adviser recruiting activity and robust pipelines for investment banking.
In the Private Client Group segment, while the recruiting environment is competitive and we face some challenges in a largely virtual environment, our financial adviser recruiting pipeline is strong across all of our affiliation options, and this segment is going to benefit by starting the fiscal third quarter with a 7% sequential increase in assets and fee-based accounts. The enhancements we made to the recruiting packages on the employee side of the business have been very well received by prospective advisers, and that pipeline has recovered nicely.
Our perspective advisers across all of our affiliation options have continued to be attracted by our leading technology solutions. We have been known for our industry-leading position in mobile adviser tools and continue to make our technology platform more robust. We have also created easy-to-use systems that put all the information advisers need right at their fingertips, so they can easily get the information they need to service their clients and have more time taking care of their clients and growing their business.
As we continue to invest in our technology, we're extremely excited about the new enhancements, which will be coming out shortly.
We have been measuring our client satisfaction for the past 10 years using Net Promoter Scores, and I am proud to share that our client satisfaction has never been higher, both in terms of satisfaction with Raymond James as well as satisfaction with their advisers. In the Capital Markets segment, although there is still economic uncertainty due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the investment banking pipeline remains strong, and we expect fixed income brokerage results to remain elevated, particularly in the depository client segment where we have a leadership position.
In the Asset Management segment, results will be positively impacted by higher financial assets under management as long as the equity markets remain resilient. We were also pleased to see positive net flows for Carillon Tower advisers in the quarter despite the structural headwinds for active asset managers. We hope that the one benefit of increased market volatility is that it reinforces the value of high-quality active asset managers.
And Raymond James Bank should continue to benefit from the attractive growth of securities-based loans and mortgages to the Private Client Group segment. On a year-over-year basis, the growth of the securities-based loans has been impressive, around 38%. We'll also continue to be selective and deliberate in growing the corporate loan portfolio and the agency-backed securities portfolio as we have ample funding and capital to grow the balance sheet. We continue to focus on long-term growth, and our priorities remain unchanged. Our top priority is organic growth, which is primarily driven by retaining and recruiting advisers in the Private Client Group. Additionally, we are continuing to add senior talent to all of our businesses. We also continue to actively pursue acquisitions, but we will still be deliberate and only pursue transactions that are a great cultural and strategic fit and at prices that we can deliver attractive returns to our shareholders. We have been even more proactive in-sourcing and evaluating opportunities.
On Earth Day last week, we released our first corporate responsibility report. The report summarizes our foundational commitment to people, sustainability, community and governance, and illustrates our long-standing approach to doing business, rooted in our values and brought to life through our people-driven culture. This report summarizes many of the inspiring things that our advisers and associates across the firm do to contribute to their communities and the things we do as a firm to help the environment. We look forward to building on this inaugural report by maintaining transparency and sharing progress over time.

And really, the decline to 12.2% this quarter was primarily attributable to the increase in client cash balances, and we're accommodating more of that on our balance sheet at the broker dealer, frankly, because the third-party bank demand with all of the banks flushed with cash right now has declined. At the broker dealer, we -- to fulfill the associated reserve requirement or repurchasing short-term treasuries. And we hope that we can, over time, redeploy that into more profitable growth at the bank. But in terms of how we think about getting to 10% over time, it's really going to be a combination of growing the balance sheet, which primarily occurs for us at Raymond James Bank, as you know. You alluded to the strong loan growth in the quarter of 4%. We are still being very deliberate in growing the portfolio, both the Private Client Group loans. Securities-based loans grew almost 40% year-over-year. And mortgages have seen good growth as well, although there's been a high degree of runoffs and refinancing there. And we're starting to really be deliberate and growing the corporate loan portfolio, although there still continues to be more demand and supply in the market with banks being flushed with cash.
And then the second component of managing the capital ratio is really deploying the capital. You saw us do the buybacks this quarter to offset the dilution. We'll continue to do that and be opportunistic if the prices are at attractive levels. And then, of course, you just heard Paul mention the focus on acquisitions as well, as another way to deploy capital."

So it's happening everywhere. And then on recruitment, we measure -- we don't publish what we call commits, and those are people saying, I'm coming. What you see are the people that sign.

And so obviously, that has grown nicely as assets have grown and the trail commissions have grown as well. But you can also see that the transactional commissions from equities, ETFs and fixed income, they're up 13% sequentially as well. So good level of client activity. Obviously, the asset growth helps there as well. There were some lumpy placement fees in that brokerage revenues in Private Client Group this quarter.

But I would tell you the comp ratio, as I said on last quarter's call, really the biggest driver there was just the increase in compensable revenues in the Private Client Group business. That has an average payout between the employee and independent channel, as you know, of around 75%. And so we want those revenues to grow as much as possible, obviously. And they're going to grow, all else being equal, in the third quarter because fee-based revenues grew -- assets grew 7% during the quarter. So that's going to be a tailwind to compensable revenues in the Private Client Group business.

We've had a lot of peers that focused on the end client desktop, some because they were going direct to their end clients. We first wanted to put all the capabilities into our adviser's desktop. So it's been many years now since we've been completely mobile where advisers could do almost everything from their iPhones that they could do from their desktop. And making sure that our advisers have all the latest tools, planning tools and completely mobile very, very early on. Now not only are we enhancing those platforms, but we're bringing that same robust technology to those client connections. We believe our client app is very good. Our SAT scores are very high on our internal survey, which we do every year. But now we're connecting all that power of those apps into their clients, so that their integration is much closer as well as rolling out many things. We've been on this journey for 10 years and going from being having good technology to all of our recruits tell us from other firms as from an adviser desktop, leading technology. So -- but that battle never ends. People are always investing. So you'll see more of it on Investor Day. We believe it's been one of the impetuses of our strong recruiting and one of the trade-offs people have made of -- for the packages. It's the culture and the tools, and the support from our marketing department and all the other things we do to help advisers build their businesses."

We have significant appetite to grow the securities portfolio. Unfortunately, the supply and the kind of shorter duration paper, we have been buying -- trying to buy in that 3-year type duration average life range. And the supply, given the flat yield curve and where mortgages are being originated today in the longer end of the curve, there's just not a lot of paper out there that gives you that 3-year average life. And to the extent that you can find it, it's probably paying in the kind of 80 basis point range. So we have been proactive in investing and growing that part of the portfolio. The challenge is where most of the supply is, you're having to go out 4.5 kind of 5 years on an average life. And you get paid more, obviously. You're going to get somewhere north of 1%. But you're certainly not getting paid enough to take any level of inflation risk over that 5-year period, for example. And so we're looking at it closely, almost daily. We're looking at what's happening with spreads on the securities portfolio. We have a lot of significant appetite to grow it over time. But I would tell you now with the Fed buying as much as they're buying, particularly on the short end, there's just not a lot -- I mean there's a whole lot more demand and supply. And so we're going to continue to be patient just as we always are."

And if you add -- if you kind of ""normalize"" for business development, and I'm not sure what normal is, frankly, when we do get back to normal, it would get you right around that range. So we have been really focused on managing all the controllable aspects of noncompensation expenses, as you can see, but also a lot of it is growth driven. I mean so sub-advisory fees is going to grow with fee-based assets over time. They have FDIC insurance premiums that grow with the bank's balance sheet growth. Recruiting, as Paul said, is picking up substantially. There's going to be account transfer fees there.

But we have seen a little bit of a level off. But those balances, as we saw last year in March, can change dramatically with market volatility or downward trend in the market. So at 6.5% of assets, I would tell you, clients are -- I think right now, we're looking at around 60% exposure to equities, which when you look historically, clients are pretty engaged in the equity markets, which is what you would want given the run that we had. And a lot of the value that financial advisers provide is keeping clients consistent with their financial plans in periods like we had last year. So for us, we don't tend to see the exposure to the different asset segments that the e-brokers might see, et cetera, or the day traders might see. We tend to stay a lot more -- our clients tend to stay a lot more consistent as their advisers really keep them on their financial plans."

It has been a year since the financial markets bottomed, and the Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates to near 0. That move reduced our pretax run rate by 40%. The stock market has seen an incredible run since 2020, with the S&P 500 up 54% year-over-year. While that tailwind has certainly helped fuel our strong results, the records we generated during the quarter and first half of the fiscal year have also been driven by our unwavering commitment to providing excellent service to advisers and their clients during this difficult and unprecedented time. It's a testament to our advisers who have shepherded their clients through the pandemic and the wherewithal of our associates who have worked so hard to service our advisers and their clients, our strong balance sheet and our ability to grow both in constructive and challenging markets. Certainly, a year we will never forget on many levels.
Starting on Slide 3. The fiscal second quarter was another record quarter. The firm reported record net revenues of $2.37 billion, which were up 15% over the prior year's fiscal second quarter and 7% over the preceding quarter. Record net income of $355 million or $2.51 per diluted share increased 110% over net income in the year ago quarter and 14% over the preceding quarter. Annualized return on equity for the quarter was 19%, and return on tangible common equity was 21.2%, an extremely impressive result especially in this near 0 rate environment and given our strong capital position.
Record quarterly revenues were primarily driven by higher asset management and related administrative fees, investment banking revenues and record brokerage revenues, which more than offset the negative impact of lower short-term interest rates on both the net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks. Record quarterly net income was attributable to the record revenues, disciplined management of controllable expenses, the bank loan loss benefit of $32 million reflecting improving economic conditions and subdued business development expenses given the lack of business travel and conferences.
Moving to Slide 4. We ended the quarter with record total client assets under administration of $1.09 trillion, which were up 40% on a year-over-year basis and 6% sequentially. We also achieved records for PCG assets in fee-based accounts of $568 billion, a 7% sequential improvement, which will benefit the third quarter, and financial assets under management of $178 billion. We ended the quarter with a record 8,327 financial advisers, a net increase of 179 over the prior year's period and 94 over the preceding quarter. This represents a solid improvement over the prior quarter and reflects our strong retention and the continued strength of our recruiting pipelines across all of our affiliation options. Our recruiting momentum in the independent side of the business continues to be strong.
On the employee side, as we mentioned last quarter, in response to the increased recruiting packages by competitors, we enhanced our recruiting packages to be more competitive, while also ensuring attractive returns to our shareholders. And while recruiting momentum in this business has increased greatly, employee advisory count is down slightly from the prior quarter as improved recruiting was offset by a higher number of retirements where assets are typically retained at the firm as well as the smaller training class. However, the number of advisers scheduled to join is up significantly, not only in our employee channel, but across all of our affiliation options.
Looking at our recruiting results. Over the prior 4 quarters, financial advisers with approximately $285 million of trailing 12 months production and nearly $44 billion of assets at their prior firms affiliated with Raymond James domestically. As for our net organic growth results in the Private Client Group, we generated domestic PCG net new assets of nearly $54 billion over the 4 quarters ending on March 31, 2021, representing more than a 7.5% of domestic PCG assets at the beginning of the period. And remember, this is net of client fees. And this trend has accelerated during the first half of the fiscal year closer to a 9% annualized rate. We are very pleased with our consistent organic growth, especially given disruption associated with the COVID-19 pandemic during the year.
Now let's move to the segment results on Slide 5. The Private Client Group generated record quarterly net revenues of $1.65 billion and pretax income of $192 million, and 11.7% pretax margins, reflecting significant operating leverage despite being in a near 0 rate environment. Quarterly net revenues grew 12% over the preceding quarter, predominantly driven by higher asset management and related administrative fees, reflecting higher assets in fee-based accounts, which will continue to be a tailwind in the third quarter. Higher brokerage revenues also contributed to the quarterly revenue growth.
The Capital Markets segment generated quarterly net revenues of $433 million and pretax income of $105 million, driven by record brokerage revenue, record equity underwriting and strong M&A revenues. Despite not topping the extraordinarily strong and record-breaking first quarter results, the results this quarter were very strong, driven by broad-based strength across global equities and investment banking and fixed income businesses. The strong results reflect the significant investments we have made to strengthen our platform over the last 10 years, and we are continuing to make investments, including the recent acquisition of the consumer-focused M&A advisory firm, Financo, which closed at the end of the quarter, and we welcome Financo to the Raymond James family.
The Asset Management segment generated record net revenues of $209 million and record pretax income of $87 million. Record results were primarily due to growth of financial assets under management, driven by equity market appreciation and net inflows into fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group. Carillon Tower Advisers also generated significant net inflows during the quarter.
Lastly, Raymond James Bank generated quarterly net revenues of $160 million and pretax income of $111 million. Quarterly net revenues declined 24% compared to a year ago quarter, primarily due to the impact of lower short-term interest rates. Sequentially, quarterly net revenues declined 4% as higher asset balances were offset by the expected 8 basis points decline in the bank's net interest margin during the quarter, which was also largely attributable to the agency-backed securities portfolio. Pretax income growth was primarily due to the loan loss reserve release in the quarter compared to the provision for credit losses in both of the comparative periods. The credit quality of the bank's portfolio remains healthy, as Paul Shoukry will cover in more detail in his remarks.
Looking at the fiscal year-to-date results on Slide 6. We generated record net revenues of $4.59 billion during the first 6 months of the fiscal 2021, up 13% over the same period. Record earnings per diluted share of $4.74 increased 53% compared to the first 6 months of fiscal 2020, primarily due to the revenue growth, along with the loan loss reserve release compared to the provision for credit losses in the comparative period.
Moving to the fiscal year-to-date results on Slide 7. The Private Client Group, Capital Markets and Asset Management segments generated record net revenues and record pretax income during the first 6 months of the fiscal year. In fact, Capital Markets segment's pretax income for the first half of the fiscal year of $234 million actually exceeded the annual record of $225 million set in fiscal 2020. Again, these results reinforce the value of our diverse and complementary businesses.
And now for a more detailed review of the financial results, I'll turn the call over to Paul Shoukry. Paul?"

Record quarterly net revenues of $2.37 billion grew 15% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. As expected, Asset Management fees grew 10% sequentially, a bit lower than the 12% growth of fee-based assets during the preceding quarter, primarily due to 2 fewer billable days during the quarter.
Private Client Group assets and fee-based accounts were up 7% during the fiscal second quarter, providing a tailwind for this line item for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. Consolidated brokerage revenues of $591 million grew 15% over the prior year and represents a record, driven by continued strength in institutional fixed income as well as strong brokerage revenues in the Private Client Group, reflecting healthy client activity levels and higher asset values.
Account and service fees of $159 million declined 8% year-over-year, almost entirely due to the decrease in RJBDP fees from third-party banks given lower short-term interest rates, which I will discuss along with net interest income in more detail on the next 2 slides.
The 10% sequential increase was largely attributable to higher asset balances and revenues from our recent acquisition of NWPS, most of which are reflected in the client account and other fees line in the PCG segment. Consolidated investment banking revenues of $242 million grew 64% year-over-year, driven by strong M&A advisory revenues and record equity underwriting revenues. For the first half of the year, investment banking revenues were 74% higher than the first half of fiscal 2020. Our investment banking pipelines remain strong, so we would be really pleased to finish the fiscal year averaging $200 million or better of investment banking revenues per quarter if market conditions remain conducive. Other revenues of $44 million are down 21% sequentially, primarily due to lower private equity valuation gains during the quarter, partially offset by a strong quarter for the tax credit funds business.
Moving to Slide 10. Clients' domestic cash sweep balances, which are the primary source of funding for our interest-earning assets and the balances with third-party banks that generate RJBDP fees, ended with a quarter end record of $62.8 billion, increasing 2% sequentially and representing 6.5% of domestic PCG client assets. As we continue to experience growing cash balances and less demand from third-party banks, more client cash is being held in the client interest program at the broker dealer. You can see those balances grew to $9.5 billion, and most of that growth has been used to purchase short-term treasuries to meet the associated reserve requirement. Over time, that cash could be redeployed to our bank or third-party banks as capacity becomes available, which would hopefully earn a higher spread than we currently earn on short-term treasuries.
On Slide 11, the top chart displays our firm-wide net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks on a combined basis, as these 2 items are directly impacted by change in short-term interest rates. Related, we have updated the net interest margin, or NIM, chart on the bottom left portion of this slide to show NIM for both Raymond James Bank and the firm overall.
The combined net interest income and BDP fees from third-party banks declined a bit sequentially, largely due to fewer days during the quarter and NIM compression at the bank. As I mentioned on the last quarter's call, we would expect the bank's NIM to decline to around 1.9% over the next 2 quarters as the new agency security purchases have lower yield than the runoff, but still represent a higher yield than we are earning from third-party banks or in short-term treasuries. We also believe the average yield on RJBDP balances with third-party banks will remain close to 30 basis points for the rest of the fiscal year. But that could experience downward pressure in fiscal 2022, if bank's demand for deposits doesn't improve from current levels.
Moving to consolidated expenses on Slide 12. First, compensation expense, which is by far our largest expense. As expected, the compensation ratio increased sequentially from 67.5% to 69.5%, largely due to the revenue mix shift towards higher compensable revenues in the PCG segment as financial adviser payouts, particularly on the independent contractor side of the business where they cover most of their overhead costs, are typically much higher than the associated compensation in the other businesses. On a sequential basis, the compensation ratio was also impacted by the reset of payroll taxes that occurs in the first calendar quarter of each year.
As we explained on the last call, given our current revenue mix and disciplined management of expenses, we are confident we can maintain a compensation ratio of 70% or better in this near 0 short-term interest rate environment. Non-compensation expenses of $277 million decreased 32% compared to last year's second quarter and 14% sequentially, primarily driven by the $32 million bank loan loss benefit compared to provisions in the comparative periods. Business development expenses also remain subdued. But we expect those to increase over the next few quarters as business travel picks back up and conferences and recognition trips resume. Overall, you can see we have been really focused on managing controllable expenses while still investing in growth and ensuring high service levels for advisers and their clients.
Slide 13 shows the pretax margin trend over the past 5 quarters. Pretax margin was 18.8% in fiscal second quarter of 2021, which was boosted by record revenues, the loan loss reserve release and subdued business development expenses. On the last call, we talked about generating a 14% to 15% pretax margin in this near 0 interest rate environment. But as we experienced during the first half of the fiscal year, there's meaningful upside to our margin when capital markets results are so strong.
On Slide 14, at the end of the quarter, total assets were $56.1 billion, a 4% sequential increase, reflecting the dynamic I explained earlier with growth in client cash balances and associated segregated assets at the broker-dealer as well as solid growth of corporate loans and security based loans at Raymond James Bank. This balance sheet growth caused our Tier 1 leverage ratio to decrease to 12.2%, which is still well above the regulatory requirements and our more conservative target of 10%. Liquidity remains very strong with $1.7 billion of cash at the parent at the end of the quarter, leaving us with plenty of flexibility to be defensive and opportunistic.
During the quarter, we announced a debt offering, which closed at the beginning of our fiscal third quarter, so it was not reflected in any of the second quarter's numbers. To take advantage of the low rate environment, we raised $750 million of 30-year senior notes at 3.75%, and utilized the proceeds and cash on hand to early redeem our next 2 senior note maturities, effectively resulting in the same amount of senior notes outstanding, but with a much longer-term stable funding profile. In the third quarter, we expect to record losses associated with the early extinguishment of these notes, which should total somewhere around $90 million. To help with comparability, we will break those losses out as a non-GAAP adjustment in the fiscal third quarter.
Slide 15 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past 5 quarters. In the second quarter, we repurchased 500,000 shares for $60 million, an average price of approximately $120 per share. Over the first 2 quarters of the fiscal year, we repurchased shares for $70 million, and we remain committed to repurchasing a total of at least $200 million in fiscal 2021 to offset share-based compensation dilution. As of April 28, $680 million remain under the current share repurchase authorization.
Lastly, on Slide 16, we provide key credit metrics for Raymond James Bank. The credit quality of the bank's loan portfolio remains healthy with most trends continuing to improve. Nonperforming assets remained low at 9 basis points of total assets. However, criticized loans increased due to a handful of credit downgrades within our REIT portfolio, particularly in the hospitality sector. While all of those credits we downgraded continue to perform, have large cash balances and are starting to see improvement in their portfolios, we thought it was prudent to downgrade those credits. We had net charge-offs of $2 million in the quarter, which were related to opportunistic loan sales of $95 million at nearly 99% of par value. The bank loan loss benefit of $32 million was largely attributable to the macroeconomic inputs in the CECL model, which reflect an improved outlook, particularly for the commercial real estate and residential mortgage loan portfolios. 
Due to reserve releases and the loan growth during the quarter, the bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans declined from 1.71% to 1.50% at quarter end. For the corporate loan portfolios, these allowances are higher at around 2.6%. We believe we are adequately reserved, but that could change if economic conditions deteriorate. Our strong balance sheet and long-term focus was recently cited as a strength by Fitch ratings, who launched its long-term senior unsecured rating for Raymond James Financial of A- with a stable outlook.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Paul Reilly to discuss our outlook. Paul?"

So overall, a year into the global health pandemic, with near 0 short-term interest rates and during a quarter with lots of seasonal headwinds, such as fewer billable days and the reset of payroll taxes, I could not be more pleased with our record top and bottom line results this quarter. As for our outlook, we remained well positioned entering the third fiscal quarter with records for all of our key business metrics, strong financial adviser recruiting activity and robust pipelines for investment banking.
In the Private Client Group segment, while the recruiting environment is competitive and we face some challenges in a largely virtual environment, our financial adviser recruiting pipeline is strong across all of our affiliation options, and this segment is going to benefit by starting the fiscal third quarter with a 7% sequential increase in assets and fee-based accounts. The enhancements we made to the recruiting packages on the employee side of the business have been very well received by prospective advisers, and that pipeline has recovered nicely.
Our perspective advisers across all of our affiliation options have continued to be attracted by our leading technology solutions. We have been known for our industry-leading position in mobile adviser tools and continue to make our technology platform more robust. We have also created easy-to-use systems that put all the information advisers need right at their fingertips, so they can easily get the information they need to service their clients and have more time taking care of their clients and growing their business. As we continue to invest in our technology, we're extremely excited about the new enhancements, which will be coming out shortly.
We have been measuring our client satisfaction for the past 10 years using Net Promoter Scores, and I am proud to share that our client satisfaction has never been higher, both in terms of satisfaction with Raymond James as well as satisfaction with their advisers. In the Capital Markets segment, although there is still economic uncertainty due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the investment banking pipeline remains strong, and we expect fixed income brokerage results to remain elevated, particularly in the depository client segment where we have a leadership position.
In the Asset Management segment, results will be positively impacted by higher financial assets under management as long as the equity markets remain resilient. We were also pleased to see positive net flows for Carillon Tower Advisers in the quarter despite the structural headwinds for active asset managers. We hope that the one benefit of increased market volatility is that it reinforces the value of high-quality active asset managers. And Raymond James Bank should continue to benefit from the attractive growth of securities-based loans and mortgages to the Private Client Group segment. On a year-over-year basis, the growth of the securities-based loan has been impressive, around 38%. We'll also continue to be selective and deliberate in growing the corporate loan portfolio and the agency-backed securities portfolio as we have ample funding and capital to grow the balance sheet.
We continue to focus on long-term growth, and our priorities remain unchanged. Our top priority is organic growth, which is primarily driven by retaining and recruiting advisers in the Private Client Group. Additionally, we are continuing to add senior talent to all of our businesses. We also continue to actively pursue acquisitions, but we will still be deliberate and only pursue transactions that are a great cultural and strategic fit and at prices that we can deliver attractive returns to our shareholders. We have been even more proactive in sourcing and evaluating opportunities.
On Earth Day, last week, we released our first corporate responsibility report. The report summarizes our foundational commitment to people, sustainability, community and governance, and illustrates our long-standing approach to doing business, rooted in our values and brought to life through our people-driven culture. This report summarizes many of the inspiring things that our advisers and associates across the firm do to contribute to their communities and the things we do as a firm to help the environment. We look forward to building on this inaugural report by maintaining transparency and sharing progress over time.

As you said, we will discuss that in a lot more detail at the upcoming Analyst/Investor Day. And really, the decline to 12.2% this quarter was primarily attributable to the increase in client cash balances, and we're accommodating more of that on our balance sheet at the broker dealer, frankly, because the third-party bank demand with all of the banks flushed with cash right now has declined. At the broker dealer, we -- to fulfill the associated reserve requirement, we're repurchasing short-term treasuries. And we hope that we can, over time, redeploy that into more profitable growth at the bank. But in terms of how we think about getting to 10% over time, it's really going to be a combination of growing the balance sheet, which primarily occurs for us at Raymond James Bank, as you know.
You alluded to the strong loan growth in the quarter of 4%. We are still being very deliberate in growing the portfolio, both the Private Client Group loans. Securities-based loans grew almost 40% year-over-year. And mortgages have seen good growth as well, although there's been a high degree of runoffs and refinancing there. And we're starting to really be deliberate in growing the corporate loan portfolio, although there still continues to be more demand and supply in the market with banks being flushed with cash.
And then the second component of managing the capital ratio is really deploying the capital. You saw us do the buybacks this quarter to offset the dilution. We'll continue to do that and be opportunistic if the prices are at attractive levels. And then, of course, you just heard Paul mention the focus on acquisitions as well, as another way to deploy capital."

So it's happening everywhere.
And then on recruitment, we measure -- we don't publish what we call commits, and those are people saying, I'm coming. What you see are the people that sign. So it's like almost M&A. You're in a transaction, but we don't count it until it closes. It's the same in recruiting. But our commits are way up in every channel, all of our channels.

And then it varies by line, for example, the mutual fund line, 65% to 70% of that is asset based. And so obviously, that has grown nicely as assets have grown and the trail commissions have grown as well. But you can also see that the transactional commissions from equities, ETFs and fixed incomes, they're up 13% sequentially as well. So good level of client activity. Obviously, the asset growth helps there as well. There were some lumpy placement fees in that brokerage revenues in Private Client Group this quarter.

That has an average payout between the employee and independent channel, as you know, of around 75%. And so we want those revenues to grow as much as possible, obviously. And they're going to grow, all else being equal, in the third quarter because fee-based revenues grew -- assets grew 7% during the quarter.

We have significant appetite to grow the securities portfolio. Unfortunately, the supply and the kind of shorter duration paper, we have been buying -- trying to buy in that 3-year type duration average life range. And the supply, given the flat yield curve and where mortgages are being originated today in the longer end of the curve, there's just not a lot of paper out there that gives you that 3-year average life. And to the extent that you can find it, it's probably paying in the kind of 80 basis point range. So we have been proactive in investing and growing that part of the portfolio.
The challenge is where most of the supply is, you're having to go out 4.5 kind of 5 years as -- on average life. And you get paid more, obviously. You're going to get somewhere north of 1%. But you're certainly not getting paid enough to take any level of inflation risk over that 5-year period, for example. And so we're looking at it closely, almost daily. We're looking at what's happening with spreads on the securities portfolio. We have a lot of significant appetite to grow it over time. But I would tell you now with the Fed buying as much as they're buying, particularly on the short end, there's just not a lot -- I mean there's a whole lot more demand than supply. And so we're going to continue to be patient just as we always are."

And if you add -- if you kind of ""normalize"" for business development, and I'm not sure what normal is, frankly, when we do get back to normal, it would get you right around that range.
So we have been really focused on managing all the controllable aspects of noncompensation expenses, as you can see, but also a lot of it is growth driven. I mean so sub-advisory fees is going to grow with fee-based assets over time. They have FDIC insurance premiums that grow with the bank's balance sheet growth. Recruiting, as Paul said, it's picking up substantially. There's going to be account transfer fees there. So a lot of the non-comp expense growth, as we are a growth company, are intended to grow over time, but we are focused on growing revenues at a faster rate than expenses over time as well.

So at 6.5% of assets, I would tell you, clients are -- I think right now, we're looking at around 60% exposure to equities, which when you look historically, clients are pretty engaged in the equity markets, which is what you would want given the run that we had. And a lot of the value that financial advisers provide is keeping clients consistent with their financial plans in periods like we had last year. So for us, we don't tend to see the exposure to the different asset segments that the e-brokers might see, et cetera, or the day traders might see. We tend to stay a lot more -- our clients tend to stay a lot more consistent as their advisers really keep them on their financial plans."

I'm actually joining you today from Chicago where we've had a number of day meetings with some of our top independent advisers. So it's great to see both their success during the pandemic and their excitement as we move forward. It's kind of hard to believe now. It's been over 16 months since it's a pandemic, and we're just starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel with the distribution of vaccines. And now the spread of Delta variant reminds us that we could be dealing with this one way or another for quite some time. 
Fortunately, our economy has really proven to be resilient and creative, quickly adapting to these changes, which has facilitated the recovery of our economy, the stock market over the past year. Similarly, our advisers and associates have been just simply amazing. I'm really proud of what they've been able to do, enabling Raymond James to achieve these record for the first 9 months of fiscal 2021. 
So why don't we move on to Slide 3 with our quarterly results. The fiscal third quarter was another strong quarter with several, I guess, many records. The firm reported record net revenue of $2.7 billion, net income of $307 million and earnings per diluted share of $2.18. Excluding the losses on extinguishment of debt of $98 million and $7 million of acquisition-related expenses, adjusted quarterly net income was $386 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share were $2.74, both records. The increase in quarterly net revenue was largely driven by record asset management and related administrative fees and record investment banking revenues during the quarter. Adjusted net income growth was due to the aforementioned higher net revenues, along with the loan loss reserve release in the quarter compared to a provision for credit losses a year ago. Annualized return on equity for the quarter was 15.9% and the adjusted return on tangible common equity was 22.2%. And really an impressive result, especially in this near 0 rate environment and given our strong capital position. 
Moving to Slide 4, and we'll see that the quarter ended with record total client assets under administration of $1.17 trillion, which were up 33% on a year-over-year basis and 7% sequentially. We also achieved record PCG assets and fee-based accounts of $617 billion, a 9% sequential improvement, which will benefit the fourth quarter, and record financial assets under management of $191 billion. We ended the quarter with record 8,413 financial advisers and that's net increases of 258 over the prior year period and 86% over the preceding quarter. Adviser recruiting has been robust even in this very competitive market. 
Over the prior 4 quarters, financial advisers with approximately $325 million of trailing 12 production and nearly $53 billion of assets at their prior firms affiliated with Raymond James domestically. As for our net organic growth results in the Private Client Group, we generated domestic PCG net new assets of nearly $69 billion over the 4 quarters ending in June 30, 2021, representing more than 8.5% of domestic PCG assets at the beginning of the period. And remember, this is net of client fees. 
And this trend has accelerated throughout the 12-month period with the past 2 quarters, reaching an annualized rate over 9%. So far this fiscal year is shaping up to be very strong in terms of adviser retention as well as attracting new advisers to the Raymond James platform through our multiple affiliation options. In fact, we are on track for a record year of adviser recruiting in fiscal 2021. We remain focused, though, on providing a superior platform to support advisers and their clients and also helping advisers grow their practice, and it's resonating well in the market. Advisers are attracted to our leading technology solutions as well as our adviser and client-centric cultures. 
Let's move on to Slide 5. The Private Client Group generated record quarterly net revenues of $1.7 billion and pretax income of $195 million, an 11.5% pretax margin reflecting significant operating leverage over the past year. Quarterly net revenues grew 3% over the preceding quarter, predominantly driven by higher asset management and related administrative fees, reflecting higher assets and fee-based accounts, which will also provide a tailwind for the fourth quarter. 
The Capital Markets segment generated quarterly net revenues of $446 million and pretax income of $115 million, driven by record investment banking revenues and a continued very solid fixed income brokerage revenue performance. The strong result reflects the significant investments we've made to strengthen our platform over the last 10 years, and we are continuing to make investments, including the recently completed acquisition of the consumer-focused M&A advisory firm, Financo, and the announcement of the acquisition of Sibio, a leading private funds placement age of the secondary market to private equities. 
We are excited to welcome [ Sunit ] and her team to the Raymond James family when we closed Sibio, currently expected to be in the fiscal fourth quarter. 
The Asset Management segment generated record net revenues of $225 million and record pretax income of $105 million. These results are primarily due to the growth of financial assets under management driven by equity market appreciation and net inflows into fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group, partially offset by the modest quarterly net outflows for Carillon Towers Associates, following a solid quarter of net inflows in the fiscal second quarter. 
Turning to the bank. Record net loans of $23.9 billion grew 13% over the prior year and 4% sequentially. This growth was primarily driven by the strong growth of securities-based loans to PCG clients of more than 50% and 14%, respectively. This is a loan category we continue to see good opportunities for growth and attractive risk-adjusted returns. 
Raymond James Bank generated quarterly net revenues of $169 million and pretax income of $104 million. Quarterly net revenues declined 5% compared to a year ago quarter, primarily due to the impact of lower short-term interest rates. Sequential quarterly net revenue grew 6% as higher asset balances offset the modest compression in the bank's net interest margin during the quarter. Pretax income growth year-over-year was primarily due to the loan loss reserve release in the quarter compared to a provision for credit losses a year ago period. The credit quality of the bank's loan portfolio remains healthy, as Paul Shoukry will cover in more detail in his remarks. 
Looking at the fiscal year-to-date results on Slide 6, we generated record net revenues of $7.07 billion during the first 9 months of fiscal 2021, up 20% over the same period a year ago. And despite the losses on extinguishment of the debt this quarter, we still generated record net earnings per diluted share of $6.92 for the first 9 months of 2021. Adjusted net income was $1.06 billion, up 73% from the net income in fiscal 2020. 
And given all the unique circumstances, I think it's also worth comparing our results so far in fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2019, a very strong year for Raymond James. When comparing the first 9 months of fiscal 2021 to the first 9 months of fiscal 2019, net revenues have grown 24%. Net income has grown 27% and adjusted net income has grown 35%, truly spectacular results, particularly given the 0 interest rate environment this fiscal year. 
Moving to the fiscal year-to-date segment results on Slide 7. The Private Client Group, Capital Markets and Asset Management segments all generated record net revenues and record pretax income during the first 9 months of the fiscal year. Again, these results reinforce the value of our diverse and complementary businesses. 
Before I turn the call over to Paul, I wanted to highlight a separate announcement we made this morning. We announced our firm's intention to make an offer for the entire issued and to-be-issued share capital of a U.K.-based Charles Stanley Group at a price of $5.15 per share. or approximately GBP 279 million, the U.S. equivalent of approximately $387 million. 
Charles Stanley is a firm we've admired for a long time and has a tremendous reputation 200-year heritage and a talented pool of wealth managers and professionals. The 2 firms share a common and increasingly rare client-centric approach where the primary client relationship is held by the individual wealth managers. Raymond James subsidiary, the U.K. RJIS has operated in the U.K. for over 20 years under strong leadership and has experienced exceptional growth. This combination with Charles Stanley would provide the opportunity for further accelerated growth in the U.K., the second largest English-speaking wealth management market. 
Charles Stanley is nearly 200 wealth managers and GBP 27.1 billion in client assets, bringing our total U.K. assets to over GBP 40 billion. Additionally, Charles Stanley, multiple affiliation options would give Raymond James the ability to offer affiliation choices consistent with our models in Canada and the U.S. and greatly accelerate the growth of the RJIS newly launched employee affiliation model, while building on its market-leading independent contracting and investment management services businesses. 
As I mentioned, the announcement today is our intention to make this software. We expect the offer to be made in approximately a month. Regulations issued by the U.K. takeover panel limit is what we can further say at this point but we will provide updates as more information is made available. 
Now for a more detailed review of our third quarter results, I'm going to turn it over to Paul. Paul?"

Record quarterly net revenues of $2.47 billion grew 35% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Record Asset Management fees grew 8% sequentially, commensurate with the sequential increase of fee-based assets in the preceding quarter. 
Private Client Group assets and fee-based accounts were up 9% during the fiscal third quarter providing a tailwind for this line item for the fourth quarter. Consolidated brokerage revenues of $552 million grew 14% over the prior year, but declined 7% from the record set in the preceding quarter. Institutional fixed income brokerage revenues remain solid, albeit down from the record set in the preceding quarter. 
Brokerage revenues in PCG were up 22% on a year-over-year basis but down 6% sequentially due to lower trading volumes as well as a large placement fee in the preceding quarter. Account and service fees of $161 million increased 20% year-over-year and 1% sequentially, largely due to higher average mutual fund balances. Record consolidated investment banking revenues of $276 million grew 99% year-over-year and 14% sequentially, driven by record M&A revenues and strong debt and equity underwriting results. Our investment banking pipelines remain strong, so we would be pleased if fourth quarter revenues came in around the average for the quarterly revenues generated over the first 3 quarters of the fiscal year, that would have been about $260 million on average. But of course, this line item is inherently difficult to predict. 
Other revenues of $55 million were up 25% sequentially, primarily due to $24 million of private equity valuation gains during the quarter, of which approximately $10 million were attributable to noncontrolling interests, which are reflected in the other expenses. 
Moving to Slide 10. Clients' domestic cash sweep balances ended the quarter at $62.9 billion, essentially flat compared to the preceding quarter and representing 6.1% of domestic PCG client assets. As we continue to experience growing cash balances and less demand from third-party banks during fiscal 2021, $8.6 billion of the client cash is being held in the client interest program at the broker-dealer. Over time, that cash could be redeployed to our bank or third-party banks as capacity becomes available, which would hopefully earn a higher spread than we currently earn on short-term treasuries. 
On Slide 11, the top chart displays our firm-wide net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks on a combined basis, as these 2 items are directly impacted by changes in short-term interest rates. The combined net interest income in BDPs from third-party banks of $183 million were up slightly compared to the preceding quarter as modest NIM compression was offset by growth in client cash balances and higher asset balances in Raymond James Bank. However, it's still down significantly from the peak of $329 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, really highlighting the remarkable results we have been able to generate despite near 0 short-term interest rates. 
In the lower left portion of the slide, we show net interest margin, or NIM, for both RJ Bank and the firm overall. We continue to expect the bank's NIM to decline to just around or just below 1.9% over the next quarter or 2. The average yield on RJBDP balances with third-party banks declined 1 basis point to 29 basis points in the quarter. We believe this average yield will remain around this level for the rest of the fiscal year but there will likely be downward pressure in this yield in fiscal 2022, especially in the back half of the fiscal year if banks demand for deposits don't improve from current levels. 
Moving to consolidated expenses on Slide 12. First, our largest expense compensation. The compensation ratio decreased sequentially from 69.5% to 67.2%, largely due to record revenues in the Capital Markets segment, which had a 57% comp ratio during the quarter and the benefit from the private equity valuation gains, which do not have direct compensation associated with them. 
Given our current revenue mix and disciplined manage of expenses, we remain confident we can maintain a compensation ratio lower than 70% in this near 0 short-term interest rate environment. And as I've said over the past few quarters, we could outperform that just as we did in the fiscal third quarter with capital markets revenues at or near these levels. Noncompensation expenses of $425 million increased 18% compared to last year's third quarter and 53% sequentially, primarily driven by the $98 million loss on extinguishment of debt, acquisition-related expenses, the noncontrolling interest of $10 million and other expenses related to our private equity valuation gains and higher business development expenses. 
As we discussed last quarter, we successfully executed a debt offering in the fiscal third quarter to take advantage of the low rate environment and significantly extend the maturities of our existing balances. We raised $750 million of 30-year senior note to 3.75% and utilize the proceeds and cash on hand to early redeem our next 2 senior notes that were maturing in 2024 and 2026, effectively resulting in the same amount of senior notes outstanding. This resulted in $98 million in losses associated with the early extinguishment of those notes but in doing so, locked in very low rates for 30 years, while significantly extending the duration and stability of our funding profile. 
Overall, our results show we have remained focused on managing controllable expenses while still investing in growth across all of our businesses and ensuring high service levels for advisers and their clients. Excluding the debt extinguishment expense, we do expect non-compensation expense to continue picking up over the next few quarters as hopefully, travel, recognition trips and conferences continue to resume, and we continue to increase our investments in technology and high-quality service levels for our growing business. We would eventually expect loan loss provisions associated with net loan growth as well. 
Slide 13 shows the pretax margin trend over the past 5 quarters, pretax margin was 15.6% in fiscal third quarter of 2021 and adjusted pretax margin was 19.8% which was boosted by record revenues, the loan loss reserve release and still relatively subdued business development expenses. At our Analyst and Investor Day in June, we outlined a pretax margin target of 15% to 16% and in this near 0 interest rate environment. But as we experienced during the first 9 months of the fiscal year, there is meaningful upside to our margins when capital markets results are strong, and improving macroeconomic trends lead to releases of our allowances for credit losses. 
On Slide 14, at the end of the quarter, total assets were approximately $57.2 billion, a 2% sequential increasing -- increase reflecting solid growth of securities-based loans at Raymond James Bank. 
Liquidity and capital levels are very strong, with cash at the [ parent ] of approximately $1.56 billion, a total capital ratio of 25.5% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 12.6%. We have substantial amount of flexibility to be both defensive and opportunistic. The third quarter effective tax rate of 20.3% benefited from nontaxable gains in the corporate life insurance portfolio, we would expect that tax rate to be around 21% in the fiscal fourth quarter, assuming a flat equity market. 
Slide 15 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past 5 quarters. In the third quarter, we repurchased 375,000 shares for $48 million. As of July 28, $632 million remains available under the current share repurchase authorization. But as Paul Reilly will discuss, our priority continues to be deploying capital to grow our businesses. 
Lastly, on Slide 16, we provide key credit metrics for Raymond James Bank. The credit quality of the bank's loan portfolio remains healthy with most trends continuing to improve. Nonperforming assets remained low at just 12 basis points of total assets and criticized loans declined sequentially. 
The bank loan loss benefit of $19 million reflects an improved outlook for economic conditions and higher credit ratings on average within the corporate loan portfolio. Due to reserve releases and loan growth during the quarter, the bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percent of total loans declined from 1.5% to 1.34% at the quarter end. For the corporate portfolio, these allowances are higher at around 2.4%. We believe we're adequately reserved, but that could change if economic conditions deteriorate. Now I'll turn the call back over to Paul Reilly to discuss our outlook. Paul?"

So overall, I'm very pleased with our strong results for this quarter, which top many records, and did so in spite of the persistent challenges of the global health pandemic and near 0 short-term rates. As for the outlook, we remain well",494,"Thank you, Paul. So overall, I'm very pleased with our strong results for this quarter, which top many records, and did so in spite of the persistent challenges of the global health pandemic and near 0 short-term rates. As for the outlook, we remain well positioned entering the fourth fiscal quarter with records of many of our key business metrics, strong pipelines for financial adviser recruiting and investment banking. 
In the Private Client Group, results will benefit by starting the fourth quarter with a 9% increase of assets and fee-based accounts. With the strong recruiting pipeline, we are on track for a record fiscal year recruiting as prospective advisers across all of the affiliation options have continued to be attracted to our platform, including the leading technology solution, our adviser and client-centric culture. These recruiting results are primarily strong, given the very competitive market for experienced advisers. 
In Capital Markets segment, the investment banking pipeline remains strong, and we expect solid fixed income brokerage results driven by demand from depository client segment. However, keep in mind, these -- there is still an economic uncertainty due to the ongoing pandemic that could impact these results. 
In the Asset Management segment, if equity markets remain resilient, we expect results to be positively impacted by higher financial assets under management. Active asset managers continue to face structural headwinds. However, we are pleased to see positive net flows on a fiscal year-to-date basis for Carillon Tower Associates. We hope that the one benefit of increased market volatility is that it reinforces the value of our high-quality asset at managers. And Raymond James Bank should continue to grow as we have ample funding and capital to grow the balance sheet. We'll continue to focus on lending to PCG clients through securities-based loans and mortgages. And we'll continue to be selective and deliberate in growing our corporate loan and agency-backed securities portfolio. 
As we look further ahead, we remain focused on the long-term growth. And as we've outlined at our recent Analyst and Investor Day, those key growth initiatives include driving organic growth across all of our core businesses, continue to expand our investments in technology and sharpening our focus on strategic M&A. Today's announcement of our firm's intention to make an offer for Charles Stanley Group demonstrates our focus on these initiatives and our commitment to deploy excess capital over time. We believe this acquisition stays true to our long-standing criteria for acquisitions. So first, being a good cultural fit, a good strategic fit, it makes financial sense for shareholders and something we can integrate. 
I also want to once again take a moment to thank our advisers and associates. They've been amazing at being able to provide excellent service to their clients to these difficult times. I'm very proud to be a part of the special Raymond James' family. 
Thank you all for attending. With that, operator, Tommy, I'm going to turn it over to you for questions."

Charles Stanley brings first culture identical to us. It's stewarded by the Howard family for generations. I think the fourth generations in the business has the very same value of client-centric adviser-centric culture and has multichannel. So the combination gets us at GBP 40 billion and really gives us the mass to utilize a lot of the things they've done well and to continue to grow that business and really give us the base to make a difference. So it's not saying we're not choosing it over the U.S., Canada or the U.K., we believe in all 3 of those markets.

So over the next quarter or 2, obviously, depends somewhat on asset mix and the growth of the agency MBS portfolio, which we've essentially decelerated over the last quarter, just given where rates are. We would expect to come in right around that 1.9%, give or take a couple of basis points over the next quarter or 2. 
As far as the yield on the BDP balances with third-party banks, there is a significant portion of our deposits that mature contractually over the next, I would say, 6 to 12 months. Right now, the sort of market rate for new deposits, if you can even get capacity is much lower than the 30 basis points or the 29 basis points that we're currently earning on average. 
But remember, if the yield on those deposits aren't attractive with those third-party banks, we have the the capital flexibility going back to Paul's comments earlier to bring those cash balances on the balance sheet and invest in other assets. So I don't think it's as easy as a formula of just assuming that those balances reset at a lower yield off balance sheet because depending on what we can in our off-balance sheet, it may be more compelling to bring it on balance sheet and invest in other assets at the bank securities and/or loans."

I would tell you, Steve, that the primary driver of the NIM compression because most of the short-term rates are reflected in sort of the yields of the various asset categories. Most of our asset categories are floating in nature. So they reflect the kind of rate environment that we're in. So most of the NIM dynamic going forward is really going to be driven by asset mix. So for example, this quarter, we grew securities-based loans on a net basis, $700 million, which is a truly fantastic growth, 14% sequentially, over 50% year-over-year. And those have -- those are fully secured with marketable securities and help strengthen the relationships between advisers and their clients in the Private Client Group. So we love that asset. But that yield is 2.2% on average in the quarter, whereas the corporate loans are in the 2.5% to 2.6%. And they have been growing, we can resume growth there, but not to the same extent as SBL. 
So just by the change in mix, to sort of the lower risk categories like securities-based loans, that's going to put downward pressure on your NIM, all else being equal. As far as the breakeven analysis, I wish it was that simple. There's a lot of variables that go into that to bring it on balance sheet, obviously, uses capital. And then you have to essentially take either duration and/or credit risk to earn a higher yield. And so -- and that higher yield changes week-to-week depending on the latest Fed announcement. 
So one thing is certain, if we don't have the capacity of balance sheet or the capacity is at very low rates, then the -- bringing it on balance sheet certainly looks more attractive on a relative basis. And that's something that we have, the capital and the appetite to do, if necessary."

I would say the $1.3 billion jumping off rate, I want to say that our quarterly revenues at that time were somewhere around $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. I don't remember exactly when that was, but we're at $2.5 billion now. So just the business is a lot bigger now. And there's a lot of expenses that are directly associated with the size of our business, whether it be sub-advisory fees that support the asset management business, whether it be FDIC insurance expense, which supports the bank branches -- branch expense as we continue to recruit more advisers. We've done a couple of acquisitions. We just announced another one. So a lot has changed since we provided that $1.3 billion metric, which backs the question, when are we going to provide more new guidance and a new threshold. And I would say we want to do that as soon as there's more clarity, kind of, on the go-forward path, particularly for things like business development expense. In fiscal '19, before the pandemic, that was running at around $200 million for the year, $50 million a quarter. So even this quarter's number of $31 million is well below that as an example. And then loan loss provisions as well. Obviously, that is something that's going to be volatile until there's more kind of economic certainty or clarity going forward. So as soon as there is more certainty around what these expenses will look like, we will certainly be transparent as we always are and try to provide you better guidance."

They have no thoughts or slowing down either. 
So again, short to midterm, I think it's sustainable. The recruiting has been good across all the options, which is ironic, too, sometimes. We got slowed down a little bit a few quarters ago when the private -- when they're employed channel, the offices were closed, and we were adjusting, but that's really taken off, and it's going to hit a record probably. It's on a pace to hit a record this year even after that very slow start. So we're seeing it all across the affiliation options. So the pipeline is very strong.

And welcome to the story. I'm glad to have you part of the coverage universe. Yes, one of the biggest drivers, and we can get into more detail offline for -- that impacts the tax rate quarter-to-quarter is we have a corporate-owned life insurance portfolio, which we use to sort of fund the -- some of our nonqualified benefits that we offer our associates. And so the way that corporate-owned life insurance portfolio, those balances work is that when the equity market appreciates that typically results in nontaxable gains in that portfolio which means that our effective tax rate, all else being equal, is lower and vice versa when the equity market goes in the other direction. It results in nondeductible losses, which means our effective tax rate, all else being equal, goes higher. So typically, the trend is when the equity markets are up, our effective tax rate is lower and vice versa. Again, there's a lot of other factors, but that is the factor that seems to be the most sort of volatile or impactful from quarter-to-quarter."

Thank you, Kristie. I'm actually joining you today from Chicago where we've had a number of day meetings with some of our top independent advisers.

I'm actually joining you today from Chicago where we've had a number of day meetings with some of our top independent advisers. So it's great to see both their success during the pandemic and their excitement as we move forward. It's kind of hard to believe now. It's been over 16 months since it's a pandemic, and we're just starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel with the distribution of vaccines. And now the spread of Delta variant reminds us that we could be dealing with this one way or another for quite some time. 
Fortunately, our economy has really proven to be resilient and creative, quickly adapting to these changes, which has facilitated the recovery of our economy, the stock market over the past year. Similarly, our advisers and associates have been just simply amazing. I'm really proud of what they've been able to do, enabling Raymond James to achieve these record for the first 9 months of fiscal 2021. 
So why don't we move on to Slide 3 with our quarterly results. The fiscal third quarter was another strong quarter with several, I guess, many records. The firm reported record net revenue of $2.7 billion, net income of $307 million and earnings per diluted share of $2.18. Excluding the losses on extinguishment of debt of $98 million and $7 million of acquisition-related expenses, adjusted quarterly net income was $386 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share were $2.74, both records. 
The increase in quarterly net revenue was largely driven by record asset management and related administrative fees and record investment banking revenues during the quarter. Adjusted net income growth was due to the aforementioned higher net revenues, along with the loan loss reserve release in the quarter compared to a provision for credit losses a year ago. Annualized return on equity for the quarter was 15.9% and the adjusted return on tangible common equity was 22.2%, really an impressive result, especially in this near 0 rate environment and given our strong capital position. 
Moving to Slide 4, and we'll see that the quarter ended with record total client assets under administration of $1.17 trillion, which were up 33% on a year-over-year basis and 7% sequentially. We also achieved record PCG assets and fee-based accounts of $617 billion, a 9% sequential improvement, which will benefit the fourth quarter, and record financial assets under management of $191 billion. We ended the quarter with record 8,413 financial advisers and that's net increases of 258 over the prior year period and 86% over the preceding quarter. Adviser recruiting has been robust even in this very competitive market. 
Over the prior 4 quarters, financial advisers with approximately $325 million of trailing 12 production and nearly $53 billion of assets at their prior firms affiliated with Raymond James domestically. As for our net organic growth results in the Private Client Group, we generated domestic PCG net new assets of nearly $69 billion over the 4 quarters ending in June 30, 2021, representing more than 8.5% of domestic PCG assets at the beginning of the period. And remember, this is net of client fees. 
And this trend has accelerated throughout the 12-month period with the past 2 quarters, reaching an annualized rate over 9%. So far this fiscal year is shaping up to be very strong in terms of adviser retention as well as attracting new advisers to the Raymond James platform through our multiple affiliation options. In fact, we are on track for a record year of adviser recruiting in fiscal 2021. 
We remain focused, though, on providing a superior platform to support advisers and their clients and also helping advisers grow their practice, and it's resonating well in the market. Advisers are attracted to our leading technology solutions as well as our adviser and client-centric cultures. 
Let's move on to Slide 5. The Private Client Group generated record quarterly net revenues of $1.7 billion and pretax income of $195 million, an 11.5% pretax margin reflecting significant operating leverage over the past year. Quarterly net revenues grew 3% over the preceding quarter, predominantly driven by higher asset management and related administrative fees, reflecting higher assets and fee-based accounts, which will also provide a tailwind for the fourth quarter. 
The Capital Markets segment generated quarterly net revenues of $446 million and pretax income of $115 million, driven by record investment banking revenues and a continued very solid fixed income brokerage revenue performance. The strong result reflects the significant investments we've made to strengthen our platform over the last 10 years, and we are continuing to make investments, including the recently completed acquisition of the consumer-focused M&A advisory firm, Financo, and the announcement of the acquisition of Sibio, a leading private funds placement age of the secondary market to private equities. 
We are excited to welcome [indiscernible] and her team to the Raymond James family when we closed Sibio, currently expected to be in the fiscal fourth quarter. 
The Asset Management segment generated record net revenues of $225 million and record pretax income of $105 million. These results are primarily due to the growth of financial assets under management driven by equity market appreciation and net inflows into fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group, partially offset by the modest quarterly net outflows for Carillon Towers Associates, following a solid quarter of net inflows in the fiscal second quarter. 
Turning to the bank. Record net loans of $23.9 billion grew 13% over the prior year and 4% sequentially. This growth was primarily driven by the strong growth of securities-based loans to PCG clients of more than 50% and 14%, respectively. This is a loan category we continue to see good opportunities for growth and attractive risk-adjusted returns. 
Raymond James Bank generated quarterly net revenues of $169 million and pretax income of $104 million. Quarterly net revenues declined 5% compared to a year ago quarter, primarily due to the impact of lower short-term interest rates. Sequential quarterly net revenue grew 6% as higher asset balances offset the modest compression in the bank's net interest margin during the quarter. Pretax income growth year-over-year was primarily due to the loan loss reserve release in the quarter compared to a provision for credit losses a year ago period. The credit quality of the bank's loan portfolio remains healthy, as Paul Shoukry will cover in more detail in his remarks. 
Looking at the fiscal year-to-date results on Slide 6, we generated record net revenues of $7.07 billion during the first 9 months of fiscal 2021, up 20% over the same period a year ago. And despite the losses on extinguishment of the debt this quarter, we still generated record net earnings per diluted share of $6.92 for the first 9 months of 2021. Adjusted net income was $1.06 billion, up 73% from the net income in fiscal 2020. 
And given all the unique circumstances, I think it's also worth comparing our results so far in fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2019, a very strong year for Raymond James. When comparing the first 9 months of fiscal 2021 to the first 9 months of fiscal 2019, net revenues have grown 24%. Net income has grown 27% and adjusted net income has grown 35%, truly spectacular results, particularly given the 0 interest rate environment this fiscal year. 
Moving to the fiscal year-to-date segment results on Slide 7. The Private Client Group, Capital Markets and Asset Management segments all generated record net revenues and record pretax income during the first 9 months of the fiscal year. Again, these results reinforce the value of our diverse and complementary businesses. 
Before I turn the call over to Paul, I wanted to highlight a separate announcement we made this morning. We announced our firm's intention to make an offer for the entire issued and to-be-issued share capital of a U.K.-based Charles Stanley Group at a price of $5.15 per share. or approximately GBP 279 million, the U.S. equivalent of approximately $387 million. 
Charles Stanley is a firm we've admired for a long time and has a tremendous reputation 200-year heritage and a talented pool of wealth managers and professionals. The 2 firms share a common and increasingly rare client-centric approach where the primary client relationship is held by the individual wealth managers. Raymond James subsidiary, the U.K. RJIS has operated in the U.K. for over 20 years under strong leadership and has experienced exceptional growth. This combination with Charles Stanley would provide the opportunity for further accelerated growth in the U.K., the second largest English-speaking wealth management market. 
Charles Stanley is nearly 200 wealth managers and GBP 27.1 billion in client assets, bringing our total U.K. assets to over GBP 40 billion. Additionally, Charles Stanley, multiple affiliation options would give Raymond James the ability to offer affiliation choices consistent with our models in Canada and the U.S. and greatly accelerate the growth of the RJIS newly launched employee affiliation model, while building on its market-leading independent contracting and investment management services businesses. 
As I mentioned, the announcement today is our intention to make this software. We expect the offer to be made in approximately a month. Regulations issued by the U.K. takeover panel limit is what we can further say at this point, but we will provide updates as more information is made available. 
Now for a more detailed review of our third quarter results, I'm going to turn it over to Paul. Paul?"

Record quarterly net revenues of $2.47 billion grew 35% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Record Asset Management fees grew 8% sequentially, commensurate with the sequential increase of fee-based assets in the preceding quarter. 
Private Client Group assets and fee-based accounts were up 9% during the fiscal third quarter providing a tailwind for this line item for the fourth quarter. Consolidated brokerage revenues of $552 million grew 14% over the prior year but declined 7% from the record set in the preceding quarter. Institutional fixed income brokerage revenues remain solid, albeit down from the record set in the preceding quarter. 
Brokerage revenues in PCG were up 22% on a year-over-year basis but down 6% sequentially due to lower trading volumes as well as a large placement fee in the preceding quarter. Account and service fees of $161 million increased 20% year-over-year and 1% sequentially, largely due to higher average mutual fund balances. Record consolidated investment banking revenues of $276 million grew 99% year-over-year and 14% sequentially, driven by record M&A revenues and strong debt and equity underwriting results. Our investment banking pipelines remain strong, so we would be pleased if fourth quarter revenues came in around the average for the quarterly revenues generated over the first 3 quarters of the fiscal year, that would have been about $260 million on average. But of course, this line item is inherently difficult to predict. 
Other revenues of $55 million were up 25% sequentially, primarily due to $24 million of private equity valuation gains during the quarter, of which approximately $10 million were attributable to noncontrolling interests, which are reflected in the other expenses. 
Moving to Slide 10. Clients' domestic cash sweep balances ended the quarter at $62.9 billion, essentially flat compared to the preceding quarter and representing 6.1% of domestic PCG client assets. As we continue to experience growing cash balances and less demand from third-party banks during fiscal 2021, $8.6 billion of the client cash is being held in the client interest program at the broker-dealer. Over time, that cash could be redeployed to our bank or third-party banks as capacity becomes available, which would hopefully earn a higher spread than we currently earn on short-term treasuries. 
On Slide 11, the top chart displays our firm-wide net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks on a combined basis, as these 2 items are directly impacted by changes in short-term interest rates. The combined net interest income in BDPs from third-party banks of $183 million were up slightly compared to the preceding quarter as modest NIM compression was offset by growth in client cash balances and higher asset balances in Raymond James Bank. However, it's still down significantly from the peak of $329 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, really highlighting the remarkable results we have been able to generate despite near 0 short-term interest rates. 
In the lower left portion of the slide, we show net interest margin, or NIM, for both RJ Bank and the firm overall. We continue to expect the bank's NIM to decline to just around or just below 1.9% over the next quarter or 2. The average yield on RJBDP balances with third-party banks declined 1 basis point to 29 basis points in the quarter. We believe this average yield will remain around this level for the rest of the fiscal year but there will likely be downward pressure in this yield in fiscal 2022, especially in the back half of the fiscal year if banks demand for deposits don't improve from current levels. 
Moving to consolidated expenses on Slide 12. First, our largest expense compensation. The compensation ratio decreased sequentially from 69.5% to 67.2%, largely due to record revenues in the Capital Markets segment, which had a 57% comp ratio during the quarter and the benefit from the private equity valuation gains, which do not have direct compensation associated with them. 
Given our current revenue mix and disciplined manage of expenses, we remain confident we can maintain a compensation ratio lower than 70% in this near 0 short-term interest rate environment. And as I've said over the past few quarters, we could outperform that just as we did in the fiscal third quarter with capital markets revenues at or near these levels. Noncompensation expenses of $425 million increased 18% compared to last year's third quarter and 53% sequentially, primarily driven by the $98 million loss on extinguishment of debt, acquisition-related expenses, the noncontrolling interest of $10 million and other expenses related to our private equity valuation gains and higher business development expenses. 
As we discussed last quarter, we successfully executed a debt offering in the fiscal third quarter to take advantage of the low rate environment and significantly extend the maturities of our existing balances. We raised $750 million of 30-year senior note to 3.75% and utilize the proceeds and cash on hand to early redeem our next 2 senior notes that were maturing in 2024 and 2026, effectively resulting in the same amount of senior notes outstanding. This resulted in $98 million in losses associated with the early extinguishment of those notes but in doing so, locked in very low rates for 30 years, while significantly extending the duration and stability of our funding profile. 
Overall, our results show we have remained focused on managing controllable expenses while still investing in growth across all of our businesses and ensuring high service levels for advisers and their clients. Excluding the debt extinguishment expense, we do expect non-compensation expense to continue picking up over the next few quarters as hopefully, travel, recognition trips and conferences continue to resume, and we continue to increase our investments in technology and high-quality service levels for our growing business. We would eventually expect loan loss provisions associated with net loan growth as well. 
Slide 13 shows the pretax margin trend over the past 5 quarters, pretax margin was 15.6% in fiscal third quarter of 2021 and adjusted pretax margin was 19.8% which was boosted by record revenues, the loan loss reserve release and still relatively subdued business development expenses. At our Analyst and Investor Day in June, we outlined a pretax margin target of 15% to 16% and in this near 0 interest rate environment. But as we experienced during the first 9 months of the fiscal year, there is meaningful upside to our margins when capital markets results are strong, and improving macroeconomic trends lead to releases of our allowances for credit losses. 
On Slide 14, at the end of the quarter, total assets were approximately $57.2 billion, a 2% sequential increasing -- increase reflecting solid growth of securities-based loans at Raymond James Bank. 
Liquidity and capital levels are very strong, with cash at the parent of approximately $1.56 billion, a total capital ratio of 25.5% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 12.6%. We have substantial amount of flexibility to be both defensive and opportunistic. The third quarter effective tax rate of 20.3% benefited from nontaxable gains in the corporate life insurance portfolio, we would expect that tax rate to be around 21% in the fiscal fourth quarter, assuming a flat equity market. 
Slide 15 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past 5 quarters. In the third quarter, we repurchased 375,000 shares for $48 million. As of July 28, $632 million remains available under the current share repurchase authorization. But as Paul Reilly will discuss, our priority continues to be deploying capital to grow our businesses. 
Lastly, on Slide 16, we provide key credit metrics for Raymond James Bank. The credit quality of the bank's loan portfolio remains healthy with most trends continuing to improve. Nonperforming assets remained low at just 12 basis points of total assets and criticized loans declined sequentially. 
The bank loan loss benefit of $19 million reflects an improved outlook for economic conditions and higher credit ratings on average within the corporate loan portfolio. Due to reserve releases and loan growth during the quarter, the bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percent of total loans declined from 1.5% to 1.34% at the quarter end. For the corporate portfolio, these allowances are higher at around 2.4%. We believe we're adequately reserved, but that could change if economic conditions deteriorate. Now I'll turn the call back over to Paul Reilly to discuss our outlook. Paul?"

As for the outlook, we remain well",494,"Thank you, Paul. So overall, I'm very pleased with our strong results for this quarter, which top many records, and did so in spite of the persistent challenges of the global health pandemic and near 0 short-term rates. As for the outlook, we remain well positioned entering the fourth fiscal quarter with records of many of our key business metrics, strong pipelines for financial adviser recruiting and investment banking. 
In the Private Client Group, results will benefit by starting the fourth quarter with a 9% increase of assets and fee-based accounts. With the strong recruiting pipeline, we are on track for a record fiscal year recruiting as prospective advisers across all of the affiliation options have continued to be attracted to our platform, including the leading technology solution, our adviser and client-centric culture. These recruiting results are primarily strong, given the very competitive market for experienced advisers. 
In Capital Markets segment, the investment banking pipeline remains strong, and we expect solid fixed income brokerage results driven by demand from depository client segment. However, keep in mind, these -- there is still an economic uncertainty due to the ongoing pandemic that could impact these results. 
In the Asset Management segment, if equity markets remain resilient, we expect results to be positively impacted by higher financial assets under management. Active asset managers continue to face structural headwinds. However, we are pleased to see positive net flows on a fiscal year-to-date basis for Carillon Tower Associates. We hope that the one benefit of increased market volatility is that it reinforces the value of our high-quality asset at managers. And Raymond James Bank should continue to grow as we have ample funding and capital to grow the balance sheet. We'll continue to focus on lending to PCG clients through securities-based loans and mortgages. And we'll continue to be selective and deliberate in growing our corporate loan and agency-backed securities portfolio. 
As we look further ahead, we remain focused on the long-term growth. And as we've outlined at our recent Analyst and Investor Day, those key growth initiatives include driving organic growth across all of our core businesses, continue to expand our investments in technology and sharpening our focus on strategic M&A. Today's announcement of our firm's intention to make an offer for Charles Stanley Group demonstrates our focus on these initiatives and our commitment to deploy excess capital over time. We believe this acquisition stays true to our long-standing criteria for acquisitions. So first, being a good cultural fit, a good strategic fit, it makes financial sense for shareholders and something we can integrate. 
I also want to once again take a moment to thank our advisers and associates. They've been amazing at being able to provide excellent service to their clients to these difficult times. I'm very proud to be a part of the special Raymond James' family. 
Thank you all for attending. With that, operator, Tommy, I'm going to turn it over to you for questions."

So it's not saying we're not choosing it over the U.S., Canada or the U.K., we believe in all 3 of those markets.

So over the next quarter or 2, obviously, depends somewhat on asset mix and the growth of the agency MBS portfolio, which we've essentially decelerated over the last quarter, just given where rates are. We would expect to come in right around that 1.9%, give or take a couple of basis points over the next quarter or 2. 
As far as the yield on the BDP balances with third-party banks, there is a significant portion of our deposits that mature contractually over the next, I would say, 6 to 12 months. Right now, the sort of market rate for new deposits, if you can even get capacity is much lower than the 30 basis points or the 29 basis points that we're currently earning on average. 
But remember, if the yield on those deposits aren't attractive with those third-party banks, we have the capital flexibility going back to Paul's comments earlier to bring those cash balances on the balance sheet and invest in other assets. So I don't think it's as easy as a formula of just assuming that those balances reset at a lower yield off balance sheet because depending on what we can in our off-balance sheet, it may be more compelling to bring it on balance sheet and invest in other assets at the bank securities and/or loans."

I would tell you, Steve, that the primary driver of the NIM compression because most of the short-term rates are reflected in sort of the yields of the various asset categories. Most of our asset categories are floating in nature. So they reflect the kind of rate environment that we're in. So most of the NIM dynamic going forward is really going to be driven by asset mix. So for example, this quarter, we grew securities-based loans on a net basis, $700 million, which is a truly fantastic growth, 14% sequentially, over 50% year-over-year. And those have -- those are fully secured with marketable securities and help strengthen the relationships between advisers and their clients in the Private Client Group. So we love that asset. But that yield is 2.2% on average in the quarter, whereas the corporate loans are in the 2.5% to 2.6%. And they have been growing, we can resume growth there, but not to the same extent as SBL. 
So just by the change in mix, to sort of the lower risk categories like securities-based loans, that's going to put downward pressure on your NIM, all else being equal. As far as the breakeven analysis, I wish it was that simple. There's a lot of variables that go into that to bring it on balance sheet, obviously, uses capital. And then you have to essentially take either duration and/or credit risk to earn a higher yield. And so -- and that higher yield changes week-to-week depending on the latest Fed announcement. 
So one thing is certain, if we don't have the capacity of balance sheet or the capacity is at very low rates, then the -- bringing it on balance sheet certainly looks more attractive on a relative basis. And that's something that we have, the capital and the appetite to do, if necessary."

I would say the $1.3 billion jumping off rate, I want to say that our quarterly revenues at that time were somewhere around $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. I don't remember exactly when that was, but we're at $2.5 billion now. So just the business is a lot bigger now. And there's a lot of expenses that are directly associated with the size of our business, whether it be sub-advisory fees that support the asset management business, whether it be FDIC insurance expense, which supports the bank branches -- branch expense as we continue to recruit more advisers. We've done a couple of acquisitions. We just announced another one. So a lot has changed since we provided that $1.3 billion metric, which backs the question, when are we going to provide more new guidance and a new threshold. And I would say we want to do that as soon as there's more clarity, kind of, on the go-forward path, particularly for things like business development expense. In fiscal '19, before the pandemic, that was running at around $200 million for the year, $50 million a quarter. So even this quarter's number of $31 million is well below that as an example. And then loan loss provisions as well. Obviously, that is something that's going to be volatile until there's more kind of economic certainty or clarity going forward.

They have no thoughts or slowing down either. 
So again, short to midterm, I think it's sustainable. The recruiting has been good across all the options, which is ironic, too, sometimes. We got slowed down a little bit a few quarters ago when the private -- when they're employed channel, the offices were closed, and we were adjusting, but that's really taken off, and it's going to hit a record probably. It's on a pace to hit a record this year even after that very slow start. So we're seeing it all across the affiliation options. So the pipeline is very strong.

Longer term, it depends on the economic viability. The numbers for the economy growth were good this quarter. And if that continues and people stay positive, I think it could continue for a while."

So we are focused on the Private Client Group of any type of opportunity in those 3 markets. We're not really looking to in other markets in the private wealth business right now. And we just want to focus on growing and competing well in those 3 markets. It's broader in the M&A categories, but one business that we do look at global opportunities, both from a capital deployment, I mean, the capital for most places, just an office and people versus capital is heavier in the other businesses, and it is a global business. So we will continue to look for opportunities. But again, we've been focused in North America, the U.K. and Europe, but we have looked at things in other places. 
And then the rest of the businesses have continued to be kind of a North American and U.K. focused. So we're not -- we don't -- we have plenty of capital to grow. We think we're in strong positions in the U.K. We had a very good practice, but it was small, and we think this acquisition would put us in a very competitive position where we can accelerate the growth. So that's been our focus. It continues to be our focus, and we're not looking at other kind of global markets."

And welcome to the story. I'm glad to have you part of the coverage universe. Yes, one of the biggest drivers, and we can get into more detail offline for -- that impacts the tax rate quarter-to-quarter is we have a corporate-owned life insurance portfolio, which we use to sort of fund the -- some of our nonqualified benefits that we offer our associates. And so the way that corporate-owned life insurance portfolio, those balances work is that when the equity market appreciates that typically results in nontaxable gains in that portfolio which means that our effective tax rate, all else being equal, is lower and vice versa when the equity market goes in the other direction. It results in nondeductible losses, which means our effective tax rate, all else being equal, goes higher. So typically, the trend is when the equity markets are up, our effective tax rate is lower and vice versa. Again, there's a lot of other factors, but that is the factor that seems to be the most sort of volatile or impactful from quarter-to-quarter."

Thank you, Kristie. I'm actually joining you today from Chicago where we've had a number of day meetings with some of our top independent advisers.

I'm actually joining you today from Chicago where we've had a number of day meetings with some of our top independent advisers. So it's great to see both their success during the pandemic and their excitement as we move forward. It's kind of hard to believe now, it's been over 16 months since the pandemic, and we're just starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel with the distribution of vaccines. And now the spread of Delta variant reminds us that we could be dealing with this one way or another for quite some time. 
Fortunately, our economy has really proven to be resilient and creative, quickly adapting to these changes, which has facilitated the recovery of our economy, the stock market over the past year. Similarly, our advisers and associates have been just simply amazing. I'm really proud of what they've been able to do, enabling Raymond James to achieve these record results for the first 9 months of fiscal 2021. 
So why don't we move on to Slide 3 with our quarterly results. The fiscal third quarter was another strong quarter with several, I guess, many records. The firm reported record net revenue of $2.7 billion (sic) [ $2.471 billion ], net income of $307 million and earnings per diluted share of $2.18. Excluding the losses on extinguishment of debt of $98 million and $7 million of acquisition-related expenses, adjusted quarterly net income was $386 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share were $2.74, both records. 
The increase in quarterly net revenue was largely driven by record asset management and related administrative fees and record investment banking revenues during the quarter. Adjusted net income growth was due to the aforementioned higher net revenues, along with the loan loss reserve release in the quarter compared to a provision for credit losses a year ago. Annualized return on equity for the quarter was 15.9% and the adjusted return on tangible common equity was 22.2%, really an impressive result, especially in this near 0 rate environment and given our strong capital position. 
Moving to Slide 4, and we'll see that the quarter ended with record total client assets under administration of $1.17 trillion, which were up 33% on a year-over-year basis and 7% sequentially. We also achieved record PCG assets in fee-based accounts of $617 billion, a 9% sequential improvement, which will benefit the fourth quarter, and record financial assets under management of $191 billion. We ended the quarter with record 8,413 financial advisers and that's net increases of 258 over the prior year period and 86 over the preceding quarter. Adviser recruiting has been robust even in this very competitive market. 
Over the prior 4 quarters, financial advisers with approximately $325 million of trailing 12 production and nearly $53 billion of assets at their prior firms affiliated with Raymond James domestically. As for our net organic growth results in the Private Client Group, we generated domestic PCG net new assets of nearly $69 billion over the 4 quarters ending in June 30, 2021, representing more than 8.5% of domestic PCG assets at the beginning of the period. And remember, this is net of client fees. 
And this trend has accelerated throughout the 12-month period with the past 2 quarters reaching an annualized rate over 9%. So far this fiscal year is shaping up to be very strong in terms of adviser retention as well as attracting new advisers to the Raymond James platform through our multiple affiliation options. In fact, we are on track for a record year of adviser recruiting in fiscal 2021. 
We remain focused, though, on providing a superior platform to support advisers and their clients and also helping advisers grow their practice, and it's resonating well in the market. Advisers are attracted to our leading technology solutions as well as our adviser and client-centric cultures. 
Let's move on to Slide 5. The Private Client Group generated record quarterly net revenues of $1.7 billion and pretax income of $195 million, and 11.5% pretax margin, reflecting significant operating leverage over the past year. Quarterly net revenues grew 3% over the preceding quarter, predominantly driven by higher asset management and related administrative fees, reflecting higher assets and fee-based accounts, which will also provide a tailwind for the fourth quarter. 
The Capital Markets segment generated quarterly net revenues of $446 million and pretax income of $115 million, driven by record investment banking revenues and a continued very solid fixed income brokerage revenue performance. The strong result reflects the significant investments we've made to strengthen our platform over the last 10 years, and we are continuing to make investments, including the recently completed acquisition of the consumer-focused M&A advisory firm, Financo, and the announcement of the acquisition of Cebile, a leading private funds placement agent of secondary market to private equities. 
We are excited to welcome Sunaina and her team to the Raymond James family when we close Cebile, currently expected to be in the fiscal fourth quarter. 
The Asset Management segment generated record net revenues of $225 million and record pretax income of $105 million. These results are primarily due to the growth of financial assets under management driven by equity market appreciation and net inflows into fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group, partially offset by the modest quarterly net outflows for Carillon Towers Associates, following a solid quarter of net inflows in the fiscal second quarter. 
Turning to the bank. Record net loans of $23.9 billion grew 13% over the prior year and 4% sequentially. This growth was primarily driven by the strong growth of securities-based loans to PCG clients of more than 50% and 14%, respectively. This is a loan category we continue to see good opportunities for growth and attractive risk-adjusted returns. 
Raymond James Bank generated quarterly net revenues of $169 million and pretax income of $104 million. Quarterly net revenues declined 5% compared to a year ago quarter, primarily due to the impact of lower short-term interest rates. Sequentially quarterly net revenue grew 6% as higher asset balances offset the modest compression in the bank's net interest margin during the quarter. Pretax income growth year-over-year was primarily due to the loan loss reserve release in the quarter compared to a provision for credit losses a year ago period. The credit quality of the bank's loan portfolio remains healthy, as Paul Shoukry will cover in more detail in his remarks. 
Looking at the fiscal year-to-date results on Slide 6, we generated record net revenues of $7.07 billion during the first 9 months of fiscal 2021, up 20% over the same period a year ago. And despite the losses on extinguishment of the debt this quarter, we still generated record net earnings per diluted share of $6.92 for the first 9 months of 2021. Adjusted net income was $1.06 billion, up 73% from the net income in fiscal 2020. 
And given all the unique circumstances, I think it's also worth comparing our results so far in fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2019, a very strong year for Raymond James. When comparing the first 9 months of fiscal 2021 to the first 9 months of fiscal 2019, net revenues have grown 24%, net income has grown 27% and adjusted net income has grown 35%, truly spectacular results, particularly given the 0 interest rate environment this fiscal year. 
Moving to the fiscal year-to-date segment results on Slide 7. The Private Client Group, Capital Markets and Asset Management segments all generated record net revenues and record pretax income during the first 9 months of the fiscal year. Again, these results reinforce the value of our diverse and complementary businesses. 
Before I turn the call over to Paul, I wanted to highlight a separate announcement we made this morning. We announced our firm's intention to make an offer for the entire issued and to-be-issued share capital of the U.K.-based Charles Stanley Group at a price of GBP 5.15 per share or approximately GBP 279 million, the U.S. equivalent of approximately $387 million. 
Charles Stanley is a firm we've admired for a long time and has a tremendous reputation, a 200-year heritage and a talented pool of wealth managers and professionals. The 2 firms share a common and increasingly rare client-centric approach where the primary client relationship is held by the individual wealth managers. Raymond James' subsidiary in the U.K., RJIS has operated in the U.K. for over 20 years under strong leadership and has experienced exceptional growth. This combination with Charles Stanley would provide the opportunity for further accelerated growth in the U.K., the second largest English-speaking wealth management market. 
Charles Stanley is nearly 200 wealth managers and GBP 27.1 billion in client assets, bringing our total U.K. assets to over GBP 40 billion. Additionally, Charles Stanley's multiple affiliation options would give Raymond James the ability to offer affiliation choices consistent with our models in Canada and the U.S. and greatly accelerate the growth of the RJIS newly launched employee affiliation model, while building on its market-leading independent contracting and investment management services businesses. 
As I mentioned, the announcement today is our intention to make this offer. We expect the offer to be made in approximately a month. Regulations issued by the U.K. Takeover Panel limits what we can further say at this point, but we will provide updates as more information is made available. 
Now for a more detailed review of our third quarter results, I'm going to turn it over to Paul. Paul?"

Record quarterly net revenues of $2.47 billion grew 35% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Record asset management fees grew 8% sequentially, commensurate with the sequential increase of fee-based assets in the preceding quarter. 
Private Client Group assets in fee-based accounts were up 9% during the fiscal third quarter providing a tailwind for this line item for the fourth quarter. Consolidated brokerage revenues of $552 million grew 14% over the prior year but declined 7% from the record set in the preceding quarter. Institutional fixed income brokerage revenues remain solid, albeit down from the record set in the preceding quarter. 
Brokerage revenues in PCG were up 22% on a year-over-year basis but down 6% sequentially due to lower trading volumes as well as a large placement fee in the preceding quarter. Account and service fees of $161 million increased 20% year-over-year and 1% sequentially, largely due to higher average mutual fund balances. Record consolidated investment banking revenues of $276 million grew 99% year-over-year and 14% sequentially, driven by record M&A revenues and strong debt and equity underwriting results. Our investment banking pipelines remain strong, so we would be pleased if fourth quarter revenues came in around the average for the quarterly revenues generated over the first 3 quarters of the fiscal year, that would have been about $260 million on average. But of course, this line item is inherently difficult to predict. 
Other revenues of $55 million were up 25% sequentially, primarily due to $24 million of private equity valuation gains during the quarter, of which approximately $10 million were attributable to noncontrolling interests, which are reflected in the other expenses. 
Moving to Slide 10. Clients' domestic cash sweep balances ended the quarter at $62.9 billion, essentially flat compared to the preceding quarter and representing 6.1% of domestic PCG client assets. As we continue to experience growing cash balances and less demand from third-party banks during fiscal 2021, $8.6 billion of the client cash is being held in the client interest program at the broker-dealer. Over time, that cash could be redeployed to our bank or third-party banks as capacity becomes available, which would hopefully earn a higher spread than we currently earn on short-term treasuries. 
On Slide 11, the top chart displays our firm-wide net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks on a combined basis, as these 2 items are directly impacted by changes in short-term interest rates. The combined net interest income in BDPs from third-party banks of $183 million were up slightly compared to the preceding quarter as modest NIM compression was offset by growth in client cash balances and higher asset balances in Raymond James Bank. However, it's still down significantly from the peak of $329 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, really highlighting the remarkable results we have been able to generate despite near 0 short-term interest rates. 
In the lower left portion of the slide, we show net interest margin, or NIM, for both RJ Bank and the firm overall. We continue to expect the bank's NIM to decline to just around or just below 1.9% over the next quarter or 2. The average yield on RJBDP balances with third-party banks declined 1 basis point to 29 basis points in the quarter. We believe this average yield will remain around this level for the rest of the fiscal year, but there will likely be downward pressure in this yield in fiscal 2022, especially in the back half of the fiscal year if banks' demand for deposits don't improve from current levels. 
Moving to consolidated expenses on Slide 12. First, our largest expense, compensation. The compensation ratio decreased sequentially from 69.5% to 67.2%, largely due to record revenues in the Capital Markets segment, which had a 57% comp ratio during the quarter and the benefit from the private equity valuation gains, which do not have direct compensation associated with them. 
Given our current revenue mix and disciplined manage of expenses, we remain confident we can maintain a compensation ratio lower than 70% in this near 0 short-term interest rate environment. And as I've said over the past few quarters, we could outperform that just as we did in the fiscal third quarter with capital markets revenues at or near these levels. Noncompensation expenses of $425 million increased 18% compared to last year's third quarter and 53% sequentially, primarily driven by the $98 million loss on extinguishment of debt, acquisition-related expenses, the noncontrolling interest of $10 million and other expenses related to our private equity valuation gains and higher business development expenses. 
As we discussed last quarter, we successfully executed a debt offering in the fiscal third quarter to take advantage of the low rate environment and significantly extend the maturities of our existing balances. We raised $750 million of 30-year senior notes at 3.75% and utilized the proceeds and cash on hand to early redeem our next 2 senior notes that were maturing in 2024 and 2026, effectively resulting in the same amount of senior notes outstanding. This resulted in $98 million in losses associated with the early extinguishment of those notes, but in doing so, locked in very low rates for 30 years, while significantly extending the duration and stability of our funding profile. 
Overall, our results show we have remained focused on managing controllable expenses while still investing in growth across all of our businesses and ensuring high service levels for advisers and their clients. Excluding the debt extinguishment expense, we do expect noncompensation expense to continue picking up over the next few quarters as hopefully, travel, recognition trips and conferences continue to resume, and we continue to increase our investments in technology and high-quality service levels for our growing business. We would eventually expect loan loss provisions associated with net loan growth as well. 
Slide 13 shows the pretax margin trend over the past 5 quarters. Pretax margin was 15.6% in fiscal third quarter of 2021, and adjusted pretax margin was 19.8% which was boosted by record revenues, the loan loss reserve release and still relatively subdued business development expenses. At our Analyst and Investor Day in June, we outlined a pretax margin target of 15% to 16% in this near 0 interest rate environment. But as we experienced during the first 9 months of the fiscal year, there is meaningful upside to our margins when capital markets results are strong, and improving macroeconomic trends lead to releases of our allowances for credit losses. 
On Slide 14, at the end of the quarter, total assets were approximately $57.2 billion, a 2% sequential increasing -- increase reflecting solid growth of securities-based loans at Raymond James Bank. 
Liquidity and capital levels are very strong, with cash at the parent of approximately $1.56 billion, a total capital ratio of 25.5% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 12.6%. We have substantial amount of flexibility to be both defensive and opportunistic. The third quarter effective tax rate of 20.3% benefited from nontaxable gains in the corporate life insurance portfolio. We would expect that tax rate to be around 21% in the fiscal fourth quarter, assuming a flat equity market. 
Slide 15 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past 5 quarters. In the third quarter, we repurchased 375,000 shares for $48 million. As of July 28, $632 million remains available under the current share repurchase authorization. But as Paul Reilly will discuss, our priority continues to be deploying capital to grow our businesses. 
Lastly, on Slide 16, we provide key credit metrics for Raymond James Bank. The credit quality of the bank's loan portfolio remains healthy with most trends continuing to improve. Nonperforming assets remained low at just 12 basis points of total assets and criticized loans declined sequentially. 
The bank loan loss benefit of $19 million reflects an improved outlook for economic conditions and higher credit ratings on average within the corporate loan portfolio. Due to reserve releases and loan growth during the quarter, the bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percent of total loans declined from 1.5% to 1.34% at the quarter end. For the corporate portfolio, these allowances are higher at around 2.4%. We believe we're adequately reserved, but that could change if economic conditions deteriorate. Now I'll turn the call back over to Paul Reilly to discuss our outlook. Paul?"

As for the outlook, we remain well",497,"Thank you, Paul. So overall, I'm very pleased with our strong results for this quarter, which top many records, and did so in spite of the persistent challenges of the global health pandemic and near 0 short-term rates. As for the outlook, we remain well positioned entering the fourth fiscal quarter with records of many of our key business metrics, strong pipelines for financial adviser recruiting and investment banking. 
In the Private Client Group, results will benefit by -- starting in the fourth quarter with a 9% increase of assets in fee-based accounts. With the strong recruiting pipeline, we are on track for a record fiscal year of recruiting as prospective advisers across all of the affiliation options have continued to be attracted to our platform, including the leading technology solution, our adviser and client-centric culture. These recruiting results are primarily strong, given the very competitive market for experienced advisers. 
In Capital Markets segment, the investment banking pipeline remains strong, and we expect solid fixed income brokerage results driven by demand from depository client segment. However, keep in mind, these -- there is still an economic uncertainty due to the ongoing pandemic that could impact these results. 
In the Asset Management segment, if equity markets remain resilient, we expect results to be positively impacted by higher financial assets under management. Active asset managers continue to face structural headwinds. However, we are pleased to see positive net flows on a fiscal year-to-date basis for Carillon Tower Associates. We hope that the one benefit of increased market volatility is that it reinforces the value of our high-quality asset active managers. And Raymond James Bank should continue to grow as we have ample funding and capital to grow the balance sheet. We'll continue to focus on lending to PCG clients through securities-based loans and mortgages. And we'll continue to be selective and deliberate in growing our corporate loan and agency-backed securities portfolio. 
As we look further ahead, we remain focused on the long-term growth. And as we've outlined at our recent Analyst and Investor Day, those key growth initiatives include driving organic growth across all of our core businesses, continue to expand our investments in technology and sharpening our focus on strategic M&A. Today's announcement of our firm's intention to make an offer for Charles Stanley Group demonstrates our focus on these initiatives and our commitment to deploy excess capital over time. We believe this acquisition stays true to our long-standing criteria for acquisitions. So first, being a good cultural fit, a good strategic fit, and makes financial sense for shareholders and something we can integrate. 
I also want to once again take a moment to thank our advisers and associates. They've been amazing at being able to provide excellent service to their clients through these difficult times. I'm very proud to be a part of the special Raymond James' family.

Charles Stanley brings first a culture identical to us. It's stewarded by the Howard family for generations. I think the fourth generation is in the business, has the very same value of client-centric, adviser-centric culture and has multichannel. So the combination gets us at GBP 40 billion and really gives us the mass to utilize a lot of the things they've done well and to continue to grow that business and really give us the base to make a difference. So it's not saying we're not choosing it over the U.S., Canada or the U.K., we believe in all 3 of those markets.

So over the next quarter or 2, obviously, depends somewhat on asset mix and the growth of the agency MBS portfolio, which we've essentially decelerated over the last quarter just given where rates are, we would expect to come in right around that 1.9%, give or take a couple of basis points over the next quarter or 2. 
As far as the yield on the BDP balances with third-party banks, there is a significant portion of our deposits that mature contractually over the next, I would say, 6 to 12 months. Right now, the sort of market rate for new deposits, if you can even get capacity, is much lower than the 30 basis points or the 29 basis points that we're currently earning on average. 
But remember, if the yield on those deposits aren't attractive with those third-party banks, we have the capital flexibility, going back to Paul's comments earlier, to bring those cash balances on the balance sheet and invest in other assets. So I don't think it's as easy as a formula of just assuming that those balances reset at a lower yield off balance sheet because depending on what we can earn off balance sheet, it may be more compelling to bring it on balance sheet and invest in other assets at the bank, securities and/or loans."

You cited the continued pressure on the bank NIM, consistent with the trend we've seen in recent quarters. Just given the very strong loan growth, particularly in the SBL channel and already low securities yields, I was hoping, Paul, that you could unpack what's the primary driver of the NIM compression from here? And relating to the third-party sweeps, what's the breakeven level or a spread where you might look to sweep third-party cash more aggressively to the bank as you face that repricing -- or that pricing headwind in the back half of next year?"

I would tell you, Steve, that the primary driver of the NIM compression -- because most of the short-term rates are reflected in sort of the yields of the various asset categories. Most of our asset categories are floating in nature. So they reflect the kind of rate environment that we're in. So most of the NIM dynamic going forward is really going to be driven by asset mix. So for example, this quarter, we grew securities-based loans on a net basis $700 million, which was a truly fantastic growth, 14% sequentially, over 50% year-over-year. And those have -- those are fully secured with marketable securities and help strengthen the relationships between advisers and their clients in the Private Client Group. So we love that asset. But that yield is 2.2% on average in the quarter, whereas the corporate loans are in the 2.5% to 2.6%. And they have been growing, we can resume growth there, but not to the same extent as SBL. 
So just by the change in mix to sort of the lower risk categories like securities-based loans, that's going to put downward pressure on your NIM, all else being equal. 
As far as the breakeven analysis, I wish it was that simple. There's a lot of variables that go into that. To bring it on balance sheet, obviously, uses capital. And then you have to essentially take either duration and/or credit risk to earn a higher yield. And so -- and that higher yield changes week-to-week depending on the latest Fed announcement. 
So one thing is certain. If we don't have the capacity off balance sheet or the capacity is at very low rates, then the -- bringing it on balance sheet certainly looks more attractive on a relative basis. And that's something that we have, the capital and the appetite to do, if necessary."

I would say the $1.3 billion jumping off rate, I want to say that our quarterly revenues at that time were somewhere around $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. I don't remember exactly when that was, but we're at $2.5 billion now. So just the business is a lot bigger now. And there's a lot of expenses that are directly associated with the size of our business, whether it be sub-advisory fees that support the asset management business, whether it be FDIC insurance expense, which supports the bank, branches -- branch expense as we continue to recruit more advisers. We've done a couple of acquisitions. We just announced another one. So a lot has changed since we provided that $1.3 billion metric, which begs the question, when are we going to provide more -- new guidance and a new threshold. 
And I would say we want to do that as soon as there's more clarity, kind of, on the go-forward path, particularly for things like business development expense. In fiscal '19, before the pandemic, that was running at around $200 million for the year, $50 million a quarter. So even this quarter's number of $31 million is well below that as an example. And then loan loss provisions as well. Obviously, that is something that's going to be volatile until there's more kind of economic certainty or clarity going forward.

The market's been robust and people have been growing and the client engagement has been really good. So that could all change with the downturn where clients get fearful and assets often don't grow the same in those environments. But if you look at any outlook we see in the short to midterm, it all looks still very, very positive. Again, as I said up here at a meeting with our advisers, and they're all very positive, experiencing, our top advisers, not just record growth of their businesses, but I can tell you by the questions over 2 days and watching what they're doing with their practices, they have no thoughts of slowing down either. 
So again, short to midterm, I think it's sustainable. The recruiting has been good across all the options, which is ironic, too, sometimes. We got slowed down a little bit a few quarters ago when the private client -- when their employee channel, the offices were closed, and we were adjusting, but that's really taken off, and it's going to hit a record probably. It's on a pace to hit a record this year even after that very slow start. So we're seeing it all across the affiliation options. So the pipeline is very strong. And so I'd say, for the short to midterm, it looks very, very good. 
Longer term, it depends on the economic viability. The numbers for the economy growth were good this quarter. And if that continues and people stay positive, I think it could continue for a while."

So we are focused on the Private Client Group of any type of opportunity in those 3 markets. We're not really looking to expand in other markets in the private wealth business right now. And we just want to focus on growing and competing well in those 3 markets. 
It's broader in the M&A categories, but one business that we do look at global opportunities, both from a capital deployment, I mean, the capital for most places, just an office and people versus capital is heavier in the other businesses, and it is a global business. So we will continue to look for opportunities. But again, we've been focused in North America, the U.K. and Europe, but we have looked at things in other places. 
And then the rest of the businesses have continued to be kind of a North American and U.K. focused. So we're not -- we don't -- we have plenty of capital to grow. We think we're in strong positions in the U.K. We have very good practice, but it was small, and we think this acquisition would put us in a very competitive position where we can, we think, accelerate the growth.

And welcome to the story. Glad to have you part of the coverage universe. Yes, one of the biggest drivers, and we can get into more detail offline for -- that impacts the tax rate quarter-to-quarter is we have a corporate-owned life insurance portfolio, which we use to sort of fund the -- some of our nonqualified benefits that we offer our associates. And so the way that corporate-owned life insurance portfolio, those balances work is that when the equity market appreciates, that typically results in nontaxable gains in that portfolio which means that our effective tax rate, all else being equal, is lower and vice versa when the equity market goes in the other direction, it results in nondeductible losses, which means our effective tax rate, all else being equal, goes higher. So typically, the trend is when the equity markets are up, our effective tax rate is lower and vice versa. Again, there's a lot of other factors, but that is the factor that seems to be the most sort of volatile or impactful from quarter-to-quarter."

So you see Financo, which just joined us, which has already scored a few deals of good size in a very short period of time with us. And so they're not -- their run rate is really not online.

And there are a few other verticals that we're not well positioned and that we're looking to do the same things.

I want to first by apologizing I'll sound like a broken record using the word record over and over again. It really was an outstanding year and quarter. I wish management could take credit, but it is really the work of our advisers and associates that delivered these results. 
Their dedication and perseverance during the fiscal year was amazing. We've proven once again that focusing on our time-tested client-first strategy and providing outstanding service to our advisers and their clients will guide us through uncertain economic and global conditions, in this case, in record-setting fashion. 
The record results we generated would not have been possible without everyone's contribution. So thanks, again. Starting on Slide 4 with our quarterly results. The fiscal fourth quarter capped off what was a record fiscal year on a number of fronts. 
The firm reported record quarterly net revenues of $2.7 billion and record quarterly net income of $429 million or earnings per diluted share of $2.02, which reflects the impact of the 3 for 2 stock split in September. Excluding the $10 million of acquisition-related expenses, quarterly adjusted net income was $437 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share equaled $2.06. 
The increase in quarterly net revenues was largely driven by record investment banking revenues and record assets under management and related administrative fees, primarily due to higher private client group assets and fee-based accounts. 
Annualized return on equity for the quarter was 21.3% and adjusted annualized return on tangible common equity was 24.1%, a very impressive result, especially in the near 0-rate environment and given our strong capital position. 
Moving to Slide 5. We ended the quarter with record total client assets under administration of $1.18 trillion, up 27% on a year-over-year basis and 1% sequentially. We also achieved record PCG assets and fee-based accounts of $627 billion and record financial assets under management of $192 billion. 
We continue to focus on supporting advisers and their clients through leading technology solutions and a client-focused culture. As a result, we had a fantastic year in terms of adviser retention as well as record results in recruiting new advisers to the Raymond James platform through our multiple affiliation options. 
We ended the quarter with records of 8,482 financial advisers, net increases of 243 over the prior period and 69% over the preceding quarter. Representing a new record during the fiscal year, we recruited financial advisers with approximately $330 million of trailing 12-month production and approximately $54 billion of client assets to our domestic independent contractor and employee channels. 
Also in the Private Client Group, advisers generated domestic net new assets of approximately $83 billion in fiscal 2021, representing 10% of domestic PCG assets at the beginning of the fiscal year, a very strong result, reflecting our excellent retention and record recruiting. 
Additionally, this year, new account openings and adviser productivity were very strong, contributing to the excellent net new asset results. Also worth noting on the slide is the impressive loan growth at Raymond James Bank during the quarter, up 5% sequentially to a record $25 billion. This growth was driven by securities-based loans to the Private Client Group clients as well as a strong corporate loan growth. 
Moving to segment results on Slide 6. The Private Client Group generated record quarterly net revenues of $1.8 billion and pretax income of $222 million, a 12.3% pretax margin, reflecting significant operating leverage over the past year. 
The Capital Markets segment generated record quarterly net revenues of $554 million and pretax income of $183 million, representing an extremely impressive 33% pretax margin to net revenues. 
These record results were driven by record investment banking revenues, strong tax credit fund revenues and solid fixed income brokerage revenues. The Asset Management segment generated record net revenues of $238 million and record pretax income of $114 million, up 29% and 46% over the year ago period, respectively. 
These results were primarily due to growth in financial assets under management, driven by net inflows to fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group, partially offset by market depreciation and net outflows for the Carillon Towers Advisers during the quarter. 
Raymond James Bank generated quarterly net revenues of $176 million and pretax income of $81 million. Quarterly net revenues increased 9% over the year ago quarter, as higher levels of earning assets offset year-over-year compression in the bank's net interest margin. 
Sequentially, net revenues grew 4% due to higher asset balances during the quarter. The pretax income growth year-over-year was due to the aforementioned revenue growth and lower bank loan provision for credit losses in the current quarter. 
Compared to the preceding quarter, the bank's pretax income declined largely due to a reserve release in the preceding quarter compared to a loan loss provision, primarily associated with the strong loan growth during the fiscal fourth quarter. 
Looking at the fiscal year 2021 results on Slide 7. We generated record net revenues of $9.76 billion, up 22% over fiscal year 2020, and record net income of $1.4 billion, up 7% over fiscal 2020. 
Excluding losses on the extinguishment of debt and acquisition-related expenses during the year, adjusted net income was $1.49 billion, up 74% over adjusted net income in fiscal 2020. 
Moving to the fiscal year results on Slide 8. The Private Client Group, Capital Markets and Asset Management segments generated record net revenues and record pretax income and all of our segments realized substantial operating leverage during the fiscal year. 
Once again, these results reinforce the value of our diverse and complementary businesses. And now for a more detailed review of the fourth quarter financial results, I'm going to turn the call over to Paul Shoukry. Paul?"

Record quarterly net revenues of $2.7 billion grew 30% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. Record asset management fees grew 8% sequentially, commensurate with the sequential increase in the beginning of the quarter balance of fee-based assets. 
Private Client Group assets and fee-based accounts were up 2% during the fiscal fourth quarter, providing a modest tailwind for this line item for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. 
Consolidated brokerage revenues of $541 million grew 9% over the prior year, but declined 2% from the preceding quarter. Institutional fixed income brokerage revenues remain solid, albeit down from the strong levels of the comparison periods. 
Brokerage revenues in PCG were up 17% on a year-over-year basis, but flat sequentially due to lower trading volumes, which offset the benefit from higher asset balances and associated trailing commissions. 
For the fiscal year, brokerage revenues were up 13% to a record $2.2 billion, reflecting records for both PCG and fixed income which had a fantastic year that was a testament to their leading position in the depository segment. 
Account and service fees of $170 million increased 21% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, largely due to higher average mutual fund assets driving higher associated service fees. 
Paul already discussed our record investment banking results this quarter. So let me touch on other revenues. Other revenues of $74 million were up 35% sequentially, primarily due to higher tax credit funds revenues. We also had $18 million of private equity valuation gains during the quarter, of which approximately $5 million were attributable to noncontrolling interest reflected in other expenses. 
Moving to Slide 11. Clients' domestic cash sweep balances, which are the primary source of funding for our interest-earning assets and the balances with third-party banks that generate RJBDP fees, ended the quarter at a record $66.7 billion, up 6% over the preceding quarter and representing 6.3% of domestic PCG client assets. 
As we continue to experience growing cash balances and less demand from third-party banks during fiscal 2021, $10.8 billion of client cash is being held in the client interest program at the broker-dealer. 
Over time, that cash could be redeployed to our bank or third-party banks as capacity becomes available, which would hopefully earn a higher spread than we currently earn on short-term treasuries. 
On Slide 12, it was great to see an 8% sequential increase in the combined net interest income and BDP fees from third-party banks to $198 million. This growth was largely attributable to strong asset growth and a resilient net interest margin at Raymond James Bank, which remained right at 1.92% for the quarter. 
We expect the bank's NIM to settle right around 1.9% over the next couple of quarters. The average yield on RJBDP balances with third-party banks remained flat at 29 basis points in the quarter. If banks demand for deposits doesn't improve from current levels, we believe there will be downward pressure on this yield in fiscal 2022, especially in the back half of the fiscal year, which is why we have been so focused on generating on-balance sheet growth in assets that could deliver good risk-adjusted returns. 
Moving to consolidated expenses on Slide 13. First, our largest expense compensation. The compensation ratio decreased sequentially from 67.2% to 65.8%, largely due to record revenues in the Capital Markets segment, which had a very low 52% compensation ratio during the quarter. 
Given our current revenue mix and disciplined management of expenses, we are confident we can maintain a compensation ratio of 70% or lower in this near-0 short-term interest rate environment. And as we experienced in fiscal 2021, we can do meaningfully better than 70% with Capital Markets revenues at or near these record levels, which is our expectation for at least the next quarter or 2. 
Noncompensation expenses of $361 million decreased 15% sequentially, primarily driven by the $98 million loss on extinguishment of debt in the fiscal third quarter. Somewhat offsetting this favorable variance, we had a modest provision for credit losses during the quarter compared with a bank loan loss reserve release in the fiscal third quarter. 
Overall, our results in fiscal 2021 show we have remained focused on managing controllable expenses while still investing in growth and ensuring high service levels for advisers and their clients. 
While we are still finalizing our fiscal 2022 budget, we do expect expenses to increase meaningfully in fiscal 2022 for a variety of reasons. First and foremost, we are going to continue investing in people and technology to support the phenomenal growth of our business over the past year, ensuring we maintain very high service levels and leading technology solutions for advisers and their clients. 
We also expect business development expenses to pick up as travel, recognition trips and conferences have already started resuming in the fiscal first quarter, which our advisers and associates are really excited about. Just as a reminder, business development expenses totaled about $200 million in fiscal 2019 before the start of the pandemic. 
Additionally, whereas we had a $32 million net benefit for credit losses in fiscal 2021, we would expect bank loan loss provisions for credit losses associated with net loan growth in fiscal 2022. 
Slide 14 shows the pretax margin trend over the past 5 quarters. Pretax margin was 20.8% in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2021 and adjusted pretax margin was 21.2%, which was boosted by record revenues and still relatively subdued business development expenses. 
At our Analyst and Investor Day in June, we outlined a pretax margin target of 15% to 16% in this near-0 interest rate environment. And right now, we believe the top end of that range is an appropriate target, given the aforementioned expense growth we currently expect in fiscal 2022. 
But as we experienced during the fiscal year, there is a meaningful upside to our margins when Capital Markets revenues are as strong as they have been in fiscal 2021. 
On Slide 15, at the end of the quarter, total assets were approximately $61.9 billion, an 8% sequential increase, reflecting solid growth of loans at Raymond James Bank as well as a substantial increase in client cash balances being held on the balance sheet. 
Liquidity and capital remained very strong. The total capital ratio of 26.2% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 12.6% are both over double the regulatory requirements to be well capitalized, giving us significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and grow the business. 
You can see that RJF corporate cash at the parent ended the quarter at $1.15 billion, decreasing 26% during the quarter as we have restricted the cash that we plan on using to close on the Charles Stanley acquisition, which we currently expect to close in the first or second quarter of fiscal 2022 for as soon as we receive the requisite regulatory approvals. 
Slide 16 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past 5 quarters. During the fiscal year, we repurchased nearly 1.5 million shares split adjusted for $118 million. As of October 27, $632 million remained under the current share repurchase authorization. 
Due to the restrictions following our announced acquisition of TriState Capital Holdings, we do not expect to repurchase common shares until after closing. 
Lastly, on Slide 17, we provide key credit metrics for Raymond James Bank. The credit quality of the bank's loan portfolio remains healthy, with most trends continuing to improve. Criticized loans declined and nonperforming assets remain low at just 20 basis points. 
The bank loan loss provision of $5 million was primarily driven by strong loan growth during the quarter. The bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percent of loans held for investment declined from 1.34% in the preceding quarter to 1.27% at quarter end. 
For the corporate portfolios, these allowances are higher at around 2.25%. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Paul Reilly to discuss our outlook. Paul?"

Overall, I'm very pleased with our fantastic results for this quarter and the fiscal year, which exceeded many records. As for our outlook, we are well positioned entering fiscal 2022 with strong capital ratios, quarter-end records for all of our key business metrics and strong activity levels for financial adviser recruiting and investment banking. 
In the Private Client Group segment, results will benefit modestly by starting the fiscal first quarter with a 2% sequential increase of assets in fee-based accounts. Additionally, based on our robust recruiting pipeline, we hope to continue our current recruiting trend as prospective advisers are attracted to our client-focused values and leading technology platforms. 
In the Capital Markets segment, the investment banking pipeline remains very strong, and we expect a solid fixed income brokerage results driven by demand from the depository client segment. 
In the Asset Management segment, if equity markets remain resilient, we expect results will be positively impacted by higher financial assets under management. And Raymond James Bank should continue to grow as we have ample funding and capital to grow the balance sheet. We will continue to focus on lending to PCG clients through our securities-based loans and mortgages, and we will continue to be selective and deliberate in growing our corporate loan and agency-backed securities portfolio. 
As we look ahead, we remain focused on the long term and our long-term growth. And as we've outlined at our recent Analyst and Investor Day, those key growth initiatives include driving organic growth across our core businesses, continuing to expand our investments in technology and sharpening our focus on strategic M&A. 
Our recent announcements to acquire TriState Capital and Charles Stanley Group demonstrate our focus on these initiatives and our commitment to deploy excess capital over time. We believe these acquisitions stay true to our long-standing criteria, which is a good cultural fit, a strategic purpose and makes sense for our shareholders. 
Finally, thank you again to our advisers and associates for providing excellent service to their clients during these uncertain times. These results are a testament to the dedication of everyone in the Raymond James family. 
With that, I'm going to turn it back over to the operator for questions."

I appreciate that the Capital Markets segment can drive some variability in margins and so that's tough to predict. And so that kind of all gets wrapped up in the firm-wide kind of margin commentary. 
But if we set that aside and we think about the business, I mean, you're sitting in a much better place heading into 2022 than you were in 2021. And I appreciate that you're also going to be ramping investment into the business as well, which makes sense. 
So as we think about the individual segments, whether it's PCG or asset management or bank, can you just talk about where operating leverage may exist and then where it's more challenged just because of the investments? I think that would be helpful to unpack away from some of the maybe the difficulty in predicting capital markets? Because it does feel like there should still be some operating leverage in some of those areas, but want to just dig into those a little bit?"
22623,1685451847,2415452,"Raymond James Financial, Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Raymond James Financial, Inc.","Executives","Yes. So the business that's probably -- it's our best business, but probably the most margin challenge the Private Client Group because it has a high comp ratio with our independent contractors.

So the business that's probably -- it's our best business, but probably the most margin challenge the Private Client Group because it has a high comp ratio with our independent contractors. And if you're -- to deliver 20% margins in the business when you have a 70% comp ratio or less in these times, right, is -- shows the balance we have on really managing expenses and making sure we invest. 
So we had a good margin this year based on the growth. But the real delta in our margins come from the capital markets and the banks as they grow, and in asset management, they have much higher margins. And to the extent they grow, they drive our comp ratio down and our margins up. So those are the ones that have the delta. 
Now the good news is the backlog in Capital Markets is fantastic. It's at historic paces. And the problem with that business, as you know, it can stop on a dime and it could increase, but our visibility is really good into this first quarter, which is very strong. 
And the second quarter should be very good, too. After that, you never really know because of the M&A and underwriting part, it depends on the environment. The bank, we expect good growth. 
You saw very good growth this quarter. Given the markets right now, and I think a reasonable economy going forward, the best we all can tell, we should have growth there. And the asset management business continues to grow, especially with our record recruiting, and we're still on that same pace. 
If you look at commits and people coming through the office, we are still on a very, very -- we're still at that record pace. We took a snapshot today. So shorter term, we see these kind of very good margins. 
But if Capital Markets slow down or the economy turns and M&A deal stop and stuff, that's where we're going to get the margin compression again without interest rates. It wasn't that long ago that half of our pretax income was interest spreads. 
So we've lost that about overnight on March over 2 Fed meetings, and so it's kind of amazing getting these kind of margins without that help. So that's the other factor in this that we can't predict. 
If that comes back, even if the markets cool down, that's certainly going to continue to expand margins. So I wish I could tell you. I can tell you where we sit today, it looks good for the next quarter. But between the economy and Congress and regulators and interest rates, it all could change because those aren't in our control."

Because it's not such a step function in growth and contribution. Is the size of the platform or the personnel is that much greater? Or has it just been the environment -- I know the environment has been incredibly favorable. But how you guys are thinking about that business?

The biggest factor has really been, if you look at the the sweet spot in the business, it's the depository franchise and the depository franchise like all banks and us have a ton of cash. 
And in order to put that cash to work, they can make loans. And if they can't make loans fast enough, they buy securities, and that's where they really utilize us as -- actually for a lot of banks, almost as a treasury manager, we help them look at where they should invest in the spreads and yields. 
We provide a lot of tools for them. And that business has been very, very good because of the cash in the system. So as long as that cash in the system stays there, those brokerage revenues should be very, very good. And again, the fixed income business by far had its best record as did the equity capital markets business. So combined, the Capital Markets segment was extremely good. 
And again, short term to midterm, everything we see today, we don't see that really slowing down off its pace. It's been a little slower in the last quarter than it had been earlier in the year, but I'd still call the numbers robust."

But at 66% you're coming in well below and I sort of wanted to assess how much of this is the benefit of scale and of the platform rather than the strength of the Capital Markets? 
So first, on the PCG side, a lot of the competition decline has to do with the actions that you've taken to hold administer costs down even as the FA headcount and revenues have grown. So how should we think about the administrative and incentive comp in that segment going forward, given the recruiting momentum that you're seeing right now?

If you look at the addition of Financo and Cebile during this quarter, which, again, they only have a full year run rate in those numbers. Cebile being the most recent to join the platform. And the hiring we've done across the platform. The leadership there has done a really good job of building scale where we were probably underscaled given our size competitors. 
So there is a scale play there, but the markets are very, very constructive. So it's a little bit of both in that business. And in the Private Client Group, a lot of business development expenses were low. We didn't have conferences. We didn't have award trips. We didn't have the regional meetings because of the pandemic. And now those are opening up. 
We have our first major conference early in November, and we've had smaller conferences and our first award trip, although they're smaller than traditional, they're still there, and there's some makeup award trips where we cancel them and move them into this year. And so we'll have some double trips and in fact in our employee group will have a double conference because we're going to -- we move this year to the fall and next year will come in the summer. 
So certainly, those expenses are back up. So that's just business as normal. And those are highly valued by advisers. They're a great cultural tool to reinforce the value of Raymond James or great training. These aren't just fun trips to people -- they're fun because we get together, but it's work. I mean there are classes, trainings, teaching. So they're very important to the long-term business, both teaching practice management and sharing best practices as well as explaining new regulations or new technology tools they need to learn. 
So they're very, very valuable. So it's work. I mean fund work, but it's worked. So they're essential and those will return because they're important to the business model."

Their comp ratio this year was 56%. It was 60% last year, and last year was a pretty good year once you put it all together just to show you the sensitivity there. And then the Private Client Group, you mentioned some of the initiatives. Frankly, with the non-FA comp up 5% year-over-year against the 19% revenue growth rate, while we always strive to achieve operating leverage, frankly, that gap is not sustainable. 
We want to make sure that we're providing adequate support levels for our advisers and their clients. And so we need to make sure we have sufficient capacity and bandwidth in our service and product areas to continue delivering excellent service to our advisers and their clients.

So we try to be conservative there. And that doesn't even give them the benefit of where we expect most of the synergy to come from, which is really replacement of their higher cost deposits, a portion of their higher cost deposits with our lower-cost deposits. They are sitting on our balance sheet now earning very little in short-term treasuries at the broker-dealer per the regulation. 
So between short-term rate increases, deposit replacements and the scalability of their technology-enabled model, we think there is a significant upside to the results over time."

But a question we get a lot from investors and analysts is how do we think about that 10% ratio and potentially lowering that ratio over time, that target that we -- which is double the regulatory requirements. 
And our response to that is, as long as regulators continue to consider that as a part of your metric in your requirements, then we need to, in our business, have some cushion for a surge of cash balances because while cash balances are high now on an absolute basis, they are only 6.3% of client assets, which historically speaking, is a good 100 basis points lower than average. 
Now we can argue whether or not that's because asset values are higher than they were historically speaking. But it is not unfathomable to see a situation where cash balance is surged by another 10% to 20%. And as we saw in March 2020, regulators don't give firms relief for accommodating those client cash balances. 
So we still need to make sure we have ample flexibility because those type of environments are when we could be most opportunistic. So we don't want to be constrained by the Tier 1 leverage ratio. And unless regulators change the treatment of that accommodated client cash balance, which they didn't do in 2020, and I'm hopeful they will do, but not optimistic, then we need that cushion."

That was up 9% this year. I could see it being up 10%-plus on next year just with our technology initiatives that we have on the docket. So I don't want to go line by line, but I think when you look at the various line items, you can see that there's sort of room for growth. 
I mean just, again, stepping back, the noncomp expenses grew 5% in PCG this year versus a 19% growth rate. So I would say in hindsight, if we had known revenues were going to grow 19%, we probably would have grown those noncomp expenses higher than the 5%. 
Now some of that was helped by the business development with everything shut down. But that's not a sustainable relationship over time. We want to make sure that we continue supporting the business and the infrastructure, the support levels of the business over time."

Now with that being said, where our stock price is now, we would expect it to be lower than that than the fiscal first quarter with the timing of our stock-based compensation that vest, there would be a tax benefit there in the first quarter based on the current price. 
But we think 24% over the year, plus or minus the impact from corporate-owned life insurance. And just as a reminder, the corporate-owned life insurance creates nontaxable gains when the equity markets are up and does the opposite when equity markets are down, and that's sort of the impact to the tax rate in that type of environment.

I want to first by apologizing I'll sound like a broken record using the word record over and over again. It really was an outstanding year and quarter. I wish management could take credit, but it is really the work of our advisers and associates that delivered these results.  
Their dedication and perseverance during the fiscal year was amazing. We've proven once again that focusing on our time-tested client-first strategy and providing outstanding service to our advisers and their clients will guide us through uncertain economic and global conditions, in this case, in record-setting fashion.  
The record results we generated would not have been possible without everyone's contribution. So thanks, again. 
Starting on Slide 4 with our quarterly results. The fiscal fourth quarter capped off what was a record fiscal year on a number of fronts.  
The firm reported record quarterly net revenues of $2.7 billion and record quarterly net income of $429 million or earnings per diluted share of $2.02, which reflects the impact of the 3 for 2 stock split in September. Excluding the $10 million of acquisition-related expenses, quarterly adjusted net income was $437 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share equaled $2.06.  
The increase in quarterly net revenues was largely driven by record investment banking revenues and record assets under management and related administrative fees, primarily due to higher private client group assets and fee-based accounts. 
Annualized return on equity for the quarter was 21.3% and adjusted annualized return on tangible common equity was 24.1%, a very impressive result, especially in the near 0-rate environment and given our strong capital position.  
Moving to Slide 5. We ended the quarter with record total client assets under administration of $1.18 trillion, up 27% on a year-over-year basis and 1% sequentially. We also achieved record PCG assets and fee-based accounts of $627 billion and record financial assets under management of $192 billion. 
We continue to focus on supporting advisers and their clients through leading technology solutions and a client-focused culture. As a result, we had a fantastic year in terms of adviser retention as well as record results in recruiting new advisers to the Raymond James platform through our multiple affiliation options.  
We ended the quarter with records of 8,482 financial advisers, net increases of 243 over the prior period and 69% over the preceding quarter, representing a new record during the fiscal year, we recruited financial advisers with approximately $330 million of trailing 12-month production and approximately $54 billion of client assets to our domestic independent contractor and employee channels.  
Also in the Private Client Group, advisers generated domestic net new assets of approximately $83 billion in fiscal 2021, representing 10% of domestic PCG assets at the beginning of the fiscal year, a very strong result, reflecting our excellent retention and record recruiting. 
Additionally, this year, new account openings and adviser productivity were very strong, contributing to the excellent net new asset results. Also worth noting on the slide is the impressive loan growth at Raymond James Bank during the quarter, up 5% sequentially to a record $25 billion. This growth was driven by securities-based loans to the Private Client Group clients as well as a strong corporate loan growth.  
Moving to segment results on Slide 6. The Private Client Group generated record quarterly net revenues of $1.8 billion and pretax income of $222 million, a 12.3% pretax margin, reflecting significant operating leverage over the past year. 
The Capital Markets segment generated record quarterly net revenues of $554 million and pretax income of $183 million, representing an extremely impressive 33% pretax margin to net revenues. 
These record results were driven by record investment banking revenues, strong tax credit fund revenues and solid fixed income brokerage revenues. The Asset Management segment generated record net revenues of $238 million and record pretax income of $114 million, up 29% and 46% over the year ago period, respectively.  
These results were primarily due to growth in financial assets under management, driven by net inflows to fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group, partially offset by market depreciation and net outflows for the Carillon Tower Advisers during the quarter.  
Raymond James Bank generated quarterly net revenues of $176 million and pretax income of $81 million. Quarterly net revenues increased 9% over the year ago quarter, as higher levels of earning assets offset year-over-year compression in the bank's net interest margin.  
Sequentially, net revenues grew 4% due to higher asset balances during the quarter. The pretax income growth year-over-year was due to the aforementioned revenue growth and lower bank loan provision for credit losses in the current quarter. 
Compared to the preceding quarter, the bank's pretax income declined largely due to a reserve release in the preceding quarter compared to a loan loss provision, primarily associated with the strong loan growth during the fiscal fourth quarter.  
Looking at the fiscal year 2021 results on Slide 7. We generated record net revenues of $9.76 billion, up 22% over fiscal year 2020, and record net income of $1.4 billion, up 73% over fiscal 2020. 
Excluding losses on the extinguishment of debt and acquisition-related expenses during the year, adjusted net income was $1.49 billion, up 74% over adjusted net income in fiscal 2020.  
Moving to the fiscal year results on Slide 8. The Private Client Group, Capital Markets and Asset Management segments generated record net revenues and record pretax income and all of our segments realized substantial operating leverage during the fiscal year.  
Once again, these results reinforce the value of our diverse and complementary businesses. And now for a more detailed review of the fourth quarter financial results, I'm going to turn the call over to Paul Shoukry. Paul?"

Record Asset Management fees grew 8% sequentially, commensurate with the sequential increase in the beginning of the quarter balance of fee-based assets.  
Private Client Group assets and fee-based accounts were up 2% during the fiscal fourth quarter, providing a modest tailwind for this line item for the first quarter of fiscal 2022.  
Consolidated brokerage revenues of $541 million grew 9% over the prior year, but declined 2% from the preceding quarter. Institutional fixed income brokerage revenues remain solid, albeit down from the strong levels of the comparison periods.
Brokerage revenues in PCG were up 17% on a year-over-year basis, but flat sequentially due to lower trading volumes, which offset the benefit from higher asset balances and associated trailing commissions.  
For the fiscal year, brokerage revenues were up 13% to a record $2.2 billion, reflecting records for both PCG and fixed income which had a fantastic year that was a testament to their leading position in the depository segment.  
Account and service fees of $170 million increased 21% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, largely due to higher average mutual fund assets driving higher associated service fees.  
Paul already discussed our record investment banking results this quarter. So let me touch on other revenues. Other revenues of $74 million were up 35% sequentially, primarily due to higher tax credit funds revenues. We also had $18 million of private equity valuation gains during the quarter, of which approximately $5 million were attributable to noncontrolling interest reflected in other expenses.  
Moving to Slide 11. Clients' domestic cash sweep balances, which are the primary source of funding for our interest-earning assets and the balances with third-party banks that generate RJBDP fees, ended the quarter at a record $66.7 billion, up 6% over the preceding quarter and representing 6.3% of domestic PCG client assets.  
As we continue to experience growing cash balances and less demand from third-party banks during fiscal 2021, $10.8 billion of client cash is being held in the client interest program at the broker-dealer. Over time, that cash could be redeployed to our bank or third-party banks as capacity becomes available, which would hopefully earn a higher spread than we currently earn on short-term treasuries.  
On Slide 12, it was great to see an 8% sequential increase in the combined net interest income and BDP fees from third-party banks to $198 million. This growth was largely attributable to strong asset growth and a resilient net interest margin at Raymond James Bank, which remained right at 1.92% for the quarter.  
We expect the bank's NIM to settle right around 1.9% over the next couple of quarters. The average yield on RJBDP balances with third-party banks remained flat at 29 basis points in the quarter. If banks demand for deposits doesn't improve from current levels, we believe there will be downward pressure on this yield in fiscal 2022, especially in the back half of the fiscal year, which is why we have been so focused on generating on-balance sheet growth in assets that could deliver good risk-adjusted returns.  
Moving to consolidated expenses on Slide 13. First, our largest expense compensation. The compensation ratio decreased sequentially from 67.2% to 65.8%, largely due to record revenues in the Capital Markets segment, which had a very low 52% compensation ratio during the quarter.  
Given our current revenue mix and disciplined management of expenses, we are confident we can maintain a compensation ratio of 70% or lower in this near-0 short-term interest rate environment. And as we experienced in fiscal 2021, we can do meaningfully better than 70% with Capital Markets revenues at or near these record levels, which is our expectation for at least the next quarter or 2.
Noncompensation expenses of $361 million decreased 15% sequentially, primarily driven by the $98 million loss on extinguishment of debt in the fiscal third quarter. Somewhat offsetting this favorable variance, we had a modest provision for credit losses during the quarter compared with a bank loan loss reserve release in the fiscal third quarter.  
Overall, our results in fiscal 2021 show we have remained focused on managing controllable expenses while still investing in growth and ensuring high service levels for advisers and their clients. 
While we are still finalizing our fiscal 2022 budget, we do expect expenses to increase meaningfully in fiscal 2022 for a variety of reasons. First and foremost, we are going to continue investing in people and technology to support the phenomenal growth of our business over the past year, ensuring we maintain very high service levels and leading technology solutions for advisers and their clients.  
We also expect business development expenses to pick up as travel, recognition trips and conferences have already started resuming in the fiscal first quarter, which our advisers and associates are really excited about. Just as a reminder, business development expenses totaled about $200 million in fiscal 2019 before the start of the pandemic.  
Additionally, whereas we had a $32 million net benefit for credit losses in fiscal 2021, we would expect bank loan loss provisions for credit losses associated with net loan growth in fiscal 2022.
Slide 14 shows the pretax margin trend over the past 5 quarters. Pretax margin was 20.8% in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2021 and adjusted pretax margin was 21.2%, which was boosted by record revenues and still relatively subdued business development expenses.  
At our Analyst and Investor Day in June, we outlined a pretax margin target of 15% to 16% in this near-0 interest rate environment. And right now, we believe the top end of that range is an appropriate target, given the aforementioned expense growth we currently expect in fiscal 2022.
But as we experienced during the fiscal year, there is a meaningful upside to our margins when Capital Markets revenues are as strong as they have been in fiscal 2021.  
On Slide 15, at the end of the quarter, total assets were approximately $61.9 billion, an 8% sequential increase, reflecting solid growth of loans at Raymond James Bank as well as a substantial increase in client cash balances being held on the balance sheet.  
Liquidity and capital remained very strong. The total capital ratio of 26.2% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 12.6% are both over double the regulatory requirements to be well capitalized, giving us significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and grow the business.  
You can see that RJF corporate cash at the parent ended the quarter at $1.15 billion, decreasing 26% during the quarter as we have restricted the cash that we plan on using to close on the Charles Stanley acquisition, which we currently expect to close in the first or second quarter of fiscal 2022 for as soon as we receive the requisite regulatory approvals.  
Slide 16 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past 5 quarters. During the fiscal year, we repurchased nearly 1.5 million shares split adjusted for $118 million. As of October 27, $632 million remained under the current share repurchase authorization.  
Due to the restrictions following our announced acquisition of TriState Capital Holdings, we do not expect to repurchase common shares until after closing.  
Lastly, on Slide 17, we provide key credit metrics for Raymond James Bank. The credit quality of the bank's loan portfolio remains healthy, with most trends continuing to improve. Criticized loans declined and nonperforming assets remain low at just 20 basis points.  
The bank loan loss provision of $5 million was primarily driven by strong loan growth during the quarter. The bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percent of loans held for investment declined from 1.34% in the preceding quarter to 1.27% at quarter end.  
For the corporate portfolios, these allowances are higher at around 2.25%. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Paul Reilly to discuss our outlook. Paul?"

Overall, I'm very pleased with our fantastic results for this quarter and the fiscal year, which exceeded many records. As for our outlook, we are well positioned entering fiscal 2022 with strong capital ratios, quarter-end records for all of our key business metrics and strong activity levels for financial adviser recruiting and investment banking.  
In the Private Client Group segment, results will benefit modestly by starting the fiscal first quarter with a 2% sequential increase of assets in fee-based accounts. Additionally, based on our robust recruiting pipeline, we hope to continue our current recruiting trend as prospective advisers are attracted to our client-focused values and leading technology platforms.  
In the Capital Markets segment, the investment banking pipeline remains very strong, and we expect a solid fixed income brokerage results driven by demand from the depository client segment.  
In the Asset Management segment, if equity markets remain resilient, we expect results will be positively impacted by higher financial assets under management. And Raymond James Bank should continue to grow as we have ample funding and capital to grow the balance sheet. We will continue to focus on lending to PCG clients through our securities-based loans and mortgages, and we will continue to be selective and deliberate in growing our corporate loan and agency-backed securities portfolio.  
As we look ahead, we remain focused on the long term and our long-term growth. And as we've outlined at our recent Analyst and Investor Day, those key growth initiatives include driving organic growth across our core businesses, continuing to expand our investments in technology and sharpening our focus on strategic M&A.  
Our recent announcements to acquire TriState Capital and Charles Stanley Group demonstrate our focus on these initiatives and our commitment to deploy excess capital over time. We believe these acquisitions stay true to our long-standing criteria, which is a good cultural fit, a strategic purpose and makes sense for our shareholders. 
Finally, thank you again to our advisers and associates for providing excellent service to their clients during these uncertain times. These results are a testament to the dedication of everyone in the Raymond James family.  
With that, I'm going to turn it back over to the operator for questions."

I appreciate that the Capital Markets segment can drive some variability in margins and so that's tough to predict. And so that kind of all gets wrapped up in the firm-wide kind of margin commentary.  
But if we set that aside and we think about the business, I mean, you're sitting in a much better place heading into 2022 than you were in 2021. And I appreciate that you're also going to be ramping investment into the business as well, which makes sense.  
So as we think about the individual segments, whether it's PCG or Asset Management or the bank, can you just talk about where operating leverage may exist and then where it's more challenged just because of the investments? I think that would be helpful to unpack away from some of the maybe the difficulty in predicting Capital Markets? Because it does feel like there should still be some operating leverage in some of those areas, but want to just dig into those a little bit?"
22623,1685451847,2415708,"Raymond James Financial, Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Raymond James Financial, Inc.","Executives","Yes.

So the business that's probably -- it's our best business, but probably the most margin challenge the Private Client Group because it has a high comp ratio with our independent contractors. And if you're -- to deliver 20% margins in the business when you have a 70% comp ratio or less in these times, right, is -- shows the balance we have on really managing expenses and making sure we invest.  
So we had a good margin this year based on the growth. But the real delta in our margins come from the Capital Markets and the banks as they grow, and in Asset Management, they have much higher margins. And to the extent they grow, they drive our comp ratio down and our margins up. So those are the ones that have the delta.  
Now the good news is the backlog in Capital Markets is fantastic. It's at historic paces. And the problem with that business, as you know, it can stop on a dime and it could increase, but our visibility is really good into this first quarter, which is very strong.  
And the second quarter should be very good, too. After that, you never really know because of the M&A and underwriting part, it depends on the environment. The bank, we expect good growth. You saw very good growth this quarter. Given the markets right now, and I think a reasonable economy going forward, the best we all can tell, we should have growth there. And the Asset Management business continues to grow, especially with our record recruiting, and we're still on that same pace.  
If you look at commits and people coming through the office, we are still on a very, very -- we're still at that record pace. We took a snapshot today. So shorter term, we see these kind of very good margins.  
But if Capital Markets slow down or the economy turns and M&A deal stop and stuff, that's where we're going to get the margin compression again without interest rates. It wasn't that long ago that half of our pretax income was interest spreads. So we've lost that about overnight on March over 2 Fed meetings, and so it's kind of amazing getting these kind of margins without that help. So that's the other factor in this that we can't predict.  
If that comes back, even if the markets cool down, that's certainly going to continue to expand margins. So I wish I could tell you. I can tell you where we sit today, it looks good for the next quarter. But between the economy and Congress and regulators and interest rates, it all could change because those aren't in our control."

There's some new product focus and products they brought to the market, to their clients. The biggest factor has really been, if you look at the sweet spot in the business, it's the depository franchise and the depository franchise like all banks and us have a ton of cash.  
And in order to put that cash to work, they can make loans. And if they can't make loans fast enough, they buy securities, and that's where they really utilize us as -- actually for a lot of banks, almost as a treasury manager, we help them look at where they should invest in the spreads and yields. We provide a lot of tools for them. And that business has been very, very good because of the cash in the system. So as long as that cash in the system stays there, those brokerage revenues should be very, very good. And again, the fixed income business by far had its best record as did the Equity Capital Markets business. So combined, the Capital Markets segment was extremely good. 
And again, short term to midterm, everything we see today, we don't see that really slowing down off its pace. It's been a little slower in the last quarter than it had been earlier in the year, but I'd still call the numbers robust."

So first, on the PCG side, a lot of the competition decline has to do with the actions that you've taken to hold administer costs down even as the FA headcount and revenues have grown. So how should we think about the administrative and incentive comp in that segment going forward, given the recruiting momentum that you're seeing right now?

If you look at the addition of Financo and Cebile during this quarter, which, again, they only have a full year run rate in those numbers. Cebile being the most recent to join the platform and the hiring we've done across the platform. The leadership there has done a really good job of building scale where we were probably underscaled given our size competitors.  
So there is a scale play there, but the markets are very, very constructive. So it's a little bit of both in that business. And in the Private Client Group, a lot of business development expenses were low. We didn't have conferences. We didn't have award trips. We didn't have the regional meetings because of the pandemic. And now those are opening up.  
We have our first major conference early in November, and we've had smaller conferences and our first award trip, although they're smaller than traditional, they're still there, and there's some makeup award trips where we cancel them and move them into this year. And so we'll have some double trips and in fact in our employee group will have a double conference because we're going to -- we move this year's to the fall and next year's will come in the summer.  
So certainly, those expenses are back up. So that's just business as normal. And those are highly valued by advisers. They're a great cultural tool to reinforce the value of Raymond James or great training. These aren't just fun trips to people -- they're fun because we get together, but it's work. I mean there are classes, trainings, teaching. So they're very important to the long-term business, both teaching practice management and sharing best practices as well as explaining new regulations or new technology tools they need to learn.

So we try to be conservative there. And that doesn't even give them the benefit of where we expect most of the synergy to come from, which is really replacement of their higher cost deposits, a portion of their higher cost deposits with our lower-cost deposits. They are sitting on our balance sheet now earning very little in short-term treasuries at the broker-dealer per the regulation.
So between short-term rate increases, deposit replacements and the scalability of their technology-enabled model, we think there is a significant upside to the results over time."

As we bring more advisers in, their clients have a portion in cash. And we also see you'd say enough markets, you don't expect to see as high a percentage in cash, but people are using it often in lower fixed income. They're just saying they're worried about rates going up. They view -- many clients view the market as                 as it's continued to grow. And they're using their cash balances to hedge that a little bit.  
So even in up market, you got a pretty good percentage of cash. And again, as assets grow and the recruiting grow -- recruiting is driving it, and I think some investors are taking a little off the table and keeping some in cash as just a balancing or diversification hedge."

I mean I think bringing the cash on the balance sheet certainly does impact our Tier 1 leverage ratio and in stress periods, we do have sort of different type of metrics that we think about to absorb a surge in cash balances.  But a question we get",274,"Yes. I mean I think bringing the cash on the balance sheet certainly does impact our Tier 1 leverage ratio and in stress periods, we do have sort of different type of metrics that we think about to absorb a surge in cash balances.  
But a question we get a lot from investors and analysts is how do we think about that 10% ratio and potentially lowering that ratio over time, that target that we -- which is double the regulatory requirements.  
And our response to that is, as long as regulators continue to consider that as a part of your metric in your requirements, then we need to, in our business, have some cushion for a surge of cash balances because while cash balances are high now on an absolute basis, they are only 6.3% of client assets, which historically speaking, is a good 100 basis points lower than average.  
Now we can argue whether or not that's because asset values are higher than they were historically speaking. But it is not unfathomable to see a situation where cash balance is surged by another 10% to 20%. And as we saw in March 2020, regulators don't give firms relief for accommodating those client cash balances.  
So we still need to make sure we have ample flexibility because those type of environments are when we could be most opportunistic. So we don't want to be constrained by the Tier 1 leverage ratio. And unless regulators change the treatment of that accommodated client cash balance, which they didn't do in 2020, and I'm hopeful they will do, but not optimistic, then we need that cushion."

But even when you look at technology, that's something we're going to continue to invest heavily in to, again, continue providing a competitive platform for our advisers and their clients and to drive efficiency over time and scalability over time.  
That was up 9% this year. I could see it being up 10% plus next year just with our technology initiatives that we have on the docket. So I don't want to go line by line, but I think when you look at the various line items, you can see that there's sort of room for growth.  I mean just, again, stepping back, the noncomp expenses grew 5% in PCG this year versus a 19% growth rate. So I would say in hindsight, if we had known revenues were going to grow 19%, we probably would have grown those noncomp expenses higher than the 5%.  
Now some of that was helped by the business development with everything shut down. But that's not a sustainable relationship over time. We want to make sure that we continue supporting the business and the infrastructure, the support levels of the business over time."

We can tell you our visibility is it is and you know, and it's -- I think I remember I forget how many quarters ago, we talked about a slowdown for 1 quarter, but it would pick up, and certainly, it did again.  
And so we've been on this kind of ramp up for a couple of years. We still see very strong demand, whether it will be a record this coming year or just very strong, I don't know. But what we can see today is that ramp-up should be very good. And part of that net new asset growth is the markets when people bring accounts over or bring in new clients and the market's up, while the assets are up, so it helps drive that number, too.  
So it's very complex. I think all we can tell you right now is that all the factors are in place to show it should be very strong again this year. But to give you a number, I'd have to know what the market appreciation is, what recruiting is, what -- just so many factors that aren't predictable.  
I can just tell you that -- the things that drove it last year look still in place coming into this next quarter and how long it continues, I don't know. We all know that this kind of growth in the market isn't forever. There's going to be cycles. There could be shocks to the system. But I think we're well positioned on both sides, both to continue our growth. And if there's a shock to the system, our capital and liquidity will put us in good stead, so."

So we would still guide, all else being equal, to around 24% over the year. Now with that being said, where our stock price is now, we would expect it to be lower than that than the fiscal first quarter with the timing of our stock-based compensation that vest, there would be a tax benefit there in the first quarter based on the current price. 
But we think 24% over the year, plus or minus the impact from corporate-owned life insurance. And just as a reminder, the corporate-owned life insurance creates nontaxable gains when the equity markets are up and does the opposite when equity markets are down, and that's sort of the impact to the tax rate in that type of environment.

And that gets helped with an acquisition like the TriState acquisition, for example, bringing more balances on the balance sheet. The bank growth is anticipated to be strong. Our bank, Raymond James Bank, growth is anticipated to be strong this year as well, and we can also accelerate purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities if that demand from third-party banks doesn't pick up.
