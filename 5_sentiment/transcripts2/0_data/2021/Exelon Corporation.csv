We have a lot to talk about this morning, so Joe and I will try to go through it and allow adequate time for questions. Some of the stuff we have to talk about is bad. The recent events in Texas put some light on",1434,"Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everybody. We have a lot to talk about this morning, so Joe and I will try to go through it and allow adequate time for questions. Some of the stuff we have to talk about is bad. The recent events in Texas put some light on that, but we have some great other subjects to talk about, our strong performance in 2020, the results there and the future path for our business. 
I'll start with Texas. The experienced unprecedented sustained cold temperatures, as we know, impacted the energy system in the state, along with severely impacting the people who live there. As noted in last week's 8-K, we had operational issues with our plants due to the extreme weather. They only periodically were available when the prices hit and were maintained at the administrative cap of $9,000. Our preliminary estimate, and it is preliminary, of the impact of this event across our portfolio is $750 million to $950 million pretax or $560 million to $710 million post tax. 
At this point, the range is wide. It includes our best estimate for load obligations, ancillary charges and bad debt. It will take some time to refine this estimate. The data we normally comes to us is on a lag from ERCOT. With recently PUCT actions, the data has been further delayed and continued uncertainty around any future actions the PUCT or others may take. We expect to provide a better update no later than the first quarter earnings call. 
This loss is not acceptable to us. We are mitigating it through business updates, including first quarterly favorability, mostly onetime cost reductions and deferral of nonessential maintenance, which Joe will cover in further detail. We have, today, found updates and offsets that are expected to reduce our net impact up to $0.20 per share at the midpoint of our loss estimates, which is reflected in our earnings guidance. These mitigating efforts are expected to reduce the cash impact to $200 million. 
As you know, last week's events have raised many questions about the Texas market design and associated risks. And this has not been a new conversation, it's been one that's been around for a while. And we hope that through this, that the proper actions can be taken on the design. As a result, we are evaluating all our options with respect to our ERCOT business. 
Moving on to good news. Our 2020 operational and financial performance was strong. Our utilities maintained excellent operations not only in the face of the pandemic but in an extremely punishing storm year.  [indiscernible] hurricanes. In 1 day, we had 13 tornadoes in the service territory. The power of our utility platform paid off for us this year. The mutual assistance across the fleet helped achieve record restoration speeds for both ComEd and PECO. 
Each utility delivered excellent reliability, top decile outage frequency and top quartile outage duration. This performance was reflected in our customer satisfaction scores, with all utilities receiving their best on-record scores in first quartile customer satisfaction. 
Strong operations led to constructive regulatory results as we saw in the outcome of 3 rate cases across our jurisdictions in 2020. In December, the Maryland PSC approved BGE's first-ever multiyear plan, enabling investment in reliability. We're expecting orders for multiyear plans at both Pepco D.C. and Pepco Maryland. This is allowing for timely recovery while supporting jobs in the economy in D.C. and Maryland. 
Turning to Slide 7. Nuclear had another very good year, generating 150 terawatt-hours of zero-emitting power, avoiding 80 -- 78 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. The capacity factor was [ 95.4 ] second only to last year's performance in fleet history. The nuclear group completed 12 refueling outages and fewer days planned despite the rigorous pandemic protections. Our relationships with our retail customers continues to remain strong, with a 79% customer renewal rate, average customer duration of more than 6 years and power contracts of 21 months on average. 
Slide 8, the financial results. Exelon operations at robust cost led to our strong financial results, as you see on this slide. The pandemic reduced our demand for electricity, particularly at Constellation, which created financial headwinds for us. We reduced our earnings guidance on the first quarter call based on what we knew at the time, and we kept looking for ways to improve our earnings outlet throughout the year. We delivered on $400 million of savings, $150 million more than announced, which brought us well within our original earning guidance range. And then gains from the Constellation Technology Ventures portfolio brought us above the midpoint of our earnings guidance. We earned $2.01 on a GAAP basis and $3.22 on a non-GAAP basis. 
Turning to Slide 10. This morning's announcement is really a very good strategic move for us. With our Board, we completed -- concluded the separation of our regulated business -- regulated utilities in the competitive businesses is the best interest of all stakeholders and are moving forward with that decision. So separation, it establishes 2 best-in-class stand-alone companies, a high-growth, high-quality, 100% regulated utility and America's leading clean energy company producing the most clean energy paired with the best and largest customer-facing business in the country. 
It better positions each business within its peer set. And it will support business strategies tailored to the distinct business investment profiles and meeting unique customer needs. The same operational expertise, customer focus and financial discipline that you expect from this management team will continue to underpin the value proposition of each company. 
On Slide 11, the separation of the spin of the generation business to our Exelon shareholders, the regulatory business, which is being termed the remainco, shares the traits of a high-quality best-in-class utility, strong above-earnings growth rate of 6% to 8%, diversified rate base across 7 constructive jurisdictions with almost 100% of our rate base growth covered by alternative rate recovery mechanisms. Best-in-class operations and an attractive ESG attributes provide platforms to enable a transition to a clean energy economy without owning the generation. 
The spinco, Genco being titled a spinco for this, will be America's clean energy leader, will continue to produce electricity that is over 90% carbon-free, provide 11% of the clean energy in the country and with no coal-fired generation and emissions profile, our emissions profiles are significantly below the 1.5-degree C targets. Delivering solutions for our large customer-facing platform in the country, and we anticipate having an investment-grade rating on that balance sheet. 
The transition, going to Slide 12, Joe will get in more details around the strategy and the specifics of these 2 great companies, but let me hit on some of the key transaction considerations. The spin is designed to be a tax-free distribution of the spinco shares to the existing shareholders of Exelon. We will work hard to close by the end of the year, which provides execution benefits around a clean calendar year transition for the split. But regulatory approvals could potentially take longer. We have several required approvals, with long lead time items being the NRC and the New York Public Service Commission. We have good plans for each of these approvals and we'll be making the necessary files in the very near term. 
We maintain an open dialogue with the 3 credit agencies and anticipate both businesses remaining investment-grade under various scenarios. Our preliminary work on the dis-synergies gives us confidence that they will be able to at least offset them at both companies. 
Turning to the dividend. The Board has approved the dividend at $1.53 for 2021, which is holding it flat to last year. Remainco expects to target a 60% payout, in line with best-in-class high-growth peers and will grow its dividend consistent with earnings. The spinco will focus on the combination of debt paydown to support our credit metrics and return capital to our shareholders and continue to invest in clean energy solutions. Resolution of the Illinois legislative session and capacity auction results in June, along with a number of other factors, will have a bearing on the allocation of this strategy. 
From a funding perspective, we estimate the remainco will need around $1 billion of new equity capital through 2024 investment horizon. This could change depending on variations of factors that we expect to play out over the course of the year. The EPS bands that Joe will show you for the remainco already incorporate the potential future equity needs. I'm now going to turn the call over to Joe to talk more about the 2 business strategies and the outlook for 2021."

I will try to build on Chris' remarks by providing more detail about the 2 stand-alone businesses and then we'll discuss our 2021 guidance. I'll start with remainco on Slide 14. Our utilities will continue to",1725,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I will try to build on Chris' remarks by providing more detail about the 2 stand-alone businesses and then we'll discuss our 2021 guidance. I'll start with remainco on Slide 14. Our utilities will continue to be a premium business within the sector and share the characteristics of other high-quality utilities. They operate in constructive regulatory jurisdictions with nearly 100% of rate base growth recovered through alternative recovery mechanisms. 
We will continue to meet our commitments to our customers through bill affordability and best-in-class operations. We will maintain a keen focus on our ESG initiatives, including clean energy and diversity, equity and inclusion. And we'll continue to pursue a balanced and disciplined financial policy underpinned by a strong balance sheet. All of this will allow us to deliver on industry-leading rate base and earnings growth, built on strong returns on equity, growing the remainco business model well into the future. 
If you turn to Slide 15, we show remainco's growth outlook. We have a robust investment plan across our utilities to continue to improve reliability and resiliency, enhance the service experience for our customers and prepare for a clean energy future. In 2021, we intend to invest nearly $6.6 billion and a total of $27 billion over the next 4 years. Since our last capital investment disclosure, we have identified more than $500 million in additional investment needs across our system that will provide further benefits for our customers and communities. We are planning to grow our rate base by 7.6% annually, [indiscernible] to $58.8 billion, adding nearly $15 billion to rate base by 2024. Our rate base growth has improved by 30 basis points since last year. And as a reminder, our capital forecast reflects only identified projects that we expect to recover through our normal rate filings and other recovery mechanisms. 
I will also point out that the largest project in our plan is less than 1% of our capital spend from 2021 to 2024, avoiding concentration risk with any particular project. Our earnings per share outlook remains strong at 6% to 8% growth. Compared to last year's update, this growth reflects updates to our rate base forecast and our assumptions around funding remainco's growth with debt and the $1 billion equity issuance through 2024 that Chris mentioned. We are confident this growth extends beyond 2024. I would note that 2025 will further benefit from rate case timing as you think about your long-term modeling. 
We deliver on this strong growth while maintaining a focus on affordability, which is paramount to a successful utility. We will continue to manage our costs and support energy efficiency programs to keep bill inflation in check even as we make these investments that benefit our customers. 
Now turning to Slide 16. Remainco is a 100% fully regulated transmission and distribution utility with no generation. It is diversified across 7 regulatory jurisdictions with no 1 jurisdiction representing the majority of the rate base. We have worked with stakeholders in our jurisdictions to establish recovery mechanisms that allow us to prudently and efficiently invest in critical infrastructure for the benefit of our customers while generating an appropriate return on capital. Nearly 100% of our rate base growth will be covered by alternative mechanisms by the end of our planning period. 
These mechanisms include multiyear plans in Maryland and D.C., formula rates for both transmission and distribution, capital and other trackers as well as forward-looking test years. We see the combination of being a fully regulated T&D utility with geographic diversity and constructive regulatory designs as a clear differentiator among our utility peers. 
Turning to Slide 17. Chris covered our 2020 operations earlier, but I wanted to highlight our operations over time, which consistently outperform the sector average, bringing tangible benefits to our customers. 
Moving to Slide 18. Environmental, social and governance or ESG values have been at the core of our business since Exelon's founding. We have been committed to doing what is right for all our stakeholders and that will not change. Specifically, remainco is committed to working within our states, regulators and communities to make investments that help them achieve their environmental and clean energy goals. 
Continuing to support our diverse employees, customers and communities and create a workforce that reflects our community and operate responsibly and transparently maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance. ESG will continue to be an integral part of remainco's strategy as a stand-alone company. 
Moving to spinco on Slide 20. Spinco will be the largest supplier of clean energy and sustainable solutions to its customers. It produces 12% or 1 out of every 9 megawatt-hours of carbon-free electricity in the United States. Spinco is an essential partner to businesses and federal, state and local governments that are setting carbon reduction goals and seeking long-term solutions to the climate crisis. 
Spinco's clean generation fleet is paired with one of the largest customer-facing platforms with the leading share in the C&I market where we continue to have very high customer renewal and retention rates. It is also the best operator of nuclear power plants in the country. As Chris mentioned, we are in ongoing conversations with rating agencies and anticipate that spinco will remain investment-grade. It will continue to have a disciplined financial policy focused on optimizing cash flows to support the balance sheet, invest in clean energy solutions and return value to shareholders. 
On Slide 21, you can see how spinco's clean generation fleet stacks up against others. Spinco is and will be the leading clean energy producer in the United States. It does not own coal-fired generation and 90% of its output is emissions-free. As a result, spinco produces nearly double the clean energy of the next leading provider and more than 8 to 17x the clean energy of its IPP peers. It also has the lowest emissions intensity, nearly fivefold less intensive than the next generator and more than 13 to 15x less carbon-intensive than the other IPPs. These attributes are a clear advantage for spinco as the Biden administration commits to 100% zero-carbon electricity sector by 2035 to address the climate crisis. 
Turning to Slide 22. Each of spinco's states have or are looking to set ambitious emissions reductions for clean energy goals. Spinco's generation is essential to helping states meet their goals in an affordable manner. Spinco provides a significant amount of the clean energy in the states where it operates. In Illinois and Maryland, it provides nearly all of the clean electricity in the state. Losing any of these assets would be a significant step backward for each state in meeting its goals while also creating higher cost for customers and significant economic hardship for host communities. The company will continue to be a leading advocate for clean energy policies aimed at preserving and growing clean energy to combat the climate crisis. 
Spinco's clean energy leadership extends beyond the power generation fleet. As you can see on Slide 23, our Constellation business has also been a leader in developing and providing clean energy and sustainability solutions for our customers. The desire of our customers to positively impact the environment is real. And the Constellation business leads the charge through new products and strategic investments to help our customers. 
Not only have these efforts been economically beneficial with solid margins, they've also yielded strong customer retention rates and opened up additional revenue opportunities. One example of this is our core product. Constellation serves as an intermediary between the renewable developer and the customer, filling a niche where multiple offtakes are needed for 150- to 250-megawatt sized projects, and customers may have varying demands for term and deal structure. It allows Constellation to provide a customized solution for our customers. 
Moving to Slide 24. It shows the operational performance of Generation over time compared to the industry. Generation remains the best operator of nuclear power plants in the United States with industry-leading capacity factors of approximately 94% or better and industry-leading refueling outage days at least 10 days better than the industry average every year. 
Turning to our customer-facing business on Slide 25. Constellation's retail business is strong. It is steady, repeatable, and with stable margins. Customer retention rates have averaged 77% over the last 5 years, with average contract terms of 25 months and customer duration of more than 6 years. Constellation is successful at acquiring new customers with a win rate of 29%. We have the largest C&I customer base and that remains key to our strategy. First, C&I customers have higher load factors compared to residential customers and are less exposed to seasonal and weather fluctuations. Second, C&I customers allow us to achieve scale that cannot be done with residential customers. And finally, although the gross margins may be higher on residential customers, these margins do not account for the cost to acquire these customers, which are higher than C&I. 
Turning to Slide 26. There are uncertainties that will impact spinco's future such as legislation in Illinois, the next PJM auction and potential federal carbon legislation. Regardless of those outcomes, spinco will continue to focus on its strong investment-grade rated balance sheet, supported by stable free cash flows which we see in the different scenarios we are currently considering. Exelon Generation has a strong record of cost management with announced savings of more than $1.1 billion since 2015 and that cost discipline will not change. We will continue to seek fair compensation for the zero-carbon attributes while maintaining the discipline to retire uneconomic assets and opportunistically monetize others. 
We will provide a more detailed capital allocation strategy, including debt reduction, return of capital to shareholders and growth later this year when we have more clarity on these policy and auction outcomes. That said, we are confident that our disciplined approach will keep spinco an investment-grade rated business regardless of those outcomes. 
Finally, I'll conclude with our 2021 earnings guidance on Slide 28. We are providing 2021 adjusted operating earnings guidance of $2.60 to $3 per share, which incorporates the midpoint of the range for the severe weather impacts, offset by the opportunities that Chris discussed. Our disclosures, including O&M, CapEx and gross margin reflect the mitigation opportunities we have identified and factored into this guidance. Thank you, and now I'll turn the call back to Chris for closing remarks."

We'll meet or exceed our financial commitments, delivering earnings within our guidance strange and maintain a strong balance sheet. We'll continue our work to mitigate the impact of ERCOT losses and maximize the earnings and cash flow. 
At the utilities, we will prudently and effectively deploy $6.6 billion of capital to benefit the customers and meet the state's energy policy goals. We will work with our regulators to ensure timely recovery on these investments. We'll continue to advocate for clean energy climate policies with the new administration and Congress in the states to put our country on a path of meeting the carbon reduction goals. 
In Illinois, stakeholders continue the discussion on clean energy legislation. The governor's call for passing an energy bill session that protects our nuclear fleet, grows renewable energy and supports customers and job creation. We expect the legislative process to ramp up in the coming weeks and months. We will continue to work with all interested parties on legislation that will achieve the state's clean energy goals and a power system dependability while protecting our customers from higher bills, dirtier air in our communities from the loss of the economic engines that our nuclear plants are. 
We will be a partner in allied to our communities we serve, including following through on our work we have underway on social justice, racial equity and restoring civil discourse. Thank you, and I'll open the call up for questions."

I mean, obviously, we were heartened to see the administration set the carbon-free power sector goal by 2035. And we know that there are a number of steps that are to come, including, as you mentioned, potential for climate legislation. But I would keep my eye on the administration needs to set an NDC for the U.S., a Nationally Determined Contribution to match up to the new commitment to the Paris target. We do expect that to be more aggressive than in the past. And that will sort of set the tone for what Congress takes up. 
But I think the nearest-term thing to look to is the push for in infrastructure package. There are a number of business in labor and other interests pushing the administration to move forward on a piece of legislation that itself could make progress on climate. So separate from a pure climate bill, an infrastructure bill that included tax incentives for clean energy development, electric vehicle, storage, climate resilient infrastructure is sort of the first thing to look out for. 
And then I think once that gets done, we'll see the discussions ramp up around what the future sort of national climate policy is going to look like. As you know, the administration has already expressed support for a national clean energy standard that counts nuclear as clean. And so that clearly will be on the table, but there will also be discussions about a carbon tax dividend approach. And with the growing public support for national action, we, as Chris said, are working with folks in Washington to make sure that the proper design is included in the sense that we need something that is going to be cognizant of the customer impact but also aggressive enough to address the challenge of the climate crisis. 
The last thing I'd say, I guess, is that while those are all extremely positive developments, they do take time. Legislation in Washington will take some time to enact and then it will take time to implement. So that's why our focus does remain at the state level on moving forward with legislation that will support the state's air pollution reduction, electrification of the economy and job creation and equity so that we can make progress now while the federal discussions continue."

We're investing for the benefit of our consumers and improving reliability and the customer experience. But we're also trying to make sure that we reduce the regulatory lag, and we've seen that with things like the multiyear rate plan in Maryland and D.C. for example.

296181,702990430,2221814,"Exelon Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2021",2021-02-24,"Earnings Calls","Exelon Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everybody. We have a lot to talk about this morning, so Joe and I will try to go through it and allow adequate time for questions. Some of the stuff we have to talk about is bad. The recent events in Texas have  some light o",1433,"Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everybody. We have a lot to talk about this morning, so Joe and I will try to go through it and allow adequate time for questions. Some of the stuff we have to talk about is bad. The recent events in Texas have  some light on that, but we have some great other subjects to talk about, our strong performance in 2020, the results there and the future path for our business.  
I'll start with Texas. The experienced unprecedented sustained cold temperatures, as we know, impacted the energy system in the state, along with severely impacting the people who live there. As noted in last week's 8-K, we had operational issues with our plants due to the extreme weather. They only periodically were available when the prices hit and were maintained at the administrative cap of $9,000. Our preliminary estimate, and it is preliminary, of the impact of this event across our portfolio is $750 million to $950 million pretax or $560 million to $710 million post tax.  
At this point, the range is wide. It includes our best estimate for load obligations, ancillary charges and bad debt. It will take some time to refine this estimate. The data we normally -- comes to us is on a lag from ERCOT. With recently PUCT actions, the data has been further delayed and continued uncertainty around any future actions the PUCT or others may take. We expect to provide a better update no later than the first quarter earnings call.  
This loss is not acceptable to us. We are mitigating it through business updates, including first quarterly favorability, mostly onetime cost reductions and deferral of nonessential maintenance, which Joe will cover in further detail. We have, today, found updates and offsets that are expected to reduce our net impact up to $0.20 per share at the midpoint of our loss estimates, which is reflected in our earnings guidance. These mitigating efforts are expected to reduce the cash impact to $200 million.  
As you know, last week's events have raised many questions about the Texas market design and associated risks. And this has not been a new conversation, it's been one that's been around for a while. And we hope that through this, that the proper actions can be taken on the design. As a result, we are evaluating all our options with respect to our ERCOT business.  
Moving on to good news. Our 2020 operational and financial performance was strong. Our utilities maintained excellent operations not only in the face of the pandemic but in an extremely punishing storm year.  Derechos, hurricanes, in 1 day, we had 13 tornadoes in the ComEd service territory. The power of our utility platform paid off for us this year. The mutual assistance across the fleet helped achieve record restoration speeds for both ComEd and PECO.  
Each utility delivered excellent reliability, top decile outage frequency and top quartile outage duration. This performance was reflected in our customer satisfaction scores, with all utilities receiving their best on-record scores in first quartile customer satisfaction.  
Strong operations led to constructive regulatory results as we saw in the outcome of 3 rate cases across our jurisdictions in 2020. In December, the Maryland PSC approved BGE's first-ever multiyear plan, enabling investment in reliability. We're expecting orders for multiyear plans at both Pepco D.C. and Pepco Maryland. This is allowing for timely recovery while supporting jobs in the economy in D.C. and Maryland.  
Turning to Slide 7. Nuclear had another very good year, generating 150 terawatt-hours of zero-emitting power, avoiding 80 -- 78 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. The capacity factor was 95.4%, second only to last year's performance in fleet history. The nuclear group completed 12 refueling outages and fewer days planned despite the rigorous pandemic protections. Our relationships with our retail customers continues to remain strong, with a 79% customer renewal rate, average customer duration of more than 6 years and power contracts of 21 months on average.    
Slide 8, the financial results. Excellent operations and robust cost led to our strong financial results, as you see on this slide. The pandemic reduced our demand for electricity, particularly at Constellation, which created financial headwinds for us. We reduced our earnings guidance on the first quarter call based on what we knew at the time, and we kept looking for ways to improve our earnings outlet throughout the year. We delivered on $400 million of savings, $150 million more than announced, which brought us well within our original earning guidance range. And then gains from the Constellation Technology Ventures portfolio brought us above the midpoint of our earnings guidance. We earned $2.01 on a GAAP basis and $3.22 on a non-GAAP basis.  
Turning to Slide 10. This morning's announcement is really a very good strategic move for us. With our Board, we completed -- concluded the separation of our regulated business -- regulated utilities in the competitive businesses is the best interest of all stakeholders and are moving forward with that decision. So separation, it establishes 2 best-in-class stand-alone companies: a high-growth, high-quality, 100% regulated utility and America's leading clean energy company, producing the most clean energy paired with the best and largest customer-facing business in the country.  
It better positions each business within its peer set. And it will support business strategies tailored to the distinct business investment profiles and meeting unique customer needs. The same operational expertise, customer focus and financial discipline that you expect from this management team will continue to underpin the value proposition of each company.  
On Slide 11, the separation, the spin of the generation business to our existing Exelon shareholders, the regulatory business, which is being termed the RemainCo, shares the traits of a high-quality best-in-class utility, strong above-earnings growth rate of 6% to 8%, diversified rate base across 7 constructive jurisdictions with almost 100% of our rate base growth covered by alternative rate recovery mechanisms. Best-in-class operations and an attractive ESG attributes provide platforms to enable a transition to a clean energy economy without owning the generation.  
The SpinCo, Genco being titled as SpinCo for this, will be America's clean energy leader, will continue to produce electricity that is over 90% carbon-free, provide 11% of the clean energy in the country and with no coal-fired generation and emissions profile, our emissions profiles are significantly below the 1.5-degree C targets, delivering solutions for our large customer-facing platform in the country, and we anticipate having an investment-grade rating on that balance sheet.  
The transition, going to Slide 12, Joe will get in more details around the strategy and the specifics of these 2 great companies, but let me hit on some of the key transaction considerations. The spin is designed to be a tax-free distribution of the SpinCo shares to the existing shareholders of Exelon. We will work hard to close by the end of the year, which provides execution benefits around a clean calendar year transition for the split. But regulatory approvals could potentially take longer. We have several required approvals, with long lead time items being the NRC and the New York Public Service Commission. We have good plans for each of these approvals, and we'll be making the necessary files in the very near term.  
We maintain an open dialogue with the 3 credit agencies and anticipate both businesses remaining investment-grade under various scenarios. Our preliminary work on dis-synergy gives us confidence that they will be able to at least offset them at both companies.  
Turning to the dividend. The Board has approved the dividend at $1.53 for 2021, which is holding it flat to last year. RemainCo expects to target a 60% payout, in line with best-in-class high-growth peers and will grow its dividend consistent with earnings. The SpinCo will focus on the combination of debt pay-down to support our credit metrics and return capital to our shareholders and continue to invest in clean energy solutions.  
Resolution of the Illinois legislative session and capacity auction results in June, along with a number of other factors, will have a bearing on the allocation of this strategy.  
From a funding perspective, we estimate the RemainCo will need around $1 billion of new equity capital through 2024 investment horizon. This could change depending on variations of factors that we expect to play out over the course of the year. The EPS bands that Joe will show you for the RemainCo already incorporate the potential future equity needs. I'm now going to turn the call over to Joe to talk more about the 2 business strategies and the outlook for 2021."

I will try to build on Chris' remarks by providing more detail about the 2 stand-alone businesses and then we'll discuss our 2021 guidance. I'll start with RemainCo on Slide 14. Our utilities will continue to be a premium business within the sector and share the characteristics of other high-quality utilities. They operate in constructive regulatory jurisdictions with nearly 100% of rate base growth recovered through alternative recovery mechanisms. We will continue to meet our commitments to our customers through bill affordability and best-in-class operations. We will maintain a keen focus on our ESG initiatives, including clean energy, and diversity, equity and inclusion, and we'll continue to pursue a balanced and disciplined financial policy underpinned by a strong balance sheet. All of this will allow us to deliver on industry-leading rate base and earnings growth, built on strong returns on equity, growing the RemainCo business model well into the future.  
If you turn to Slide 15, we show RemainCo's growth outlook. We have a robust investment plan across our utilities to continue to improve reliability and resiliency, enhance the service experience for our customers and prepare for a clean energy future. In 2021, we intend to invest nearly $6.6 billion and a total of $27 billion over the next 4 years. Since our last capital investment disclosure, we have identified more than $500 million in additional investment needs across our system that will provide further benefits for our customers and communities. We are planning to grow our rate base by 7.6% annually, subject to $58.8 billion, adding nearly $15 billion to rate base by 2024. Our rate base growth has improved by 30 basis points since last year. And as a reminder, our capital forecast reflects only identified projects that we expect to recover through our normal rate filings and other recovery mechanisms.  
I will also point out that the largest project in our plan is less than 1% of our capital spend from 2021 to 2024, avoiding concentration risk with any particular project. Our earnings per share outlook remains strong at 6% to 8% growth. Compared to last year's update, this growth reflects updates to our rate base forecast and our assumptions around funding RemainCo's growth with debt and the $1 billion equity issuance through 2024 that Chris mentioned. We are confident this growth extends beyond 2024. I would note that 2025 will further benefit from rate case timing as you think about your long-term modeling.  
We deliver on this strong growth while maintaining a focus on affordability, which is paramount to a successful utility. We will continue to manage our costs and support energy efficiency programs to keep bill inflation in check even as we make these investments that benefit our customers.  
Now turning to Slide 16. RemainCo is a 100% fully regulated transmission and distribution utility with no generation. It is diversified across 7 regulatory jurisdictions with no one jurisdiction representing the majority of the rate base. We have worked with stakeholders in our jurisdictions to establish recovery mechanisms that allow us to prudently and efficiently invest in critical infrastructure for the benefit of our customers while generating an appropriate return on capital. Nearly 100% of our rate base growth will be covered by alternative mechanisms by the end of our planning period.  
These mechanisms include multiyear plans in Maryland and D.C., formula rates for both transmission and distribution, capital and other trackers as well as forward-looking test years. We see the combination of being a fully regulated T&D utility with geographic diversity and constructive regulatory designs as a clear differentiator among our utility peers.  
Turning to Slide 17. Chris covered our 2020 operations earlier, but I wanted to highlight our operations over time, which consistently outperform the sector average, bringing tangible benefits to our customers.  
Moving to Slide 18. Environmental, social and governance or ESG values have been at the core of our business since Exelon's founding. We have been committed to doing what is right for all our stakeholders and that will not change. Specifically, RemainCo is committed to working within our states, regulators and communities to make investments that help them achieve their environmental and clean energy goals; continuing to support our diverse employees, customers and communities and create a workforce that reflects our community; and operate responsibly and transparently, maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance. ESG will continue to be an integral part of RemainCo's strategy as a stand-alone company.  
Moving to SpinCo on Slide 20. SpinCo will be the largest supplier of clean energy and sustainable solutions to its customers. It produces 12% or one out of every 9 megawatt-hours of carbon-free electricity in the United States. SpinCo is an essential partner to businesses and federal, state and local governments that are setting carbon reduction goals and seeking long-term solutions to the climate crisis.  
SpinCo's clean generation fleet is paired with one of the largest customer-facing platforms with the leading share in the C&I market where we continue to have very high customer renewal and retention rates. It is also the best operator of nuclear power plants in the country. As Chris mentioned, we are in ongoing conversations with rating agencies and anticipate that SpinCo will remain investment-grade. It will continue to have a disciplined financial policy focused on optimizing cash flows to support the balance sheet, invest in clean energy solutions and return value to shareholders.  
On Slide 21, you can see how SpinCo's clean generation fleet stacks up against others. SpinCo is and will be the leading clean energy producer in the United States. It does not own coal-fired generation and 90% of its output is emissions-free. As a result, SpinCo produces nearly double the clean energy of the next leading provider and more than 8 to 17x the clean energy of its IPP peers. It also has the lowest emissions intensity, nearly fivefold less intensive than the next generator and more than 13 to 15x less carbon-intensive than the other IPPs. These attributes are a clear advantage for SpinCo as the Biden administration commits to 100% zero-carbon electricity sector by 2035 to address the climate crisis.  
Turning to Slide 22. Each of SpinCo's states have or are looking to set ambitious emissions reductions for clean energy goals. SpinCo's generation is essential to helping states meet their goals in an affordable manner. SpinCo provides a significant amount of the clean energy in the states where it operates. In Illinois and Maryland, it provides nearly all of the clean electricity in the state. Losing any of these assets would be a significant step backward for each state in meeting its goals while also creating higher cost for customers and significant economic hardship for host communities. The company will continue to be a leading advocate for clean energy policies aimed at preserving and growing clean energy to combat the climate crisis.  
SpinCo's clean energy leadership extends beyond the power generation fleet. As you can see on Slide 23, our Constellation business has also been a leader in developing and providing clean energy and sustainability solutions for our customers. The desire of our customers to positively impact the environment is real. And the Constellation business leads the charge through new products and strategic investments to help our customers.  
Not only have these efforts been economically beneficial with solid margins, they've also yielded strong customer retention rates and opened up additional revenue opportunities. One example of this is our CORe product. Constellation serves as an intermediary between the renewable developer and the customer, filling a niche where multiple offtakes are needed for 150- to 250-megawatt sized projects, and customers may have varying demands for term and deal structure. It allows Constellation to provide a customized solution for our customers. 
Moving to Slide 24. It shows the operational performance of Generation over time compared to the industry. Generation remains the best operator of nuclear power plants in the United States with industry-leading capacity factors of approximately 94% or better and industry-leading refueling outage days at least 10 days better than the industry average every year. 
Turning to our customer-facing business on Slide 25. Constellation's retail business is strong. It is steady, repeatable, and with stable margins. Customer retention rates have averaged 77% over the last 5 years, with average contract terms of 25 months and customer duration of more than 6 years. Constellation is successful at acquiring new customers with a win rate of 29%. We have the largest C&I customer base and that remains key to our strategy. First, C&I customers have higher load factors compared to residential customers and are less exposed to seasonal and weather fluctuations. Second, C&I customers allow us to achieve scale that cannot be done with residential customers. And finally, although the gross margins may be higher on residential customers, these margins do not account for the cost to acquire these customers, which are higher than C&I. 
Turning to Slide 26. There are uncertainties that will impact SpinCo's future such as legislation in Illinois, the next PJM auction and potential federal carbon legislation. Regardless of those outcomes, SpinCo will continue to focus on its strong investment-grade rated balance sheet, supported by stable free cash flows which we see in the different scenarios we are currently considering. Exelon Generation has a strong record of cost management with announced savings of more than $1.1 billion since 2015 and that cost discipline will not change. We will continue to seek fair compensation for the zero-carbon attributes while maintaining the discipline to retire uneconomic assets and opportunistically monetize others. 
We will provide a more detailed capital allocation strategy, including debt reduction, return of capital to shareholders and growth later this year when we have more clarity on these policy and auction outcomes. That said, we are confident that our disciplined approach will keep SpinCo an investment-grade rated business regardless of those outcomes. 
Finally, I'll conclude with our 2021 earnings guidance on Slide 28. We are providing 2021 adjusted operating earnings guidance of $2.60 to $3 per share, which incorporates the midpoint of the range for the severe weather impacts, offset by the opportunities that Chris discussed. Our disclosures, including O&M, CapEx and gross margin reflect the mitigation opportunities we have identified and factored into this guidance. Thank you, and now I'll turn the call back to Chris for closing remarks."

We'll meet or exceed our financial commitments, delivering earnings within our guidance strange and maintain a strong balance sheet. We'll continue our work to mitigate the impact of ERCOT losses and maximize the earnings and cash flow. 
At the utilities, we will prudently and effectively deploy $6.6 billion of capital to benefit the customers and meet the state's energy policy goals. We will work with our regulators to ensure timely recovery on these investments. We'll continue to advocate for clean energy climate policies with the new administration, Congress and the states to put our country on a path of meeting the carbon reduction goals. 
In Illinois, stakeholders continue the discussion on clean energy legislation. The governor has called for passing an energy bill this session that protects our nuclear fleet, grows renewable energy and supports customers and job creation. We expect the legislative process to ramp up in the coming weeks and months. We will continue to work with all interested parties on legislation that will achieve the state's clean energy goals and a power system dependability while protecting our customers from higher bills, dirtier air in our communities from the loss of the economic engines that our nuclear plants are. 
We will be a partner and ally to our communities we serve, including following through on our work we have underway on social justice, racial equity and restoring civil discourse. Thank you, and I'll open the call up for questions."

I wanted to talk about your Constellation Technology Ventures investment portfolio. I think you laid that out well on Slide 45.

I mean, obviously, we were heartened to see the administration set the carbon-free power sector goal by 2035. And we know that there are a number of steps that are to come, including, as you mentioned, potential for climate legislation. But I would keep my eye on the administration needs to set an NDC for the U.S., a nationally determined contribution to match up to the new commitment to the Paris target. We do expect that to be more aggressive than in the past. And that will sort of set the tone for what Congress takes up. 
But I think the nearest-term thing to look to is the push for an infrastructure package. There are a number of business and labor and other interests pushing the administration to move forward on a piece of legislation that itself could make progress on climate. So separate from a pure climate bill, an infrastructure bill that included tax incentives for clean energy development, electric vehicle, storage, climate-resilient infrastructure is sort of the first thing to look out for. 
And then I think once that gets done, we'll see the discussions ramp up around what the future sort of national climate policy is going to look like. As you know, the administration has already expressed support for a national clean energy standard that counts nuclear as clean. And so that clearly will be on the table, but there will also be discussions about a carbon tax dividend approach. And with the growing public support for national action, we, as Chris said, are working with folks in Washington to make sure that the proper design is included in the sense that we need something that is going to be cognizant of the customer impact but also aggressive enough to address the challenge of the climate crisis. 
The last thing I'd say, I guess, is that while those are all extremely positive developments, they do take time. Legislation in Washington will take some time to enact and then it will take time to implement. So that's why our focus does remain at the state level on moving forward with legislation that will support the state's climate goals, air pollution reduction, electrification of the economy and job creation and equity so that we can make progress now while the federal discussions continue."

But you take in an isolated market where you do not have the ability to import to cover your load, you have a price cap that's significantly high and you essentially lose your sights. It is not something you can hedge for at this time in ERCOT, and that's what we have to work on. But our hedging strategy and our ability to have our customer-facing products in our retail C&I and residential business has many risk focuses on that, and we continue to work as the markets evolve. 
So we're not looking at it like this is an event everywhere across the country as long as we keep focusing on sound market designs, understanding capacity requirements and the investments required by the generators to prevent such volatility. But our hedging strategy is the key to that."

As you've seen from our earlier releases and notifications, we had mixed results in the first quarter. We performed well across our businesses outside of the challenges from 5 days in February due to the Texas weather event. 
Overall, our first quarter GAAP loss was $0.30 per share and our non-GAAP loss was $0.06 per share. Exelon Utilities performed well operationally and financially during the quarter, delivering $0.72 per share, which is $0.11 better than the first quarter last year. At ExGen, we lost $0.58 per share overall, with the February weather event costing $0.90 per share in the first quarter. The event was unprecedented. We continue to investigate the multiple complex factors that led to our plant outages. And we are working with ERCOT regulators and other stakeholders to ensure an event like this does not happen again. 
As you saw in our 8-K last week, we updated our full year losses at $150 million due to the updated load meter data in ERCOT default payments that differed from our original estimate. In addition, we reaffirmed our full year guidance of $2.60 to $3 per share. We continue to work on mitigating this approximately $1 billion loss, and expect to offset the loss by $410 million to $490 million after taxes through a combination of mostly onetime cost reductions and deferral of nonessential maintenance and revenue opportunities. Joe is going to go in much more detail on that in his presentation. 
Turning to the operations. 
Despite the extreme cold winters, and the winter storms, the pandemic conditions, our utilities had a strong operational performance, delivering reliability, affordable electricity and gas for our consumers. All the utilities achieved first quartile operating performance in outage duration and frequency. BGE, ComEd and PHI were in top decile in outage duration. Customer operations metrics remained strong across the utilities. PECO and BGE's customer satisfaction levels were top decile. ComEd was top quartile. And PHI just missed top quartile, but improved year-over-year. 
On the generation front, in the face of extreme temperatures, winter storms, our nuclear plants provided 37 terawatt hours of reliable, resilient and clean to the grid of the citizens of Illinois, Pennsylvania, New York and Maryland. The fleet capacity factor of 95.3% was what we reached for the quarter. 
The spring has been active -- switching to policy. The spring has been active on the policy front with momentum building at both federal and state levels for policies that recognize the value of existing nuclear and would put the country on a path to a net 0 future. Both ExGen and the Utilities are well positioned to benefit from these policies and the transition to a clean energy economy. 
On the federal level, the Biden administration has set out an ambitious goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50% to 52% by 2030. Nuclear provides more than half of the carbon-free emission electricity in the U.S., with Exelon plants providing 12% of all the carbon-free energy in the United States. The administration is clear that preserving the existing nuclear fleet is key in meeting the goals that they have set. 
The administration's infrastructure proposal, the American Jobs Plan, would enact policies to help reach the goal. It includes a clean electricity standard that would require 100% clean electricity by 2035, with existing nuclear qualifying as clean; incentives to build 500,000 EV charging stations by 2030; and for 20 gigawatts of high-voltage transmission lines to be built to support the renewable build-out. We're encouraged that the administration and members of Congress recognize the importance of preserving the nuclear fleet to meet the country's clean energy and climate goals. The timing and the outcome of the federal legislation is highly uncertain. And in any case, it will be too late to reverse the retirement decisions for Byron and Dresden. 
Our states are also advancing clean energy policies. In Illinois, 6 energy policy reform bills have been introduced that would drive the transition to clean energy and then address climate change. The legislative leaders are meeting to craft a package from the various bills that can be considered this session. We're encouraged by the expression of support that continued -- for the continued operation of the nuclear plants. 
However, the details really matter. A bill needs to pass before the end of the regular session, and it needs to provide support for continuing to invest in the Illinois fleet. Current market prices do not continue to meet -- do not allow us to continue to meet our payroll, paying our property taxes, and covering other significant costs and risks of operating these assets. Without adequate policy, as I've stated to you, that we will retire uneconomic plants beginning this fall. 
If you take a look at what happened in New Jersey last week, the Board concluded that the financial challenges faced by nuclear plants there justified a maximum ZEC of $10 per megawatt hour. The same voices that are arguing in Illinois that our plants are profitable were overruled in New Jersey's decision. The commission in New Jersey emphasized that maintaining the existing nuclear plants was critical to achieving the state's emission goals and -- significantly less costly than replacing nuclear with other 0 free carbon generation. This is true in Illinois. Keeping the nuclear plants running is better option for the customers than trying to replace them with all renewables in storage. At 12x the cost, higher cost than preserving the nuclear plants, it would cost the Illinois consumers over $80 billion more to achieve the same admissions. We've been advocating for policy changes in Illinois for more than 2 years because I feel that we have a duty to our customers to preserve every opportunity to correct flawed policies and keep these critical energy resources running. But we're almost out of time, and we'll prematurely retire these assets in the fall if the policy reforms are not passed in this session. 
Turning to clean energy policy in Pennsylvania. The Senate is moving forward on a bill that would set a state goal for transportation, electrification and authorized electric utilities to develop EV infrastructure and plans authorize a recovery for these investments. 
We support these federal and state policy efforts and stand ready to enable this important transition to a clean energy future. Joe will talk about what our utilities are doing currently on EVs. 
Moving on to the separation update. Our team is working to get the separation done. We filed our applications for regulatory approval at FERC, the NRC, New York Public Service Commission in February. The NRC has indicated that our application is complete, and they expect to rule by November 30. In New York, comments are due on May 24. And we requested that the commission rule no later than their December 16 meeting. We're on track to get the necessary approvals so that we can close in the first quarter of next year. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe to go into the financial details."

Today, I will cover our first quarter results, quarterly financial updates and our hedge disclosures. 
Turning first to Slide 9. 
As Chris mentioned, we recorded a loss of $0.06 per share on a non-GAAP basis for the first quarter, driven by the losses from the February weather event. 
Our utilities performed ahead of plan for the quarter, delivering a combined $0.72 per share this year, which was $0.11 per share higher than the first quarter of 2020. We This was primarily driven by strong operational performance as well as the impacts of distribution rate cases. 
ExGen reported a loss of $0.58 per share for the quarter. Excluding the 5-day weather event in February, ExGen would have earned $0.32 per share as we had anticipated. However, specific to the weather event, we incurred a loss in the first quarter of $0.90 per share. A portion of this loss is due to some penalties or charges associated with our natural gas business, that we ultimately expect to be reduced through waivers and/or recovered from customers later in this year. 
As we disclosed in our 8-K last week, we estimate our full year loss from the weather event to be approximately $900 million to $1.1 billion pretax or $670 million to $820 million after tax. We also continue to expect to offset between $550 million and $650 million pretax or $410 million and $490 million after tax for the full year 2021. These offsets will occur primarily at ExGen through a combination of enhanced revenue opportunities, deferral of selected nonessential maintenance and primarily onetime cost savings, and are mostly expected in the second half of this year. 
Holdco recorded a loss of $0.20 per share for the quarter, which was a larger loss than is typical in the first quarter and was driven by a tax adjustment required by GAAP to partially offset the tax benefit recorded at ExGen due to the Texas losses. This amount will reverse over the next 3 quarters, and ultimately will not have an impact on full year results. 
As Chris stated, we are reaffirming our guidance range of $2.60 a share to $3 per share, and you can see the details on Slide 16 in the appendix. 
Moving on to Slide 10. 
Looking at our utility returns on a consolidated basis, our trailing 12-month ROE as of the first quarter has improved to 8.9% from 8.7% last quarter. The 20 basis point increase was primarily due to higher earnings across the operating companies in the first quarter. As a reminder, the calculation is backward-looking. So you should continue to see some pressure on ROEs over the next couple of quarters as we work off the impacts of COVID-19, low interest rates at ComEd and the 2020 storms. We do expect to be in our targeted range of 9% to 10% by year-end. And looking into the future, we remain focused on delivering strong [ earned ] returns at the Utilities in supporting our growth targets. 
Turning to the next Slide 11. Since the last call, there were some important developments on the regulatory front. 
First, on March 30, PECO filed an electric distribution case with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. PECO is seeking a revenue increase of $246 million for continued investments in electric distribution infrastructure, which will make the local energy grid stronger and more resilient, enhance service, and help the company deliver safe, reliable and clean energy for consumers. In addition, the filing proposes customer relief offerings for eligible residential and small business customers, and we expect an order in December of this year. 
Second, ComEd filed its annual distribution formula rate update with the Illinois Commerce Commission on April 16, seeking a $51 million increase to electric distribution base rates. This year's formula rate update file in [ March ] ComEd's first request for a distribution rate increase in 4 years. The filing will support investments to expand access to clean energy through private and community solar and support the growing demand for electric vehicles. Additionally, we continue to make investments and make the power grid more resilient to severe storms, such as those experienced in Northern Illinois last year. We expect to receive an order by early December. 
We also have several rate cases still in progress, including orders in multiyear plans for Pepco DC and Pepco Maryland, which are expected in the second quarter. We continue to have constructive regulatory relationships across our jurisdictions, and are working with our regulators, states and communities to support their clean energy and climate goals. More details on our rate cases can be found on Slides 20 through 28 of the appendix. 
Slide 12 provides one example of how Exelon Utilities are working with our regulators and states to make investments that will address the climate crisis and help our customers. 
Our utilities pay -- play a critical role advancing electric vehicles in our communities. This includes both the installation of publicly available charging stations and investment in the system to support this infrastructure. Exelon Utilities have been leaders in this rapidly growing space by expanding charging infrastructure, offering rebates and incentives and innovative rates, while electrifying public transportation to deliver convenient, affordable and equally accessible clean transportation options. 
Our clean electric transportation programs aim to support nearly 100,000 current electric vehicle drivers across our service territories, aligned with state climate goals, and improve overall air quality for all our customers and communities. To date, electric vehicle programs have been approved in Maryland, D.C., Delaware and New Jersey, with approval pending in Pennsylvania, as part of PECO's recent rate case filing. ComEd also has several ongoing educational and outreach initiatives. And several of the bills Chris spoke about would provide incentives for EV infrastructure. 
The transportation sector currently represents about 1/3 of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Urban areas, like many of our service territories, are disproportionately affected by air pollution and the negative effects of climate change. One way we aim to help address this is by advocating for and helping to usher in cleaner, 0 emission transportation, particularly in underserved communities. Our programs are designed to reduce common barriers to electric vehicle adoption, including range anxiety, total cost of vehicle ownership and lack of education among consumers. Cleaner vehicles on the road help our cities and states meet their environmental goals, reduce their carbon footprint, bring cleaner air to communities, and create economic opportunity through job creation and reduced energy costs. Additionally, Exelon's utilities are leading by example in setting an aggressive goal to electrify our fleet, including both light and heavy-duty vehicles. We have committed to electrify 30% of our fleet by 2025 and 50% by 2030. Electrifying 50% of the fleet could avoid more than 65,000 metric tons of emissions cumulatively from 2020 to 2030. That's the equivalent to the carbon removed by 1 million trees planted and grown for 10 years. 
On Slide 13, we provide a gross margin update. 
For 2021, total gross margin is down $150 million versus the fourth quarter call, due to the increase in the estimated impact of the February weather event. The midpoint of our current estimate of the gross margin impact from this event is $950 million. This number is lower than the midpoint of our loss range of $1 billion because it does not include bad debt, which is captured in O&M. 
Excluding the impacts of the February weather event, gross margin is flat to last quarter. Open Gross Margin is up $300 million relative to our prior disclosure, primarily due to higher prices in NiHub and West Hub. Our mark-to-market of hedges were down $200 million due to our hedge position, offsetting the increase in Open Gross Margin partially offset by the execution of $100 million of power new business. We also executed $50 million in non-power new business during the quarter. 
Thank you. And I will now turn back the call to Chris for his closing remarks."

Turning to Slide 14. I'll close on our priorities and commitments. 
We will deliver or exceed our financial commitments, delivering earnings within our guidance range and to maintain strong balance sheet. We will complete preparations to separate the businesses, including the regulatory approvals. At Exelon Utilities, we will prudently and effectively deploy nearly $6.6 billion of capital to benefit our customers and help meet the needs of our states energy policy goals. We'll work with our regulators to ensure timely recovery on these investments. We'll continue to advocate for clean energy and climate policies with the new administration, Congress and our states to put our country on the path to meeting a carbon reduction goals. And we'll continue to partner with the support of our customers and our communities that we serve. 
So thank you all for joining us. And with that, we'll open it up for questions."

I think there are a number of ideas under discussion in the legislature. And I guess I wouldn't say that it's less likely that the state will ultimately choose to go down the path of setting a reliability standard. That idea does have some support and is being discussed openly, as are other changes, for example, to the ORDC curve to sort of lengthen it and lower the cap. And then there are other ideas out there as well. So I think there's active discussion in both the House and the Senate over whether and when the legislature should act. There are some who think it should move forward and set some expectations and let the PCT work on a market design over the balance of the year, whereas others are thinking maybe they'll wait and do it later in the year. So it's a little bit early to tell how those conversations are going to land. But I think the concept of setting, as all the other markets do, a reliability standard and letting the market operator design a market-based way to get there is still under active discussion."

Most state or legislative bodies, the work comes to an end towards the end of the session. There's a lot of stakeholders involved here. There's a lot of voices that are inputting into. And the legislature has a tough job of building a single bill out of 6 suggested bills and making sure that they take care of their constituents as well as all of the other stakeholders involved in the process. So we're not giving up. We're confident that we've got adequate support within the administration and within the legislature, and we'll see how it goes. That said, we have been clear for a couple of years. And it's just the reality, we cannot continue to run uneconomic plants and challenge the balance sheets of the genco or the holdco. We've got commitments. As I said earlier, we're going to make payroll. We've got to pay pensions. We got to pay our bills. We have to have an investment grade credit rating that we can access capital markets. And when you have plants that are uneconomic and pulling you down, it's a tough decision, but it's one that we've made. And we'll continue to be optimistic that we can work with the stakeholders and the legislative body and the administration. But short of getting something done, we'll have to start to proceed what we are already doing the planning proceed for the shutdown. You can't order fuel. You can't do capital improvement. You can't do a lot of stuff in the face of uncertainty, which causes you to spend hundreds of millions to billions of dollars on plants that just aren't going to support themselves."

But of course, their plan does not currently include a PTC for existing nuclear nor -- for existing nuclear nor has one been introduced in either chamber. So it's obviously helpful that there is a growing focus on the fact that the existing nuclear fleet is integral to getting to any of the carbon targets that has been set. And we welcome that sort of change in focus and a growing understanding. But the challenge remains that we're not yet even to the point where we know, is Congress going to move forward on a bipartisan basis? Does a bill need to be drafted that would be consistent with reconciliation? And the timing and the outcome is just far too uncertain for us to make any decisions here based on that.

First of all, Chicago is a world-class city, and we're privileged to serve it. And we want to continue that relationship. And we've been working with the city for some time on terms for a new franchise agreement. As you know, the franchise agreement",743,"Yes. First of all, Chicago is a world-class city, and we're privileged to serve it. And we want to continue that relationship. And we've been working with the city for some time on terms for a new franchise agreement. As you know, the franchise agreement continues until a new one is approved or until a new franchise -- or franchisee is selected. They are going to explore all their options. And I think they are going to follow a blueprint like San Diego used to solicit ideas. We have an RFI that's been issued. We'll participate in that RFI. We'll see if others do. And we'll see what ideas come out of that process. That's expected to close on May 28. 
In the meantime, we are continuing with the discussions around the new franchise agreement. And we're pretty confident that ComEd is going to be successful at the end. We have a lot to offer. We're leaning in on the city's priorities around energy efficiency, jobs, support for low-income families, clean and renewable energy and more. 
I think the most important thing for the city, and they've been very clear about this, is making the study reliable and resilient against some of the storms. We have talked on these calls about some of the storms we've experienced. We added [ ratio ] in August, where we had 110-mile per hour hurricane in-forced wins across our service territory. 15 tornadoes landed. It was the second most expensive storm in the U.S. this year. And unfortunately, that event has not been an anomaly. We saw unprecedented flooding coming off the lake in the summer. And just maybe 12 months earlier, we saw polar vortex that brought with it negative 30-degree weather. 
So the city, I think, is rightfully concerned about the changing weather from the climate crisis. And notwithstanding these weather events, Chris reviewed earlier some of our performance. We're not only top decile in SFI and Katy, but I think, best-in-class in both categories, first time for this company to achieve that. And we've been able to make the investments, keep residential rates low and so on. So I think we're doing what we need to do. We're investing philanthropically in the city. 
And I think it's important to note. I think we all know this, that serving cities alone is a pretty expensive proposition. The infrastructure is expensive doing any work in the city is expensive just because of the density of a existing infrastructure. You tend to have more of a concentration of low-income customers in the city for a variety of reasons. It's more expensive. 
When the city is part of a broader Chicago system, and the city accounts for about 1/3 of ComEd, we have the ability to use the horsepower and the talent not only within ComEd, but the Exelon family of companies to come in, repair the system when it's damaged as a result of weather. But also, we have the financial wherewithal of the industry and the businesses and the people that live outside of Chicago in the suburbs to cover some of the costs for the cities more economically challenged citizens. 
So we think the whole package is going to be valuable. You mentioned the San Diego process. We've followed that for some time. I don't think there was, at the end of the day, anyone who actually competed for the franchise there. But it is a process. And it's a transparent process that we need to go through, and we appreciate that. And in the meantime, as I said, we're going to lean into it. If the city decides to go into in a different direction, they would have the pay ComEd upwards of $7 billion for the system, depending on the timing of the transaction. And because these systems were built in an interconnected way, we anticipate that there would be about $5 billion or more in separation costs that would take upwards of a decade to complete new substations, control centers computer platforms alike. 
So this is going to be a long road if the city goes in that direction. We understand this move within the fabric of the negotiations that we've been having with the city. And I'm confident that the proposal we're going to offer is going to allow us to continue this long-standing relationship. And we will be very fortunate to be able to continue to serve this great city."

I think the common thread in all of them is that we would come out of the formula rate. And so -- as you know, the formula rate historically for the last 10 years, really throughout the entirety of EMA, has produced an ROE that is significantly lower than the national average. And that's resulted in billions of dollars of savings for our customers over that period of time. 
As we emerge from the formula and we come to a more normalized ROE, there will be an opportunity for expanded earnings at ComEd. At the same time, one of the things we very much liked about the formula is our ability to plan work for years in advance. We don't -- as you well know, we don't do radically different things year-to-year. We kind of continue to invest in poles, wires, smart devices, those sorts of things over the course of years. And the formula had given us some certainty that we were going to be able to continue those investments, and that allowed us to kind of make arrangements with our vendors so that we could maximize efficiencies there, both from a supply standpoint as well as from a labor standpoint. 
So one of the things I worry about coming out of the formula is that planning process. Are we going to continue to see volatility from rate case to rate case? So some of the ideas that have been proposed are aimed at looking at a longer-term transparent investment direction coming out of the company and being reviewed by the commission. For example, the labor proposals would have us produce reports every 4 years, showing all the investments that we're going to make. And it would give stakeholders an opportunity to take a look at that. We wouldn't necessarily get an approval from that. But it would give people a good understanding of what we're trying to do, what we're trying to invest in the system as we integrate renewables and build on the resilience of the system. So that would be, I think, helpful, so that we have some clarity in the process about where we're going next. 
It's clear to me that to continue the level of reliability that we've been able to attain and meet the challenge of these storms, integrate renewables, integrate fleets of electric cars, trucks and buses, we're going to need to continue to invest in the system the way we have been investing in those technologies. The formula gave us a clearer path for doing that. 
And one of the concerns I have about just returning to traditional ratemaking is we don't have that year-over-year clarity. And you could get the volatility and rate outcomes, and that turns into volatility, in terms of your workforce, volatility in terms of your suppliers and the loss of efficiency there. So I think those are the puts and takes, at least as I see the legislation right now. And I think as Chris said, the policymakers have been meeting routinely on that. And I think those are the issues they're worried about as well."

In PJM, it's a very resilient market. We're compensated. And we're penalized if we don't produce. That is not the structure that ERCOT has taken in the past. And so it leaves the generators competing against significant amounts of wind suppressing the prices during the shoulder months, especially.

As you've seen from our earlier releases and notifications, we had mixed results in the first quarter. We performed well across our businesses outside of the challenges from 5 days in February due to the Texas weather event.
Overall, our first quarter GAAP loss was $0.30 per share and our non-GAAP loss was $0.06 per share. Exelon Utilities performed well operationally and financially during the quarter, delivering $0.72 per share, which is $0.11 better than the first quarter last year. At ExGen, we lost $0.58 per share overall, with the February weather event costing $0.90 per share in the first quarter. The event was unprecedented. We continue to investigate the multiple complex factors that led to our plant outages, and we are working with ERCOT regulators and other stakeholders to ensure an event like this does not happen again.
As you saw in our 8-K last week, we updated our full year losses at $150 million due to the updated load meter data in ERCOT default payments that differed from our original estimate. In addition, we reaffirmed our full year guidance of $2.60 to $3 per share. We continue to work on mitigating this approximately $1 billion loss, and expect to offset the loss by $410 million to $490 million after taxes through a combination of mostly onetime cost reductions and deferral of nonessential maintenance and revenue opportunities. Joe is going to go in much more detail on that in his presentation.
Turning to the operations. Despite the extreme cold winters, and the winter storms, the pandemic conditions, our utilities had a strong operational performance, delivering reliability, affordable electricity and gas for our consumers. All the utilities achieved first quartile operating performance in outage duration and frequency, BGE, ComEd and PHI were in top decile in outage duration. Customer operations metrics remained strong across the utilities. PECO and BGE's customer satisfaction levels were top decile. ComEd was top quartile and PHI just missed top quartile, but improved year-over-year.
On the generation front, in the face of extreme temperatures, winter storms, our nuclear plants provided 37 terawatt hours of reliable, resilient and clean to the grid of the citizens of Illinois, Pennsylvania, New York and Maryland. The fleet capacity factor of 95.3% was what we reached for the quarter.
The spring has been active -- switching to policy. The spring has been active on the policy front with momentum building at both federal and state levels for policies that recognize the value of existing nuclear and would put the country on a path to a net 0 future. Both ExGen and the Utilities are well positioned to benefit from these policies and the transition to a clean energy economy.
On the federal level, the Biden administration has set out an ambitious goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50% to 52% by 2030. Nuclear provides more than half of the carbon-free emission electricity in the U.S., with Exelon plants providing 12% of all the carbon-free energy in the United States. The administration is clear that preserving the existing nuclear fleet is key in meeting the goals that they have set.
The administration's infrastructure proposal, the American Jobs Plan, would enact policies to help reach the goal. It includes a clean electricity standard that would require 100% clean electricity by 2035, with existing nuclear qualifying as clean; incentives to build 500,000 EV charging stations by 2030; and for 20 gigawatts of high-voltage transmission lines to be built to support the renewable build-out. We're encouraged that the administration and members of Congress recognize the importance of preserving the nuclear fleet to meet the country's clean energy and climate goals. The timing and the outcome of the federal legislation is highly uncertain. And in any case, it will be too late to reverse the retirement decisions for Byron and Dresden.
Our states are also advancing clean energy policies. In Illinois, 6 energy policy reform bills have been introduced that would drive the transition to clean energy and address climate change. The legislative leaders are meeting to craft a package from the various bills that can be considered this session. We're encouraged by the expression of support that continued -- for the continued operation of the nuclear plants.
However, the details really matter. A bill needs to pass before the end of the regular session, and it needs to provide adequate support for continuing to invest in the Illinois fleet. Current market prices do not continue to meet -- do not allow us to continue to meet our payroll, paying our property taxes and covering other significant costs and risks of operating these assets. Without adequate policy, as I've stated to you that we will retire uneconomic plants beginning this fall.
If you take a look at what happened in New Jersey last week, the Board concluded that the financial challenges faced by nuclear plants there justified a maximum ZEC of $10 per megawatt hour. The same voices that are arguing in Illinois that our plants are profitable were overruled in New Jersey's decision. The commission in New Jersey emphasized that maintaining the existing nuclear plants was critical to achieving the state's emission goals and -- significantly less costly than replacing nuclear with other 0 free carbon generation.
This is true in Illinois. Keeping the nuclear plants running is better option for the customers than trying to replace them with all renewables in storage. At 12x the cost, higher cost than preserving the nuclear plants, it would cost the Illinois consumers over $80 billion more to achieve the same admissions. We've been advocating for policy changes in Illinois for more than 2 years because I feel that we have a duty to our customers to preserve every opportunity to correct flawed policies and keep these critical energy resources running. But we're almost out of time, and we'll prematurely retire these assets in the fall if the policy reforms are not passed in this session.
Turning to clean energy policy in Pennsylvania. The Senate is moving forward on a bill that would set a state goal for transportation, electrification and authorized electric utilities to develop EV infrastructure and plans authorize a recovery for these investments. We support these federal and state policy efforts and stand ready to enable this important transition to a clean energy future. Joe will talk about what our utilities are doing currently on EVs.
Moving on to the separation update. Our team is working to get the separation done. We filed our applications for regulatory approval at FERC, the NRC, New York Public Service Commission in February. The NRC has indicated that our application is complete, and they expect to rule by November 30. In New York, comments are due on May 24, and we requested that the commission rule no later than their December 16 meeting. We're on track to get the necessary approvals so that we can close in the first quarter of next year.
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe to go into the financial details."

Today, I will cover our first quarter results, quarterly financial updates and our hedge disclosures.Turning first to Slide 9. As Chris mentioned, we recorded a loss of $0.06 per share on a non-GAAP basis",1332,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone.  
Today, I will cover our first quarter results, quarterly financial updates and our hedge disclosures.
Turning first to Slide 9. As Chris mentioned, we recorded a loss of $0.06 per share on a non-GAAP basis for the first quarter, driven by the losses from the February weather event.
Our Utilities performed ahead of plan for the quarter, delivering a combined $0.72 per share this year, which was $0.11 per share higher than the first quarter of 2020. This was primarily driven by strong operational performance as well as the impacts of distribution rate cases.
ExGen reported a loss of $0.58 per share for the quarter. Excluding the 5-day weather event in February, ExGen would have earned $0.32 per share as we had anticipated. However, specific to the weather event, we occurred -- we incurred a loss in the first quarter of $0.90 per share. A portion of this loss is due to some penalties or charges associated with our natural gas business, that we ultimately expect to be reduced through waivers and/or recovered from customers later in this year.
As we disclosed in our 8-K last week, we estimate our full year loss from the weather event to be approximately $900 million to $1.1 billion pretax or $670 million to $820 million after tax. We also continue to expect to offset between $550 million and $650 million pretax or $410 million and $490 million after tax for the full year 2021. These offsets will occur primarily at ExGen through a combination of enhanced revenue opportunities, deferral of selected nonessential maintenance and primarily onetime cost savings, and are mostly expected in the second half of this year.
Holdco recorded a loss of $0.20 per share for the quarter, which was a larger loss than is typical in the first quarter and was driven by a tax adjustment required by GAAP to partially offset the tax benefit recorded at ExGen due to the Texas losses. This amount will reverse over the next 3 quarters, and ultimately will not have an impact on full year results.
As Chris stated, we are reaffirming our guidance range of $2.60 a share to $3 per share, and you can see the details on Slide 16 in the appendix.
Moving on to Slide 10. Looking at our utility returns on a consolidated basis, our trailing 12-month ROE as of the first quarter has improved to 8.9% from 8.7% last quarter. The 20 basis point increase was primarily due to higher earnings across the operating companies in the first quarter. As a reminder, the calculation is backward-looking. So you should continue to see some pressure on ROEs over the next couple of quarters as we work off the impacts of COVID-19, low interest rates at ComEd and the 2020 storms. We do expect to be in our targeted range of 9% to 10% by year-end. And looking into the future, we remain focused on delivering strong earned returns at the utilities in supporting our growth targets.
Turning to the next slide, 11. Since the last call, there were some important developments on the regulatory front. First, on March 30, PECO filed an electric distribution case with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. PECO is seeking a revenue increase of $246 million for continued investments in electric distribution infrastructure, which will make the local energy grid stronger and more resilient, enhance service, and help the company deliver safe, reliable and clean energy for consumers. In addition, the filing proposes customer relief offerings for eligible residential and small business customers, and we expect an order in December of this year.
Second, ComEd filed its annual distribution formula rate update with the Illinois Commerce Commission on April 16, seeking a $51 million increase to electric distribution base rates. This year's formula rate update filing March ComEd's first request for a distribution rate increase in 4 years. The filing will support investments to expand access to clean energy through private and community solar and support the growing demand for electric vehicles. Additionally, we continue to make investments and make the power grid more resilient to severe storms, such as those experienced in Northern Illinois last year. We expect to receive an order by early December.
We also have several rate cases still in progress, including orders in multiyear plans for Pepco D.C. and Pepco Maryland, which are expected in the second quarter. We continue to have constructive regulatory relationships across our jurisdictions, and are working with our regulators, states and communities to support their clean energy and climate goals. More details on our rate cases can be found on Slides 20 through 28 of the appendix.
Slide 12 provides one example of how Exelon Utilities are working with our regulators and states to make investments that will address the climate crisis and help our customers. Our Utilities pay -- play a critical role advancing electric vehicles in our communities. This includes both the installation of publicly available charging stations and investment in the system to support this infrastructure. Exelon Utilities have been leaders in this rapidly growing space by expanding charging infrastructure, offering rebates and incentives and innovative rates, while electrifying public transportation to deliver convenient, affordable and equally accessible clean transportation options.
Our clean electric transportation programs aim to support nearly 100,000 current electric vehicle drivers across our service territories, aligned with state climate goals, and improve overall air quality for all our customers and communities. To date, electric vehicle programs have been approved in Maryland, D.C., Delaware and New Jersey, with approval pending in Pennsylvania, as part of PECO's recent rate case filing. ComEd also has several ongoing educational and outreach initiatives, and several of the bills Chris spoke about would provide incentives for EV infrastructure.
The transportation sector currently represents about 1/3 of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Urban areas, like many of our service territories, are disproportionately affected by air pollution and the negative effects of climate change. One way we aim to help address this is by advocating for and helping to usher in cleaner, zero emission transportation, particularly in underserved communities. Our programs are designed to reduce common barriers to electric vehicle adoption, including range anxiety, total cost of vehicle ownership and lack of education and awareness among consumers. Cleaner vehicles on the road help our cities and states meet their environmental goals, reduce their carbon footprint, bring cleaner air to communities, and create economic opportunity through job creation and reduced energy costs.
Additionally, Exelon's Utilities are leading by example in setting an aggressive goal to electrify our fleet, including both light and heavy-duty vehicles. We have committed to electrify 30% of our fleet by 2025 and 50% by 2030. Electrifying 50% of the fleet could avoid more than 65,000 metric tons of emissions cumulatively from 2020 to 2030. That's the equivalent to the carbon removed by 1 million trees planted and grown for 10 years.
On Slide 13, we provide a gross margin update. For 2021, total gross margin is down $150 million versus the fourth quarter call, due to the increase in the estimated impact of the February weather event. The midpoint of our current estimate of the gross margin impact from this event is $950 million. This number is lower than the midpoint of our loss range of $1 billion because it does not include bad debt, which is captured in O&M.
Excluding the impacts of the February weather event, gross margin is flat to last quarter. Open gross margin is up $300 million relative to our prior disclosure, primarily due to higher prices in NiHub and West Hub. Our mark-to-market of hedges were down $200 million due to our hedge position, offsetting the increase in open gross margin partially offset by the execution of $100 million of power new business. We also executed $50 million in non-power new business during the quarter.
Thank you. And I will now turn back the call to Chris for his closing remarks."

We'll work with our regulators to ensure timely recovery on these investments. We'll continue to advocate for clean energy and climate policies with the new administration, Congress and our states to put our country on the path to meeting our carbon reduction goals.

That idea does have some support and is being discussed openly, as are other changes, for example, to the ORDC curve to sort of lengthen it and lower the cap. And then there are other ideas out there as well.
So I think there's active discussion in both the House and the Senate over whether and when the legislature should act. There are some who think it should move forward and set some expectations and let the PUCT work on a market design over the balance of the year, whereas others are thinking maybe they'll wait and do it later in the year. So it's a little bit early to tell how those conversations are going to land. But I think the concept of setting, as all the other markets do, a reliability standard and letting the market operator design a market-based way to get there is still under active discussion."

Most state or legislative bodies, the work comes to an end towards the end of the session. There's a lot of stakeholders involved here. There's a lot of voices that are inputting into it. And the legislature has a tough job of building a single bill out of 6 suggested bills and making sure that they take care of their constituents as well as all of the other stakeholders involved in the process. So we're not giving up. We're confident that we've got adequate support within the administration and within the legislature, and we'll see how it goes.
That said, we have been clear for a couple of years. And it's just the reality, we cannot continue to run uneconomic plants and challenge the balance sheets of the Genco or the Holdco. We've got commitments. As I said earlier, we're going to make payroll. We've got to pay pensions. We've got to pay our bills. We have to have an investment grade credit rating that we can access capital markets. And when you have plants that are uneconomic and pulling you down, it's a tough decision, but it's one that we've made. And we'll continue to be optimistic that we can work with the stakeholders and the legislative body and the administration.
But short of getting something done, we'll have to start to proceed what we are already doing the planning proceed for the shutdown. You can't order fuel. You can't do capital improvement. You can't do a lot of stuff in the face of uncertainty, which causes you to spend hundreds of millions to billions of dollars on plants that just aren't going to support themselves."

And we welcome that sort of change in focus and a growing understanding.
But the challenge remains that we're not yet even to the point where we know, is Congress going to move forward on a bipartisan basis? Does a bill need to be drafted that would be consistent with reconciliation? And the timing and the outcome is just far too uncertain for us to make any decisions here based on that.

And we've been working with the city for some time on terms for a new franchise agreement. As you know, the franchise agreement continues until a new one is approved or until a new franchise -- or franchisee is selected. They are going to explore all their options. And I think they are going to follow a blueprint like San Diego used to solicit ideas.
We have an RFI that's been issued. We'll participate in that RFI. We'll see if others do. And we'll see what ideas come out of that process. That's expected to close on May 28. In the meantime, we are continuing with the discussions around the new franchise agreement. And we're pretty confident that ComEd is going to be successful at the end. We have a lot to offer. We're leaning in on the city's priorities around energy efficiency, jobs, support for low-income families, clean and renewable energy and more.
I think the most important thing for the city, and they've been very clear about this, is making the city reliable and resilient against some of the storms. We have talked on these calls about some of the storms we've experienced. We added [ ratio ] in August, where we had 110-mile per hour hurricane and force winds our service territory. 15 tornadoes landed. It was the second most expensive storm in the U.S. this year. And unfortunately, that event has not been an anomaly. We saw unprecedented flooding coming off the lake in the summer. And just maybe 12 months earlier, we saw polar vortex that brought with it negative 30-degree weather.
So the city, I think, is rightfully concerned about the changing weather from the climate crisis. And notwithstanding these weather events, Chris reviewed earlier some of our performance. We're not only top decile in SAIFI and CAIDI, but I think, best-in-class in both categories, first time for this company to achieve that. And we've been able to make the investments, keep residential rates low and so on. So I think we're doing what we need to do. We're investing philanthropically in the city.
And I think it's important to note. I think we all know this, that serving cities alone is a pretty expensive proposition. The infrastructure is expensive doing any work in the city is expensive just because of the density of existing infrastructure. You tend to have more of a concentration of low-income customers in the city for a variety of reasons. It's more expensive.
When the city is part of a broader Chicago system, and the city accounts for about 1/3 of ComEd, we have the ability to use the horsepower and the talent not only within ComEd, but the Exelon family of companies to come in, repair the system when it's damaged as a result of weather. But also, we have the financial wherewithal of the industry and the businesses and the people that live outside of Chicago in the suburbs to cover some of the costs for the city's more economically challenged citizens.
So we think the whole package is going to be valuable. You mentioned the San Diego process. We've followed that for some time. I don't think there was, at the end of the day, anyone who actually competed for the franchise there. But it is a process. And it's a transparent process that we need to go through, and we appreciate that. And in the meantime, as I said, we're going to lean into it. If the city decides to go into in a different direction, they would have the pay ComEd upwards of $7 billion for the system, depending on the timing of the transaction. And because these systems were built in an interconnected way, we anticipate that there would be about $5 billion or more in separation costs that would take upwards of a decade to complete new substations, control centers, computer platforms alike.
So this is going to be a long road if the city goes in that direction. We understand this move within the fabric of the negotiations that we've been having with the city. And I'm confident that the proposal we're going to offer is going to allow us to continue this long-standing relationship. And we will be very fortunate to be able to continue to serve this great city."

And I'll give you an example. Philadelphia Electric and BGE are upgrading their voltages on their distribution systems from 4,160 to 13,800 in anticipation of more distributed generation, but that will also support EV. So it gives us more capacity on the circuits to allow the customers to get the services they want."

I think the common thread in all of them is that we would come out of the formula rate. And so -- as you know, the formula rate historically for the last 10 years, really throughout the entirety of EMA, has produced an ROE that is significantly lower than the national average. And that's resulted in billions of dollars of savings for our customers over that period of time.
As we emerge from the formula and we come to a more normalized ROE, there will be an opportunity for expanded earnings at ComEd. At the same time, one of the things we very much liked about the formula is our ability to plan work for years in advance. We don't -- as you well know, we don't do radically different things year-to-year. We kind of continue to invest in poles, wires, smart devices, those sorts of things over the course of years. And the formula had given us some certainty that we were going to be able to continue those investments, and that allowed us to kind of make arrangements with our vendors so that we could maximize efficiencies there, both from a supply standpoint as well as from a labor standpoint.
So one of the things I worry about coming out of the formula is that planning process. Are we going to continue to see volatility from rate case to rate case? So some of the ideas that have been proposed are aimed at looking at a longer-term transparent investment direction coming out of the company and being reviewed by the commission.
For example, the labor proposals would have us produce reports every 4 years, showing all the investments that we're going to make. And it would give stakeholders an opportunity to take a look at that. We wouldn't necessarily get an approval from that. But it would give people a good understanding of what we're trying to do, what we're trying to invest in the system as we integrate renewables and build on the resilience of the system. So that would be, I think, helpful, so that we have some clarity in the process about where we're going next.
It's clear to me that to continue the level of reliability that we've been able to attain and meet the challenge of these storms, integrate renewables, integrate fleets of electric cars, trucks and buses, we're going to need to continue to invest in the system the way we have been investing in those technologies. The formula gave us a clearer path for doing that.
And one of the concerns I have about just returning to traditional ratemaking is we don't have that year-over-year clarity. And you could get the volatility and rate outcomes, and that turns into volatility in terms of your workforce, volatility in terms of your suppliers and the loss of efficiency there. So I think those are the puts and takes, at least as I see the legislation right now. And I think as Chris said, the policymakers have been meeting routinely on that. And I think those are the issues they're worried about as well."

In PJM, it's a very resilient market. We're compensated. And we're penalized if we don't produce. That is not the structure that ERCOT has taken in the past. And so it leaves the generators competing against significant amounts of wind suppressing the prices during the shoulder months, especially.

We earned [ $0.41 ] per share on a GAAP basis and $0.89 per share on a non-GAAP basis, and Joe will go through those details when we get to his part of the presentation. 
As you know, we've been working with our regulators and our policymakers across our 6 jurisdictions on regulatory mechanisms that would allow us to prudently invest in critical infrastructure to the benefit of our consumers while earning an appropriate return on that used capital. As part of those efforts, the D.C., Maryland PSCs, approved multiyear plans for Pepco. The New Jersey BPU approved ACE's electric rate settlement, and we received an order in the PECO gas case. It's the first in 10 years. 
PJM held a first capacity auction in 3 years. Results were disappointing, but were slightly better than we had anticipated or expected. Commerce and the administration continue to work on the infrastructure package and there is momentum building to preserve the existing nuclear fleet to meet the country's energy and climate goals. The presence budget includes support for existing nuclear plants and Senator [indiscernible] and representative [ Pascrell ] introduced legislation to provide $15 per megawatt hour production tax credit to existing nuclear power plants. This legislation would help ensure that the existing nuclear fleet, which provides more than 50% of the nation's carbon-free power remains in operations and available to meet the country's energy needs while preserving and achieving climate goals. 
This progress is encouraging if the PTC is included in the legislation that passes later this year, it will make an enormous difference for climate and for our nuclear plants. Unfortunately, though, that will be too late for the buyer in the dress and nuclear facilities, which brings me to Illinois. After many months of very tough negotiations. We were able to reach agreement with the governor and his administration that would provide support to the buyer interest and in Byron facilities, allowing them continued operation and [indiscernible], would also be preserved. Unfortunately, the state leaders and other stakeholders are at an impasse at this point on provisions related to the nuclear regulation -- or excuse me, the nuclear issues in the legislation. 
There's been no progress towards enacting the legislation since the session ended and the retirement dates for the plants are now only weeks away. We don't want to close these plants, but we cannot make decisions based off of hope of legislation being passed in the future. We've been doing that since 2016, while significant losses have been incurred. We must act on the economic facts as they exist today. where no legislation has been passed by the general assembly or signed into law by the governor. Absent legislation, closing the plants is the right economic decision, but not an easy one. The talent, the dedicated employees that work at these plants, our colleagues and our friends that these -- that their jobs support their families and their communities. Premature retirement of these plants is also a loss for the citizens of Illinois. 
The 4 plants at Byron [indiscernible], which are 8 reactors provide 28,000 direct and indirect jobs, $3.5 billion annually to the Illinois economy. $150 million in Illinois taxes that support the schools, public safety and other critical services in the communities that they reside in. 2/3 of Illinois carbon-free electricity is greatly at risk with these shutdowns. Once Byron and Dresden retire, it will take many years under the proposed legislation to add enough renewable energy -- intermittent renewable energy to get back to where Illinois in terms of clean energy production. In the meantime, more than 100 million metric tons of additional carbon will be admitted over the next decade as a result. I remain hopeful that the outstanding differences can be resolved and the bill will be passed very soon that would allow the clients to continue to deliver the carbon-free power to the grid, but time is really running out on that becoming achievable. 
Moving to operations on Slide 6. Reliability and performance remained strong despite the frequent storms and the heat across our service service territories. All utilities achieved first quartile operating performance in outage duration and frequency, as you can see by the charts. ComEd delivered top decile performance in outage duration and frequency while BGE and PHI were top decile for outage duration. Customer operation metrics remain strong across the utilities, BGE, ComEd and PECO achieved top decile performance in the customer satisfaction indices. 
On the generation front, our generation fleet performed well during the quarter. Our nuclear plants provided 36.6 terawatt hours of 0 carbon generation to the grid, avoiding approximately 20 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. The fleet had a capacity factor of 93.7% for the quarter. Our fossil and renewable fleet operated above plan with power dispatch match at 99.5% and wind and solar energy capture at 96%. Our Texas plants are running as expected, helping to meet the summer loads. 
Turning to the separation on Slide 7. We're making progress against our execution plan and remain on track for a first quarter close. The team is working on the organizational and cost structures of each company that will set each business up for long-term success. On the regulatory front, we received comments in each of the dockets for approval and the process is moving forward as expected. We remain on track to get the necessary approvals. We will continue to update you on the work as it progresses. 
Turning to Slide 8. We all are very excited at Exelon to announce that Exelon Utilities have set a goal to reduce their operations driven admission by 50% by 2030 and reaching net 0 by 2050. Since our founding, Exelon has been dedicated to being part of the solution for climate crisis and a leader in providing clean energy to the grid. We were one of the first companies in our industry to commit to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, even though our admissions were already 10x lower than our peers. We have met or exceeded our previous 3 previous goals and Exelon Utilities new goal builds upon our long-standing commitment to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. We'll make these goals through continued modernization of our gas systems, electrifying our light-duty fleet and exploring electricity and other 0 carbon alternatives for medium- and heavy-duty fleet. A focus on energy efficiency and clean electricity for our operations is clearly part of the plan. Investing in equipment and processes to reduce our [indiscernible]  insulating gas from our large breakers from our system, exploring and piloting low-carbon fuels  in new grid technologies and advocating for affordable grid decarbonization. In addition, we remain focused on how we can help our customers and communities decarbonize in an equitable way. The utilities will continue to invest in the EV infrastructure across our service territories and join the electric highway coalition, which will create a seamless network of charging stations on highway systems covering most of the country. 
We will invest in robust energy efficiency programs at each of our utilities. This is a continuing endeavor which will enable customers to have lower emissions profile use less energy and save money. In 2020 alone, these programs avoided 8.1 million metric tons of carbon emissions. Advocates for policy that will put our state -- we will continue to advocating for policies that will put our states and our communities on a path to a clean energy future while ensuring equitable transitions that benefit everyone in our communities. 
Before I turn it over to Joe on Slide 9, I want to highlight the work we are doing to help transform our communities through our workforce development programs, which you can see on -- narrated on the slide. Diversity, equality and inclusion is a core value at Exelon, and we are growing a diverse and inclusive, high-performing workforce. We operate in some of the most diversed cities in the country, and we have a responsibility to help address the inequities in our communities. We have more than 100 workforce development programs, spanning from middle schools, high schools and throughout colleges as well as programs for work-ready underemployed adults. These programs have already reached more than 22,000 participants. 
We recently launched the STEM Leadership Academy scholarships that are open to graduates of the program ensures that the graduates are debt-free and guaranteed internships with Exelon throughout their college half. I recently awarded scholarships to 7 young women and see their faces on how life-changing this was for them and their families. It was quite emotional not only for the young women, but for myself and the rest of the leadership here at Exelon. We are committed to supporting our communities by investing in education, job training programs and giving the underserved populations opportunities to grow and succeed. I'll turn it over to Joe now to take our financial update."

First, turning to Slide 10, we earned $0.89 per share on a non-GAAP basis for the quarter. This favorability was driven by O&M tax timing as well as some realized and unrealized gains we have forecasted for later this year. Exelon Utilities delivered a combined $0.49 per share net of holding company expenses. This was primarily driven by strong operational performance and the impacts of distribution rate cases. 
ExGen earned $0.40 per share in the second quarter, and we've begun to make progress on levers we identified to mitigate the [ taxes laws ], but as we've said before, we expect it will take a full year to realize all the savings. Additionally, unrealized and realized gains from the Constellation Technology Ventures portfolio, and realized gains from our [ Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds ] contributed to the favorable course. At Holdco, we benefited from expected income tax favorability in the second quarter. As a reminder, Holdco incurred $0.12 per share drag in the first quarter associated with how consolidated full year tax expenses are booked due to the impact of losses [indiscernible] during Q1. The remainder of the first quarter has will reverse over the course of the year and not impact our full year results. There's still a lot of work to be done this year, but we are confident we will deliver earnings within our guidance range of $2.60 to $3 per share. 
And you can see the details on Slide 17 and in the appendix. On Slide 11, we show our quarter-over-quarter earnings was $0.89 per share in the second quarter of this year was $0.34 per share higher than the second quarter of 2020. Exelon Utilities less Holdco earnings were up $0.20 per share compared with last year. The increase was driven primarily by the absence of storm costs from last year's record-setting storm season at PECO and new rates associated with our completed rate cases and the impact of higher treasury rate on ComEd's distribution ROE. The partial reversal of first quarter tax expense at corporate also drove favorability relative to last year's results. ExGen's earnings were up $0.14 per share compared with last year. And the increase was due to unrealized and realized gains on our Constellation Technology Venture investments, realized gains in our Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds, fewer planned nuclear outage days and higher [ ZEC ] revenue from increased volumes in [ ZEC ] pricing in New York. As a reminder, the Constellation Technology Venture investment will be mark-to-market every quarter. And since the quarter end, we have seen some decline in prices. 
Moving on to Slide 12. Looking at our utility returns on a consolidated basis, our trailing 12-month ROE as of the second quarter has improved to [indiscernible] and is back within our 9% to 10% targeted range. A 50 basis point increase from last quarter was primarily due to higher second quarter earnings across the utilities and the roll-off of the storms that I mentioned that occurred last year. Looking forward, we remain focused on delivering stronger returns [indiscernible] utilities and supporting our growth targets. 
Now turning to Slide 13. As Chris mentioned briefly in his remarks, there were some important developments on the regulatory front. Notably, we received orders in two multiyear plans at Pepco for [indiscernible]. Multiyear plans provide our customers with great predictability and reduce the administrative costs caused by frequent filing with traditional rate case to recover our costs. We are pleased that we have now received orders in our first 3 multiyear repayments, which will provide timely and predictable recovery for capital investments for the benefit of all our customers. 
And now moving on to the details of the recent rate case developments. First, on June 8. The DC Public Service Commission approved Pepco's multiyear plan for the 18 months spanning the remainder of '21 through 2022 with an allowed ROE of [ 9.75% ], a revenue increase of [ $108.6 million ], along with the acceleration of tax benefits to partially mitigate rate impacts for customers through 2022 is approved. Additionally, the order allows for two-way reconciliation, including the ability to request recovery of costs that exceed the forecasted cost at the end of [indiscernible]. The commission also approved tracking performance and center mechanisms that are focused on the district's climate and clinical energy goals, including GHG, emission reduction, energy savings, peak demand reduction and distributed energy resources deployed. 
Second, on the 28th of June, the Maryland Public Service Commission approved Pepco's 3-year multiyear plan for April 1, 2021 through March 31, 2024. The order approved a cumulative revenue requiring of $52 million over the period as well as a 9.55% ROE. Acceleration of tax benefits to offset customer increases were improved for the first year with years 2 and 3 to be determined later. COVID-19 in electric vehicle regulatory assets were also approved for recovery. Third, on the 22nd of June, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission issued an order approving increase in PECO's annual natural gas distribution revenues of $29 million, reflecting an ROE of 10.24%. And fourth, on July 14, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities unanimously approved ASIS settlement in both the electric distribution rate case as well as our AMI meter and network deployment and cost recovery. The rate case settlement was for $41 million revenue increase and a 9.6% ROE. There will be no rate impact to customers until January 1, 2022, due to improved offsets from acceleration of tax benefits. 
We are excited about the AMI decision that will allow us to bring the benefits of this technology to our customers in South Jersey. We've also had several rate cases still in progress. including [ Del Margo Delaware's ] electric case where we expected [indiscernible] the third quarter, the PECO electric case in the fourth quarter and ComEd's annual formula filing in December. And overall, we're very pleased with the progress in advancing progressive regulatory designs that benefit our customers while easing regulatory burden and improving visibility for our utilities. As a reminder, we expect nearly 100% of our rate base growth will be covered by alternative mechanisms by the end of our planning period, a differentiator for our utilities when compared to our peers. And more details on the rate cases can be found on Slides 21 through 28 of the appendix. 
And before discussing our gross margin update on Slide 14, I want to remind you that we will not be providing any ExGen disclosures beyond 2021 at this time. And given the separation, we expect to provide the 2022 hedge disclosures closer to completion when we're able to give a full financial picture for new spinoff company. 
Turning to the table on gross margin. There is no change to the 2021 gross margin last quarter. In 2021, open gross margin is up $750 million relative to the first quarter primarily due to the impact of higher prices across all regions and the execution of $50 million for new business in. Our mark-to-market hedges were down $600 million due to our highly hedged position, partially offset by the execution of power new business. We executed $150 million of power new business in the quarter and $50 million of non-power I'll stop there. Thank you, and I'll now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks."

And you asked about CMC, I think what you mean is cobrand program that has been discussed potential inclusion in the infrastructure bill. So those are three very different kinds of policy solutions. The first 2 being far more comprehensive and ones that, as you mentioned, in Maryland, Pennsylvania and other states, in the existing nuclear team potentially seeing a significant amount of support.

We made progress on our regulatory and policy objectives as we had stated our desires last quarter. We earned $0.41 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.89 per share on a non-GAAP basis, and Joe will go through those details when we get to his part of the presentation.
As you know, we've been working with our regulators and our policymakers across our 6 jurisdictions on regulatory mechanisms that would allow us to prudently invest in critical infrastructure to the benefit of our consumers while earning an appropriate return on that used capital. As part of those efforts, the D.C., Maryland PSCs, approved multiyear plans for Pepco. The New Jersey BPU approved ACE's electric rate settlement, and we received an order in the PECO gas rate case. It's the first in 10 years.
PJM held a first capacity auction in 3 years. Results were disappointing, but were slightly better than we had anticipated or expected. Commerce and the administration continue to work on the infrastructure package, and there is momentum building to preserve the existing nuclear fleet to meet the country's energy and climate goals.
The president's budget includes support for existing nuclear plants, and Senator Cardin and Representative Pascrell introduced legislation to provide $15 per megawatt hour production tax credit to existing nuclear power plants. This legislation would help ensure that the existing nuclear fleet, which provides more than 50% of the nation's carbon-free power remains in operations and available to meet the country's energy needs while preserving and achieving climate goals.
This progress is encouraging. If the PTC is included in the legislation that passes later this year, it will make an enormous difference for climate and for our nuclear plants. Unfortunately, though, that will be too late for the buyer interest in nuclear facilities, which brings me to Illinois. After many months of very tough negotiations, we were able to reach agreement with the governor and his administration that would provide support to the buyer interest in Braidwood facilities, allowing them continued operation and LaSalle would also be preserved.
Unfortunately, the state leaders and other stakeholders are at an impasse at this point on provisions related to the nuclear regulation -- or excuse me, the nuclear issues in the legislation. There's been no progress towards enacting the legislation since the session ended and the retirement dates for the plants are now only weeks away. We don't want to close these plants, but we cannot make decisions based off of hope of legislation being passed in the future. We've been doing that since 2016, while significant losses have been incurred.
We must act on the economic facts as they exist today, where no legislation has been passed by the general assembly or signed into law by the governor. Absent legislation, closing the plants is the right economic decision, but not an easy one. The talent, the dedicated employees that work at these plants, our colleagues and our friends that these -- their jobs support their families and their communities. Premature retirement of these plants is also a loss for the citizens of Illinois.
The 4 plants at Byron, Dresden, Braidwood and LaSalle, which are 8 reactors, provide 28,000 direct and indirect jobs, $3.5 billion annually to the Illinois economy. $150 million in Illinois taxes that support the schools, public safety and other critical services in the communities that they reside in. 2/3 of Illinois carbon-free electricity is greatly at risk with these shutdowns. Once Byron and Dresden retire, it will take many years under the proposed legislation to add enough renewable energy -- intermittent renewable energy to get back to where Illinois is in terms of clean energy production. In the meantime, more than 100 million metric tons of additional carbon will be admitted over the next decade as a result.
I remain hopeful that the outstanding differences can be resolved and the bill will be passed very soon that would allow the clients to continue to deliver the carbon-free power to the grid, but time is really running out on that becoming achievable.
Moving to operations on Slide 6. Reliability performance remained strong despite the frequent storms and the heat across our service territories. All utilities achieved first quartile operating performance in outage duration and frequency, as you can see by the charts. ComEd delivered top decile performance in outage duration and frequency while BGE and PHI were top decile for outage duration. Customer operation metrics remain strong across the utilities. BGE, ComEd and PECO achieved top decile performance in the customer satisfaction indices.
On the Generation front, our generation fleet performed well during the quarter. Our nuclear plants provided 36.6 terawatt hours of 0 carbon generation to the grid, avoiding approximately 20 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. The fleet had a capacity factor of 93.7% for the quarter. Our fossil and renewable fleet operated above plan with power dispatch match at 99.5% and wind and solar energy capture at 96%. Our Texas plants are running as expected, helping to meet the summer loads.
Turning to the separation on Slide 7. We're making progress against our execution plan and remain on track for a first quarter close. The team is working on the organizational and cost structures of each company that will set each business up for long-term success. On the regulatory front, we received comments in each of the dockets for approval and the process is moving forward as expected. We remain on track to get the necessary approvals. We will continue to update you on the work as it progresses.
Turning to Slide 8. We all are very excited at Exelon to announce that Exelon Utilities have set a goal to reduce their operations-driven emission by 50% by 2030 and reaching net zero by 2050. Since our founding, Exelon has been dedicated to being part of the solution for climate crisis and a leader in providing clean energy to the grid.
We were one of the first companies in our industry to commit to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, even though our emissions were already 10x lower than our peers. We have met or exceeded our previous -- 3 previous goals, and Exelon Utilities' new goal builds upon our long-standing commitment to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.
We'll meet these goals through continued modernization of our gas systems, electrifying our light-duty fleet and exploring electricity and other zero carbon alternatives for medium- and heavy-duty fleet. A focus on energy efficiency and clean electricity for our operations is clearly part of the plan. Investing in equipment and processes to reduce our SF6 insulating gas from our large breakers from our system, exploring and piloting low-carbon fuels in new grid technologies and advocating for affordable grid decarbonization.
In addition, we remain focused on how we can help our customers and communities decarbonize in an equitable way. The utilities will continue to invest in the EV infrastructure across our service territories and join the Electric Highway Coalition, which will create a seamless network of charging stations on highway systems covering most of the country.
We will invest in robust energy efficiency programs at each of our utilities. This is a continuing endeavor which will enable customers to have lower emissions profile, use less energy and save money. In 2020 alone, these programs avoided 8.1 million metric tons of carbon emissions. Advocates for policy that will put our state -- we will continue to advocating for policies that will put our states and our communities on a path to a clean energy future while ensuring equitable transitions that benefit everyone in our communities.
Before I turn it over to Joe on Slide 9, I want to highlight the work we are doing to help transform our communities through our workforce development programs, which you can see on -- narrated on the slide. Diversity, equality and inclusion is a core value at Exelon, and we are growing a diverse and inclusive, high-performing workforce. We operate in some of the most diversed cities in the country, and we have a responsibility to help address the inequities in our communities. We have more than 100 workforce development programs, spanning from middle schools, high schools and throughout colleges as well as programs for work-ready underemployed adults. These programs have already reached more than 22,000 participants.
We recently launched the STEM Leadership Academy scholarships that are open to graduates of the program, ensures that the graduates are debt-free and guaranteed internships with Exelon throughout their college half. I recently awarded scholarships to 7 young women and see their faces on how life-changing this was for them and their families. It was quite emotional not only for the young women, but for myself and the rest of the leadership here at Exelon. We are committed to supporting our communities by investing in education, job training programs and giving the underserved populations opportunities to grow and succeed.
I'll turn it over to Joe now to take our financial update."

This favor",1251,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our second quarter results, our quarterly financial updates and our hedge disclosures.
First, turning to Slide 10. We earned $0.89 per share on a non-GAAP basis for the quarter. This favorability was driven by O&M and tax timing as well as some realized and unrealized gains we have forecasted for later this year. Exelon Utilities delivered a combined $0.49 per share net of holding company expenses. This was primarily driven by strong operational performance and the impacts of distribution rate cases.
ExGen earned $0.40 per share in the second quarter, and we've begun to make progress on levers we identified to mitigate the Texas laws, but as we've said before, we expect it will take a full year to realize all the savings. Additionally, unrealized and realized gains from the Constellation Technology Ventures portfolio, and realized gains from our nuclear decommissioning trust funds contributed to the favorable course.
At Holdco, we benefited from expected income tax favorability in the second quarter. As a reminder, Holdco incurred $0.12 per share drag in the first quarter associated with how consolidated full year tax expenses are booked due to the impact of losses incurred at ExGen in Texas during Q1. The remainder of the first quarter hit will reverse over the course of the year and not impact our full year results.
There's still a lot of work to be done this year, but we are confident we will deliver earnings within our guidance range of $2.60 to $3 per share, and you can see the details on Slide 17 in the appendix.
On Slide 11, we show our quarter-over-quarter earnings walk. The $0.89 per share in the second quarter of this year was $0.34 per share higher than the second quarter of 2020. Exelon Utilities less Holdco earnings were up $0.20 per share compared with last year. The increase was driven primarily by the absence of storm's costs from last year's record-setting storm season at PECO and new rates associated with our completed rate cases and the impact of higher treasury rate on ComEd's distribution ROE. The partial reversal of first quarter tax expense at corporate also drove favorability relative to last year's results.
ExGen's earnings were up $0.14 per share compared with last year. And the increase was due to unrealized and realized gains on our Constellation Technology Venture investments, realized gains in our nuclear decommissioning trust funds, fewer planned nuclear outage days and higher ZEC revenue from increased volumes in ZEC pricing in New York. As a reminder, the Constellation Technology Venture investment will be mark-to-market every quarter. And since the quarter end, we have seen some decline in prices.
Moving on to Slide 12. Looking at our utility returns on a consolidated basis, our trailing 12-month ROE as of the second quarter has improved to 9.4% and is back within our 9% to 10% targeted range. A 50 basis point increase from last quarter was primarily due to higher second quarter earnings across the utilities and the roll-off of the storms that I mentioned that occurred last year. Looking forward, we remain focused on delivering stronger returns in the utilities and supporting our growth targets.
Now turning to Slide 13. As Chris mentioned briefly in his remarks, there were some important developments on the regulatory front. Notably, we received orders in 2 multiyear plans at Pepco for D.C. and Maryland. Multiyear plans provide our customers with great predictability and reduce the administrative costs caused by frequent filing with traditional rate case to recover our costs. We are pleased that we have now received orders in our first 3 multiyear rate plans, which will provide timely and predictable recovery for capital investments for the benefit of all our customers.
And now moving on to the details of the recent rate case developments. First, on June 8. The DC Public Service Commission approved Pepco's multiyear plan for the 18 months, spanning the remainder of '21 through 2022 with an allowed ROE of 9.275%, a revenue increase of $108.6 million along with the acceleration of tax benefits to partially mitigate rate impacts for customers through 2022 is approved. Additionally, the order allows for two-way reconciliation, including the ability to request recovery of costs that exceed the forecasted cost at the end of deployment. The commission also approved tracking performance incentive mechanisms that are focused on the district's climate and clean energy goals, including GHG emission reduction, energy savings, peak demand reduction and distributed energy resources deployed.
Second, on the 28th of June, the Maryland Public Service Commission approved Pepco's 3-year multiyear plan for April 1, 2021 through March 31, 2024. The order approved a cumulative revenue requirement of $52 million over the period as well as a 9.55% ROE. Acceleration of tax benefits to offset customer increases were improved for the first year with years 2 and 3 to be determined later. COVID-19 in electric vehicle regulatory assets were also approved for recovery.
Third, on the 22nd of June, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission issued an order approving increase in PECO's annual natural gas distribution revenues of $29 million, reflecting an ROE of 10.24%.
And fourth, on July 14, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities unanimously approved ACE's settlement in both the electric distribution rate case as well as our AMI meter and network deployment and cost recovery. The rate case settlement was for $41 million revenue increase and a 9.6% ROE. There will be no rate impact to customers until January 1, 2022, due to improved offsets from acceleration of tax benefits. We are excited about the AMI decision that will allow us to bring the benefits of this technology to our customers in South Jersey.
We've also had several rate cases still in progress, including Delmarva, Delaware's electric case where we expected [ provision ] in the third quarter, the PECO electric case in the fourth quarter and ComEd's annual formula rate filing in December. And overall, we're very pleased with the progress in advancing progressive regulatory designs that benefit our customers while easing regulatory burden and improving visibility for our utilities. As a reminder, we expect nearly 100% of our rate base growth will be covered by alternative mechanisms by the end of our planning period, a differentiator for our utilities when compared to our peers. And more details on the rate cases can be found on Slides 21 through 28 of the appendix.
And before discussing our gross margin update on Slide 14, I want to remind you that we will not be providing any ExGen disclosures beyond 2021 at this time. And given the separation, we expect to provide the 2022 hedge disclosures closer to completion when we're able to give a full financial picture for new spun-off company.
Turning to the table on gross margin. There is no change to the 2021 gross margin since last quarter. In 2021, open gross margin is up $750 million relative to the first quarter primarily due to the impact of higher prices across all regions and the execution of $50 million power new business in [ 2021 ]. Our mark-to-market hedges were down $600 million due to our highly hedged position, partially offset by the execution of power new business. We executed $150 million of power new business in the quarter and $50 million of non-power business in the quarter.
I'll stop there. Thank you, and I'll now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks."

There are discussions of a clean energy standard potentially being developed for the reconciliation bill.
And you asked about [ CMC ]. I think what you mean is the DOE grant program that has been discussed for a potential inclusion in the infrastructure bill. So those are 3 very different kinds of policy solutions. The first 2 being far more comprehensive and one's that, as you mentioned, in Maryland, Pennsylvania and other states, in the existing nuclear fleet potentially seeing a significant amount of support, and as Chris said, providing a real benefit to the climate. The grant program is a little bit more challenging and more limited given the limited amount of funding that will be available under that program at least as it's currently drafted.
The real point though, is that all of these programs are just tatter or just sort of proposed programs. Nothing has yet been enacted as you know. And so while we're watching it very closely and again, very grateful for the growing amount of support for preserving their fleet through federal legislation, the reality is that, as Chris said, we need to make decisions based on laws that have actually been enacted and nothing has yet come to fruition in D.C. as of yet."

And so it's a tough situation.
But I can say that's not a fight that we're involved in. And we are very dependent on the support for our power plants to be maintained by our union partners, building trades in the IBEW. They're very aware of the dire situation for the nuclear plants. So I don't think that their dedication to saving the jobs at these plants are in question. They have some other priorities and other constituents within their organizations that are dealing with issues. So I would just leave it at that."

And so you get to a point that you're running -- within months or so period, you're running inefficient steam paths and inefficient operations. So you make the call as coast down to start and to shut the facility down.
The one thing to reiterate in shutting down a nuclear plant, it is -- the goal is you shut down, you cool down. You disassemble the reactor. You offload all of the fuel into the spent fuel pool and you relinquish the license to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and there is no path back from that. There's no regulatory path back.
And so what we do is start into the phases of the chosen decommissioning using the decommissioning trust fund and it comes out of our expense column. It's in the prefunded category of the decommissioning trust. So it's irreversible. And running a year is physically impossible.

We had a good quarter financially and operationally and had several very positive developments during the quarter. 
I'm starting on Slide 5. We earned $1.23 per share on a GAAP basis and $1.09 on a non-GAAP basis, and Joe will get into those details. Illinois passed, at the last minute, a landmark clean energy legislation, which makes the state a national leader in clean energy. Illinois will achieve 100% carbon-free by 2045 by preserving and adding -- preserving the plants and adding tens of thousands of jobs. And we thank Kathleen Barrón and her team and many others for the work they've done. As a result, we have reversed the retirement decision on Byron and Dresden. Our Illinois plants will continue to provide good paying jobs, economic support to the communities and zero carbon energy to the citizens of Illinois. 
We've begun to fill the 650 vacant positions, and we'll be investing more than $300 million in our plants over the next 5 years to catch up on what we pulled back from during the unknown period. The legislation also includes the provision that would transition the [indiscernible] out of the formula rates into a new multi-year performance-based rate framework. 
In August, we completed the put transaction and acquired EDF's portion of the CNG nuclear plants, adding 17 terawatts to our own zero admitting nuclear generation. We did receive a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy to explore the potential benefits of on-site hydrogen production at our Nine Mile point in New York. And we continue to believe that there's a very strong future for hydrogen. 
Hydrogen will be key in helping the nation address the climate crisis, and the nuclear plants can play a vital role in its production with its heat and capabilities. We're partnering with Nel Hydrogen and the national labs to demonstrate the integrated production storage and use of hydrogen on site to prove its commercial viability. Operations are expected to begin in 2022. 
On the regulatory front, Delaware PSC issued a constructive order in our Delmarva rate case. Last quarter, we announced our path to clean and our net zero goal for the utilities, so we continue to strive to meet what our customers desire and our regulators desire. Each utility is building upon existing work and supporting a path to clean that aligns to the goals that are needed for their local jurisdictions and stakeholders. 
An example is PECO's climate solution. It's a 5-year action plan that will fill Pepco's -- I said PECO, Pepco's that will fill with the DC PSC's request last month. This filing outlines 62 different programs to help enable the district's road map toward decarbonization. Another example of helping our communities to meet their goals is through our energy efficiency programs, which are some of the nation's largest. Jim will talk about them in his remarks. 
We're committed to serving our communities and helping to drive equity and positive change. Last week, we launched a $36 million Racial Equity Capital Fund to expand access to capital for minority-owned businesses so they can create jobs and grow their businesses and reinvest in the neighborhoods and the communities that we serve. It's the first-of-a-kind in our sector. 
In addition, we partnered with the UNCF to launch a $3 million Exelon Fund for Corporate Scholarship Program to provide scholarships and internships that create opportunities for students attending historically black colleges and universities that reside in the communities that we serve. Finally, we are closely watching the work in Washington on the Infrastructure Build Back Better agenda. The legislation will help us address climate change crisis through incentivizing clean technologies and infrastructure investments to make the grid more resilient and ready for clean energy technologies. 
It is clear from the proposal that the administration and Congress recognize the critical importance of maintaining the existing nuclear fleet to ensure that the nation can cost-effectively address climate change, and we're confident that when the legislation pass -- does pass, it will include a production tax credit for the existing nuclear. 
Moving on to Slide 6 to our operations. Reliability remains incredibly strong. All the utilities are delivering a top decile outage frequencies and first quartile in outage durations. BGE, PECO and PHI were top decile for gas odor responses, which is very critical for us as we continue to fend gas as a source -- a bridge source to the future. Customer services is top-notch with BGE PECO achieving top decile and PHI top quartile. 
On the generation front, our generation fleet performed well during the quarter even in the face of uncertainty in Illinois. Our nuclear plants produced 40.5 terawatts of zero carbon generation, avoiding approximately 21 million tons of carbon dioxide that would be generated otherwise. The fleet had a 96% capacity factor over that period of time, and we're very proud of their operations with the uncertainty they faced. 
On Slide 7, the progress on separation. We continue to make progress on separating the businesses into 2 independent Fortune 200 companies. FERC approved the separation in August, and in September, we received a private letter ruling from the IRS confirming the tax-free nature of the separation. The process for the NRC and New York PSC approvals are moving forward as expected and remain on track. Last week, the New York PSC staff held the first meeting of settlement negotiations. This is an important step in the process, and we've asked for authorization from the commission by December 16 on their scheduled meeting date. 
We have named the CEO of each company as well as their direct reports, and we'll continue the staffing process over the course of the next few weeks and months to be ready for the close in the first quarter of next year. Joe Dominguez and I are both excited to lead our companies into the next chapter. Exelon will continue to be one of the nation's premier customer-focused energy delivery companies with more than 10 million customers. Joe is the right person to lead Constellation, will be America's leading clean energy company producing 12% of the nation's clean energy and nearly 2x more than any other clean energy company out there. We remain focused on setting each business up to be successful for the long term. Joe, I'll turn over to you for the financial update."

Today, I'll cover our third quarter results, our quarterly financial updates and our hedge disclosures. I will also provide an update on our full year 2021 guidance. Turning to Slide 8 first, we earned $1.09",1400,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover our third quarter results, our quarterly financial updates and our hedge disclosures. I will also provide an update on our full year 2021 guidance. 
Turning to Slide 8 first, we earned $1.09 per share on a non-GAAP basis for the quarter. Exelon Utilities delivered a combined $0.66 per share, net of holding company expenses, and this was primarily driven by above-normal summer weather in our non-decoupled jurisdictions, along with strong operational performance and the impacts of distribution rate cases. ExGen earned $0.44 per share in the third quarter. Generation and Constellation both performed well during the quarter. 
We continue to make progress on levers we identified to mitigate the Texas loss, and we expect it will take the full year to realize all of the savings. Realized gains in our decommissioning trust funds partially offset the unrealized losses from our Constellation technology venture investments, which are mark-to-market every quarter until realized. 
At our holding company, we benefited from expected income tax favorability in the third quarter. And as a reminder, our holding company incurred $0.12 per share drag in the first quarter associated with how consolidated full year tax expenses are booked due to the impact of the losses incurred at ExGen in Texas. The remainder of the first quarter drag is expected to reverse in the fourth quarter and is not expected to impact our full year results. 
Turning to guidance. We are narrowing our 2021 EPS guidance range to $2.70 to $2.90 per share from $2.60 to $3 per share previously. Our updated guidance considers reversal of the retirement of the Byron and Dresden nuclear stations as well as execution of the EDF put and our continued additional -- a disciplined approach to cost management. We are delivering on our financial commitments and are confident we will be within our revised range at year-end. 
On Slide 9, we show our quarter-over-quarter earnings walk. The $1.09 per share in the third quarter of this year was $0.05 per share higher than the third quarter of 2020. Exelon Utilities, inclusive of holding company earnings, were $0.08 per share higher compared to last year. The earnings growth was driven primarily by higher transmission and distribution rates associated with completed rate cases relative to the third quarter of 2020 and higher treasury rates on ComEd's distribution ROE. This was partially offset by costs related to the remnants of Hurricane Ida that swept through the PECO service territory in early September. The partial reversal of the first quarter tax expense at corporate also drove favorability relative to last year's results. 
ExGen's earnings were down $0.03 per share compared with last year, and the decrease was due to net unrealized and realized losses on Constellation venture investments, lower capacity revenues primarily in PJM and more planned nuclear outage days. This was partially offset by realized gains in our nuclear decommissioning trust funds and higher ZEC revenue due in part to increased volumes resulting from fewer planned refuel outages and ZEC pricing in New York. 
Moving to Slide 10. Looking at our utility returns on a consolidated basis, we continue to meet our consolidated 9% to 10% target with a 9.3% trailing 12-month ROE as of the third quarter. Earned ROEs dipped modestly by 10 basis points since last quarter. Despite higher earnings driven primarily by distribution and transmission rates, the earnings were outpaced by increased equity infusions across all 4 utilities to support capital investments. Looking forward, we remain focused on delivering stronger returns at the utilities and supporting our growth targets to enable customer benefits. 
Turning to Slide 11, there were some important developments on the regulatory front since the last call. First, on September 1, Delmarva Maryland filed an electric base rate case with the Maryland Public Service Commission seeking an approximately $29 million increase in electric distribution rates and reflecting an ROE of 10.1%. The case highlights Delmarva Power's strong record of reliability, reporting the second best reliability performance in Maryland in 2019 and '20 behind only Pepco. Delmarva Power continues to make significant investments to improve reliability and customer service for our customers and communities. DPL Maryland expects to receive an order by March 30, 2022. 
Second, on September 15, Delmarva Delaware received a verbal order for its distribution electric rate case. The Delaware Commission approved approximately $14 million increase in annual base distribution rates, reflecting an ROE of 9.6%. As permitted by Delaware law, Delmarva Power implemented full allowable rates on October 6, 2020, subject to refund. 
We also have 2 rate cases pending final orders in the fourth quarter. On October 6, the administrative law judge presiding over PECO's electric distribution base rate case recommended the settlement with all parties be approved. The settlement provides for an increase of $132 million in annual electric distribution revenues, and we expect to receive an order in the fourth quarter. And then on November 2, the ALJ presiding over ComEd's 2021 distribution formula rate update issued a proposed order. There were no adjustments to ComEd's proposed revenue requirement increase of $45.8 million. We expect to receive a final order from the Illinois Commerce Commission by early December. 
We continue to have constructive regulatory relationships across our jurisdictions and are working with our regulators, states and communities to support their clean energy and climate goals. As a reminder, we expect nearly 100% of our rate base growth will be covered by alternative mechanisms by the end of our planning period, a differentiator for our utilities when compared to peers. More details on the rate cases can be found on Slides 20 through 24 of the appendix. 
And as Chris mentioned, our energy efficiency programs highlighted on Slide 12 is 1 example of how Exelon's utilities are helping their customers on the path to clean. Exelon Utilities are driving customer-driven emissions reductions in our communities through some of the nation's largest energy efficiency programs and conservation efforts. These programs enable customer savings through home energy audits, lighting discounts, appliance recycling, home improvement rebates, equipment upgrade incentives and innovative programs like smart thermostats and combined heat and power programs. 
In 2020, through a combination of new and prior year investments, our utilities helped customers save over 22.3 million megawatt hours of energy. This equates to 8.1 million metric tons of CO2 emissions avoided, the equivalent of nearly 932,000 homes energy use for 1 year or the carbon sequestered by 10.5 million acres of U.S. forests in 1 year according to EPA's greenhouse gas calculator. Each of Exelon's utilities is building upon existing work and supporting a path to clean that aligns to the goals and needs of their local jurisdictions and stakeholders. Our approach allows jurisdictional flexibility such that each utility may respond to their unique regions and markets and employ the strategies and solutions that best address their operational footprints and customer preferences. 
Before discussing our gross margin update on Slide 13, I want to remind you that we expect to provide 2022 hedge disclosures at Analyst Day, which will be held closer to the completion of the separation. However, what I can say now is that we have continued to hedge on our ratable plan for future years, and this includes the length from the Byron and Dresden retirement reversals until the carbon mitigation contracts begin and Exelon's full ownership of the CENG assets. 
Turning to the table. Total gross margin increased $500 million since last quarter due to the plant retirement reversals in Illinois and full ownership of the CENG assets beginning on August 7. In 2021, open gross margin is up $1.6 billion relative to the second quarter, primarily due to higher prices in all regions and higher volumes driven by execution of the EDF put and the decision to reverse Byron and Dresden's early retirements. Capacity in ZEC dollars are up $100 million due to full ownership of the CENG assets. 
Mark-to-market of hedges were down $1 billion due to our hedged position, partially offset by the execution of power new business. We executed $200 million of power new business and $50 million of non-power new business during the third quarter. The non-gross margin impacts of the Illinois plant reversals and the full ownership of CENG are incorporated on Page 32 of the appendix. Thank you, and I'll now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks."

We'll complete the preparations to separate the businesses, including the organization, the cost structure for each company that will set each company up for long-term success at a strong investment grade. At Exelon Utilities, we are prudently and efficiently deploying $6.6 billion of capital to benefit our customers and help meet the needs of our jurisdiction's energy policy goals. We are working with our regulators to ensure timely recovery of these investments, as Joe discussed in his talking points. 
We continue to advocate for clean energy and climate policies with the new administration and Congress in our states to put the country on a path to meeting the carbon and air pollution reduction goals. There's more here than just carbon. We have a city in Chicago that is the third highest with lung disease. And it's not only carbon, it's the fumes from the industrial sources, and we need to do our part to help lower that. And we're partnering and supporting our customers and the communities that we serve. So with that, I thank you for your time today, and I'll open up the call to questions."

The transmission program, that's always been a challenging issue, as you know, given that it's not just about funding but it's also about citing. And so we do expect that to continue to be a challenging area but obviously essential to the clean energy buildout. So I'll stop there and let Cal jump in or Joe, as I said, on tax."

Port electrification, when you think about port electrification for our city of Baltimore and Philadelphia, what that would mean for them, and not even talking about the different grants that they are proposing where utilities could partner to do different things and creative. 
And all of this is good for the customers. If that -- those monies are coming directly to the state and there's a partnership, we will continue to invest on reliability and resiliency and then take these moments. It keeps the customer bill down and that is a concern of ours, just to keep affordability at the forefront of everything we do. So that's, that partnership and how we see it playing out."

Yes, I think we're still feeling very confident about the Democrats' ability to get both infrastructure and Build Back Better across the finish line. There's, as you know, a strong proposal put out by the President that had support last week around a top line number that the group has apparently coalesced around. They have continued to work to flesh out the meat on the bone so that they can move this package quickly. And Senator Manchin has shared that he thinks that's doable, indeed even citing agreement with the Senate majority leader that it's possible this could get done by Thanksgiving. 
So I think there's broad consensus that action is needed, and in particular, on the clean energy tax package that there is sufficient support for the provisions that will get the country to a place where it can come close to meeting the 2030 carbon reduction goals. If for some reason, that does not occur, as you know, there's regularly action at the end of the year on a bipartisan basis to look at tax extenders. And we're, again, hopeful, given the amount of support that we've seen for support for the existing fleet that the nuclear provision could be considered as part of an end of the year bipartisan package if the Democrat BBB bill doesn't get across the finish line."

But the short answer is that under the nuclear PTC, as drafted, revenues from a state program are not included at the state program would adjust to reflect the existence of the federal support. And almost all of our programs have some explicit reference to the fact that if there is subsequent federal support after the state program takes effect, that it will be reflected in the state calculation of the support under the program. 
So there clearly will need to be further proceedings to evaluate and have the state adjudicate how that federal support will be reflected. But assuming that the PTC passes, we would expect each of the states to take a look at that and for it to be reflected in the level of the state support. Jim?"

We're not deviating a large deal from what we've historically talked about. I think the change for 2022 has to be in relation to what we saw develop over the course of this quarter with the legislation, right? We had assets that we had previously said we're going to retire, and then the legislation passed, and we unretired. 
And what that effectively meant for 2022 is that before the contract goes into effect, it created a position that added extra generation linked to our portfolio that we've been able to, since then, hedge. But beyond -- then beyond May or June when the contract starts, effectively, those megawatts are hedged through the CMC contract. So the 2022 is just a little bit in a different beginning of the year, end of year story because effectively, the contracts are providing the hedge in the long run. We hedged the length that got added back to the book, largely speaking, in the beginning of the year during this price action that we saw this quarter so that's been a generally good development. And then in the outer years, we would still -- other than the contracted assets, we would still be following along our ratable hedge program. So there's the further out in time you go, the more open position here is as we've always had historically."

And Emily, thank you for putting a hedge on everything we're about to say. We had a good quarter financially and operationally and had several very positive developments during the quarter.

We had a good quarter financially and operationally and had several very positive developments during the quarter. I'm starting on Slide 5. We earned $1.23 per share on a GAAP basis and $1.09 on a non-GAAP basis, and Joe will get into those details. Illinois passed, at the last minute, a landmark clean energy legislation which makes the state a national leader in clean energy. Illinois will achieve 100% carbon-free by 2045 by preserving and adding -- preserving the plants and adding tens of thousands of jobs. And we thank Kathleen Barrón and her team and many others for the work they've done. 
As a result, we have reversed the retirement decision on Byron and Dresden. Our Illinois plants will continue to provide good-paying jobs, economic support to the communities and zero-carbon energy to the citizens of Illinois. We've begun to fill the 650 vacant positions, and we'll be investing more than $300 million in our plants over the next 5 years to catch up on what we pulled back from during the unknown period. The legislation also includes the provision that would transition to -- these out of the formula rates into a new multiyear, performance-based rate framework. 
In August, we completed the put transaction and acquired the EDF's portion of the CENG nuclear plants, adding 17 terawatts to our own zero-emitting nuclear generation. 
We did receive a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy to explore the potential benefits of on-site hydrogen production at our Nine Mile Point in New York, and we continue to believe that there's a very strong future for hydrogen. Hydrogen will be key in helping the nation address the climate crisis, and the nuclear plants can play a vital role in its production with its heat and capabilities. We're partnering with Nel Hydrogen and the national labs to demonstrate the integrated production storage and use of hydrogen on site to prove its commercial viability. Operations are expected to begin in 2022.
On the regulatory front, Delaware PSC issued a constructive order in our Delmarva rate case. Last quarter, we announced our Path to Clean and our net-zero goal for the utilities, so we continue to strive to meet what our customers desire and our regulators desire. Each utility is building upon existing work and supporting a Path to Clean that aligns to the goals that are needed for their local jurisdictions and stakeholders. 
An example is PECO's climate solution. It's a 5-year action plan that will fill Pepco's -- I said PECO, Pepco's that will fill with the DC PSC's request last month. This filing outlines 62 different programs to help enable the district's road map toward decarbonization. Another example of helping our communities to meet their goals is through our energy efficiency programs, which are some of the nation's largest. Joe will talk about them in his remarks. 
We're committed to serving our communities and helping to drive equity and positive change. Last week, we launched a $36 million Racial Equity Capital Fund to expand access to capital for minority-owned businesses, so they can create jobs and grow their businesses and reinvest in the neighborhoods and the communities that we serve. It's the first-of-a-kind in our sector.
In addition, we partnered with the UNCF to launch a $3 million Exelon fund for Corporate Scholarship Program to provide scholarships and internships that create opportunities for students attending historically Black colleges and universities that reside in the communities that we serve. 
Finally, we are closely watching the work in Washington on the infrastructure Build Back Better Agenda. The legislation will help us address climate change crisis through incentivizing clean technologies and infrastructure investments to make the grid more resilient and ready for clean energy technologies. It is clear from the proposal that the administration and Congress recognize the critical importance of maintaining the existing nuclear fleet to ensure that the nation can cost effectively address climate change, and we're confident that when the legislation pass -- does pass, it will include a production tax credit for the existing nuclear.
Moving on to Slide 6, to our operations. Reliability remains incredibly strong. All the utilities are delivering a top decile outage frequencies and first quartile in outage durations. BGE, PECO and PHI were top decile for gas odor responses, which is very critical for us as we continue to fend gas as a source -- a bridge source to the future. Customer service is top-notch with BGE, ComEd and PECO achieving top decile and PHI top quartile. 
On the generation front, our generation fleet performed well during the quarter, even in the face of uncertainty in Illinois. Our nuclear plants produced 40.5 terawatts of zero-carbon generation, avoiding approximately 21 million tons of carbon dioxide that would be generated otherwise. The fleet had a 96% capacity factor over that period of time, and we're very proud of their operations with the uncertainty they faced.
On Slide 7, the progress on separation. We continue to make progress on separating the businesses into 2 independent Fortune 200 companies. FERC approved the separation in August. And in September, we received a private letter ruling from the IRS confirming the tax-free nature of the separation. The process for the NRC and New York PSC approvals are moving forward, as expected, and remain on track. Last week, the New York PSC staff held the first meeting of settlement negotiations. This is an important step in the process, and we've asked for authorization from the commission by December 16 on their scheduled meeting date. We have named the CEO of each company, as well as their direct reports, and we'll continue the staffing process over the course of the next few weeks and months to be ready for the close in the first quarter of next year. 
Joe Dominguez and I are both excited to lead our companies into the next chapter. Exelon will continue to be one of the nation's premier customer-focused energy delivery companies with more than 10 million customers. Joe is the right person to lead Constellation, will be America's leading clean energy company, producing 12% of the nation's clean energy and nearly 2x more than any other clean energy company out there. We remain focused on setting each business up to be successful for the long term. 
Joe, I'll turn over to you for the financial update."
296181,1684503709,2423325,"Exelon Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2021",2021-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Exelon Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover our third quarter results, our quarterly financial updates and our hedge disclosures. I will also provide an update on our full year 2021 guidance. Turning to Slide 8 first. We earned $1.09",1402,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover our third quarter results, our quarterly financial updates and our hedge disclosures. I will also provide an update on our full year 2021 guidance. 
Turning to Slide 8 first. We earned $1.09 per share on a non-GAAP basis for the quarter. Exelon Utilities delivered a combined $0.66 per share, net of holding company expenses, and this was primarily driven by above-normal summer weather in our non-decoupled jurisdictions, along with strong operational performance and the impacts of distribution rate cases. ExGen earned $0.44 per share in the third quarter. Generation and Constellation both performed well during the quarter. We continue to make progress on levers we identified to mitigate the Texas loss, and we expect it will take the full year to realize all of the savings. Realized gains in our decommissioning trust funds partially offset the unrealized losses from our Constellation technology venture investments which are mark to market every quarter until realized. 
At our holding company, we benefited from expected income tax favorability in the third quarter. And as a reminder, our holding company incurred $0.12 per share drag in the first quarter associated with how consolidated full year tax expenses are booked due to the impact of the losses incurred at ExGen in Texas. The remainder of the first quarter drag is expected to reverse in the fourth quarter and is not expected to impact our full year results.
Turning to guidance. We are narrowing our 2021 EPS guidance range to $2.70 to $2.90 per share from $2.60 to $3 per share previously. Our updated guidance considers reversal of the retirements of the Byron and Dresden nuclear stations as well as execution of the EDF put and our continued additional -- a disciplined approach to cost management. We are delivering on our financial commitments and are confident we will be within our revised range at year-end.
On Slide 9, we show our quarter-over-quarter earnings walk. The $1.09 per share in the third quarter of this year was $0.05 per share higher than the third quarter of 2020. Exelon Utilities, inclusive of holding company earnings, were $0.08 per share higher compared to last year. The earnings growth was driven primarily by higher transmission and distribution rates associated with completed rate cases relative to the third quarter of 2020 and higher treasury rates on ComEd's distribution ROE. This was partially offset by costs related to the remnants of Hurricane Ida that swept through the PECO service territory in early September. The partial reversal of the first quarter tax expense at corporate also drove favorability relative to last year's results.
ExGen's earnings were down $0.03 per share compared with last year, and the decrease was due to net unrealized and realized losses on Constellation venture investments; lower capacity revenues, primarily in PJM; and more planned nuclear outage days. This was partially offset by realized gains in our nuclear decommissioning trust funds and higher ZEC revenue due, in part, to increased volumes resulting from fewer planned refuel outages and ZEC pricing in New York. 
Moving to Slide 10. Looking at our utility returns on a consolidated basis, we continue to meet our consolidated 9% to 10% target with a 9.3% trailing 12-month ROE as of the third quarter. Earned ROEs dipped modestly by 10 basis points since last quarter. Despite higher earnings driven primarily by distribution and transmission rates, the earnings were outpaced by increased equity infusions across all 4 utilities to support capital investments. Looking forward, we remain focused on delivering stronger returns at the utilities and supporting our growth targets to enable customer benefits.
Turning to Slide 11, there were some important developments on the regulatory front since the last call. First, on September 1, Delmarva Maryland filed an electric base rate case with the Maryland Public Service Commission seeking an approximately $29 million increase in electric distribution rates and reflecting an ROE of 10.1%. The case highlights Delmarva Power's strong record of reliability, reporting the second-best reliability performance in Maryland in 2019 and '20 behind only Pepco. Delmarva Power continues to make significant investments to improve reliability and customer service for our customers and communities. DPL Maryland expects to receive an order by March 30, 2022.
Second, on September 15, Delmarva Delaware received a verbal order for its distribution electric rate case. The Delaware Commission approved approximately $14 million increase in annual base distribution rates, reflecting an ROE of 9.6%. As permitted by Delaware law, Delmarva Power implemented full allowable rates on October 6, 2020, subject to refund.
We also have 2 rate cases pending final orders in the fourth quarter. On October 6, the administrative law judge presiding over PECO's electric distribution base rate case recommended the settlement with all parties be approved. The settlement provides for an increase of $132 million in annual electric distribution revenues, and we expect to receive an order in the fourth quarter. 
And then on November 2, the ALJ presiding over ComEd's 2021 distribution formula rate update issued a proposed order. There were no adjustments to ComEd's proposed revenue requirement increase of $45.8 million. We expect to receive a final order from the Illinois Commerce Commission by early December. 
We continue to have constructive regulatory relationships across our jurisdictions and are working with our regulators, states and communities to support their clean energy and climate goals. As a reminder, we expect nearly 100% of our rate base growth will be covered by alternative mechanisms by the end of our planning period, a differentiator for our utilities when compared to peers. More details on the rate cases can be found on Slides 20 through 24 of the appendix. 
And as Chris mentioned, our energy efficiency programs highlighted on Slide 12 is one example of how Exelon's utilities are helping their customers on the Path to Clean. Exelon Utilities are driving customer-driven emissions reductions in our communities through some of the nation's largest energy-efficiency programs and conservation efforts. These programs enable customer savings through home energy audits, lighting discounts, appliance recycling, home improvement rebates, equipment upgrade incentives and innovative programs like smart thermostats and combined heat and power programs. 
In 2020, through a combination of new and prior year investments, our utilities helped customers save over 22.3 million megawatt hours of energy. This equates to 8.1 million metric tons of CO2 emissions avoided, the equivalent of nearly 932,000 homes energy use for 1 year or the carbon sequestered by 10.5 million acres of U.S. forests in 1 year according to EPA's greenhouse gas calculator. 
Each of Exelon's utilities is building upon existing work and supporting a Path to Clean that aligns to the goals and needs of their local jurisdictions and stakeholders. Our approach allows jurisdictional flexibility, such that each utility may respond to their unique regions and markets and employ the strategies and solutions that best address their operational footprints and customer preferences.
Before discussing our gross margin update on Slide 13, I want to remind you that we expect to provide 2022 hedge disclosures at Analyst Day, which will be held closer to the completion of the separation. However, what I can say now is that we have continued to hedge on our ratable plan for future years, and this includes the length from the Byron and Dresden retirement reversals until the carbon mitigation contracts begin and Exelon's full ownership of the CENG assets. 
Turning to the table. Total gross margin increased $500 million since last quarter due to the plant retirement reversals in Illinois and full ownership of the CENG assets beginning on August 7. In 2021, open gross margin is up $1.6 billion relative to the second quarter, primarily due to higher prices in all regions and higher volumes driven by execution of the EDF put and the decision to reverse Byron and Dresden's early retirements. Capacity in ZEC dollars are up $100 million due to full ownership of the CENG assets.
Mark to market of hedges were down $1 billion due to our hedged position, partially offset by the execution of power new business. We executed $200 million of power new business and $50 million of non-power new business during the third quarter. The non-gross margin impacts of the Illinois plant reversals and the full ownership of CENG are incorporated on Page 32 of the appendix. 
Thank you, and I'll now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks."

And that goes for both companies as we split. There's a commitment on both sides to do that. We'll complete the preparations to separate the businesses, including the organization, the cost structure for each company that will set each company up for long-term success at a strong investment grade. 
At Exelon Utilities, we are prudently and efficiently deploying $6.6 billion of capital to benefit our customers and help meet the needs of our jurisdictions' energy policy goals. We are working with our regulators to ensure timely recovery of these investments, as Joe discussed in his talking points.
We continue to advocate for clean energy and climate policies with the new administration and Congress in our states to put the country on a path to meeting the carbon and air pollution reduction goals. There's more here than just carbon. We have a city in Chicago that is the third highest with lung disease. And it's not only carbon. It's the fumes from the industrial sources, and we need to do our part to help lower that. And we're partnering and supporting our customers and the communities that we serve. 
So with that, I thank you for your time today, and I'll open up the call to questions."

The transmission program, that's always been a challenging issue, as you know, given that it's not just about funding, but it's also about citing. And so we do expect that to continue to be a challenging area but obviously essential to the clean energy build-out. So I'll stop there and let Cal jump in or Joe, as I said, on tax."

The $5 billion going toward zero emission and clean buses; port electrification, when you think about port electrification for our city of Baltimore and Philadelphia, what that would mean for them; and not even talking about the different grants that they are proposing where utilities could partner to do different things and creative.
And all of this is good for the customers. If that -- those monies are coming directly to the state and there's a partnership, we will continue to invest on reliability and resiliency and then take these moments. It keeps the customer bill down, and that is a concern of ours, just to keep affordability at the forefront of everything we do. So that's that partnership and how we see it playing out."

I think we're still feeling very confident about the Democrats' ability to get both infrastructure and Build Back Better across the finish line. There's, as you know, a strong proposal put out by the President that had support last week around a top line number that the group has apparently coalesced around. They have continued to work to flesh out the meat on the bone so that they can move this package quickly. And Senator Manchin has shared that he thinks that's doable, indeed even citing agreement with the Senate majority leader that it's possible this could get done by Thanksgiving. 
So I think there's broad consensus that action is needed, and in particular, on the clean energy tax package that there is sufficient support for the provisions that will get the country to a place where it can come close to meeting the 2030 carbon reduction goals. 
If for some reason that, that does not occur, as you know, there's regularly action at the end of the year on a bipartisan basis to look at tax extenders. And we're, again, hopeful, given the amount of support that we've seen for support for the existing fleet that the nuclear provision could be considered as part of an end-of-the-year bipartisan package if the Democrat BBB bill doesn't get across the finish line."

But the short answer is that under the nuclear PTC, as drafted, revenues from a state program are not -- included at the state program would adjust to reflect the existence of the federal support. And almost all of our programs have some explicit reference to the fact that if there is subsequent federal support after the state program takes effect, that it will be reflected in the state calculation of the support under the program. 
So there clearly will need to be further proceedings to evaluate and have the state adjudicate how that federal support will be reflected. But assuming that the PTC passes, we would expect each of the states to take a look at that and for it to be reflected in the level of the state support. Jim?"

We're not deviating a large deal from what we've historically talked about. I think the change for 2022 has to be in relation to what we saw develop over the course of this quarter with the legislation, right? We had assets that we had previously said we're going to retire, and then the legislation passed, and we unretired. 
And what that effectively meant for 2022 is that before the contract goes into effect, it created a position that added extra generation link to our portfolio that we've been able to, since then, hedge. But beyond -- then beyond May or June when the contract starts, effectively, those megawatts are hedged through the CMC contract. 
So the 2022 is just a little bit in a different beginning of the year, end of year story because, effectively, the contracts are providing the hedge in the long run. We hedged the length that got added back to the book, largely speaking, in the beginning of the year during this price action that we saw this quarter so that's been a generally good development. And then in the outer-years, we would still -- other than the contracted assets, we would still be following along our ratable hedge program. So there's -- the further out in time you go, the more open position areas, as we've always had historically."

We made progress on our regulatory and policy objectives as we had stated our desires last quarter. We earned $0.41 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.89 per share on a non-GAAP basis, and Joe will go through those details when we get to his part of the presentation.
As you know, we've been working with our regulators and our policymakers across our 6 jurisdictions on regulatory mechanisms that would allow us to prudently invest in critical infrastructure to the benefit of our consumers while earning an appropriate return on that used capital. As part of those efforts, the D.C., Maryland PSCs, approved multiyear plans for Pepco. The New Jersey BPU approved ACE's electric rate settlement, and we received an order in the PECO gas rate case. It's the first in 10 years.
PJM held a first capacity auction in 3 years. Results were disappointing, but were slightly better than we had anticipated or expected. Commerce and the administration continue to work on the infrastructure package, and there is momentum building to preserve the existing nuclear fleet to meet the country's energy and climate goals.
The president's budget includes support for existing nuclear plants, and Senator Cardin and Representative Pascrell introduced legislation to provide $15 per megawatt hour production tax credit to existing nuclear power plants. This legislation would help ensure that the existing nuclear fleet, which provides more than 50% of the nation's carbon-free power remains in operations and available to meet the country's energy needs while preserving and achieving climate goals.
This progress is encouraging. If the PTC is included in the legislation that passes later this year, it will make an enormous difference for climate and for our nuclear plants. Unfortunately, though, that will be too late for the buyer interest in nuclear facilities, which brings me to Illinois. After many months of very tough negotiations, we were able to reach agreement with the governor and his administration that would provide support to the buyer interest in Braidwood facilities, allowing them continued operation and LaSalle would also be preserved.
Unfortunately, the state leaders and other stakeholders are at an impasse at this point on provisions related to the nuclear regulation -- or excuse me, the nuclear issues in the legislation. There's been no progress towards enacting the legislation since the session ended and the retirement dates for the plants are now only weeks away. We don't want to close these plants, but we cannot make decisions based off of hope of legislation being passed in the future. We've been doing that since 2016, while significant losses have been incurred.
We must act on the economic facts as they exist today, where no legislation has been passed by the general assembly or signed into law by the governor. Absent legislation, closing the plants is the right economic decision, but not an easy one. The talent, the dedicated employees that work at these plants, our colleagues and our friends that these -- their jobs support their families and their communities. Premature retirement of these plants is also a loss for the citizens of Illinois.
The 4 plants at Byron, Dresden, Braidwood and LaSalle, which are 8 reactors, provide 28,000 direct and indirect jobs, $3.5 billion annually to the Illinois economy. $150 million in Illinois taxes that support the schools, public safety and other critical services in the communities that they reside in. 2/3 of Illinois carbon-free electricity is greatly at risk with these shutdowns. Once Byron and Dresden retire, it will take many years under the proposed legislation to add enough renewable energy -- intermittent renewable energy to get back to where Illinois is in terms of clean energy production. In the meantime, more than 100 million metric tons of additional carbon will be admitted over the next decade as a result.
I remain hopeful that the outstanding differences can be resolved and the bill will be passed very soon that would allow the clients to continue to deliver the carbon-free power to the grid, but time is really running out on that becoming achievable.
Moving to operations on Slide 6. Reliability performance remained strong despite the frequent storms and the heat across our service territories. All utilities achieved first quartile operating performance in outage duration and frequency, as you can see by the charts. ComEd delivered top decile performance in outage duration and frequency while BGE and PHI were top decile for outage duration. Customer operation metrics remain strong across the utilities. BGE, ComEd and PECO achieved top decile performance in the customer satisfaction indices.
On the Generation front, our generation fleet performed well during the quarter. Our nuclear plants provided 36.6 terawatt hours of 0 carbon generation to the grid, avoiding approximately 20 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. The fleet had a capacity factor of 93.7% for the quarter. Our fossil and renewable fleet operated above plan with power dispatch match at 99.5% and wind and solar energy capture at 96%. Our Texas plants are running as expected, helping to meet the summer loads.
Turning to the separation on Slide 7. We're making progress against our execution plan and remain on track for a first quarter close. The team is working on the organizational and cost structures of each company that will set each business up for long-term success. On the regulatory front, we received comments in each of the dockets for approval and the process is moving forward as expected. We remain on track to get the necessary approvals. We will continue to update you on the work as it progresses.
Turning to Slide 8. We all are very excited at Exelon to announce that Exelon Utilities have set a goal to reduce their operations-driven emission by 50% by 2030 and reaching net zero by 2050. Since our founding, Exelon has been dedicated to being part of the solution for climate crisis and a leader in providing clean energy to the grid.
We were one of the first companies in our industry to commit to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, even though our emissions were already 10x lower than our peers. We have met or exceeded our previous -- 3 previous goals, and Exelon Utilities' new goal builds upon our long-standing commitment to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.
We'll meet these goals through continued modernization of our gas systems, electrifying our light-duty fleet and exploring electricity and other zero carbon alternatives for medium- and heavy-duty fleet. A focus on energy efficiency and clean electricity for our operations is clearly part of the plan. Investing in equipment and processes to reduce our SF6 insulating gas from our large breakers from our system, exploring and piloting low-carbon fuels in new grid technologies and advocating for affordable grid decarbonization.
In addition, we remain focused on how we can help our customers and communities decarbonize in an equitable way. The utilities will continue to invest in the EV infrastructure across our service territories and join the Electric Highway Coalition, which will create a seamless network of charging stations on highway systems covering most of the country.
We will invest in robust energy efficiency programs at each of our utilities. This is a continuing endeavor which will enable customers to have lower emissions profile, use less energy and save money. In 2020 alone, these programs avoided 8.1 million metric tons of carbon emissions. Advocates for policy that will put our state -- we will continue to advocating for policies that will put our states and our communities on a path to a clean energy future while ensuring equitable transitions that benefit everyone in our communities.
Before I turn it over to Joe on Slide 9, I want to highlight the work we are doing to help transform our communities through our workforce development programs, which you can see on -- narrated on the slide. Diversity, equality and inclusion is a core value at Exelon, and we are growing a diverse and inclusive, high-performing workforce. We operate in some of the most diverse cities in the country, and we have a responsibility to help address the inequities in our communities. We have more than 100 workforce development programs, spanning from middle schools, high schools and throughout colleges as well as programs for work-ready underemployed adults. These programs have already reached more than 22,000 participants.
We recently launched the STEM Leadership Academy scholarships that are open to graduates of the program, ensures that the graduates are debt-free and guaranteed internships with Exelon throughout their college half. I recently awarded scholarships to 7 young women and see their faces on how life-changing this was for them and their families. It was quite emotional not only for the young women, but for myself and the rest of the leadership here at Exelon. We are committed to supporting our communities by investing in education, job training programs and giving the underserved populations opportunities to grow and succeed.
I'll turn it over to Joe now to take our financial update."

Today, I will cover our second quarter results, our quarterly financial updates and our hedge disclosures.First, turning to Slide 10. We earned $0.89 per share on a non-GAAP basis for the quarter. This favor",1251,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our second quarter results, our quarterly financial updates and our hedge disclosures.
First, turning to Slide 10. We earned $0.89 per share on a non-GAAP basis for the quarter. This favorability was driven by O&M and tax timing as well as some realized and unrealized gains we have forecasted for later this year. Exelon Utilities delivered a combined $0.49 per share net of holding company expenses. This was primarily driven by strong operational performance and the impacts of distribution rate cases.
ExGen earned $0.40 per share in the second quarter, and we've begun to make progress on levers we identified to mitigate the Texas laws, but as we've said before, we expect it will take a full year to realize all the savings. Additionally, unrealized and realized gains from the Constellation Technology Ventures portfolio, and realized gains from our nuclear decommissioning trust funds contributed to the favorable course.
At Holdco, we benefited from expected income tax favorability in the second quarter. As a reminder, Holdco incurred $0.12 per share drag in the first quarter associated with how consolidated full year tax expenses are booked due to the impact of losses incurred at ExGen in Texas during Q1. The remainder of the first quarter hit will reverse over the course of the year and not impact our full year results.
There's still a lot of work to be done this year, but we are confident we will deliver earnings within our guidance range of $2.60 to $3 per share, and you can see the details on Slide 17 in the appendix.
On Slide 11, we show our quarter-over-quarter earnings walk. The $0.89 per share in the second quarter of this year was $0.34 per share higher than the second quarter of 2020. Exelon Utilities less Holdco earnings were up $0.20 per share compared with last year. The increase was driven primarily by the absence of storm's costs from last year's record-setting storm season at PECO and new rates associated with our completed rate cases and the impact of higher treasury rate on ComEd's distribution ROE. The partial reversal of first quarter tax expense at corporate also drove favorability relative to last year's results.
ExGen's earnings were up $0.14 per share compared with last year. And the increase was due to unrealized and realized gains on our Constellation Technology Venture investments, realized gains in our nuclear decommissioning trust funds, fewer planned nuclear outage days and higher ZEC revenue from increased volumes in ZEC pricing in New York. As a reminder, the Constellation Technology Venture investment will be mark-to-market every quarter. And since the quarter end, we have seen some decline in prices.
Moving on to Slide 12. Looking at our utility returns on a consolidated basis, our trailing 12-month ROE as of the second quarter has improved to 9.4% and is back within our 9% to 10% targeted range. A 50 basis point increase from last quarter was primarily due to higher second quarter earnings across the utilities and the roll-off of the storms that I mentioned that occurred last year. Looking forward, we remain focused on delivering stronger returns in the utilities and supporting our growth targets.
Now turning to Slide 13. As Chris mentioned briefly in his remarks, there were some important developments on the regulatory front. Notably, we received orders in 2 multiyear plans at Pepco for D.C. and Maryland. Multiyear plans provide our customers with great predictability and reduce the administrative costs caused by frequent filing with traditional rate case to recover our costs. We are pleased that we have now received orders in our first 3 multiyear rate plans, which will provide timely and predictable recovery for capital investments for the benefit of all our customers.
And now moving on to the details of the recent rate case developments. First, on June 8. The DC Public Service Commission approved Pepco's multiyear plan for the 18 months, spanning the remainder of '21 through 2022 with an allowed ROE of 9.275%, a revenue increase of $108.6 million along with the acceleration of tax benefits to partially mitigate rate impacts for customers through 2022 is approved. Additionally, the order allows for two-way reconciliation, including the ability to request recovery of costs that exceed the forecasted cost at the end of deployment. The commission also approved tracking performance incentive mechanisms that are focused on the district's climate and clean energy goals, including GHG emission reduction, energy savings, peak demand reduction and distributed energy resources deployed.
Second, on the 28th of June, the Maryland Public Service Commission approved Pepco's 3-year multiyear plan for April 1, 2021 through March 31, 2024. The order approved a cumulative revenue requirement of $52 million over the period as well as a 9.55% ROE. Acceleration of tax benefits to offset customer increases were improved for the first year with years 2 and 3 to be determined later. COVID-19 in electric vehicle regulatory assets were also approved for recovery.
Third, on the 22nd of June, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission issued an order approving increase in PECO's annual natural gas distribution revenues of $29 million, reflecting an ROE of 10.24%.
And fourth, on July 14, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities unanimously approved ACE's settlement in both the electric distribution rate case as well as our AMI meter and network deployment and cost recovery. The rate case settlement was for $41 million revenue increase and a 9.6% ROE. There will be no rate impact to customers until January 1, 2022, due to improved offsets from acceleration of tax benefits. We are excited about the AMI decision that will allow us to bring the benefits of this technology to our customers in South Jersey.
We've also had several rate cases still in progress, including Delmarva, Delaware's electric case where we expected [ provision ] in the third quarter, the PECO electric case in the fourth quarter and ComEd's annual formula rate filing in December. And overall, we're very pleased with the progress in advancing progressive regulatory designs that benefit our customers while easing regulatory burden and improving visibility for our utilities. As a reminder, we expect nearly 100% of our rate base growth will be covered by alternative mechanisms by the end of our planning period, a differentiator for our utilities when compared to our peers. And more details on the rate cases can be found on Slides 21 through 28 of the appendix.
And before discussing our gross margin update on Slide 14, I want to remind you that we will not be providing any ExGen disclosures beyond 2021 at this time. And given the separation, we expect to provide the 2022 hedge disclosures closer to completion when we're able to give a full financial picture for new spun-off company.
Turning to the table on gross margin. There is no change to the 2021 gross margin since last quarter. In 2021, open gross margin is up $750 million relative to the first quarter primarily due to the impact of higher prices across all regions and the execution of $50 million power new business in [ 2021 ]. Our mark-to-market hedges were down $600 million due to our highly hedged position, partially offset by the execution of power new business. We executed $150 million of power new business in the quarter and $50 million of non-power business in the quarter.
I'll stop there. Thank you, and I'll now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks."

There are discussions of a clean energy standard potentially being developed for the reconciliation bill.
And you asked about [ CMC ]. I think what you mean is the DOE grant program that has been discussed for a potential inclusion in the infrastructure bill. So those are 3 very different kinds of policy solutions. The first 2 being far more comprehensive and one's that, as you mentioned, in Maryland, Pennsylvania and other states, in the existing nuclear fleet potentially seeing a significant amount of support, and as Chris said, providing a real benefit to the climate. The grant program is a little bit more challenging and more limited given the limited amount of funding that will be available under that program at least as it's currently drafted.
The real point though, is that all of these programs are just tatter or just sort of proposed programs. Nothing has yet been enacted as you know. And so while we're watching it very closely and again, very grateful for the growing amount of support for preserving their fleet through federal legislation, the reality is that, as Chris said, we need to make decisions based on laws that have actually been enacted and nothing has yet come to fruition in D.C. as of yet."

And we said they would come in a number of areas, when you look at deferral of cost and onetime cost savings opportunities, whether it's things like contracting dollars, holding labor vacancies, reductions in travel and entertainment expense, deferring noncritical maintenance capital, those types of things.
There were some revenue opportunities when you see the improvement in treasuries. We talked about our technology ventures investments. So we're ahead of what we expected to do at this point in the year, and we're continuing to work hard on delivering the balance of what we committed to."

We are committed to $6.6 billion annual investments in capital and recovery of real-time on that capital. And the alternative ratemaking that has been taking place across those utilities indicate that we are recovering and returning on that capital in real time. If you think about the jurisdictions in which we operate, they have typically been some of the more difficult across the country. and we're changing that landscape.

But what I would add to that is, as you know, Michael, we've done a good job across the enterprise and as well as at ExGen in really driving efficiencies and cost here in the last 5 or 6 years, and we continue to look at new ways to do that, whether it's leverage in technology or the scale of our business when you look at our supply organization doing a nice job in that area, and we'll continue to challenge ourselves.

And so you start power out of the reactor, the thermal megawatts out of the reactor is reduced, which compounds to the electric megawatts produced. And so you get to a point that you're running -- within months or so period, you're running inefficient steam paths and inefficient operations. So you make the call as coast down to start and to shut the facility down.
The one thing to reiterate in shutting down a nuclear plant, it is -- the goal is you shut down, you cool down. You disassemble the reactor. You offload all of the fuel into the spent fuel pool and you relinquish the license to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and there is no path back from that. There's no regulatory path back.
And so what we do is start into the phases of the chosen decommissioning using the decommissioning trust fund and it comes out of our expense column. It's in the prefunded category of the decommissioning trust. So it's irreversible. And running a year is physically impossible. Running an extra month is very challenging on the steep supply system and maintaining adequate controls on the physics."
