I hope you and your families are well and my thoughts go out to all those affected by the pandemic. 2020 was an unprecedented year, which presented challenges that none of us could have predicted a year ago. The biggest being the emergence of the global pandemic. This event materially impacted our supply chain, the way we work and collaborate and how we engage with our customers around the world. The pandemic also impacted the health of our customers, employees and people close to us in our personal lives. Despite these challenges, we grew our enterprise business for a fourth consecutive year. We grew our cloud business for a second consecutive year, and we made progress stabilizing our service provider business, with orders in this vertical growing on a full year basis even though revenue declined. These results were made possible by the efforts of our employees who have executed exceptionally well, and I'd like to give a special thanks to all of them for not only enduring, but excelling in the face of adversity. 
We're proud to be one of the key PIs of the global Internet, and the world needed the Internet in 2020 more than ever. We are exiting 2020 following 2 consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth and entering the new year with good momentum. This is a direct result of the strategic actions we have taken around how we go-to-market, how we align our business and how we complement our organic business with thoughtful acquisitions, such as Mist that create new revenue streams and pull-through sales of our existing products. 
While these actions should set us up to sustainably grow our business starting this year, I'd like to highlight several key areas of strategic focus, where we plan to double down in the new year, which you'll hear us talk more about during our upcoming Investor Day event on February 12. First, delivering industry-leading customer experiences through superior technology, engagement, quality and support. While we're entering 2021 with the highest customer satisfaction score we have ever seen, we view customer experience as our true north and are committed to doing even better. We think delivering superior customer outcomes will enable us to win across all of the markets and verticals we serve. Second, focusing our business on specific use cases which include the AI-driven enterprise, cloud-ready data centers and automated WAN with connected security embedded in each. These use cases each represent a large opportunity that spans across verticals we serve. Each of these use cases is likely to see attractive market tailwinds over the next several years and focusing our resources on these areas should enable us to accelerate our growth as these opportunities unfold. 
As I discussed last quarter, we have reorganized our sales, product management and engineering teams around these business opportunities, and we will begin disclosing our revenue mix in this format when we report our Q1 results. Third, capturing the value presented by our recent acquisition and making sure 128 Technology, Apstra and Netrounds deliver similar returns on investment to what we are seeing with Mist, which continues to exceed expectations and is positively impacting sales of the broader Juniper portfolio. I am very encouraged by the early customer interest in each of these transactions which is building confidence these businesses will positively impact our performance in the future. 
We firmly believe we are taking share and that the deliberate actions we have taken, along with some of the investments we have made, should position us to not only capitalize on the big market opportunities, such as 400-gig and 5G that will unfold over the next few years but also to see broader market success that decreases our sensitivity to macro trends. We believe our plans will enable us to emerge from the pandemic stronger than we entered and delivers sustainable top and bottom line growth over the next several years even if end market conditions remain challenged. 
Now I'd like to provide some additional insights into the quarter and address some of the key developments we are seeing within each of our core market verticals. Starting with enterprise. We delivered record revenue in the December quarter and experienced high single-digit order growth year-over-year, which exceeded our own expectations. While we saw particularly strong demand in the North American market, strength was broad-based across geographies, and we secured a significant multiyear opportunity with an international global 10 accounts for our wireless, wired and SD-WAN portfolio driven by our Mist AI differentiation. Based on our results, we believe we are taking share and that our enterprise business is likely to be our fastest growth vertical in 2021. Our optimism is fueled by the building customer response to our AI-driven enterprise offerings. And specifically, the momentum we are seeing around Mist which saw new logos grow by more than 125% year-over-year, and orders increased by nearly 140% year-over-year. 
In addition to robust wireless growth driven by Mist AI, we experienced strong adoption of our wired assurance capabilities and record pull-through of our EX switching portfolio. In total, our current mystified business of Mist wireless land, wired assurance, Marvis virtual network assistant and associated EX pull-through generated more than $150 million worth of revenue in 2020, and we expect to materially grow this business over the next few years. 
We would also remind you that Mist is a software subscription business with 30% to 35% of each deal recognized ratably, generating a healthy deferred revenue stream, which will be recognized in the future. The Mist technology is truly unique and delivers a compelling solution for AI-driven client to cloud operations. Not only does our solution minimize IT costs with proactive automation and self-driving action but it assures secure user experiences with end-to-end service levels and AI-driven support. This experience first focus is resonating in the market and is one of the reasons Gartner recently positioned us in the leaders quadrant for wired and wireless access, where we were named the leader of leaders in terms of ability to execute. 
The acquisition of 128 Technology represents the next evolution of our AI-driven enterprise vision. 128 Technology will not only enable Juniper to provide a superior application and user aware SD-WAN experience as compared to all other SD-WAN offerings in the market, but also to extend the value of Mist AI engine and cloud management capabilities from client to cloud. 
Our service provider segment also exceeded our expectations in Q4 and we have been encouraged to see this business begin to stabilize in 2020 following several difficult years. The improved service provider results we delivered, both in Q4 and and for the full year 2020, are due in large part to the deliberate diversification efforts we have undertaken, which has enabled us to overcome weak spending trends at several of our large U.S. Tier 1 customers. We believe the strength we are seeing with U.S. cable operators and international carriers is likely to continue through the upcoming year and we remain optimistic regarding our ability to capture more switching and security opportunities within the service provider vertical in addition to core and edge routing deployments. 
Not to be overlooked, we remain optimistic regarding the access aggregation and metro routing opportunities, which in aggregate, represent a $2 billion portion of the market that is growing and where Juniper historically hasn't played. We introduced our first product targeting this opportunity during the second half of this past year and plan to introduce additional solutions through the course of 2021. Early interest in our metro offerings is encouraging, and we believe the combination of these products with net brand software automation capabilities should present a compelling value proposition that enable us to win in this attractive portion of the market. 
Based on our current pipeline, we remain confident in our ability to further stabilize our service provider business during the upcoming year, despite the ongoing challenges facing many of our customers in this vertical. Our cloud business also exceeded our expectations in Q4 and grew on a full year basis for a second consecutive year despite an anticipated decline in spending by what has historically been our largest cloud customer. We have been able to achieve this growth through improved momentum with other hyperscale accounts and continued success with our Tier 2 customers, which we plan to call cloud majors going forward. Our hyperscale pipeline remains healthy, and we continue to see strong wide area momentum with these important customers, particularly for our routing solutions, which experienced strong growth from both a revenue and an orders perspective during the most recent quarter. While business with these customers is likely to remain lumpy, especially as old projects complete and new projects ramp up, the funnel of new high-value opportunities we have been seeing in this footprint continues to exceed the headwinds we also see from old projects completing. 
The value of our routing stack remains critical to these customers and some of the innovations we have been delivering in software around SONiC and containerized routing are opening up new use cases to expand our TAM and will further increase the value of our technology to this critical customer set. Importantly, we also remain optimistic regarding our potential to gain share with cloud majors, which we view as a large and growing market opportunity. Our potential here is not only driven by the strength of our portfolio, and Apstra will further enhance our position but this is also an area where we see opportunities to diversify by gaining share within existing accounts and opening up new logos through an incremental go-to-market effort. 
Based on our current pipeline and the momentum we are seeing at both hyperscale and cloud majors, I expect us to grow our cloud business in 2021. Importantly, we are continuing to make progress on 400-gig and currently have more than 100 wins for our 400-gig capable products. While many of our wins are addressing wide area use cases, where we have historically been strong, we're also seeing an increased level of success in data center switching opportunities. We continue to expand our 400-gig product set and deliver new features needed to gain share in this critical market opportunity. We believe we have the right product and customer engagement to both protect our wide area footprint and capture switching share as the 400-gig cycle unfolds across our cloud and carrier customers starting later this year. 
On this last point, I'd like to spend a few minutes on Apstra, which has the potential to accelerate our success in the data center switching market both within cloud majors and large enterprise accounts. Fabric management is a key determinant of success in many of these opportunities, and Apstra not only provides us with leadership here but also in the area of closed-loop assurance, which allows customers to quickly troubleshoot and remediate problems in large data center environments. We believe Apstra's capabilities are highly differentiated and offer customers the industry's best day 0, day 1 and day 2 automated operations. We think these capabilities have the potential to significantly improve customer experience and accelerate the momentum in our data center switching business, both in cloud majors as well as large enterprise environment. Our software business performed well in Q4 and accounted for 12% of our overall sales. 
As a company, we remain laser-focused on capturing more software and in particular, more SaaS and subscription based software. While high-value SaaS and subscription software are a smaller percentage of our overall software revenue stream today, they are growing rapidly which is a trend we expect to continue over the next several years. This growth is primarily being driven by the strong adoption of our mid- cloud as well as other software-based subscription offerings. The recent acquisitions of 128 Technology, Netrounds and Apstra will further accelerate our efforts to capture more software revenue in the years to come. I'd like to mention that our services team delivered another solid quarter and on a full year basis, 2020 was another year of service revenue growth due to strong renewals and attach rates as well as growth in our SaaS and software subscriptions. 
Our services team continues to execute extremely well and ensure our customers receive an excellent experience. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders. 
I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail."

I will start by discussing our fourth quarter results and then cover the fiscal year 2020 and end with some color on our outlook. We ended the fourth quarter of 2020 at $1.223 billion in revenue and non-GAA",1300,"Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start by discussing our fourth quarter results and then cover the fiscal year 2020 and end with some color on our outlook. 
We ended the fourth quarter of 2020 at $1.223 billion in revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.55, both above the midpoint of guidance. Revenue grew 1%, which was the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. The higher than midpoint results were driven by strength across all verticals. 
Looking at our revenue by vertical. On a year-over-year basis, Enterprise posted a record quarter, growing 7% year-over-year and 14% sequentially. Cloud grew slightly year-over-year and increased 11% sequentially. Service provider declined 4% year-over-year and was essentially flat sequentially. 
From a technology perspective, routing increased 9% year-over-year and grew 7% sequentially. Switching decreased 2% year-over-year and increased 14% sequentially. Security decreased 14% year-over-year and grew 19% sequentially. Our services business decreased 1% year-over-year and increased 2% sequentially. Software revenue was approximately 12% of total revenue in the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 60.0% in the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. 
In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, 3 were cloud, 6 were service provider and 1 was an Enterprise. Our top 10 customers account for 30% of our total revenue as compared to 33% in the fourth quarter of last year. Product deferred revenue was $105 million, up 5% sequentially and down 21% year-over-year due to the timing of the delivery of contractual commitments. Deferred revenue related to our software as a service and software subscription offerings, which grew year-over-year, are included in our services deferred revenue. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 2% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. The higher-than-anticipated costs were driven by higher variable compensation, mostly in the go-to-market organization, as a result of higher revenue as well as the acquisition of 128 Technology. 
Cash flow from operations was $126 million for the quarter, an increase both year-over-year and sequentially. We paid $66 million in dividends, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share. We also repurchased $75 million worth of shares. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020 was $2.4 billion. I would like to point out that there was a timing difference between our new debt issuance and the full retirement of the previous debt which was completed in January. As a result of this timing difference, our total cash and debt balances are elevated by approximately $485 million and $425 million, respectively, as of year-end. 
Moving on to our full year results. Total revenue for 2020 was $4.445 billion, which was flat versus 2019. Our Enterprise business grew 3% for the year, despite the impact of the pandemic. This was our fourth consecutive year of full year growth in Enterprise. Our Cloud business grew 2% for the year, the second consecutive year of growth. Our Service Provider business began to stabilize and performed as expected, declining 4% for the full year. 
Looking at our technologies, routing declined 1% and switching grew 2% and security declined 9% year-over-year. Our services business grew 1%. Software was 10% of total revenue, the second year of software being at or above this level. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the year, 5 were Cloud, 4 were Service Provider and 1 was an Enterprise. Non-GAAP gross margin declined by 90 basis points in 2020, primarily due to the additional logistics and other supply chain-related costs related to COVID-19, partially offset by improvement in our service gross margin. 
Throughout the year, we continue to focus on disciplined operating expense management, a modest increase of less than 1% on a non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue was 43.7%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.55 in 2020. For the year, we had cash flow from operations of $612 million, which increased $83 million compared to 2019. 
During 2020, we took a balanced approach to capital allocation. We repurchased $375 million worth of shares and paid $264 million in dividends for a total capital return of 125% of free cash flow to shareholders. In addition, we acquired 2 growth-oriented companies that we believe will help us return to sustainable revenue growth and margin expansion over time. We also improved our capital structure by refinancing a portion of our debt locking in historically low long-term financing rates and extending our average maturity while preserving our investment-grade credit profile. I am proud of the strategic approach the team has taken to ensure our financial resilience through these challenging and uncertain times. 
Now I would like to provide some color on our guidance, which you can find details in the CFO commentary available on our Investor Relations website. At the midpoint of our revenue guidance, revenue is expected to be up 6% year-over-year, which includes less than $10 million from our recent acquisitions. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to experience normal seasonal patterns in the first quarter, excluding the anticipated impact of increased COVID related costs, non-GAAP gross margin would be approximately flat versus the first quarter of last year. We expect first quarter non-GAAP operating expense to increase sequentially, primarily due to the inclusion of approximately $20 million of operating expenses related to the recent acquisition as well as the annual reset of variable compensation and the typical seasonal increase in fringe costs, partially offset by a decline in commission expense. 
In addition, our first quarter non-GAAP EPS guidance includes the dilutive impact of the recent acquisitions. Before we move on to Q&A, I would like to provide some comments on our expectations for the full year 2021. Our 2021 revenue and non-GAAP earnings expectations remain unchanged relative to the forecast we provided during our Q3 2020 earnings call. However, we have updated our growth expectations to account for the revenue and the non-GAAP earnings upside that we experienced in Q4 2020 as compared to the midpoint of our guidance. We have also factored in the acquisition of Apstra, which is expected to be dilutive to our non-GAAP earnings during the first half of 2021, but be breakeven on a full year basis. 
In terms of full year revenue, we expect organic growth of approximately 2% to 3% and we anticipate an additional 1% of growth from the recent acquisitions. Beyond the first quarter, we expect revenue to grow sequentially each quarter in 2021. While non-GAAP gross margin can be difficult to predict, we expect full year gross margin of approximately 60% due to the higher volume, reduced COVID-related logistics costs and higher software mix as well as improved service costs. Through the course of the year, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to improve with volume. Non-GAAP operating expense is expected to remain near first quarter levels through the course of the year. The full year non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be approximately flat to 2020 levels. 
While we expect total non-GAAP operating expense to be up on a full year basis as we absorb our recent acquisition and invest to take advantage of market opportunities, we remain committed to disciplined expense management and expanding operating margin longer term. I'd also like to note that we expect non-GAAP other income and expense to remain near first quarter levels through the course of the year. Our non-GAAP tax rate on worldwide earnings is expected to be 19.5%, plus or minus 1%. We expect full year non-GAAP EPS to grow faster than revenue. Finally, our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share to be paid this quarter to stockholders of record. 
In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success, especially in this challenging environment. Now I'd like to open the call for questions."

Our organic innovation, our inorganic acquisitions have set us up to accelerate this part of our business. So despite the challenges that we saw in 2020 as a result of COVID, we grew this vertical, and we grew it nicely. I think we're taking share. I believe our technology and our differentiation has never been stronger. We've created not just market share growth and business growth, but mind share growth in the industry. And I think we've done so with an eye on doing it as efficiently as possible by focusing on the large enterprises. So a big component of our success comes from large Fortune 500, Global 1000 accounts, where the sales investment is as efficient as it can be for that enterprise.

We continue to see healthy diversification within cloud, both within the hyperscale spot providers where we enjoy footprint across practically all of them, but also among the what we used to call Tier 223, which we're now calling cloud majors going forward, more and more market share in that area as well. I'd also think that there is a greater diversity of technologies that we're selling. So it's not just about routing, it's also about switching. It's also about security in this very important vertical. 
As I look out into 2021, I believe our footprint that we retain within the cloud space is going to work for us, right? We didn't anticipate any major additional share taking that's going to happen in 2021 to achieve the growth that we believe that we can achieve in '21. But I do think that with the right focus in go to market, the technology that I know we have that I know is very competitive, we can, in fact, take some additional share as well in this vertical."

And if you include Mist wireless and wired, so this is EX that's sold really under the Mist automation framework on a stand-alone analyzed order basis, it's really around $300 million already. So the momentum has been really amazing. We're going to take the playbook that we implemented and getting our sellers very proficient in being able to position the Mist differentiation, the technology and apply that exact same playbook to the acquisitions that we've made last year, 128 and Apstra, in particular, which are mostly suited for the Enterprise but have applicability in other verticals as well. With 128, it is a really unique differentiated SD-WAN solution that fit beautifully under the Mist client to cloud vision, right, where you're extracting data insight telemetry from everything in the path between client to cloud and you're doing something really interesting with that data, which is to provide insights and improved automation and improved end-user experience for our customers. Apstra takes this experienced first networking approach that we know has worked so effectively in the campus, in client to cloud and applies it to the data center. So honestly, early interest in Apstra, although we just closed the deal yesterday, has been -- exceeded our expectations at this point. The pipeline we're building, the interest in customers that want to understand the better together story has been extremely encouraging. And then the last acquisition is a little bit on a smaller one, which is Netrounds, and Netrounds has applicability to all verticals, but especially the service provider vertical, where we have an ability now to sell beyond just the box and connectivity between boxes, but an assured experience assured SLAs to service providers, and we're also very pleased with the early interest from SPs in that technology as well."

So really leveraging our installed base with the growth asset of Mist is very much part of the strategy to accelerate the Mist growth, but also a good percentage of those customers are net new to Juniper.

Though Europe largely played out as expected from a revenue standpoint, Q4 probably exceeded our expectations by a bit. We enjoy very strong healthy franchises with service providers around the world. 49 of the top 50 service providers worldwide our customers trust Juniper technology. We did see weakness in some of the largest Tier 1 service providers, especially here in North America. And I think for the reason that we all know, there has been a lot of capital expenditure that has been placed in spectrum auctions and so forth. So it diverted investment away from the areas of the network, the business that we are traditionally strong in. I don't expect that to be the case forever. If you look out into '21, and we've provided an outlook of further stabilization, i.e., even better results than we saw in 2020 and in '21, we did not, in that outlook, anticipate a resumption that any significant resumption in spending by our large Tier 1 SP. If they do resume spending in the kind of IP technology that we develop and sell, then I think that would obviously benefit our business even more. The strength that we saw has to do with the diversification strategy that we have been executing on. So increased penetration in the cable space in this country, Tier 2 and Tier 3 service providers that are working very effectively for us and international service providers. You'll notice that we had a very healthy quarter in Asia Pacific. I'm very proud of the team in APAC for really showing results, not just in SP, but across all verticals, and that's just an indication of the kind of diversification we're driving through our business."

But as we look out beyond the pandemic, and you start to think about what happens when we recover from the pandemic my strong belief is that there will be a pivot towards investments in IT technology that's going to be cloud delivered, AI driven. It's not going to be the complex legacy on-prem traditional technologies that, quite frankly, are not important to Juniper, not a part of our strategy. It's the cloud-delivered technology that I think will actually see an acceleration as you get out of this COVID crisis.

As far as your question around appetite for spending, in those verticals that I just mentioned to Rob, financial services, campuses, higher education, federal government, large retailers.

So there are always going to be older, more mature use cases that start to sort of diminish. They kind of reduced over time. But we're offsetting those older use cases with new use cases that we continue to win even within the same customer so any cloud provider, especially how hyperscale cloud provider is going to be deploying our technology in a number of different use cases. And that natural evolution of use cases has always been there. Some will decline and others will grow. The second factor within the cloud vertical is just diversity within or among customers, we're seeing really healthy diversity among our largest hyperscale cloud customers, and that offsets some of the puts and takes of use cases within each of the customers, and we're seeing strength in the cloud majors opportunity where there are many customers.

As well as talking to individual companies. And it seems quite clear that spending intention around security has actually look quite significantly and that the overall IT budgets are also increasing quite meaningfully, which does not really put to your commentary about fairly soft conditions on spending, potentially improving once COVID is resolved.

First, I want to say, actually, what I mentioned was we anticipate enterprise spending to be healthy post COVID. So I actually think that there will be a resumption in spend and more tailwinds, an acceleration, if you will, of enterprise spending in many different use cases, especially the use cases that we as a company are focused on. Next, I was want to say with respect to Juniper and impact of solar winds, we never put that solar wind product into any of our products that we sell our customers. And of course, once we heard of the news, we quickly scoured our own networks and looked for any exposures, and we didn't find that we were in any way exposed. So that -- I'll just get out of the way. In terms of has solar wins or how their security type incidents increased the appetite for IT leaders or CCOs, to focus on spending, especially in security, the answer is absolutely, yes. I mean there is a reason that I think it's very important that as a networking company, you also have security cockpit competence and you embed security as a forethought, not an afterthought in all of the solutions that you sell to address the use cases that are important to your business, that's never been more important. So our security business in Q4 did not grow, but there's a reason for this. The high end of our security, where we typically sell into large service providers, cloud providers, that tends to be lumpy. The broader part of our security portfolio is really the strategy there is to embed it into our solutions. So we talked a lot about Mist. One element of our client to cloud Mist solution is that it's going to be secured by default with the technology that we have embedded in our -- the Mist solution portfolio. And for that reason, I'm actually quite optimistic about how these security trends and the appetite to invest in security by IT departments for our business."

In Q4, we saw double-digit routing growth in cloud providers and enterprises. Government and cable momentum was strong. MX and PTX grew both on a year-over-year and a sequential basis. So it does appear to be broad based. The use cases today for us are mostly going to be in core routing and edge routing, some DCI data center interconnect. The thing that I'm really excited about when it comes to the opportunity is on our metro road map. The metro represents around a $2 billion routing opportunity today that's growing at a healthy clip. It's probably the fastest-growing routing submarket of the overall routing market, and it's largely untapped by Juniper. And the good news is this is just another high-performance networking -- network, but it requires certain capabilities in certain aspects of your products around footprint and in power efficiency and certain types of features these are all within our wheelhouse. And this is a road map that we're executing on. We've already introduced the first product to address it, but you can expect a number of new products that we introduced this year to complete our metro routing portfolio. Netrounds really fits beautifully into this solution because it really provides that automation and SLA assurance end-to-end that's important for the metro. So that, I believe, is going to help us in our routing business in '21, but especially in '22 when the portfolio is complete."

I hope you and your families are well and my thoughts go out to all those affected by the pandemic. 2020 was an unprecedented year, whic",2115,"Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss our Q4 and full year 2020 results. I hope you and your families are well and my thoughts go out to all those affected by the pandemic. 
2020 was an unprecedented year, which presented challenges that none of us could have predicted a year ago. The biggest being the emergence of the global pandemic. This event materially impacted our supply chain, the way we work and collaborate and how we engage with our customers around the world. The pandemic also impacted the health of our customers, employees and people close to us in our personal lives. 
Despite these challenges, we grew our enterprise business for a fourth consecutive year. We grew our cloud business for a second consecutive year, and we made progress stabilizing our Service Provider business, with orders in this vertical growing on a full year basis even though revenue declined. These results were made possible by the efforts of our employees who have executed exceptionally well, and I'd like to give a special thanks to all of them for not only enduring, but excelling in the face of adversity. We're proud to be one of the keepers of the global Internet, and the world needed the Internet in 2020 more than ever. 
We are exiting 2020 following 2 consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth and entering the new year with good momentum. This is a direct result of the strategic actions we have taken around how we go-to-market, how we align our business and how we complement our organic business with thoughtful acquisitions, such as Mist that create new revenue streams and pull-through sales of our existing products. 
While these actions should set us up to sustainably grow our business starting this year, I'd like to highlight several key areas of strategic focus where we plan to double down in the new year, which you'll hear us talk more about during our upcoming Investor Day event on February 12. 
First, delivering industry-leading customer experiences through superior technology, engagement, quality and support. While we're entering 2021 with the highest customer satisfaction scores we have ever seen, we view customer experience as our true north and are committed to doing even better. We think delivering superior customer outcomes will enable us to win across all of the markets and verticals we serve. 
Second, focusing our business on specific use cases, which include the AI-driven enterprise, cloud-ready data centers and automated WAN with connected security embedded in each. These use cases each represent a large opportunity that spans across verticals we serve. Each of these use cases is likely to see attractive market tailwinds over the next several years and focusing our resources on these areas should enable us to accelerate our growth as these opportunities unfold. 
As I discussed last quarter, we have reorganized our sales, product management and engineering teams around these business opportunities, and we will begin disclosing our revenue mix in this format when we report our Q1 results. 
Third, capturing the value presented by our recent acquisition and making sure 128 Technology, Apstra and Netrounds deliver similar returns on investment to what we are seeing with Mist, which continues to exceed expectations and is positively impacting sales of the broader Juniper portfolio. I am very encouraged by the early customer interest in each of these transactions, which is building confidence these businesses will positively impact our performance in the future. 
We firmly believe we are taking share and that the deliberate actions we have taken, along with some of the investments we have made, should position us to not only capitalize on the big market opportunities, such as 400-gig and 5G that will unfold over the next few years but also to see broader market success that decreases our sensitivity to macro trends. We believe our plans will enable us to emerge from the pandemic stronger than we entered and deliver sustainable top and bottom line growth over the next several years even if end market conditions remain challenged. 
Now I'd like to provide some additional insights into the quarter and address some of the key developments we are seeing within each of our core market verticals. Starting with enterprise. We delivered record revenue in the December quarter and experienced high single-digit order growth year-over-year, which exceeded our own expectations. While we saw particularly strong demand in the North American market, strength was broad-based across geographies, and we secured a significant multiyear opportunity with an international Global 10 account for our wireless, wired and SD-WAN portfolio driven by our Mist AI differentiation. Based on our results, we believe we are taking share and that our enterprise business is likely to be our fastest growth vertical in 2021. 
Our optimism is fueled by the building customer response to our AI-driven enterprise offerings and specifically, the momentum we are seeing around Mist, which saw new logos grow by more than 125% year-over-year, and orders increased by nearly 140% year-over-year. 
In addition to robust wireless growth driven by Mist AI, we experienced strong adoption of our wired assurance capabilities and record pull-through of our EX switching portfolio. In total, our current mystified business of Mist wireless LAN, wired assurance, Marvis virtual network assistant and associated EX pull-through generated more than $150 million worth of revenue in 2020, and we expect to materially grow this business over the next few years. 
We would also remind you that Mist is a software subscription business with 30% to 35% of each deal recognized ratably, generating a healthy deferred revenue stream, which will be recognized in the future. 
The Mist technology is truly unique and delivers a compelling solution for AI-driven client-to-cloud operations. Not only does our solution minimize IT costs with proactive automation and self-driving action but it assures secure user experiences with end-to-end service levels and AI-driven support. This experience-first focus is resonating in the market and is one of the reasons Gartner recently positioned us in the leaders quadrant for wired and wireless access, where we were named the Leader of Leaders in terms of ability to execute. 
The acquisition of 128 Technology represents the next evolution of our AI-driven enterprise vision. 128 Technology will not only enable Juniper to provide a superior application and user aware SD-WAN experience as compared to all other SD-WAN offerings in the market, but also to extend the value of Mist's secure AI engine and cloud management capabilities from client to cloud. 
Our Service Provider segment also exceeded our expectations in Q4 and we have been encouraged to see this business begin to stabilize in 2020 following several difficult years. The improved Service Provider results we delivered, both in Q4 and  for the full year 2020, are due in large part to the deliberate diversification efforts we have undertaken, which has enabled us to overcome weak spending trends at several of our large U.S. Tier 1 customers. 
We believe the strength we are seeing with U.S. cable operators and international carriers is likely to continue through the upcoming year and we remain optimistic regarding our ability to capture more switching and security opportunities within the Service Provider vertical in addition to core and edge routing deployments. 
Not to be overlooked, we remain optimistic regarding the access/aggregation and metro routing opportunities, which, in aggregate, represent a $2 billion portion of the market that is growing and where Juniper historically hasn't played. We introduced our first product targeting this opportunity during the second half of this past year and plan to introduce additional solutions through the course of 2021. Early interest in our metro offerings is encouraging, and we believe the combination of these products with Netrounds software automation capabilities should present a compelling value proposition that enable us to win in this attractive portion of the market.
Based on our current pipeline, we remain confident in our ability to further stabilize our Service Provider business during the upcoming year, despite the ongoing challenges facing many of our customers in this vertical. 
Our cloud business also exceeded our expectations in Q4 and grew on a full year basis for a second consecutive year despite an anticipated decline in spending by what has historically been our largest cloud customer. We have been able to achieve this growth through improved momentum with other hyperscale accounts and continued success with our Tier 2 customers, which we plan to call cloud majors going forward. 
Our hyperscale pipeline remains healthy, and we continue to see strong wide-area momentum with these important customers, particularly for our routing solutions, which experienced strong growth from both a revenue and an orders perspective during the most recent quarter. While business with these customers is likely to remain lumpy, especially as old projects complete and new projects ramp up, the funnel of new high-value opportunities we have been seeing in this footprint continues to exceed the headwinds we also see from old projects completing. 
The value of our routing stack remains critical to these customers and some of the innovations we have been delivering in software around SONiC and containerized routing are opening up new use cases to expand our TAM and will further increase the value of our technology to this critical customer set. 
Importantly, we also remain optimistic regarding our potential to gain share with cloud majors, which we view as a large and growing market opportunity. Our potential here is not only driven by the strength of our portfolio, and Apstra will further enhance our position, but this is also an area where we see opportunities to diversify by gaining share within existing accounts and opening up new logos through an incremental go-to-market effort. Based on our current pipeline and the momentum we are seeing at both hyperscale and cloud majors, I expect us to grow our cloud business in 2021. 
Importantly, we are continuing to make progress on 400-gig and currently have more than 100 wins for our 400-gig capable products. While many of our wins are addressing wide-area use cases, where we have historically been strong, we're also seeing an increased level of success in data center switching opportunities. We continue to expand our 400-gig product set and deliver new features needed to gain share in this critical market opportunity. We believe we have the right product and customer engagement to both protect our wide-area footprint and capture switching share as the 400-gig cycle unfolds across our cloud and carrier customers starting later this year. 
On this last point, I'd like to spend a few minutes on Apstra, which has the potential to accelerate our success in the data center switching market, both within cloud majors and large enterprise accounts. Fabric management is a key determinant of success in many of these opportunities, and Apstra not only provides us with leadership here but also in the area of closed-loop assurance, which allows customers to quickly troubleshoot and remediate problems in large data center environments. 
We believe Apstra's capabilities are highly differentiated and offer customers the industry's best day 0, day 1 and day 2 automated operations. We think these capabilities have the potential to significantly improve customer experience and accelerate the momentum in our data center switching business, both in cloud majors as well as large enterprise environment. 
Our software business performed well in Q4 and accounted for 12% of our overall sales. As a company, we remain laser-focused on capturing more software and in particular, more SaaS and subscription based software. While high-value SaaS and subscription software are a smaller percentage of our overall software revenue stream today, they are growing rapidly, which is a trend we expect to continue over the next several years. This growth is primarily being driven by the strong adoption of our Mist Cloud as well as other software-based subscription offerings. The recent acquisitions of 128 Technology, Netrounds and Apstra will further accelerate our efforts to capture more software revenue in the years to come.  
I'd like to mention that our services team delivered another solid quarter and on a full year basis, 2020 was another year of service revenue growth due to strong renewals and attach rates as well as growth in our SaaS and software subscriptions. 
Our services team continues to execute extremely well and ensure our customers receive an excellent experience. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders. 
I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail."

Looking at our revenue by vertical. On a year-over-year basis, Enterprise posted a record quarter, growing 7% year-over-year and 14% sequentially. Cloud grew slightly year-over-year and increased 11% sequentially. Service Provider declined 4% year-over-year and was essentially flat sequentially. 
From a technology perspective, routing increased 9% year-over-year and grew 7% sequentially. Switching decreased 2% year-over-year and increased 14% sequentially. Security decreased 14% year-over-year and grew 19% sequentially. Our Services business decreased 1% year-over-year and increased 2% sequentially. Software revenue was approximately 12% of total revenue in the fourth quarter. 
Non-GAAP gross margin was 60.0% in the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. 
In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, 3 were Cloud, 6 were Service Provider and 1 was in Enterprise. Our top 10 customers account for 30% of our total revenue as compared to 33% in the fourth quarter of last year. 
Product deferred revenue was $105 million, up 5% sequentially and down 21% year-over-year due to the timing of the delivery of contractual commitments. Deferred revenue related to our software-as-a-service and software subscription offerings, which grew year-over-year, are included in our Services deferred revenue. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 2% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. The higher-than-anticipated costs were driven by higher variable compensation, mostly in the go-to-market organization, as a result of higher revenue as well as the acquisition of 128 Technology.  
 
Cash flow from operations was $126 million for the quarter, an increase both year-over-year and sequentially. We paid $66 million in dividends, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share. We also repurchased $75 million worth of shares. 
Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020 was $2.4 billion. I would like to point out that there was a timing difference between our new debt issuance and the full retirement of the previous debt which was completed in January. As a result of this timing difference, our total cash and debt balances are elevated by approximately $485 million and $425 million, respectively, as of year-end.  
 
Moving on to our full year results. Total revenue for 2020 was $4.445 billion, which was flat versus 2019. Our Enterprise business grew 3% for the year, despite the impact of the pandemic. This was our fourth consecutive year of full year growth in Enterprise. Our Cloud business grew 2% for the year, the second consecutive year of growth. Our Service Provider business began to stabilize and performed as expected, declining 4% for the full year.
Looking at our technologies, routing declined 1% and switching grew 2% and security declined 9% year-over-year. Our Services business grew 1%. Software was 10% of total revenue, the second year of software being at or above this level. 
In reviewing our top 10 customers for the year, 5 were Cloud, 4 were Service Provider and 1 was in Enterprise. 
Non-GAAP gross margin declined by 90 basis points in 2020, primarily due to the additional logistics and other supply chain-related costs related to COVID-19, partially offset by improvement in our Service gross margin. 
Throughout the year, we continue to focus on disciplined operating expense management with a modest increase of less than 1% on a non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue was 43.7%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.55 in 2020. 
For the year, we had cash flow from operations of $612 million, which increased $83 million compared to 2019. 
During 2020, we took a balanced approach to capital allocation. We repurchased $375 million worth of shares and paid $264 million in dividends for a total capital return of 125% of free cash flow to shareholders. In addition, we acquired 2 growth-oriented companies that we believe will help us return to sustainable revenue growth and margin expansion over time. We also improved our capital structure by refinancing a portion of our debt, locking in historically low long-term financing rates and extending our average maturity while preserving our investment-grade credit profile. I am proud of the strategic approach the team has taken to ensure our financial resilience through these challenging and uncertain times. 
Now I would like to provide some color on our guidance, which you can find details in the CFO commentary available on our Investor Relations website. At the midpoint of our revenue guidance, revenue is expected to be up 6% year-over-year, which includes less than $10 million from our recent acquisitions. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to experience normal seasonal patterns in the first quarter. Excluding the anticipated impact of increased COVID-related costs, non-GAAP gross margin would be approximately flat versus the first quarter of last year. 
We expect first quarter non-GAAP operating expense to increase sequentially, primarily due to the inclusion of approximately $20 million of operating expenses related to the recent acquisition as well as the annual reset of variable compensation and the typical seasonal increase in fringe costs, partially offset by a decline in commission expense. 
In addition, our first quarter non-GAAP EPS guidance includes the dilutive impact of the recent acquisitions. 
Before we move on to Q&A, I would like to provide some comments on our expectations for the full year 2021. Our 2021 revenue and non-GAAP earnings expectations remain unchanged relative to the forecast we provided during our Q3 2020 earnings call. However, we have updated our growth expectations to account for the revenue and the non-GAAP earnings upside that we experienced in Q4 2020 as compared to the midpoint of our guidance. We have also factored in the acquisition of Apstra, which is expected to be dilutive to our non-GAAP earnings during the first half of 2021, but be breakeven on a full year basis. 
In terms of full year revenue, we expect organic growth of approximately 2% to 3% and we anticipate an additional 1% of growth from the recent acquisitions. Beyond the first quarter, we expect revenue to grow sequentially each quarter in 2021. 
While non-GAAP gross margin can be difficult to predict, we expect full year gross margin of approximately 60% due to the higher volume, reduced COVID-related logistics costs and higher software mix as well as improved service costs. Through the course of the year, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to improve with volume. 
Non-GAAP operating expense is expected to remain near first quarter levels through the course of the year. The full year non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be approximately flat to 2020 levels. While we expect total non-GAAP operating expense to be up on a full year basis as we absorb our recent acquisition and invest to take advantage of market opportunities, we remain committed to disciplined expense management and expanding operating margin longer term. 
I'd also like to note that we expect non-GAAP other income and expense to remain near first quarter levels through the course of the year. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate on worldwide earnings is expected to be 19.5%, plus or minus 1%. We expect full year non-GAAP EPS to grow faster than revenue. 
Finally, our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share, to be paid this quarter to stockholders of record.  
 
In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success, especially in this challenging environment. Now I'd like to open the call for questions."

We do anticipate there being some cost coming back into the equation when people start to travel again, et cetera, perhaps in the second half.

Our organic innovation, our inorganic acquisitions have set us up to accelerate this part of our business. So despite the challenges that we saw in 2020 as a result of COVID, we grew this vertical, and we grew it nicely. I think we're taking share.  
I believe our technology and our differentiation has never been stronger. We've created not just market share growth and business growth, but mind share growth in the industry. And I think we've done so with an eye on doing it as efficiently as possible by focusing on the large enterprises. So a big component of our success comes from large Fortune 500, Global 1000 accounts, where the sales investment is as efficient as it can be for that enterprise.

I think that is an indication of the health of the footprint that we have retained in this extremely important vertical for us. We continue to see healthy diversification within cloud, both within the hyperscale cloud providers where we enjoy footprint across practically all of them, but also among the what we used to call Tier 2, Tier 3, which we're now calling cloud majors going forward, more and more market share in that area as well. I'd also think that there is a greater diversity of technologies that we're selling. So it's not just about routing, it's also about switching. It's also about security in this very important vertical. 
As I look out into 2021, I believe our footprint that we retain within the cloud space is going to work for us, right? We didn't anticipate any major additional share taking that's going to happen in 2021 to achieve the growth that we believe that we can achieve in '21.

So as just a couple of data points for you to give you an indication of just how well we're doing with Mist, our annualized order business for Mist stand-alone in Q4 exceeded $200 million. And if you include Mist wireless and wired, so this is EX that's sold really under the Mist automation framework, on a stand-alone annualized order basis, it's really around $300 million already. So the momentum has been really amazing. 
We're going to take the playbook that we implemented and getting our sellers very proficient in being able to position the Mist differentiation, the technology and apply that exact same playbook to the acquisitions that we've made last year, 128 and Apstra, in particular, which are mostly suited for the Enterprise but have applicability in other verticals as well. 
With 128, it is a really unique differentiated SD-WAN solution that fit beautifully under the Mist client-to-cloud vision, right, where you're extracting data insight telemetry from everything in the path between client to cloud and you're doing something really interesting with that data, which is to provide insights and improved automation and improved end-user experience for our customers. 
Apstra takes this experience-first networking approach that we know has worked so effectively in the campus, in client to cloud and applies it to the data center. So honestly, early interest in Apstra, although we just closed the deal yesterday, has been -- like exceeded our expectations at this point. The pipeline we're building, the interest in customers that want to understand the better together story has been extremely encouraging. 
And then the last acquisition is a little bit, a smaller one, which is Netrounds, and Netrounds has applicability to all verticals, but especially the Service Provider vertical, where we have an ability now to sell beyond just the box and connectivity between boxes, but an assured experience, assured SLAs to service providers, and we're also very pleased with the early interest from SPs in that technology as well."

Though Europe largely played out as expected from a revenue standpoint, Q4 probably exceeded our expectations by a bit. We enjoy very strong, healthy franchises with service providers around the world. 49 of the top 50 service providers worldwide our customers trust Juniper technology. 
We did see weakness in some of the largest Tier 1 service providers, especially here in North America. And I think for the reason that we all know, there has been a lot of capital expenditure that has been placed in spectrum auctions and so forth. So it diverted investments away from the areas of the network, the business that we are traditionally strong in. I don't expect that to be the case forever. 
If you look out into '21, and we've provided an outlook of further stabilization, i.e., even better results than we saw in 2020 in '21, we did not, in that outlook, anticipate a resumption that any significant resumption in spending by our large Tier 1 SP. If they do resume spending in the kind of IP technology that we develop and sell, then I think that would obviously benefit our business even more.  
 
The strength that we saw has to do with the diversification strategy that we have been executing on. So increased penetration in the cable space in this country, Tier 2 and Tier 3 service providers that are working very effectively for us and international service providers.

So financial services, higher education, so think here college campuses, U.S. federal government, large big-box type retailers, warehouses, these are all areas where investments in IT and networking must be made today. 
But as we look out beyond the pandemic, and you start to think about what happens when we recover from the pandemic, my strong belief is that there will be a pivot towards investments in IT technology that's going to be cloud delivered, AI-driven. It's not going to be the complex legacy on-prem traditional technologies that, quite frankly, are not important to Juniper, not a part of our strategy. It's the cloud-delivered technology that I think will actually see an acceleration as you get out of this COVID crisis. So my view is we've done what's necessary to capture share during the pandemic, and we're setting ourselves up with a strategy that's going to be geared to where investments are going to be greatest post pandemic."

As far as your question around appetite for spending, in those verticals that I just mentioned to Rod, financial services, campuses, higher education, federal government, large retailers, actually, the appetite for investments as measured by large projects is there. We've seen it. And we've won many opportunities based on the merits, the differentiation of our technology. 
And the last thing I would say is even in the, let's say, the smaller-type enterprises, let's say, mid-sized enterprises, where COVID is going to be more of a headwind, more of a factor to be considered in IT teams justifying projects, I would argue that we're living at a time now where differentiation matters most, right?

So first, I wouldn't say seasonality because it sort of indicates maybe some timing of orders that's based on which quarter of the year. And that's not necessarily what we're seeing. What we see within the Cloud vertical are really 2 dynamics. One of them is a natural evolution of the deployment of use cases. So there are always going to be older, more mature use cases that start to sort of diminish. They're reduced over time. But we're offsetting those older use cases with new use cases that we continue to win even within the same customer. So any cloud provider, especially hyperscale cloud provider is going to be deploying our technology in a number of different use cases. And that natural evolution of use cases has always been there. Some will decline and others will grow. 
The second factor within the Cloud vertical is diversity within or among customers, we're seeing really healthy diversity among our largest hyperscale cloud customers, and that offsets some of the puts and takes of use cases within each of the customers, and we're seeing strength in the cloud majors opportunity where there are many customers.

We've spent a fair amount of time talking to value-added resellers during the survey work and the like as well as talking to individual companies. And it seems quite clear that spending intention around security has ratcheted up quite significantly and that the overall IT budgets are also increasing quite meaningfully, which does not really put to your commentary about fairly soft conditions on spending, potentially improving once COVID is resolved. Have you had conversations with the C-suite types in the large accounts or even intermediate-size accounts that are recent enough to get a handle on whether SolarWinds had an impact on spending intentions?

First, I want to say, actually, what I mentioned was we anticipate enterprise spending to be healthy post COVID. So I actually think that there will be a resumption in spend and more tailwinds, an acceleration, if you will, of enterprise spending in many different use cases, especially the use cases that we as a company are focused on. 
Next, I want to say with respect to Juniper and impact of SolarWinds, we never put that SolarWinds product into any of our products that we sell our customers. And of course, once we heard of the news, we quickly scoured our own networks and looked for any exposures, and we didn't find that we were in any way exposed. So that I'll just get out of the way. 
In terms of has SolarWinds or how their security type incidents increased the appetite for IT leaders or CSOs, to focus on spending, especially in security, the answer is absolutely, yes. I mean there is a reason that I think it's very important that as a networking company, you also have security competence and you embed security as a forethought, not an afterthought in all of the solutions that you sell to address the use cases that are important to your business, that's never been more important. 
So our security business in Q4 did not grow, but there's a reason for this. The high end of our security, where we typically sell into large service providers, cloud providers, that tends to be lumpy. The broader part of our security portfolio is, really the strategy there is to embed it into our solutions. So we talked a lot about Mist. One element of our client-to-cloud Mist solution is that it's going to be secured by default with the technology that we have embedded in our -- the Mist solution portfolio. And for that reason, I'm actually quite optimistic about how these security trends and the appetite to invest in security by IT departments for our business."

In Q4, we saw double-digit routing growth in cloud providers and enterprises. Government and cable momentum was strong. MX and PTX grew both on a year-over-year and a sequential basis. So it does appear to be broad-based. 
The use cases today for us are mostly going to be in core routing and edge routing, some DCI data center interconnect. The thing that I'm really excited about when it comes to the opportunity is on our metro road map. The metro represents around a $2 billion routing opportunity today that's growing at a healthy clip. It's probably the fastest-growing routing submarket of the overall routing market, and it's largely untapped by Juniper. 
And the good news is this is just another high-performance networking -- network, but it requires certain capabilities, certain aspects of your products around footprint and power efficiency and certain types of features. These are all within our wheelhouse. And this is a road map that we're executing on. We've already introduced the first product to address it, but you can expect a number of new products that we introduce this year to complete our metro routing portfolio. Netrounds really fits beautifully into this solution because it really provides that automation and SLA assurance end-to-end that's important for the metro. So that, I believe, is going to help us in our routing business in '21, but especially in '22 when the portfolio is complete."

I hope you and your families are well and my thoughts go out to all those affected by the pandemic. 
2020 was an unprecedented year, which presented challenges that none of us could have predicted a year ago. The biggest being the emergence of the global pandemic. This event materially impacted our supply chain, the way we work and collaborate and how we engage with our customers around the world. The pandemic also impacted the health of our customers, employees and people close to us in our personal lives. 
Despite these challenges, we grew our enterprise business for a fourth consecutive year. We grew our cloud business for a second consecutive year, and we made progress stabilizing our Service Provider business, with orders in this vertical growing on a full year basis even though revenue declined. These results were made possible by the efforts of our employees who have executed exceptionally well, and I'd like to give a special thanks to all of them for not only enduring, but excelling in the face of adversity. We're proud to be one of the keepers of the global Internet, and the world needed the Internet in 2020 more than ever. 
We are exiting 2020 following 2 consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth and entering the new year with good momentum. This is a direct result of the strategic actions we have taken around how we go-to-market, how we align our business and how we complement our organic business with thoughtful acquisitions, such as Mist that create new revenue streams and pull-through sales of our existing products. 
While these actions should set us up to sustainably grow our business starting this year, I'd like to highlight several key areas of strategic focus where we plan to double down in the new year, which you'll hear us talk more about during our upcoming Investor Day event on February 12. 
First, delivering industry-leading customer experiences through superior technology, engagement, quality and support. While we're entering 2021 with the highest customer satisfaction scores we have ever seen, we view customer experience as our true north and are committed to doing even better. We think delivering superior customer outcomes will enable us to win across all of the markets and verticals we serve. 
Second, focusing our business on specific use cases, which include the AI-driven enterprise, cloud-ready data centers and automated WAN with connected security embedded in each. These use cases each represent a large opportunity that spans across verticals we serve. Each of these use cases is likely to see attractive market tailwinds over the next several years and focusing our resources on these areas should enable us to accelerate our growth as these opportunities unfold. 
As I discussed last quarter, we have reorganized our sales, product management and engineering teams around these business opportunities, and we will begin disclosing our revenue mix in this format when we report our Q1 results. 
Third, capturing the value presented by our recent acquisition and making sure 128 Technology, Apstra and Netrounds deliver similar returns on investment to what we are seeing with Mist, which continues to exceed expectations and is positively impacting sales of the broader Juniper portfolio. I am very encouraged by the early customer interest in each of these transactions, which is building confidence these businesses will positively impact our performance in the future. 
We firmly believe we are taking share and that the deliberate actions we have taken, along with some of the investments we have made, should position us to not only capitalize on the big market opportunities, such as 400-gig and 5G that will unfold over the next few years but also to see broader market success that decreases our sensitivity to macro trends. We believe our plans will enable us to emerge from the pandemic stronger than we entered and deliver sustainable top and bottom line growth over the next several years even if end-market conditions remain challenged. 
Now I'd like to provide some additional insights into the quarter and address some of the key developments we are seeing within each of our core market verticals. Starting with enterprise. We delivered record revenue in the December quarter and experienced high single-digit order growth year-over-year, which exceeded our own expectations. While we saw particularly strong demand in the North American market, strength was broad-based across geographies, and we secured a significant multiyear opportunity with an international Global 10 account for our wireless, wired and SD-WAN portfolio driven by our Mist AI differentiation. Based on our results, we believe we are taking share and that our enterprise business is likely to be our fastest growth vertical in 2021. 
Our optimism is fueled by the building customer response to our AI-driven enterprise offerings and specifically, the momentum we are seeing around Mist, which saw new logos grow by more than 125% year-over-year, and orders increased by nearly 140% year-over-year. 
In addition to robust wireless growth driven by Mist AI, we experienced strong adoption of our wired assurance capabilities and record pull-through of our EX switching portfolio. In total, our current mystified business of Mist wireless LAN, wired assurance, Marvis virtual network assistant and associated EX pull-through generated more than $150 million worth of revenue in 2020, and we expect to materially grow this business over the next few years. 
We would also remind you that Mist is a software subscription business with 30% to 35% of each deal recognized ratably, generating a healthy deferred revenue stream, which will be recognized in the future. 
The Mist technology is truly unique and delivers a compelling solution for AI-driven client-to-cloud operations. Not only does our solution minimize IT costs with proactive automation and self-driving action but it assures secure user experiences with end-to-end service levels and AI-driven support. This experience-first focus is resonating in the market and is one of the reasons Gartner recently positioned us in the leaders quadrant for wired and wireless access, where we were named the Leader of Leaders in terms of ability to execute. 
The acquisition of 128 Technology represents the next evolution of our AI-driven enterprise vision. 128 Technology will not only enable Juniper to provide a superior application and user aware SD-WAN experience as compared to all other SD-WAN offerings in the market but also to extend the value of Mist's secure AI engine and cloud management capabilities from client to cloud. 
Our Service Provider segment also exceeded our expectations in Q4 and we have been encouraged to see this business begin to stabilize in 2020 following several difficult years. The improved Service Provider results we delivered, both in Q4 and for the full year 2020, are due in large part to the deliberate diversification efforts we have undertaken, which has enabled us to overcome weak spending trends at several of our large U.S. Tier 1 customers. 
We believe the strength we are seeing with U.S. cable operators and international carriers is likely to continue through the upcoming year and we remain optimistic regarding our ability to capture more switching and security opportunities within the Service Provider vertical in addition to core and edge routing deployments. 
Not to be overlooked, we remain optimistic regarding the access/aggregation and metro routing opportunities, which, in aggregate, represent a $2 billion portion of the market that is growing and where Juniper historically hasn't played. We introduced our first product targeting this opportunity during the second half of this past year and plan to introduce additional solutions through the course of 2021. Early interest in our metro offerings is encouraging, and we believe the combination of these products with Netrounds software automation capabilities should present a compelling value proposition that enable us to win in this attractive portion of the market.
Based on our current pipeline, we remain confident in our ability to further stabilize our Service Provider business during the upcoming year, despite the ongoing challenges facing many of our customers in this vertical. 
Our cloud business also exceeded our expectations in Q4 and grew on a full year basis for a second consecutive year despite an anticipated decline in spending by what has historically been our largest cloud customer. We have been able to achieve this growth through improved momentum with other hyperscale accounts and continued success with our Tier 2 customers, which we plan to call cloud majors going forward. 
Our hyperscale pipeline remains healthy, and we continue to see strong wide-area momentum with these important customers, particularly for our routing solutions, which experienced strong growth from both a revenue and an orders perspective during the most recent quarter. While business with these customers is likely to remain lumpy, especially as old projects complete and new projects ramp up, the funnel of new high-value opportunities we have been seeing in this footprint continues to exceed the headwinds we also see from old projects completing. 
The value of our routing stack remains critical to these customers and some of the innovations we have been delivering in software around SONiC and containerized routing are opening up new use cases to expand our TAM and will further increase the value of our technology to this critical customer set. 
Importantly, we also remain optimistic regarding our potential to gain share with cloud majors, which we view as a large and growing market opportunity. Our potential here is not only driven by the strength of our portfolio, and Apstra will further enhance our position, but this is also an area where we see opportunities to diversify by gaining share within existing accounts and opening up new logos through an incremental go-to-market effort. Based on our current pipeline and the momentum we are seeing at both hyperscale and cloud majors, I expect us to grow our cloud business in 2021. 
Importantly, we are continuing to make progress on 400-gig and currently have more than 100 wins for our 400-gig capable products. While many of our wins are addressing wide-area use cases, where we have historically been strong, we're also seeing an increased level of success in data center switching opportunities. We continue to expand our 400-gig product set and deliver new features needed to gain share in this critical market opportunity. We believe we have the right product and customer engagement to both protect our wide-area footprint and capture switching share as the 400-gig cycle unfolds across our cloud and carrier customers starting later this year. 
On this last point, I'd like to spend a few minutes on Apstra, which has the potential to accelerate our success in the data center switching market, both within cloud majors and large enterprise accounts. Fabric management is a key determinant of success in many of these opportunities, and Apstra not only provides us with leadership here but also in the area of closed-loop assurance, which allows customers to quickly troubleshoot and remediate problems in large data center environments. 
We believe Apstra's capabilities are highly differentiated and offer customers the industry's best day 0, day 1 and day 2 automated operations. We think these capabilities have the potential to significantly improve customer experience and accelerate the momentum in our data center switching business, both in cloud majors as well as large enterprise environment. 
Our software business performed well in Q4 and accounted for 12% of our overall sales. As a company, we remain laser-focused on capturing more software and in particular, more SaaS and subscription-based software. While high-value SaaS and subscription software are a smaller percentage of our overall software revenue stream today, they are growing rapidly, which is a trend we expect to continue over the next several years. This growth is primarily being driven by the strong adoption of our Mist Cloud as well as other software-based subscription offerings. The recent acquisitions of 128 Technology, Netrounds and Apstra will further accelerate our efforts to capture more software revenue in the years to come.  
I'd like to mention that our services team delivered another solid quarter and on a full year basis, 2020 was another year of service revenue growth due to strong renewals and attach rates as well as growth in our SaaS and software subscriptions. 
Our services team continues to execute extremely well and ensure our customers receive an excellent experience. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders. 
I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail."

I will start by discussing our fourth quarter results and then cover the fiscal year 2020 and end with some color on our outlook. We ended the fourth quarter of 2020 at $1.223 billion in revenue and non-GAA",1297,"Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start by discussing our fourth quarter results and then cover the fiscal year 2020 and end with some color on our outlook. 
We ended the fourth quarter of 2020 at $1.223 billion in revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.55, both above the midpoint of guidance. Revenue grew 1%, which was the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. The higher than midpoint results were driven by strength across all verticals. 
Looking at our revenue by vertical. On a year-over-year basis, Enterprise posted a record quarter, growing 7% year-over-year and 14% sequentially. Cloud grew slightly year-over-year and increased 11% sequentially. Service Provider declined 4% year-over-year and was essentially flat sequentially. 
From a technology perspective, routing increased 9% year-over-year and grew 7% sequentially. Switching decreased 2% year-over-year and increased 14% sequentially. Security decreased 14% year-over-year and grew 19% sequentially. Our Services business decreased 1% year-over-year and increased 2% sequentially. Software revenue was approximately 12% of total revenue in the fourth quarter. 
Non-GAAP gross margin was 60.0% in the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. 
In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, 3 were Cloud, 6 were Service Provider and 1 was in Enterprise. Our top 10 customers account for 30% of our total revenue as compared to 33% in the fourth quarter of last year. 
Product deferred revenue was $105 million, up 5% sequentially and down 21% year-over-year due to the timing of the delivery of contractual commitments. Deferred revenue related to our software-as-a-service and software subscription offerings, which grew year-over-year, are included in our Services deferred revenue. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 2% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. The higher-than-anticipated costs were driven by higher variable compensation, mostly in the go-to-market organization, as a result of higher revenue as well as the acquisition of 128 Technology.  
 
Cash flow from operations was $126 million for the quarter, an increase both year-over-year and sequentially. We paid $66 million in dividends, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share. We also repurchased $75 million worth of shares. 
Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020 was $2.4 billion. I would like to point out that there was a timing difference between our new debt issuance and the full retirement of the previous debt which was completed in January. As a result of this timing difference, our total cash and debt balances are elevated by approximately $485 million and $425 million, respectively, as of year-end.  
 
Moving on to our full year results. Total revenue for 2020 was $4.445 billion, which was flat versus 2019. Our Enterprise business grew 3% for the year, despite the impact of the pandemic. This was our fourth consecutive year of full year growth in Enterprise. Our Cloud business grew 2% for the year, the second consecutive year of growth. Our Service Provider business began to stabilize and performed as expected, declining 4% for the full year.
Looking at our technologies, routing declined 1% and switching grew 2% and security declined 9% year-over-year. Our Services business grew 1%. Software was 10% of total revenue, the second year of software being at or above this level. 
In reviewing our top 10 customers for the year, 5 were Cloud, 4 were Service Provider and 1 was in Enterprise. 
Non-GAAP gross margin declined by 90 basis points in 2020, primarily due to the additional logistics and other supply chain-related costs related to COVID-19, partially offset by improvement in our Service gross margin. 
Throughout the year, we continue to focus on disciplined operating expense management with a modest increase of less than 1% on a non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue was 43.7%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.55 in 2020. 
For the year, we had cash flow from operations of $612 million, which increased $83 million compared to 2019. 
During 2020, we took a balanced approach to capital allocation. We repurchased $375 million worth of shares and paid $264 million in dividends for a total capital return of 125% of free cash flow to shareholders. In addition, we acquired 2 growth-oriented companies that we believe will help us return to sustainable revenue growth and margin expansion over time. We also improved our capital structure by refinancing a portion of our debt, locking in historically low long-term financing rates and extending our average maturity while preserving our investment-grade credit profile. I am proud of the strategic approach the team has taken to ensure our financial resilience through these challenging and uncertain times. 
Now I would like to provide some color on our guidance, which you can find details in the CFO commentary available on our Investor Relations website. At the midpoint of our revenue guidance, revenue is expected to be up 6% year-over-year, which includes less than $10 million from our recent acquisitions. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to experience normal seasonal patterns in the first quarter. Excluding the anticipated impact of increased COVID-related costs, non-GAAP gross margin would be approximately flat versus the first quarter of last year. 
We expect first quarter non-GAAP operating expense to increase sequentially, primarily due to the inclusion of approximately $20 million of operating expenses related to the recent acquisition as well as the annual reset of variable compensation and the typical seasonal increase in fringe costs, partially offset by a decline in commission expense. 
In addition, our first quarter non-GAAP EPS guidance includes the dilutive impact of the recent acquisitions. 
Before we move on to Q&A, I would like to provide some comments on our expectations for the full year 2021. Our 2021 revenue and non-GAAP earnings expectations remain unchanged relative to the forecast we provided during our Q3 2020 earnings call. However, we have updated our growth expectations to account for the revenue and the non-GAAP earnings upside that we experienced in Q4 2020 as compared to the midpoint of our guidance. We have also factored in the acquisition of Apstra, which is expected to be dilutive to our non-GAAP earnings during the first half of 2021, but be breakeven on a full year basis. 
In terms of full year revenue, we expect organic growth of approximately 2% to 3% and we anticipate an additional 1% of growth from the recent acquisitions. Beyond the first quarter, we expect revenue to grow sequentially each quarter in 2021. 
While non-GAAP gross margin can be difficult to predict, we expect full year gross margin of approximately 60% due to the higher volume, reduced COVID-related logistics costs and higher software mix as well as improved service costs. Through the course of the year, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to improve with volume. 
Non-GAAP operating expense is expected to remain near first quarter levels through the course of the year. The full year non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be approximately flat to 2020 levels. While we expect total non-GAAP operating expense to be up on a full year basis as we absorb our recent acquisition and invest to take advantage of market opportunities, we remain committed to disciplined expense management and expanding operating margin longer term. 
I'd also like to note that we expect non-GAAP other income and expense to remain near first quarter levels through the course of the year. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate on worldwide earnings is expected to be 19.5%, plus or minus 1%. We expect full year non-GAAP EPS to grow faster than revenue. 
Finally, our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share, to be paid this quarter to stockholders of record.  
 
In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success, especially in this challenging environment. Now I'd like to open the call for questions."

So despite the challenges that we saw in 2020 as a result of COVID, we grew this vertical, and we grew it nicely. I think we're taking share.  
I believe our technology and our differentiation has never been stronger. We've created not just market share growth and business growth, but mind share growth in the industry. And I think we've done so with an eye on doing it as efficiently as possible by focusing on the large enterprises.

So we clearly did experience some pretty significant supply constraints in the peak of kind of the COVID pandemic, if you will, kind of in the summer months. We've had material improvement since then. I would articulate that as we exited the year, we're pretty much back to normal. We might have some elevated lead times here and there, but that's more due to demand being beyond our expectation and then true supply constraints. I'm very pleased with how the team has really adapted and improved the supply as we proceed.  
That said, backlog is higher. We're exiting the year with about 20% more backlog than we entered. So we are maintaining healthy backlog as we move into this year 2021 and really, the supply constraints, extended lead times, et cetera, that we saw through most of the summer months are largely behind us at this point. I don't believe we're at a competitive disadvantage. Our team does a great job with components manufacturing and component suppliers to negotiate the supply that we need."

We have not lost share or footprint in cloud routing today, I mean, in cloud period, I should say. We saw our routing up double-digit year-over-year in the Q4 time frame. I think that is an indication of the health of the footprint that we have retained in this extremely important vertical for us. We continue to see healthy diversification within cloud, both within the hyperscale cloud providers where we enjoy footprint across practically all of them, but also among the -- what we used to call Tier 2, Tier 3, which we're now calling cloud majors going forward, more and more market share in that area as well. I'd also think that there is a greater diversity of technologies that we're selling. So it's not just about routing, it's also about switching. It's also about security in this very important vertical. 
As I look out into 2021, I believe our footprint that we retain within the cloud space is going to work for us, right? We didn't anticipate any major additional share taking that's going to happen in 2021 to achieve the growth that we believe that we can achieve in '21. But I do think that with the right focus in go-to-market, the technology that I know we have, that I know is very competitive, we can, in fact, take some additional share as well in this vertical."

So as just a couple of data points for you to give you an indication of just how well we're doing with Mist, our annualized order business for Mist stand-alone in Q4 exceeded $200 million. And if you include Mist wireless and wired, so this is EX that's sold really under the Mist automation framework, on a stand-alone annualized order basis, it's really around $300 million already. So the momentum has been really amazing. 
We're going to take the playbook that we implemented and getting our sellers very proficient in being able to position the Mist differentiation, the technology and apply that exact same playbook to the acquisitions that we've made last year, 128 and Apstra, in particular, which are mostly suited for the Enterprise but have applicability in other verticals as well. 
With 128, it is a really unique differentiated SD-WAN solution that fit beautifully under the Mist client-to-cloud vision, right, where you're extracting data insight telemetry from everything in the path between client to cloud and you're doing something really interesting with that data, which is to provide insights and improved automation and improved end-user experience for our customers. 
Apstra takes this experience-first networking approach that we know has worked so effectively in the campus, in client to cloud and applies it to the data center. So honestly, early interest in Apstra, although we just closed the deal yesterday, has been -- like exceeded our expectations at this point. The pipeline we're building, the interest in customers that want to understand the better together story has been extremely encouraging. 
And then the last acquisition is a little bit, a smaller one, which is Netrounds, and Netrounds has applicability to all verticals, but especially the Service Provider vertical, where we have an ability now to sell beyond just the box and connectivity between boxes, but an assured experience, assured SLAs to service providers, and we're also very pleased with the early interest from SPs in that technology as well."

So really leveraging our installed base with the growth asset of Mist is very much part of the strategy to accelerate the Mist growth, but also a good percentage of those customers are net new to Juniper. So really, there is a land-and-expand opportunity where we might leave with the Mist and the Mist AI engine then expand to the rest of the portfolio.

Though Europe largely played out as expected from a revenue standpoint, Q4 probably exceeded our expectations by a bit. We enjoy very strong, healthy franchises with service providers around the world. 49 of the top 50 service providers worldwide our customers trust Juniper technology. 
We did see weakness in some of the largest Tier 1 service providers, especially here in North America. And I think for the reason that we all know, there has been a lot of capital expenditure that has been placed in spectrum auctions and so forth. So it diverted investments away from the areas of the network, the business that we are traditionally strong in. I don't expect that to be the case forever. 
If you look out into '21, and we've provided an outlook of further stabilization, i.e., even better results than we saw in 2020 in '21, we did not, in that outlook, anticipate a resumption that any significant resumption in spending by our large Tier 1 SP. If they do resume spending in the kind of IP technology that we develop and sell, then I think that would obviously benefit our business even more.  
 
The strength that we saw has to do with the diversification strategy that we have been executing on. So increased penetration in the cable space in this country, Tier 2 and Tier 3 service providers that are working very effectively for us and international service providers. You'll notice that we had a very healthy quarter in Asia Pacific. I'm very proud of the team in APAC for really showing results, not just in SP, but across all verticals, and that's just an indication of the kind of diversification we're driving through our business."

As far as your question around appetite for spending, in those verticals that I just mentioned to Rod, financial services, campuses, higher education, federal government, large retailers, actually, the appetite for investments as measured by large projects is there. We've seen it. And we've won many opportunities based on the merits, the differentiation of our technology.

You mentioned that you are completing some projects, and then you're seeing the commencement of other projects. I just want to get an idea on some of the seasonality or just the timing of some of these. Are we seeing things kind of wind down right now, which means that things could be kind of slow for a quarter or 2 in the Cloud segment and then could they potentially ramp back up very quickly to the back half of 2021? Is there anything we should be expecting as kind of like the lumpiness in 2021 Cloud revenue?"

What we see within the Cloud v",215,"Yes. Yes, I'm happy to answer that, Sami. So first, I wouldn't say seasonality because it sort of indicates maybe some timing of orders that's based on which quarter of the year. And that's not necessarily what we're seeing. What we see within the Cloud vertical are really 2 dynamics. One of them is a natural evolution of the deployment of use cases. So there are always going to be older, more mature use cases that start to sort of diminish. They're reduced over time. But we're offsetting those older use cases with new use cases that we continue to win even within the same customer. So any cloud provider, especially hyperscale cloud provider is going to be deploying our technology in a number of different use cases. And that natural evolution of use cases has always been there. Some will decline and others will grow. 
The second factor within the Cloud vertical is diversity within or among customers, we're seeing really healthy diversity among our largest hyperscale cloud customers, and that offsets some of the puts and takes of use cases within each of the customers, and we're seeing strength in the cloud majors opportunity where there are many customers. So that naturally is going to be a more diverse element of our business."

We've spent a fair amount of time talking to value-added resellers during the survey work and the like as well as talking to individual companies. And it seems quite clear that spending intention around security has ratcheted up quite significantly and that the overall IT budgets are also increasing quite meaningfully, which does not really put to your commentary about fairly soft conditions on spending, potentially improving once COVID is resolved. Have you had conversations with the C-suite types in the large accounts or even intermediate-size accounts that are recent enough to get a handle on whether SolarWinds had an impact on spending intentions?

First, I want to say, actually, what I mentioned was we anticipate enterprise spending to be healthy post COVID. So I actually think that there will be a resumption in spend and more tailwinds, an acceleration, if you will, of enterprise spending in many different use cases, especially the use cases that we as a company are focused on. 
Next, I want to say with respect to Juniper and impact of SolarWinds, we never put that SolarWinds product into any of our products that we sell our customers. And of course, once we heard of the news, we quickly scoured our own networks and looked for any exposures, and we didn't find that we were in any way exposed. So that I'll just get out of the way. 
In terms of has SolarWinds or how their security-type incidents increased the appetite for IT leaders or CSOs, to focus on spending, especially in security, the answer is absolutely, yes. I mean there is a reason that I think it's very important that as a networking company, you also have security competence and you embed security as a forethought, not an afterthought in all of the solutions that you sell to address the use cases that are important to your business, that's never been more important. 
So our security business in Q4 did not grow, but there's a reason for this. The high end of our security, where we typically sell into large service providers, cloud providers, that tends to be lumpy. The broader part of our security portfolio is, really the strategy there is to embed it into our solutions. So we talked a lot about Mist. One element of our client-to-cloud Mist solution is that it's going to be secured by default with the technology that we have embedded in our -- the Mist solution portfolio. And for that reason, I'm actually quite optimistic about how these security trends and the appetite to invest in security by IT departments for our business."

In Q4, we saw double-digit routing growth in cloud providers and enterprises. Government and cable momentum was strong. MX and PTX grew both on a year-over-year and a sequential basis. So it does appear to be broad-based. 
The use cases today for us are mostly going to be in core routing and edge routing, some DCI data center interconnect. The thing that I'm really excited about when it comes to the opportunity is on our metro road map. The metro represents around a $2 billion routing opportunity today that's growing at a healthy clip. It's probably the fastest-growing routing submarket of the overall routing market, and it's largely untapped by Juniper. 
And the good news is this is just another high-performance networking -- network, but it requires certain capabilities, certain aspects of your products around footprint and power efficiency and certain types of features. These are all within our wheelhouse. And this is a road map that we're executing on. We've already introduced the first product to address it, but you can expect a number of new products that we introduce this year to complete our metro routing portfolio. Netrounds really fits beautifully into this solution because it really provides that automation and SLA assurance end-to-end that's important for the metro. So that, I believe, is going to help us in our routing business in '21, but especially in '22 when the portfolio is complete."

I hope you and your families are well and my thoughts go out to all those affected by the pandemic. 2020 was an unprecedented year, whic",2113,"Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss our Q4 and full year 2020 results. I hope you and your families are well and my thoughts go out to all those affected by the pandemic. 
2020 was an unprecedented year, which presented challenges that none of us could have predicted a year ago. The biggest being the emergence of the global pandemic. This event materially impacted our supply chain, the way we work and collaborate and how we engage with our customers around the world. The pandemic also impacted the health of our customers, employees and people close to us in our personal lives. 
Despite these challenges, we grew our enterprise business for a fourth consecutive year. We grew our cloud business for a second consecutive year, and we made progress stabilizing our Service Provider business, with orders in this vertical growing on a full year basis even though revenue declined. These results were made possible by the efforts of our employees who have executed exceptionally well, and I'd like to give a special thanks to all of them for not only enduring, but excelling in the face of adversity. We're proud to be one of the keepers of the global Internet, and the world needed the Internet in 2020 more than ever. 
We are exiting 2020 following 2 consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth and entering the new year with good momentum. This is a direct result of the strategic actions we have taken around how we go-to-market, how we align our business and how we complement our organic business with thoughtful acquisitions, such as Mist that create new revenue streams and pull-through sales of our existing products. 
While these actions should set us up to sustainably grow our business starting this year, I'd like to highlight several key areas of strategic focus where we plan to double down in the new year, which you'll hear us talk more about during our upcoming Investor Day event on February 12. 
First, delivering industry-leading customer experiences through superior technology, engagement, quality and support. While we're entering 2021 with the highest customer satisfaction scores we have ever seen, we view customer experience as our true north and are committed to doing even better. We think delivering superior customer outcomes will enable us to win across all of the markets and verticals we serve. 
Second, focusing our business on specific use cases, which include the AI-driven enterprise, cloud-ready data centers and automated WAN with connected security embedded in each. These use cases each represent a large opportunity that spans across verticals we serve. Each of these use cases is likely to see attractive market tailwinds over the next several years and focusing our resources on these areas should enable us to accelerate our growth as these opportunities unfold. 
As I discussed last quarter, we have reorganized our sales, product management and engineering teams around these business opportunities, and we will begin disclosing our revenue mix in this format when we report our Q1 results. 
Third, capturing the value presented by our recent acquisition and making sure 128 Technology, Apstra and Netrounds deliver similar returns on investment to what we are seeing with Mist, which continues to exceed expectations and is positively impacting sales of the broader Juniper portfolio. I am very encouraged by the early customer interest in each of these transactions, which is building confidence these businesses will positively impact our performance in the future. 
We firmly believe we are taking share and that the deliberate actions we have taken, along with some of the investments we have made, should position us to not only capitalize on the big market opportunities, such as 400-gig and 5G that will unfold over the next few years but also to see broader market success that decreases our sensitivity to macro trends. We believe our plans will enable us to emerge from the pandemic stronger than we entered and deliver sustainable top and bottom line growth over the next several years even if end-market conditions remain challenged. 
Now I'd like to provide some additional insights into the quarter and address some of the key developments we are seeing within each of our core market verticals. Starting with enterprise. We delivered record revenue in the December quarter and experienced high single-digit order growth year-over-year, which exceeded our own expectations. While we saw particularly strong demand in the North American market, strength was broad-based across geographies, and we secured a significant multiyear opportunity with an international Global 10 account for our wireless, wired and SD-WAN portfolio driven by our Mist AI differentiation. Based on our results, we believe we are taking share and that our enterprise business is likely to be our fastest growth vertical in 2021. 
Our optimism is fueled by the building customer response to our AI-driven enterprise offerings and specifically, the momentum we are seeing around Mist, which saw new logos grow by more than 125% year-over-year, and orders increased by nearly 140% year-over-year. 
In addition to robust wireless growth driven by Mist AI, we experienced strong adoption of our wired assurance capabilities and record pull-through of our EX switching portfolio. In total, our current mystified business of Mist wireless LAN, wired assurance, Marvis virtual network assistant and associated EX pull-through generated more than $150 million worth of revenue in 2020, and we expect to materially grow this business over the next few years. 
We would also remind you that Mist is a software subscription business with 30% to 35% of each deal recognized ratably, generating a healthy deferred revenue stream, which will be recognized in the future. 
The Mist technology is truly unique and delivers a compelling solution for AI-driven client-to-cloud operations. Not only does our solution minimize IT costs with proactive automation and self-driving action but it assures secure user experiences with end-to-end service levels and AI-driven support. This experience-first focus is resonating in the market and is one of the reasons Gartner recently positioned us in the leaders quadrant for wired and wireless access, where we were named the Leader of Leaders in terms of ability to execute. 
The acquisition of 128 Technology represents the next evolution of our AI-driven enterprise vision. 128 Technology will not only enable Juniper to provide a superior application and user aware SD-WAN experience as compared to all other SD-WAN offerings in the market but also to extend the value of Mist's secure AI engine and cloud management capabilities from client to cloud. 
Our Service Provider segment also exceeded our expectations in Q4 and we have been encouraged to see this business begin to stabilize in 2020 following several difficult years. The improved Service Provider results we delivered, both in Q4 and for the full year 2020, are due in large part to the deliberate diversification efforts we have undertaken, which has enabled us to overcome weak spending trends at several of our large U.S. Tier 1 customers. 
We believe the strength we are seeing with U.S. cable operators and international carriers is likely to continue through the upcoming year and we remain optimistic regarding our ability to capture more switching and security opportunities within the Service Provider vertical in addition to core and edge routing deployments. 
Not to be overlooked, we remain optimistic regarding the access/aggregation and metro routing opportunities, which, in aggregate, represent a $2 billion portion of the market that is growing and where Juniper historically hasn't played. We introduced our first product targeting this opportunity during the second half of this past year and plan to introduce additional solutions through the course of 2021. Early interest in our metro offerings is encouraging, and we believe the combination of these products with Netrounds software automation capabilities should present a compelling value proposition that enable us to win in this attractive portion of the market.
Based on our current pipeline, we remain confident in our ability to further stabilize our Service Provider business during the upcoming year, despite the ongoing challenges facing many of our customers in this vertical. 
Our cloud business also exceeded our expectations in Q4 and grew on a full year basis for a second consecutive year despite an anticipated decline in spending by what has historically been our largest cloud customer. We have been able to achieve this growth through improved momentum with other hyperscale accounts and continued success with our Tier 2 customers, which we plan to call cloud majors going forward. 
Our hyperscale pipeline remains healthy, and we continue to see strong wide-area momentum with these important customers, particularly for our routing solutions, which experienced strong growth from both a revenue and an orders perspective during the most recent quarter. While business with these customers is likely to remain lumpy, especially as old projects complete and new projects ramp up, the funnel of new high-value opportunities we have been seeing in this footprint continues to exceed the headwinds we also see from old projects completing. 
The value of our routing stack remains critical to these customers and some of the innovations we have been delivering in software around SONiC and containerized routing are opening up new use cases to expand our TAM and will further increase the value of our technology to this critical customer set. 
Importantly, we also remain optimistic regarding our potential to gain share with cloud majors, which we view as a large and growing market opportunity. Our potential here is not only driven by the strength of our portfolio, and Apstra will further enhance our position, but this is also an area where we see opportunities to diversify by gaining share within existing accounts and opening up new logos through an incremental go-to-market effort. Based on our current pipeline and the momentum we are seeing at both hyperscale and cloud majors, I expect us to grow our cloud business in 2021. 
Importantly, we are continuing to make progress on 400-gig and currently have more than 100 wins for our 400-gig capable products. While many of our wins are addressing wide-area use cases, where we have historically been strong, we're also seeing an increased level of success in data center switching opportunities. We continue to expand our 400-gig product set and deliver new features needed to gain share in this critical market opportunity. We believe we have the right product and customer engagement to both protect our wide-area footprint and capture switching share as the 400-gig cycle unfolds across our cloud and carrier customers starting later this year. 
On this last point, I'd like to spend a few minutes on Apstra, which has the potential to accelerate our success in the data center switching market, both within cloud majors and large enterprise accounts. Fabric management is a key determinant of success in many of these opportunities, and Apstra not only provides us with leadership here but also in the area of closed-loop assurance, which allows customers to quickly troubleshoot and remediate problems in large data center environments. 
We believe Apstra's capabilities are highly differentiated and offer customers the industry's best day 0, day 1 and day 2 automated operations. We think these capabilities have the potential to significantly improve customer experience and accelerate the momentum in our data center switching business, both in cloud majors as well as large enterprise environment. 
Our software business performed well in Q4 and accounted for 12% of our overall sales. As a company, we remain laser-focused on capturing more software and in particular, more SaaS and subscription-based software. While high-value SaaS and subscription software are a smaller percentage of our overall software revenue stream today, they are growing rapidly, which is a trend we expect to continue over the next several years. This growth is primarily being driven by the strong adoption of our Mist Cloud as well as other software-based subscription offerings. The recent acquisitions of 128 Technology, Netrounds and Apstra will further accelerate our efforts to capture more software revenue in the years to come.  
I'd like to mention that our services team delivered another solid quarter and on a full year basis, 2020 was another year of service revenue growth due to strong renewals and attach rates as well as growth in our SaaS and software subscriptions. 
Our services team continues to execute extremely well and ensure our customers receive an excellent experience. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders. 
I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail."

I will start by discussing our fourth quarter results and then cover the fiscal year 2020 and end with some color on our outlook. We ended the fourth quarter of 2020 at $1.223 billion in revenue and non-GAA",1297,"Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start by discussing our fourth quarter results and then cover the fiscal year 2020 and end with some color on our outlook. 
We ended the fourth quarter of 2020 at $1.223 billion in revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.55, both above the midpoint of guidance. Revenue grew 1%, which was the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. The higher than midpoint results were driven by strength across all verticals. 
Looking at our revenue by vertical. On a year-over-year basis, Enterprise posted a record quarter, growing 7% year-over-year and 14% sequentially. Cloud grew slightly year-over-year and increased 11% sequentially. Service Provider declined 4% year-over-year and was essentially flat sequentially. 
From a technology perspective, routing increased 9% year-over-year and grew 7% sequentially. Switching decreased 2% year-over-year and increased 14% sequentially. Security decreased 14% year-over-year and grew 19% sequentially. Our Services business decreased 1% year-over-year and increased 2% sequentially. Software revenue was approximately 12% of total revenue in the fourth quarter. 
Non-GAAP gross margin was 60.0% in the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. 
In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, 3 were Cloud, 6 were Service Provider and 1 was in Enterprise. Our top 10 customers account for 30% of our total revenue as compared to 33% in the fourth quarter of last year. 
Product deferred revenue was $105 million, up 5% sequentially and down 21% year-over-year due to the timing of the delivery of contractual commitments. Deferred revenue related to our software-as-a-service and software subscription offerings, which grew year-over-year, are included in our Services deferred revenue. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 2% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. The higher-than-anticipated costs were driven by higher variable compensation, mostly in the go-to-market organization, as a result of higher revenue as well as the acquisition of 128 Technology.  
 
Cash flow from operations was $126 million for the quarter, an increase both year-over-year and sequentially. We paid $66 million in dividends, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share. We also repurchased $75 million worth of shares. 
Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020 was $2.4 billion. I would like to point out that there was a timing difference between our new debt issuance and the full retirement of the previous debt which was completed in January. As a result of this timing difference, our total cash and debt balances are elevated by approximately $485 million and $425 million, respectively, as of year-end.  
 
Moving on to our full year results. Total revenue for 2020 was $4.445 billion, which was flat versus 2019. Our Enterprise business grew 3% for the year, despite the impact of the pandemic. This was our fourth consecutive year of full year growth in Enterprise. Our Cloud business grew 2% for the year, the second consecutive year of growth. Our Service Provider business began to stabilize and performed as expected, declining 4% for the full year.
Looking at our technologies, routing declined 1% and switching grew 2% and security declined 9% year-over-year. Our Services business grew 1%. Software was 10% of total revenue, the second year of software being at or above this level. 
In reviewing our top 10 customers for the year, 5 were Cloud, 4 were Service Provider and 1 was in Enterprise. 
Non-GAAP gross margin declined by 90 basis points in 2020, primarily due to the additional logistics and other supply chain-related costs related to COVID-19, partially offset by improvement in our Service gross margin. 
Throughout the year, we continue to focus on disciplined operating expense management with a modest increase of less than 1% on a non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue was 43.7%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.55 in 2020. 
For the year, we had cash flow from operations of $612 million, which increased $83 million compared to 2019. 
During 2020, we took a balanced approach to capital allocation. We repurchased $375 million worth of shares and paid $264 million in dividends for a total capital return of 125% of free cash flow to shareholders. In addition, we acquired 2 growth-oriented companies that we believe will help us return to sustainable revenue growth and margin expansion over time. We also improved our capital structure by refinancing a portion of our debt, locking in historically low long-term financing rates and extending our average maturity while preserving our investment-grade credit profile. I am proud of the strategic approach the team has taken to ensure our financial resilience through these challenging and uncertain times. 
Now I would like to provide some color on our guidance, which you can find details in the CFO commentary available on our Investor Relations website. At the midpoint of our revenue guidance, revenue is expected to be up 6% year-over-year, which includes less than $10 million from our recent acquisitions. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to experience normal seasonal patterns in the first quarter. Excluding the anticipated impact of increased COVID-related costs, non-GAAP gross margin would be approximately flat versus the first quarter of last year. 
We expect first quarter non-GAAP operating expense to increase sequentially, primarily due to the inclusion of approximately $20 million of operating expenses related to the recent acquisition as well as the annual reset of variable compensation and the typical seasonal increase in fringe costs, partially offset by a decline in commission expense. 
In addition, our first quarter non-GAAP EPS guidance includes the dilutive impact of the recent acquisitions. 
Before we move on to Q&A, I would like to provide some comments on our expectations for the full year 2021. Our 2021 revenue and non-GAAP earnings expectations remain unchanged relative to the forecast we provided during our Q3 2020 earnings call. However, we have updated our growth expectations to account for the revenue and the non-GAAP earnings upside that we experienced in Q4 2020 as compared to the midpoint of our guidance. We have also factored in the acquisition of Apstra, which is expected to be dilutive to our non-GAAP earnings during the first half of 2021, but be breakeven on a full year basis. 
In terms of full year revenue, we expect organic growth of approximately 2% to 3% and we anticipate an additional 1% of growth from the recent acquisitions. Beyond the first quarter, we expect revenue to grow sequentially each quarter in 2021. 
While non-GAAP gross margin can be difficult to predict, we expect full year gross margin of approximately 60% due to the higher volume, reduced COVID-related logistics costs and higher software mix as well as improved service costs. Through the course of the year, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to improve with volume. 
Non-GAAP operating expense is expected to remain near first quarter levels through the course of the year. The full year non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be approximately flat to 2020 levels. While we expect total non-GAAP operating expense to be up on a full year basis as we absorb our recent acquisition and invest to take advantage of market opportunities, we remain committed to disciplined expense management and expanding operating margin longer term. 
I'd also like to note that we expect non-GAAP other income and expense to remain near first quarter levels through the course of the year. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate on worldwide earnings is expected to be 19.5%, plus or minus 1%. We expect full year non-GAAP EPS to grow faster than revenue. 
Finally, our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share, to be paid this quarter to stockholders of record.  
 
In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success, especially in this challenging environment. Now I'd like to open the call for questions."

We do anticipate there being some cost coming back into the equation when people start to travel again, et cetera, perhaps in the second half. However, I do think the new normal is still yet to be determined. And at this point, I'm not expecting all the costs to come back. I think we'll be able to be conservative and basically efficient with our travel, et cetera, as we move forward.

Our organic innovation, our inorganic acquisitions have set us up to accelerate this part of our business. So despite the challenges that we saw in 2020 as a result of COVID, we grew this vertical, and we grew it nicely. I think we're taking share.  
I believe our technology and our differentiation has never been stronger. We've created not just market share growth and business growth, but mind share growth in the industry. And I think we've done so with an eye on doing it as efficiently as possible by focusing on the large enterprises. So a big component of our success comes from large Fortune 500, Global 1000 accounts, where the sales investment is as efficient as it can be for that enterprise.

We continue to see healthy diversification within cloud, both within the hyperscale cloud providers where we enjoy footprint across practically all of them, but also among the -- what we used to call Tier 2, Tier 3, which we're now calling cloud majors going forward, more and more market share in that area as well. I'd also think that there is a greater diversity of technologies that we're selling. So it's not just about routing, it's also about switching. It's also about security in this very important vertical. 
As I look out into 2021, I believe our footprint that we retain within the cloud space is going to work for us, right?

So as just a couple of data points for you to give you an indication of just how well we're doing with Mist, our annualized order business for Mist stand-alone in Q4 exceeded $200 million. And if you include Mist wireless and wired, so this is EX that's sold really under the Mist automation framework, on a stand-alone annualized order basis, it's really around $300 million already. So the momentum has been really amazing. 
We're going to take the playbook that we implemented and getting our sellers very proficient in being able to position the Mist differentiation, the technology and apply that exact same playbook to the acquisitions that we've made last year, 128 and Apstra, in particular, which are mostly suited for the Enterprise but have applicability in other verticals as well. 
With 128, it is a really unique differentiated SD-WAN solution that fit beautifully under the Mist client-to-cloud vision, right, where you're extracting data insight telemetry from everything in the path between client to cloud and you're doing something really interesting with that data, which is to provide insights and improved automation and improved end-user experience for our customers. 
Apstra takes this experience-first networking approach that we know has worked so effectively in the campus, in client to cloud and applies it to the data center. So honestly, early interest in Apstra, although we just closed the deal yesterday, has been -- like exceeded our expectations at this point. The pipeline we're building, the interest in customers that want to understand the better together story has been extremely encouraging. 
And then the last acquisition is a little bit, a smaller one, which is Netrounds, and Netrounds has applicability to all verticals, but especially the Service Provider vertical, where we have an ability now to sell beyond just the box and connectivity between boxes, but an assured experience, assured SLAs to service providers, and we're also very pleased with the early interest from SPs in that technology as well."

Though Europe largely played out as expected from a revenue standpoint, Q4 probably exceeded our expectations by a bit. We enjoy very strong, healthy franchises with service providers around the world. 49 of the top 50 service providers worldwide our customers trust Juniper technology. 
We did see weakness in some of the largest Tier 1 service providers, especially here in North America. And I think for the reason that we all know, there has been a lot of capital expenditure that has been placed in spectrum auctions and so forth. So it diverted investments away from the areas of the network, the business that we are traditionally strong in. I don't expect that to be the case forever. 
If you look out into '21, and we've provided an outlook of further stabilization, i.e., even better results than we saw in 2020 in '21, we did not, in that outlook, anticipate a resumption that any significant resumption in spending by our large Tier 1 SP. If they do resume spending in the kind of IP technology that we develop and sell, then I think that would obviously benefit our business even more.  
 
The strength that we saw has to do with the diversification strategy that we have been executing on. So increased penetration in the cable space in this country, Tier 2 and Tier 3 service providers that are working very effectively for us and international service providers.

If you look at the foundation of 400-gig business today and measured in a number of customers, in the Q3 of 2020 time frame, our cumulative number of customers that invested in 400-gig capable switching technology and compared that to the Q4 time frame, same metric, cumulative number of customers that invested in 400-gig switching technology, that's doubled. So whereas the revenue from 400-gig switching today is still relatively small in comparison to the total switching business, the way we measure it is momentum in wins and momentum in customers and you can see that, that momentum is quite solid. That's a very encouraging data point for us."

So the way that we've maintained our momentum throughout the pandemic is on focusing on subsegments of the Enterprise and, of course, Cloud and SP, but primarily in the Enterprise, that are most resilient to economic perturbations or spending patterns in IT. So financial services, higher education, so think here college campuses, U.S. federal government, large big-box type retailers, warehouses, these are all areas where investments in IT and networking must be made today. 
But as we look out beyond the pandemic, and you start to think about what happens when we recover from the pandemic, my strong belief is that there will be a pivot towards investments in IT technology that's going to be cloud delivered, AI-driven. It's not going to be the complex legacy on-prem traditional technologies that, quite frankly, are not important to Juniper, not a part of our strategy. It's the cloud-delivered technology that I think will actually see an acceleration as you get out of this COVID crisis. So my view is we've done what's necessary to capture share during the pandemic, and we're setting ourselves up with a strategy that's going to be geared to where investments are going to be greatest post-pandemic."

We're not in our outlook for enterprise accounting on a major recovery, a significant recovery from COVID-type spending in enterprise, but should that reverse, let's say, in the second half of the year, enterprises go back to spending more like they used to, then I think we'll absolutely benefit from that. 
As far as your question around appetite for spending, in those verticals that I just mentioned to Rod, financial services, campuses, higher education, federal government, large retailers, actually, the appetite for investments as measured by large projects is there. We've seen it. And we've won many opportunities based on the merits, the differentiation of our technology. 
And the last thing I would say is even in the, let's say, the smaller-type enterprises, let's say, mid-sized enterprises, where COVID is going to be more of a headwind, more of a factor to be considered in IT teams justifying projects, I would argue that we're living at a time now where differentiation matters most, right?

So first, I wouldn't say seasonality because it sort of indicates maybe some timing of orders that's based on which quarter of the year. And that's not necessarily what we're seeing. What we see within the Cloud vertical are really 2 dynamics. One of them is a natural evolution of the deployment of use cases. So there are always going to be older, more mature use cases that start to sort of diminish. They're reduced over time. But we're offsetting those older use cases with new use cases that we continue to win even within the same customer. So any cloud provider, especially hyperscale cloud provider is going to be deploying our technology in a number of different use cases. And that natural evolution of use cases has always been there. Some will decline and others will grow. 
The second factor within the Cloud vertical is diversity within or among customers, we're seeing really healthy diversity among our largest hyperscale cloud customers, and that offsets some of the puts and takes of use cases within each of the customers, and we're seeing strength in the cloud majors opportunity where there are many customers.

We've spent a fair amount of time talking to value-added resellers during the survey work and the like as well as talking to individual companies. And it seems quite clear that spending intention around security has ratcheted up quite significantly and that the overall IT budgets are also increasing quite meaningfully, which does not really put to your commentary about fairly soft conditions on spending, potentially improving once COVID is resolved. Have you had conversations with the C-suite types in the large accounts or even intermediate-size accounts that are recent enough to get a handle on whether SolarWinds had an impact on spending intentions?

First, I want to say, actually, what I mentioned was we anticipate enterprise spending to be healthy post COVID. So I actually think that there will be a resumption in spend and more tailwinds, an acceleration, if you will, of enterprise spending in many different use cases, especially the use cases that we as a company are focused on. 
Next, I want to say with respect to Juniper and impact of SolarWinds, we never put that SolarWinds product into any of our products that we sell our customers. And of course, once we heard of the news, we quickly scoured our own networks and looked for any exposures, and we didn't find that we were in any way exposed. So that I'll just get out of the way. 
In terms of has SolarWinds or how their security-type incidents increased the appetite for IT leaders or CSOs, to focus on spending, especially in security, the answer is absolutely, yes. I mean there is a reason that I think it's very important that as a networking company, you also have security competence and you embed security as a forethought, not an afterthought in all of the solutions that you sell to address the use cases that are important to your business, that's never been more important. 
So our security business in Q4 did not grow, but there's a reason for this. The high end of our security, where we typically sell into large service providers, cloud providers, that tends to be lumpy. The broader part of our security portfolio is, really the strategy there is to embed it into our solutions. So we talked a lot about Mist. One element of our client-to-cloud Mist solution is that it's going to be secured by default with the technology that we have embedded in our -- the Mist solution portfolio. And for that reason, I'm actually quite optimistic about how these security trends and the appetite to invest in security by IT departments for our business."

In Q4, we saw double-digit routing growth in cloud providers and enterprises. Government and cable momentum was strong. MX and PTX grew both on a year-over-year and a sequential basis. So it does appear to be broad-based. 
The use cases today for us are mostly going to be in core routing and edge routing, some DCI data center interconnect. The thing that I'm really excited about when it comes to the opportunity is on our metro road map. The metro represents around a $2 billion routing opportunity today that's growing at a healthy clip. It's probably the fastest-growing routing submarket of the overall routing market, and it's largely untapped by Juniper. 
And the good news is this is just another high-performance networking -- network, but it requires certain capabilities, certain aspects of your products around footprint and power efficiency and certain types of features. These are all within our wheelhouse. And this is a road map that we're executing on. We've already introduced the first product to address it, but you can expect a number of new products that we introduce this year to complete our metro routing portfolio. Netrounds really fits beautifully into this solution because it really provides that automation and SLA assurance end-to-end that's important for the metro. So that, I believe, is going to help us in our routing business in '21, but especially in '22 when the portfolio is complete."

We delivered strong results during the March quarter. Revenue exceeded our expectations, and we experienced year-over-year growth across all verticals and geographies. Product orders experienced mid-teens growth year-over-year, and we grew backlog on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. 
Momentum was especially strong in our Cloud and Enterprise verticals, with Cloud orders growing nearly 30% year-over-year and Enterprise orders growing more than 20% year-over-year. While our Service Provider orders slightly declined year-over-year, even here, the results exceeded our expectations. Near-term visibility is strong. And given the momentum we're seeing, we now expect to grow our business 4% to 5% in 2021 on a full year basis. 
The success we're seeing is due in large part to deliver actions we have taken to both strengthen our portfolio and enhance our go-to-market organization. Our focus on leading the industry is delivering simplified operations and a superior end-user experience, what we call, experience first networking is resonating in the market and our deliberate focus on specific customer solutions is enabling us to accelerate our success across the areas we serve. 
We're seeing good early interest in Apstra 128 Technology and Netrounds, which are not only strengthening our position in several attractive end markets but also enhancing the success of the broader Juniper portfolio. Our go-to-market organization is executing well and the investments we've made over the last few years are paying off in the form of improved productivity, and customer diversity. 
We're continuing to invest in both product differentiation and our go-to-market organization. I remain confident these actions will not only position us to benefit from any potential improvement in end market conditions but also to capture share at several large industry transitions unfold. There are several opportunities that are beginning to play out where we feel strong about our position. First, the Enterprise transition to AI-driven cloud operations, where our Mist AI offering which was enhanced by the acquisition of 128 Technology helps customers streamline operations, reduce cost and optimize end-user experiences. 
This client-to-cloud differentiation is truly resonating. We believe the Enterprise transition to AI-driven cloud architectures is likely to present a significant disruptive port in the campus and branch networking market where we maintain significant sustainable advantages over all competitive platforms. Second, is the Cloud and Service Provider transition to 400-gig systems where we're continuing to see success both in wide area as well as data center use cases. 
Our 400-gig solutions are highly competitive. And we remain optimistic in our ability to not only protect our footprint but also to capture net new opportunities in hyperscale, Cloud major and Service Provider accounts. Last but not least, the Service Provider, 5G and metro markets which we view as a large opportunity that is likely to see healthy growth over the next several years. We are playing to win in the Service Provider vertical and believe our investments in automation technologies such as Netrounds and the introduction of new metric oriented solutions such as the award-winning ACXW100 family should position us to gain share in this attractive portion of the market, where historically we've had limited presence. 
I firmly believe we're taking share and that the investments we're making will position us to not only capitalize on the big market opportunities that will unfold over the next few years, but also to see broader market success that decreases our sensitivity to macro trends. We believe our plans will enable us to emerge from the pandemic stronger than we entered and delivered sustainable top and bottom line growth over the next several years. 
Now I'd like to provide some additional insights into the quarter and address some of the key developments we're seeing from a customer solutions perspective. Starting with our automated WAN solutions, which saw strong double-digit revenue growth year-over-year and exceeded our own expectations in Q1. We  experienced strength with both our Service Provider and Cloud customers, each of which delivered double-digit sales growth year-over-year. 
We grew in all geographies year-over-year, and momentum is healthy entering the June period. In the service provider vertical, our diversification strategy is continuing to yield positive results. And we remain optimistic regarding the outlook for our Cloud metro offerings, which combine our new ACX product with our Paragon automation portfolio. We believe these solutions are highly competitive and well positioned to win in one of the fastest-growing portion of the server routing market. 
As I mentioned previously, we are playing to win in the Service Provider market. And I remain optimistic regarding the outlook for our automated WAN solutions in this important vertical. I'd also like to highlight that our automated WAN portfolio had particularly strong orders from our Cloud customers in Q1. While our strength was across multiple hyperscale accounts, we also saw improved activity with our largest Cloud customer following several quarters of softer demand. 
Our Cloud pipeline remains strong, and we are optimistic regarding the outlook for our wide area solutions, particularly in areas where we maintain incumbency and are well positioned to benefit for 400 gig tailwind that are likely to start ramping later this year. And for the year, We are confident in our outlook for our automated WAN solution. We expect 2021 results to be slightly above the high end of the long-term forecast rate, we provided at our February Investor Day calling for a 1% decline to 3% growth. 
While our Cloud-ready data center solutions declined 10% year-over-year during Q1, orders grew nearly 30% year-over-year due to broad-based strength across our Cloud, Enterprise and Service Provider customers. Win rates improved, and we saw a material increase in average deal size in the quarter. Apstra exceeded our expectations and is already enabling us to win data center opportunities, we likely wouldn't have been able to secure if we hadn't completed the deal in January. 
Customer interest in our Cloud-ready data center portfolio is high and we remain optimistic regarding the outlook for this business. While the Q1 revenue decline in our Cloud-ready data center business was almost entirely due to expected weakness at a single large customer, orders with this customer also materially improved in the quarter and should positively impact results in future periods. 
For the year, we believe our Cloud-ready data center business remains on track to achieve the long-term forecast raise we highlighted at our Investor Day, looking for 5% to 9% growth despite the slow revenue start to the year. Finally, our AI-driven Enterprise solutions experienced double-digit growth year-over-year and exceeded expectations in the March quarter. 
Our Mist AI differentiation continues to resonate in the market as new logos nearly doubled in Q1. And Mist orders experienced another quarter of triple-digit growth with a record number of deals greater than $1 million. Our Mistified business of wireless LAN, wired access, Marvis Virtual Network Assistance and Associated EX pull-through approximately doubled year-over-year. And we saw record EX pull-through in Q1. In addition to strength with large Fortune 500 customers, we're also experiencing continued strength in the channel and improved momentum with smaller commercial accounts, which highlights the value of our AI-driven Enterprise offering to customers of all sizes and across all verticals. 
We believe Mist AI continues to offer unique and market-leading differentiation resulting in the best user and operator experiences. To enhance this leadership, we continue to bring new innovations to market that should further accelerate our success in future periods. Some of the innovations we've recently announced include the industry's first campus switch that's optimized for AI-driven Cloud operations, the ES 4400 which provides customers with ease of setup, best-in-class fabric management, security, scale and AI-driven troubleshooting to find needle in attack problem like misconfigured LANs and bad cables. 
Add to that, the mystical of our SRX branch gateway, which allows automated onboarding and configuration using Mist AI and the Cloud coupled with simple SD branch router and security configuration via the same platform as wired and wireless access. And the integration of 128 Technology Session Smart Routing with Mist, WAN assurance and virtual network assisted capabilities to deliver the industry's first AI-driven SD-WAN solution, which includes customizable service level and proactive problem resolution on top of the already unique Session Smart capabilities of Juniper's SD-WAN solution. 
While it remains early, we're seeing strong customer interest in 120 Technology session smart router capabilities in the field. We closed multimillion-dollar deals with managed service providers in Europe and Lat Am, had a significant expansion with a large global enterprise and on opportunities in the U.S. federal vertical. We're excited about our mystical of 128 Technology and are focusing our attention on sales enablement and leveraging the Juniper go-to-market organization to accelerate 128 Technology success. 
I remain encouraged by the momentum we're seeing in this business and remain confident our AI-driven Enterprise solutions are likely to see double-digit growth in 2021. Our security revenue experienced strong results during the March quarter and orders exceeded expectations in the period. Strength was especially notable in the high end of the market, although we saw growth across all customer verticals and product families. We believe our connected security strategy is resonating in the market and that the convergence of networking and security provides us with a competitive advantage in the portions of the market where we are currently focused. 
We're also benefiting from recent third-party validation, highlighting the superior efficacy of our products from reputable firms such as Gartner, ICFA and Cyber ratings. We believe these dynamics will continue to provide tailwinds in future quarters and should enable us to grow our security business during the current year. Our software and related services revenue grew 7% in the March quarter and strong growth in our ratable subscription offerings such as MIS and healthy uptake of our Flex on-box software offerings were partially offset by lower sales of certainly older products that carry a high-level perpetual software. 
ARR grew 28% year-over-year in the period, driven by a combination of missed subscription, ratable security software offering and the related services associated with these software offerings. Software orders were particularly strong in the quarter, rising more than 70% on a year-over-year basis due to fraud based strength across verticals and use cases. 
We're seeing ongoing strength in ratable subscription offerings and improved adoption of our on-box Flex licenses, which are seeing traction across all of the customer verticals we serve. Based on the momentum we're seeing, we remain optimistic regarding the outlook for our overall software business as well as the long-term ARR targets we presented at our recent Investor Day. 
I'd like to mention that our Services team delivered another solid quarter and continued to grow on a year-over-year basis due to strong renewals and service attach rates. Our Services team continues to execute extremely well to ensure our customers receive an excellent experience. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. And I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders. 
I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail."

I will start by discussing our first quarter results and end with some color on our outlook.

I will start by discussing our first quarter results and end with some color on our outlook. We entered the first quarter of 2021 at $1,074,000,000 in revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.30, both above the midpoint of our guidance. Revenue was up 8% year-over-year, with growth across all verticals and geographies. 
Looking at our revenue by vertical. On a year-over-year basis, Service Provider grew 17%; cloud grew 3%; and Enterprise grew 1%. As expected, all verticals declined on a sequential basis. Orders were strong in the first quarter, with growth in the mid-teens on a year-over-year basis, with particular strength in our Cloud and Enterprise verticals. As we discussed at our Investor Day in February, this is the first quarter of our updated revenue reported, pivoting from technology categories to customer solutions. 
The customer solution categories our automated brand solutions, cloud-ready data center and AI-Driven Enterprise. As we have discussed, this change better aligns our revenue reporting to key growth drivers that is aligned with our strategy. Looking at revenue by customer solutions, automated WAN solutions increased 22% year-over-year, with both MX and PTX product families posting year-over-year growth. 
Cloud-ready data center revenue decreased 10% year-over-year, while the timing of shipments impacted revenue results, orders saw strong growth in the quarter. And finally, the driven Enterprise revenue increased 12% versus last year. Our Mist and EX product families both grew year-over-year. As Rami mentioned, total software and related services revenue was $143 million, an increase of 7% year-over-year. And our annual recurring revenue, or ARR, grew 28% year-over-year. 
Total security revenue, which includes security products as well as services related to our security solutions was $163 million, an increase of 11% year-over-year. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, 5 were cloud; 4 were Service Provider; and 1 was an Enterprise. Our top 10 customers accounted for 31% of our total revenue as compared to 33% and in Q1 2020. 
Non-GAAP gross margin was 59.3%, which was above the midpoint of our guidance, primarily due to higher revenue. If it weren't for the pandemic-related elevated logistics and other supply chain-related costs, we would have posted non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 60%. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 3% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, in line with our guidance range. 
Non-GAAP operating margin was 12.1% for the quarter which exceeded our expectations. We exited the quarter with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $1.8 billion. The sequential decline was primarily due to the repurchase of our remaining debt that was refinanced last quarter and the cash outflows associated with the acquisition of Apstra. Cash flow from operations was $180 million. 
From a capital return perspective, we paid $65 million in dividends, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share and repurchased $125 million worth of shares in the first quarter. Turning to our guidance. As I'm sure you are aware, there is a worldwide shortage of semiconductors impacting many industries. Similar to others, we are experiencing ongoing supply constraints which have resulted in extended lead times. We have invested to strengthen our supply chain and have increased inventory levels over the course of the last year. 
We continue to work closely with our suppliers to further enhance our resiliency and many case disruptions outside of our control. Despite these actions, we believe extended lead times will likely persist for the next few quarters. While the situation is dynamic. At this point in time, we believe we will have access to efficient semiconductor supply to meet our full year financial forecast. 
Looking specifically at the second quarter. At the midpoint of guidance, revenue is expected to be up 5% year-over-year. We expect to see sequential growth across our Cloud and Enterprise verticals, while Service Provider is expected to remain approximately flat. We expect our second quarter non-GAAP gross margins to benefit from higher volume and incremental software mix, which should more than offset unfavorable product mix trends and potentially higher component costs related to supply constraints. 
We expect non-GAAP operating expense to increase sequentially, primarily due to the investments we are making to take advantage of future market opportunities. Moving on to our expectations for 2021. We have updated our full year revenue growth and profitability expectations to account for the upside we expect to experience in the first half of 2021. We now expect full year revenue growth of approximately 4% to 5%, a point of which is expected to come from recently acquired assets. 
Our revised top line outlook is 100 basis points higher than our previous expectation of 3% to 4%. From a vertical perspective, for 2021, Enterprise revenue is expected to grow the fastest; Cloud is expected to grow towards the high end of our long-term model range; and Service Provider is now expected to be flat to slightly up versus last year. 
At this time, our revenue and non-GAAP earnings expectations remain unchanged for the second half of the year relative to the forecast we provided during our Q4 2020 earnings call. While non-GAAP gross margin can be difficult to predict, we continue to expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 60%, consistent with what we said on our Q4 2020 earnings call, as well as at our February 2021 Investor Day. 
We expect full year non-GAAP gross margin to benefit from higher volume, improved service margin and incremental software mix, which should more than offset unfavorable product mix trends and potentially higher component costs related to supply constraints. Full year non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be flat to slightly up versus 2020 levels. We expect non-GAAP OI&E to remain near Q2 2021 levels through the course of the year. 
In closing, I'd like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. especially in this challenging environment. 
Now I'd like to open the call for questions."

So obviously, very pleased with the momentum in our software business, 70% year-over-year growth in orders particularly pleased with ARR momentum at 28% year-over-year. So the way we're running the business right now is with an intense focus on our customer solutions, AI-driven enterprise, automated data center and automated WAN. 
Each of these solutions has an embedded and a meaningful software components that we have invested in that drives significant differentiation in the market, and that ultimately delivers on our strategy of experience first networking. So you can't sell an AI-driven enterprise solution without actually also selling a meaningful software component along with it. That is what is driving the momentum, especially in off-box software offerings like Mist. 
And then I know it's early, but increasingly in solutions like Apstra as well. In addition to that is the flex licensing model. This is a really simple on-box licensing model that gives customers the flexibility to choose what particular features and scale they want, along with the traditional systems that they deploy in their network.

And as you mentioned, the impact in Q1 was about 70 basis points, and that is predominantly logistics and kind of some of the COVID-related costs that we've been talking about the last couple of quarters.

And as you mentioned, the impact in Q1 was about 70 basis points, and that is predominantly logistics and kind of some of the COVID-related costs that we've been talking about the last couple of quarters. And the freight cost per paying per kilogram are still significantly elevated versus pre-COVID levels. 
We expect that to be maintained for the next couple of quarters. It's going to -- it's difficult to predict when that's going to normalize, but I do expect that to normalize eventually. But I do think it's going to take a few more quarters for that to normalize. In addition to that, we are starting to factor in some potential cost from a component perspective due to the supply constraints that we've mentioned before. 
So we have factored in some cost to component cost increase into our current forecast. We still believe 60% is the right target for us on a full year basis for this year despite some of these incremental costs. But it's something we're watching very closely, and we obviously be managing it aggressively as we have been. And we'll continue to keep you guys updated as we go. There is a fair amount of uncertainty there. But based on our current expectations, we feel that the 60% target that we have for the year still holds true. 
From a revenue loss perspective, we are seeing extended lead times So that means an order that we would book might not recognize in the same period as it would have otherwise. However, we feel that the revenue result that we just posted in Q1, the guidance we just put out there for are quite strong based on the demand strength that we're seeing, and we feel good about our ability to procure the supply we need to hit our revenue forecast."

The share that we have with hyperscale routing, in particular, is second to none in the industry, I believe. So the strength that we saw in Q1 was actually very broad-based. Certainly, hyperscale contributed to that momentum. And the nice thing about the hyperscale momentum that we're seeing right now is that it's not just about 1 or even 2 accounts. It's fairly well distributed a good amount of diversification within hyperscale. 
After that, the Cloud majors, which are the smaller cloud providers, international Cloud providers that have also contributed to that momentum. So in Q1, we saw double-digit growth in routing, again, based on the footprint that we enjoyed. Switching was down, but only because of a particular use case in one customer that's essentially a wide area use case. I've actually talked about this in the last 1 or 2 earnings calls. 
But I will note here that even in that use case, we've now started to see a resumption of spend by our large customer that deploys it in this manner. And then orders up 30%, nearly 30% year-over-year, again, is indicative of the position that we have. I mean I think the way you should look at cloud providers today is, there is certainly competition that's happening for future build-outs, especially 400 gig. I feel very good about the competitive nature of our solutions, the engagements with our cloud provider customers that I think will bode well for us in the future, especially as you get into the second half of this year and next year. 
But then to benefit from the investments to hyperscale and the broader cloud major customers have today, you need to have the footprint and we have the footprint."

Now partially explained by a need to compare relative to last year. But I would say that it did exceed our expectations, including from an order standpoint. And what I really like about our performance in the Service Provider space is the diversity, both from the standpoint of geography. This is not a North America phenomenon or a European phenomenon, it's broad-based across every geography, the diversity of solutions and technologies. 
So we're seeing strength in routing, as you would expect, but we're also seeing strength in security as service providers gear up for 5G deployments. Platforms, MX has always been a workhorse in the Service Provider space. And we continue to invest in new line cards, these software capabilities. But we're starting to see some good PTX momentum and solid 400-gig wins in competitive bids with service providers. 
And last but not least, I will add that Tier 1 spending, Tier 1 U.S. Service Provider spending has actually been weak over the last year or so, as we've outlined in previous earnings calls, I'll call it, but we've actually seen a bit more, let's say, signs of life or resumption in spending by some Tier 1 operators as well, which is encouraging. Add to that, the differentiation. We've introduced just in the Q1 time frame, our Paragon automation suite, and this really addresses a real need in the market for the types of tools that customers are looking for, for planning and provisioning and insights and assurance. 
And then we also launched our Cloud Metro strategy, which is really our big push into the metro space and announced 2 new ACX metro platforms and in fact ship one of them already, the ACX 100, which is a 5G-ready high-density, high-capacity solution to address the future of 5G metro build-outs, and that's a net new opportunity for Juniper. So we've traditionally not had any meaningful presence here, but we expect us to contribute to our revenue performance over the next few years.

We're now calling SP based on the strength of the first half to be flat to slightly up. on a full year basis, which, as Rami mentioned, is more in line with our long-term model, actually the high end of our long-term model, whereas previously we were kind of tracking towards the low end.

And that continues to do phenomenally well for us. And Mist is no longer a WiFi solution. Mist is an architectural approach that's cloud-delivered AI-powered solution to everything from client to cloud. And what we're seeing is the business all up under the Mist umbrella doing incredibly well, right? 
Like I said, doubling new logos, record number of million dollar deals, et cetera. The other acquisitions are still a little bit newer, so it's still earlier, but I'm very encouraged based on what I'm seeing thus far. Apstra, as an example, has seen early interest from many customers. The pipeline is very solid. And it's clear that there are many customers out there that are looking for the ability to deploy private cloud but are fearful of the operational complexity of private cloud. 
And Apstra provides the best solution that's truly multi-vendor. So it's not just working on top of Juniper underlying but any vendor's underlay solution to provide that seamless, easy, intent-based private cloud experience There is a need in the market. And I firmly believe we have the best technology for it right now. 128 Technology, again, there, the Mistification of that technology under the Mist umbrella is happening very rapidly. 
So we're introducing more and more capabilities. The second half of the year is going to be really important for wrapping up that solution. But even on a stand-alone basis, we're closing multimillion-dollar deals with managed service providers. We're seeing expansions of existing franchises that we have with 128 Technology. Federal government is especially interested in the security aspects of 128 Technology. So even though it's early, I'm actually quite optimistic about what we're seeing thus far."

I feel increasingly confident that we're going to be able to win 400-gig footprint. And this is a broad remark across both the hyperscale Cloud providers as well as the Tier 2, 3 or the Cloud major Cloud providers as well. 
Now that the competitive solutions are out in the market, the competitive bake-offs are happening, we sort of get a good feel of what's out there and how the differentiation we had hoped to achieve is actually faring out with practical testing, and I feel good. I mean, let's just say that. We're winning, especially in wide area use cases, and this is across both the hyperscale as well as the smaller Cloud providers. 
And then even in the data center, we've won 100-gig data center use cases, We're not yet ready to announce a hyperscale 400-gig data center win at this point. But we're going to continue to aggressively go after the full market that's out there, both wide area and data center. And on the SP competitive front, there -- our solutions, our strategy is very much based on the strength and the merits of our own products, our wide area of capabilities, our automation capabilities. And I feel very good about that. 
We've listened closely to our customers. We understand what they want. And I think we were delivering solutions and have delivered solutions that addresses their biggest needs and requirements. Will the Huawei sort of issue that's out there and whether that presents an opportunity for us. The answer is yes. 
I think we do see some opportunities right now the result of some concerns about Huawei. They're going to sort of play out in time. This is never going to be a sort of an overnight thing, share shift typically happens in time frames of years. But the good news is we do see that there are opportunities and customers that are rethinking some of the decisions that they have made in specific geographies around the world."

So 128 has become an integral part of our AI-driven Enterprise strategy, which is really around everything from client to Cloud, with ease of automation, simplicity of day-to-day provisioning and there is a security architecture element to this. 
Because it provides visibility into applications, it integrates seamlessly with our on-prem security offering. And then over time, as we introduce more cloud-based security offerings that will integrate seamlessly with that. And so that has been still early days with 128 Technology. But as I mentioned, the win rate is solid. The customer interest is solid and the pipeline that's being built to solid. 
And I have a lot of confidence that it's going to be a successful acquisition in the long term."

So a big part of our ARR growth that we mentioned 20% is also very much tied to the full Mist solution, not just necessarily the WiFi. So in aggregate, we talked about at Investor Day that we think the lifetime value of the kind of the pull-through, if you will, the non-wireless land solution is about 2.5x of the WiFi business. So that's something that -- we're still in the very early innings of that. 
We're still leading largely with Mist itself and then pulling through the rest of the solution. But as we see the lifetime value and these customers continue to grow with EX and other parts of the portfolio, we feel confident in that kind of 2.5x ratio that we put out there."

We delivered strong results during the March quarter. Revenue exceeded our expectations, and we experienced year-over-year growth across all verticals and geographies. Product orders experienced mid-teens growth year-over-year, and we grew backlog on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. 
Momentum was especially strong in our Cloud and Enterprise verticals, with Cloud orders growing nearly 30% year-over-year and Enterprise orders growing more than 20% year-over-year. While our Service Provider orders slightly declined year-over-year, even here, the results exceeded our expectations. Near-term visibility is strong. And given the momentum we're seeing, we now expect to grow our business 4% to 5% in 2021 on a full year basis. 
The success we're seeing is due in large part to deliberate actions we have taken to both strengthen our portfolio and enhance our go-to-market organization. Our focus on leading the industry is delivering simplified operations and a superior end-user experience, what we call, experience first networking is resonating in the market and our deliberate focus on specific customer solutions is enabling us to accelerate our success across the areas we serve. 
We're seeing good early interest in Apstra, 128 Technology and Netrounds, which are not only strengthening our position in several attractive end markets but also enhancing the success of the broader Juniper portfolio. Our go-to-market organization is executing well and the investments we've made over the last few years are paying off in the form of improved productivity, and customer diversity. 
We're continuing to invest in both product differentiation and our go-to-market organization. I remain confident these actions will not only position us to benefit from any potential improvement in end market conditions but also to capture share at several large industry transitions unfold. There are several opportunities that are beginning to play out where we feel strong about our position. 
First, the Enterprise transition to AI-driven cloud operations, where our Mist AI offering, which was enhanced by the acquisition of 128 Technology, helps customers streamline operations, reduce cost and optimize end-user experiences.  This client-to-cloud differentiation is truly resonating. We believe the Enterprise transition to AI-driven cloud architectures is likely to present a significant disruptive port in the campus and branch networking market where we maintain significant sustainable advantages over all competitive platforms. Second, is the Cloud and Service Provider transition to 400-gig systems where we're continuing to see success both in wide area as well as data center use cases. 
Our 400-gig solutions are highly competitive. And we remain optimistic in our ability to not only protect our footprint but also to capture net new opportunities in hyperscale, Cloud major and Service Provider accounts. 
Last but not least, the Service Provider, 5G and metro markets which we view as a large opportunity that is likely to see healthy growth over the next several years. We are playing to win in the service provider vertical and believe our investments in automation technologies such as Netrounds and the introduction of new metro-oriented solutions such as the award-winning ACXW7100 family should position us to gain share in this attractive portion of the market, where historically, we've had limited presence. 
I firmly believe we're taking share and that the investments we're making will position us to not only capitalize on the big market opportunities that will unfold over the next few years, but also to see broader market success that decreases our sensitivity to macro trends. We believe our plans will enable us to emerge from the pandemic stronger than we entered and deliver sustainable top and bottom line growth over the next several years. 
Now I'd like to provide some additional insights into the quarter and address some of the key developments we're seeing from a customer solutions perspective. Starting with our automated WAN solutions, which saw strong double-digit revenue growth year-over-year and exceeded our own expectations in Q1. We experienced strength with both our Service Provider and Cloud customers, each of which delivered double-digit sales growth year-over-year. 
We grew in all geographies year-over-year, and momentum is healthy entering the June period. In the service provider vertical, our diversification strategy is continuing to yield positive results. And we remain optimistic regarding the outlook for our Cloud Metro offerings, which combine our new ACX product with our Paragon automation portfolio. We believe these solutions are highly competitive and well positioned to win in one of the fastest-growing portions of the service provider routing market. 
As I mentioned previously, we are playing to win in the service provider market. And I remain optimistic regarding the outlook for our automated WAN solutions in this important vertical. I'd also like to highlight that our automated WAN portfolio had particularly strong orders from our Cloud customers in Q1. While our strength was across multiple hyperscale accounts, we also saw improved activity with our largest Cloud customer following several quarters of softer demand. 
Our Cloud pipeline remains strong, and we are optimistic regarding the outlook for our wide area solutions, particularly in areas where we maintain incumbency and are well positioned to benefit for 400 gig tailwind that are likely to start ramping later this year. And for the year, We are confident in our outlook for our automated WAN solution. We expect 2021 results to be slightly above the high end of the long-term forecast rating we provided at our February Investor Day calling for a 1% decline to 3% growth. 
While our cloud-ready data center solutions declined 10% year-over-year during Q1, orders grew nearly 30% year-over-year due to broad-based strength across our Cloud, Enterprise and Service Provider customers. Win rates improved, and we saw a material increase in average deal size in the quarter. Apstra exceeded our expectations and is already enabling us to win data center opportunities we likely wouldn't have been able to secure if we hadn't completed the deal in January. 
Customer interest in our cloud-ready data center portfolio is high and we remain optimistic regarding the outlook for this business. While the Q1 revenue decline in our cloud-ready data center business was almost entirely due to expected weakness at a single large customer, orders with this customer also materially improved in the quarter and should positively impact results in future periods. 
For the year, we believe our cloud-ready data center business remains on track to achieve the long-term forecast raise we highlighted at our Investor Day, looking for 5% to 9% growth despite the slow revenue start to the year. Finally, our AI-driven Enterprise solutions experienced double-digit growth year-over-year and exceeded expectations in the March quarter. 
Our Mist AI differentiation continues to resonate in the market as new logos nearly doubled in Q1 and Mist orders experienced another quarter of triple-digit growth with a record number of deals greater than $1 million. Our Mistified business of wireless LAN, wired access, Marvis Virtual Network Assistance and associated EX pull-through approximately doubled year-over-year. And we saw record EX pull-through in Q1. In addition to strength with large Fortune 500 customers, we're also experiencing continued strength in the channel and improved momentum with smaller commercial accounts, which highlights the value of our AI-driven Enterprise offering to customers of all sizes and across all verticals. 
We believe Mist AI continues to offer unique and market-leading differentiation resulting in the best user and operator experiences. To enhance this leadership, we continue to bring new innovations to market that should further accelerate our success in future periods. Some of the innovations we've recently announced include the industry's first campus switch that's optimized for AI-driven Cloud operations, the EX4400 which provides customers with ease of setup, best-in-class fabric management, security, scale and AI-driven troubleshooting to find needle-in-haystack problems like misconfigured Gi-LANs and bad cables. 
Add to that the Mistification of our SRX branch gateway, which allows automated onboarding and configuration using Mist AI and the Cloud coupled with simple SD-Branch router and Security configuration via the same platform as wired and wireless access. And the integration of 128 Technology Session Smart routing with Mist, WAN assurance and virtual network assisted capabilities to deliver the industry's first AI-driven SD-WAN solution, which includes customizable service level and proactive problem resolution on top of the already unique Session Smart capabilities of Juniper's SD-WAN solution. 
While it remains early, we're seeing strong customer interest in 128 Technology's Session Smart routing capabilities in the field. We closed multimillion-dollar deals with managed service providers in Europe and LatAm, had a significant expansion with a large global enterprise and won opportunities in the U.S. federal vertical. We're excited about our Mistification of 128 Technology and are focusing our attention on sales  enablement and leveraging the Juniper go-to-market organization to accelerate 128 Technology's success. 
I remain encouraged by the momentum we're seeing in this business and remain confident our AI-driven Enterprise solutions are likely to see double-digit growth in 2021. Our security revenue experienced strong results during the March quarter and orders exceeded expectations in the period. 
Strength was especially notable in the high end of the market, although we saw growth across all customer verticals and product families. We believe our connected security strategy is resonating in the market and that the convergence of networking and security provides us with a competitive advantage in the portions of the market where we are currently focused. 
We're also benefiting from recent third-party validation, highlighting the superior efficacy of our products from reputable firms such as Gartner, ICFA and Cyber ratings. We believe these dynamics will continue to provide tailwinds in future quarters and should enable us to grow our security business during the current year. Our software and related services revenue grew 7% in the March quarter and strong growth in our ratable subscription offerings such as Mist and healthy uptake of our Flex on-box software offerings were partially offset by lower sales of certain older products that carry a high-level perpetual software. 
ARR grew 28% year-over-year in the period, driven by a combination of Mist subscriptions, ratable security software offering and the related services associated with these software offerings. Software orders were particularly strong in the quarter, rising more than 70% on a year-over-year basis due to broad-based strength across verticals and use cases. 
We're seeing ongoing strength in ratable subscription offerings and improved adoption of our on-box Flex licenses, which are seeing traction across all of the customer verticals we serve. Based on the momentum we're seeing, we remain optimistic regarding the outlook for our overall software business as well as the long-term ARR targets we presented at our recent Investor Day. 
I'd like to mention that our Services team delivered another solid quarter and continued to grow on a year-over-year basis due to strong renewals and service attach rates. Our Services team continues to execute extremely well to ensure our customers receive an excellent experience. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. And I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders. 
I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail."

We entered the first quarter of 2021 at $1.074 billion in revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.30, both ab",986,"Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start by discussing our first quarter results and end with some color on our outlook. We entered the first quarter of 2021 at $1.074 billion in revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.30, both above the midpoint of our guidance. Revenue was up 8% year-over-year, with growth across all verticals and geographies. 
Looking at our revenue by vertical. On a year-over-year basis, Service Provider grew 17%; Cloud grew 3%; and Enterprise grew 1%. As expected, all verticals declined on a sequential basis. Orders were strong in the first quarter, with growth in the mid-teens on a year-over-year basis, with particular strength in our Cloud and Enterprise verticals. As we discussed at our Investor Day in February, this is the first quarter of our updated revenue reported, pivoting from technology categories to customer solutions. 
The customer solution categories our automated brand solutions, cloud-ready data center and AI-driven Enterprise. As we have discussed, this change better aligns our revenue reporting to key growth drivers that is aligned with our strategy. Looking at revenue by customer solutions, automated WAN solutions increased 22% year-over-year, with both MX and PTX product families posting year-over-year growth. 
Cloud-ready data center revenue decreased 10% year-over-year, while the timing of shipments impacted revenue results, orders saw strong growth in the quarter. And finally, the driven Enterprise revenue increased 12% versus last year. Our Mist and EX product families both grew year-over-year. As Rami mentioned, total software and related services revenue was $143 million, an increase of 7% year-over-year. And our annual recurring revenue, or ARR, grew 28% year-over-year. 
Total security revenue, which includes security products as well as services related to our security solutions was $163 million, an increase of 11% year-over-year. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, 5 were Cloud; 4 were Service Provider; and 1 was an Enterprise. Our top 10 customers accounted for 31% of our total revenue as compared to 33% in Q1 2020. 
Non-GAAP gross margin was 59.3%, which was above the midpoint of our guidance, primarily due to higher revenue. If it weren't for the pandemic-related elevated logistics and other supply chain-related costs, we would have posted non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 60%. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 3% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, in line with our guidance range. 
Non-GAAP operating margin was 12.1% for the quarter which exceeded our expectations. We exited the quarter with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $1.8 billion. The sequential decline was primarily due to the repurchase of our remaining debt that was refinanced last quarter and the cash outflows associated with the acquisition of Apstra. Cash flow from operations was $180 million. 
From a capital return perspective, we paid $65 million in dividends, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share and repurchased $125 million worth of shares in the first quarter. Turning to our guidance. As I'm sure you are aware, there is a worldwide shortage of semiconductors impacting many industries. Similar to others, we are experiencing ongoing supply constraints which have resulted in extended lead times. We have invested to strengthen our supply chain and have increased inventory levels over the course of the last year. 
We continue to work closely with our suppliers to further enhance our resiliency and many case disruptions outside of our control. Despite these actions, we believe extended lead times will likely persist for the next few quarters. While the situation is dynamic, at this point in time, we believe we will have access to efficient semiconductor supply to meet our full year financial forecast. 
Looking specifically at the second quarter. At the midpoint of guidance, revenue is expected to be up 5% year-over-year. We expect to see sequential growth across our Cloud and Enterprise verticals, while Service Provider is expected to remain approximately flat. We expect our second quarter non-GAAP gross margins to benefit from higher volume and incremental software mix, which should more than offset unfavorable product mix trends and potentially higher component costs related to supply constraints. 
We expect non-GAAP operating expense to increase sequentially, primarily due to the investments we are making to take advantage of future market opportunities. Moving on to our expectations for 2021. We have updated our full year revenue growth and profitability expectations to account for the upside we expect to experience in the first half of 2021. We now expect full year revenue growth of approximately 4% to 5%, a point of which is expected to come from recently acquired assets. 
Our revised top line outlook is 100 basis points higher than our previous expectation of 3% to 4%. From a vertical perspective, for 2021, Enterprise revenue is expected to grow the fastest; Cloud is expected to grow towards the high end of our long-term model range; and Service Provider is now expected to be flat to slightly up versus last year. 
At this time, our revenue and non-GAAP earnings expectations remain unchanged for the second half of the year relative to the forecast we provided during our Q4 2020 earnings call. While non-GAAP gross margin can be difficult to predict, we continue to expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 60%, consistent with what we said on our Q4 2020 earnings call, as well as at our February 2021 Investor Day. 
We expect full year non-GAAP gross margin to benefit from higher volume, improved service margin and incremental software mix, which should more than offset unfavorable product mix trends and potentially higher component costs related to supply constraints. Full year non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be flat to slightly up versus 2020 levels. We expect non-GAAP OI&E to remain near Q2 2021 levels through the course of the year. 
In closing, I'd like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success, especially in this challenging environment. 
Now I'd like to open the call for questions."

Let me start with the software, and then I'll pass it over to Ken. So obviously, very pleased with the momentum in our software business, 70% year-over-year growth in orders particularly pleased with ARR momentum at 28% year-over-year. So the way we're running the business right now is with an intense focus on our customer solutions, AI-driven enterprise, cloud-ready data center and automated WAN. 
Each of these solutions has an embedded and a meaningful software component that we have invested in that drives significant differentiation in the market, and that ultimately delivers on our strategy of experience-first networking. So you can't sell an AI-driven enterprise solution without actually also selling a meaningful software component along with it. That is what is driving the momentum, especially in off-box software offerings like Mist. 
And then I know it's early, but increasingly in solutions like Apstra as well. In addition to that is the Flex licensing model. This is a really simple on-box licensing model that gives customers the flexibility to choose what particular features and scale they want, along with the traditional systems that they deploy in their network. 
So that combination is working very well for us. I feel very good about our ability to achieve our long-term targets that we provided to you in the recent analyst event. And I think we're going to continue to see good solid momentum in the software space."

And as you mentioned, the impact in Q1 was about 70 basis points, and that is predominantly logistics and kind of some of the COVID-related costs that we've been talking about the last couple of quarters. And the freight cost we're  paying per kilogram are still significantly elevated versus pre-COVID levels. 
We expect that to be maintained for the next couple of quarters. It's going to -- it's difficult to predict when that's going to normalize, but I do expect that to normalize eventually. But I do think it's going to take a few more quarters for that to normalize. In addition to that, we are starting to factor in some potential cost from a component perspective due to the supply constraints that we've mentioned before. 
So we have factored in some cost, component cost increase into our current forecast. We still believe 60% is the right target for us on a full year basis for this year despite some of these incremental costs. But it's something we're watching very closely, and we'd obviously be managing it aggressively as we have been. And we'll continue to keep you guys updated as we go. There is a fair amount of uncertainty there. But based on our current expectations, we feel that the 60% target that we have for the year still holds true. 
From a revenue loss perspective, we are seeing extended lead times So that means an order that we would book might not be recognized in the same period as it would have otherwise. However, we feel that the revenue result that we just posted in Q1, the guidance we just put out there for Q2's quite strong based on the demand strength that we're seeing, and we feel good about our ability to procure the supply we need to hit our revenue forecast."

The share that we have with hyperscale routing, in particular, is second to none in the industry, I believe. So the strength that we saw in Q1 was actually very broad-based. Certainly, hyperscale contributed to that momentum. And the nice thing about the hyperscale momentum that we're seeing right now is that it's not just about 1 or even 2 accounts. It's fairly well distributed, a good amount of diversification within hyperscale. 
After that, the Cloud majors, which are the smaller cloud providers, international cloud providers that have also contributed to that momentum. So in Q1, we saw double-digit growth in routing, again, based on the footprint that we enjoy. Switching was down, but only because of a particular use case in one customer that's essentially a wide area use case. I've actually talked about this in the last 1 or 2 earnings calls. 
But I will note here that even in that use case, we've now started to see a resumption of spend by our large customer that deploys it in this manner. And then orders up 30%, nearly 30% year-over-year, again, is indicative of the position that we have. I mean, I think the way you should look at cloud providers today is, there is certainly competition that's happening for future build-outs, especially 400 gig. I feel very good about the competitive nature of our solutions, the engagements with our cloud provider customers that I think will bode well for us in the future, especially as you get into the second half of this year and next year. 
But then to benefit from the investments to hyperscale and the broader cloud major customers have today, you need to have the footprint and we have the footprint."

Well, I think we're focusing on areas of the campus and branch market that are fastest growing, that I think will see the quickest recovery post COVID. And even now, where there are some meaningful headwinds in certain segments of the Enterprise because of COVID, we're doing really well. And I think, again, this is -- as a result of the significant differentiation that we have in the market. 
And I would also just add that, that differentiation is very difficult to replicate. I mean we now have 5 years of AI-driven solution building and learning that's happened in the market. That's given our capabilities, really some solid differentiation. This is going to be the fastest-growing vertical for Juniper. Enterprise all-up and campus is a very significant component of the enterprise. And as a result of that, we have been taking share over the last several years. And I think we're going to continue to take meaningful share going forward."

Now partially explained by a need to compare relative to last year. But I would say that it did exceed our expectations, including from an order standpoint. And what I really like about our performance in the Service Provider space is the diversity, both from the standpoint of geography. This is not a North America phenomenon or a European phenomenon, it's broad-based across every geography. 
The diversity of solutions and technologies, so we're seeing strength in routing, as you would expect, but we're also seeing strength in security as service providers gear up for 5G deployments. Platforms, MX has always been a workhorse in the Service Provider space. And we continue to invest in new LAN cards, new software capabilities. But we're starting to see some good PTX momentum and solid 400-gig wins in competitive bids with service providers. 
And last but not least, I will add that Tier 1 spending, Tier 1 U.S. Service Provider spending has actually been weak over the last year or so, as we've outlined in previous earnings calls, but we've actually seen a bit more, let's say, signs of life or resumption in spending by some Tier 1 operators as well, which is encouraging. Add to that, the differentiation. We've introduced, just in the Q1 time frame, our Paragon automation suite, and this really addresses a real need in the market for the types of tools that customers are looking for, for planning and provisioning and insights and assurance. 
And then we also launched our Cloud Metro strategy, which is really our big push into the metro space and announced 2 new ACX metro platforms and in fact shipped one of them already, the ACX7100, which is a 5G-ready high-density, high-capacity solution to address the future of 5G metro build-outs, and that's a net new opportunity for Juniper. So we've traditionally not had any meaningful presence here, but we expect us to contribute to our revenue performance over the next few years. So it's for that reason that we're now tracking up to the high end of our long-term model for this full year 2021."

We were talking before about it being further stabilization. 
If you recall, 2020, We were down 4% on a full year basis, and we thought we would get closer to 0 this year from negative 4 to something closer to 0. That's the further stabilization.  We're now calling SP based on the strength of the first half to be flat to slightly up. on a full year basis, which, as Rami mentioned, is more in line with our long-term model, actually the high end of our long-term model, whereas previously we were kind of tracking towards the low end.

And that continues to do phenomenally well for us. And Mist is no longer a WiFi solution. Mist is an architectural approach that's cloud-delivered AI-powered solution to everything from client to cloud. And what we're seeing is the business all-up under the Mist umbrella doing incredibly well, right? 
Like I said, doubling new logos, record number of million dollar deals, et cetera. The other acquisitions are still a little bit newer, so it's still earlier, but I'm very encouraged based on what I'm seeing thus far. Apstra, as an example, has seen early interest from many customers. The pipeline is very solid. And it's clear that there are many customers out there that are looking for the ability to deploy private cloud but are fearful of the operational complexity of private cloud. 
And Apstra provides the best solution that's truly multi-vendor. So it's not just working on top of Juniper underlay, but any vendor's underlay solution to provide that seamless, easy, intent-based private cloud experience. There is a need in the market and I firmly believe we have the best technology for it right now. 
128 Technology, again, there, the Mistification of that technology under the Mist umbrella is happening very rapidly. 
So we're introducing more and more capabilities. The second half of the year is going to be really important for wrapping up that solution. But even on a stand-alone basis, we're closing multimillion-dollar deals with managed service providers. We're seeing expansions of existing franchises that we have with 128 Technology. Federal government is especially interested in the security aspects of 128 Technology. So even though it's early, I'm actually quite optimistic about what we're seeing thus far."

However, I would say that if you take a look at how their businesses are doing, I haven't seen the latest headlines today, but I suspect they're doing quite well.  And I suspect they're going to continue to do quite well, and they cannot fuel that business without ongoing investments in their networks. 
So if the sort of the thrust of the question here is, is there demand that's happening within the cloud provider space that's trying to get ahead of some of the supply constraints in the industry? I believe that, yes, there's probably some of that that's happening right now, but I don't believe that's the only thing that's happening. 
I think we've executed well.  We preserved our footprint within the Cloud vertical. We've engaged as partners to our cloud customers. It's been broad-based across hyperscale and the cloud majors.

Now that the competitive solutions are out in the market, the competitive bake-offs are happening, we sort of get a good feel of what's out there and how the differentiation we had hoped to achieve is actually faring out with practical testing, and I feel good. I mean, let's just say that. We're winning, especially in wide area use cases, and this is across both the hyperscale as well as the smaller cloud providers. 
And then even in the data center, we've won 400-gig data center use cases, We're not yet ready to announce a hyperscale 400-gig data center win at this point. But we're going to continue to aggressively go after the full market that's out there, both wide area and data center.

We've listened closely to our customers. We understand what they want. And I think we were delivering solutions and have delivered solutions that addresses their biggest needs and requirements. 
With the Huawei sort of issue that's out there and whether that presents an opportunity for us, the answer is yes.  I think we do see some opportunities right now, the result of some concerns about Huawei. They're going to sort of play out in time. This is never going to be a sort of an overnight thing.

And then just as a quick follow-up. I'll just lay it out there.

Most of that would have showed up in Enterprise, given the customers -- sorry, the products predominantly being cloud-ready data center and AI-driven Enterprise-oriented revenue products. 
We're still on track for the full year to get to a 1% aggregate growth, so call it $45 million, give or take, for the year from a revenue perspective. And we do think these acquisitions, as we said before, will be dilutive in FY '21 by about $0.05 And that's something that we expect to correct here in the second half and actually be accretive here in 2022. So while they're a bit of a drag on overall earnings this year, we expect them to enable us to expand margins by -- in 2022 and beyond.

So a big part of our ARR growth that we mentioned at 28% is also very much tied to the full Mist solution, not just necessarily the WiFi. So in aggregate, we talked about, at Investor Day, that we think the lifetime value of the kind of the pull-through, if you will, the non-wireless LAN solution is about 2.5x of the WiFi business. So that's something that -- we're still in the very early innings of that. 
We're still leading largely with Mist itself and then pulling through the rest of the solution. But as we see the lifetime value and these customers continue to grow with EX and other parts of the portfolio, we feel confident in that kind of 2.5x ratio that we put out there."

We reported better-than-expected Q2 results, delivering a second consecutive quarter, which saw year-over-year revenue growth across all verticals and",1883,"Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss our Q2 2021 results. 
We reported better-than-expected Q2 results, delivering a second consecutive quarter, which saw year-over-year revenue growth across all verticals and geographies. We also experienced record orders in Q2, which helped us grow backlog, both sequentially and year-over-year. Momentum is strong entering the second half of the year. I'm encouraged by the diversity of the strength we are seeing, which is spread across verticals, customer solutions and geographies. While the strength is due in part to improve trends with some of our large strategic customers, particularly in the cloud and service provider verticals, we're also seeing strong momentum with new logos and an increased number of deals greater than $1 million, especially in the enterprise vertical. 
I would call out 3 factors driving our momentum: First, our focus on leading the industry and delivering simplified operations and a superior user experience, what we call experience-first networking is resonating in the market; our AI and software management tools are second to none and deliver meaningful customer value that's enabling us to accelerate our success and take share, particularly in the enterprise campus and the data center market, but also in service provider and cloud verticals. 
By leveraging software control points like Mist, Apstra and Juniper Paragon to improve customer operations and experience, we're not only creating sticky new software revenue stream, but also creating platforms that pulled through a broader suite of core Juniper infrastructure. 
Second, our teams are executing extremely well. Our internal alignment around customer solutions and investments in our go-to-market organization are enabling us to capitalize on our technical differentiation and benefit from improved end market conditions we're seeing. In addition, our customer satisfaction ratings are at record highs, reflecting the strong work of our engineering and services organization as well as our supply chain team, which continues to work tirelessly to meet customer demand in an extremely tight supply environment. 
Third, we are seeing improved end market conditions across verticals and geographies. As global businesses reopen and companies look to bring workers back to the office, many projects which were halted are resuming, and many new ones are starting as digital transformation and clarification initiatives accelerate. 
Enterprise, cloud and service provider customers are all recognizing the strategic importance of the network and investing to support a more distributed workforce, which is increasingly reliant on high bandwidth applications such as real-time video collaboration. While the demand environment is strong, we, like others in our industry, are managing through significant supply chain challenges. Customers have become more aware of these challenges and many are either placing orders early or providing significantly greater visibility into future projects. 
This is particularly true with some of our large strategic customers especially in the cloud and service provider verticals. We view these early orders and insight into our customers' longer-term plans as a positive development. Importantly, even excluding these accelerations, orders are estimated to have experienced mid-teens growth in the period with healthy momentum across verticals and customer solutions. Based on this trend, we now expect to grow our business approximately 6% in 2021 on a full year basis despite the challenging supply chain backdrop. I'm excited by the momentum we're seeing. The investments we're making are paying off, and I'm increasingly confident in our ability to not only grow our business this year, but to do so on a sustainable basis. 
Our strategy is down, and we're investing and succeeding in several big industry opportunities that should provide attractive tailwind over the next few years. The first area we're winning is the enterprise transition to AI-driven cloud architectures. Mist was one of the first to deliver on this vision with wireless and since the acquisition, we have brought the same automation, insight and agility to the wired land and now the WAN. This unique client-to-cloud approach for AI delivers superior end user and operator experiences, which is enabling us to both land new full stack wins defined as Wi-Fi, wired and SD-WAN and expand our opportunity with large existing accounts. While marketing messages can sound similar, we believe Juniper with Mist AI has fundamental architectural advantages that will stand the test of time, including a purpose-built microservices cloud architecture, 6 generation data science expertise, a unified AI engine across the land, wireless LAN SD-WAN and AI-driven support, led by the industry's only conversational systems market. 
This differentiation has enabled us to take share in key networking segments, which we believe will continue as the $20 billion campus in branch market transitions to AI-driven cloud architectures in the years to come. We're also continuing to see success with our 400-gig offerings, both in wide area as well as data center use cases. We now maintain more than 200 wins that span across hyperscale service provider and cloud major accounts, which is up materially on a quarter-over-quarter basis. We remain optimistic regarding our ability to not only protect our footprint, but also to capture new opportunities in these larger accounts. We continue to expect 400-gig deployments to begin later this year and present increasing tailwinds over the next few years. 
In addition, we're optimistic about our 5G metro opportunity. We believe the investments we're making in our Juniper Paragon automation suite as well as our ACF metro access and aggregation portfolio will position us to capitalize on this sizable and growing market. While it remains early, we're seeing healthy customer interest in our new metro portfolio, and we expect to continue to introduce new solutions over the next 18 months that should further enhance our ability to succeed in this market. 
Now I'd like to provide some additional insights into the quarter and address some of the key developments we're seeing from a customer solutions perspective. Starting with our automated WAN solution, while revenues slightly declined year-over-year due to the timing of shipments in the cloud, we experienced strong orders with solid momentum in both our Service Provider and Cloud segment. We saw healthy demand across both our MX and PTX product families and improved adoption of our newer products as well as our automation software portfolio. Our 400-gig solutions are performing well and enabling us to not only protect our existing footprint, but also to secure several net new wins. While we are continuing to see strong customer demand for our automated WAN solutions, these products are currently the most impacted by supply chain challenges and therefore, the most difficult for us to predict. As a result, despite very strong orders, we now expect our results from this segment to return to within the range of our long-term model, calling for a minus 1% decline to a 3% growth during the year, with supply likely to be the biggest determinant of where we will ultimately fall within this range. 
Our cloud-ready data center solutions experienced 28% year-over-year growth during the June quarter, an encouraging order trend from our cloud, enterprise and Service Provider customers. We saw strong momentum with new logos as well as an increase in average deal size in the period, including a meaningful increase in deals over $1 million. After exceeded expectations for a second consecutive quarter and it's creating a significant buzz in the market, this is leading to more software opportunities and full stack data center wins. Customer interest in our cloud-ready data center portfolio is high, and we remain optimistic regarding the outlook of this business. 
For the year, we believe our cloud-ready data center business is now tracking at the slightly above the high end of our long-term model, looking for 5% to 9% growth year-over-year. 
Finally, our AI-driven enterprise solutions also grew 28% year-over-year. Our Mist AI differentiation continues to resonate in the market as new logos increased 130% year-over-year and Mist orders experienced another quarter of solid triple-digit growth. Our mystified revenue from wireless LAN, wired assurance, Marvis Virtual Network Assistant and associated EX pull-through nearly doubled year-over-year, and we saw another quarter of record ES pull-through. I believe the missed pull-through opportunity will continue to grow, thanks to the recent introduction of the EX-4400, a groundbreaking new access switch that combines true enterprise-grade scalability and performance with the ease of AI-driven cloud operations. 
Mist also positively impacted our brand security business, which performed well in Q2, and we continue to make progress with 128 Technology, which we are integrating with our SRX Secure Branch Gateways under a common cloud and AI umbrella. The pipeline of SD-WAN opportunities remains strong, thanks to these technology differences, coupled with the unique synergy potential of a unified client-to-cloud enterprise portfolio from Juniper with end-to-end automation insight and action. 
In addition to strength with large Fortune 500 customers, we continue to see very strong momentum in the channel and success with smaller commercial accounts during Q2, which highlights the value of our AI-driven enterprise offerings to customers of all sizes and across all verticals. We believe Mist AI continues to offer unique and market-leading differentiation resulting in the best user and operator experiences. 
I remain encouraged by the momentum we're seeing in this business and remain confident our AI-driven enterprise solutions are likely to see double-digit growth in 2021. Our security revenue experienced strong results during the June quarter, and orders also exceeded expectations. 
Strength was especially notable in the high end of the market where we have historically been strong, although we saw growth across all customer verticals and most product families. Our connected security strategy is gaining traction in the market because the convergence of networking security provides us with a competitive advantage in the portions of the market where we are currently focused. We believe our technical strength in both security and networking will continue to provide tailwinds in future quarters and should enable our security business to achieve our growth objectives. 
Our software momentum is also strong. Our software and related services revenue grew 59% year-over-year in Q2 as we experienced growth with ratable subscription, solid uptake of our Flex software licenses and strong sales of certain perpetual on-box licenses. ARR grew 32% year-over-year in the period driven by a combination of mix subscriptions, ratable security software offering and the related services associated with these software offerings. We experienced record software orders in the quarter due to broad-based strength across verticals and use cases. We're seeing ongoing strength in ratable subscription offerings and improved adoption of our on-box select licenses, which are seeing traction across all of the customer verticals that we serve. 
Based on the momentum we're seeing, we remain confident in the long-term software and ARR targets we presented at our recent Investor Day. I'd like to mention that our Services team delivered another solid quarter and continued growth on a year-over-year basis due to strong renewals and service attach rates. Our services team continues to execute extremely well to ensure our customers receive an excellent experience. 
I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders. 
I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail."

I will start by discussing our second quarter results and end with some color on our outlook. We ended the second quarter of 2021 at $1.172 billion in revenue, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.43, both",997,"Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. 
I will start by discussing our second quarter results and end with some color on our outlook. We ended the second quarter of 2021 at $1.172 billion in revenue, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.43, both above the midpoint of our guidance. 
Revenue was up 8% year-over-year, with growth across all verticals and geographies. We experienced record levels of product orders during the second quarter with significant strength across all verticals and customer solutions. We believe some of this strength is attributable to industry supply chain challenges that are causing certain customers to place orders early in an effort to secure supply when needed. 
These early orders resulted in an increase in backlog and provide us with improved visibility into the second half of 2021. Even after adjusting for these early orders, total product orders are estimated to have grown mid-teens year-over-year, exceeding our expectations, with year-over-year growth across all verticals and customer solutions. 
Looking at our revenue by vertical. On a year-over-year basis, Service Provider grew 2%; cloud grew 12%; and Enterprise grew 12%. All verticals grew on a sequential basis. 
From a customer solution perspective, automated WAN solutions declined 3% year-over-year, while PTS product family posted year-over-year growth, our MX offerings declined year-over-year. While our automated WAN revenue declined due to the timing of shipments, orders grew year-over-year. 
Cloud-ready data center revenue increased 28% year-over-year as we experienced strong demand for our QFX product family across all customer verticals and geographies. 
And finally, AI-driven enterprise revenue increased 28% versus last year. Our Mist and EX product families both grew year-over-year. As Rami mentioned, total software and related services revenue was $173 million, an increase of 59% year-over-year. And our annual recurring revenue, or ARR, grew 32% year-over-year. 
Total security revenue which includes security products as well as services related to our security solutions was $172 million, an increase of 11% year-over-year. Security product sales grew 21% year-over-year. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, 4 were Cloud, 5 were Service Provider and 1 was an Enterprise. 
Our top 10 customers accounted for 33% of our total revenue as compared to 30% in Q2 2020. Non-GAAP gross margin was 60%, which was above the midpoint of our guidance, primarily due to higher revenue and lower service delivery costs. If it weren't for elevated logistics and other supply chain-related costs, we would have posted non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 60.5%. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 9% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, slightly above the high end of our guidance range, primarily due to higher variable compensation related to better-than-expected order momentum. Non-GAAP operating margin was 15.8% for the quarter which exceeded our expectations and the midpoint of the guidance looking for 14.6%. 
We exited the quarter with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $1.8 billion. The sequential increase was due to strong free cash flow generation, which was partially offset by our capital return program. Cash flow from operations was $257 million. From a capital return perspective, we paid $65 million in dividends, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share and repurchased $110 million worth of shares in the second quarter. 
Turning to our guidance. As I'm sure you are all aware, there is a worldwide shortage of semiconductors impacting many industries. Similar to others, we are experiencing ongoing supply constraints, which have resulted in extended lead times and elevated costs. We have invested to strengthen our supply chain and have increased inventory purchase commitments over the course of the last year. We continue to work closely with our suppliers to further enhance our resiliency and limit disruptions outside of our control to the best of our ability. Despite these actions, we believe extended lead times and elevated costs will likely persist for at least the next few quarters. 
While the situation is dynamic at this point in time, we believe we will have access to sufficient semiconductor supply to meet our full year financial forecast. 
Looking specifically at the third quarter. At the midpoint of guidance, revenue is expected to be up 5.5% year-over-year. We expect supply constraints to be particularly tight in the third quarter, which has been factored into our guidance. We expect our third quarter non-GAAP gross margins to be impacted by higher component costs related to supply constraints and higher expected service delivery costs. At the midpoint of guidance, earnings are expected to grow faster than revenue in the period despite the expected pressure from supply constraints. 
Moving on to our expectations for 2021. We have updated our full year revenue growth and profitability expectations to account for our better-than-expected Q2 results, and current expectations for the second half of 2021. We now expect full year revenue growth of approximately 6%, a point of which is expected to come from recently acquired assets. Our revised top line outlook is 150 basis points higher than the midpoint of our previous expectation of 4% to 5%. From a vertical perspective for 2021, Cloud is expected to grow faster than our long-term range of 1% to 5%. Enterprise is expected to grow towards the high end of our long-term model range of 5% to 9%, and Service Provider is expected to be flat to slightly up versus last year toward the high end of our guidance range. 
While non-GAAP gross margin can be difficult to predict, we now expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 59.5% for 2021, down from our previous expectation of approximately 60% due to the elevated freight and costs related to supply constraints we are now experiencing. 
We continue to expect full year non-GAAP operating margin to be flat to slightly up versus 2020 levels. On a full year basis, we expect non-GAAP earnings to grow faster than revenue. 
In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success, especially in this challenging environment. Now I'd like to open the call for questions."

So my first question here is on the guide. You reiterated your guide for Service Provider revenue to be flat to slightly up for the full year, which implies revenue for that vertical is likely to be likely to decline or to be flat in the second half of the year, which optically would appear conservative given the expectations for Service Providers to ramp spending into the second half of this year. Can you help bridge that variance there and maybe how that thinking is wrong? And then I have a follow-up."

We're encouraged by the momentum that we're seeing across the business internationally and also Tier 1 service provider strength in this country, in the U.S., also encouraged by the number of wins, 400-gig wins, which aren't really contributing to revenue in a very meaningful way yet, but I expect that to change in the second half of the year. Technology strong new products, both MX and PTX routing products are performing very well. So I like the trends that we're seeing in SP all up. Certainly, a great start of the year, there are a lot of dynamics around the second half of the year, supply being the 1 element of that dynamic that we just have to keep a watchful eye on. And all of that has fed into the outlook that we've provided for the SP segment.

What I like about this momentum is that it is really diverse. It cuts across geos, it cuts across our customer solutions, it cuts across the vertical segments. So we're firing on all cylinders on that front. There is definitely a COVID-related element where customers are, let's say, making sure that they're getting ahead of potential supply constraints. But even factoring that out, we're seeing very solid order momentum with new projects that are starting, old projects that were paused that are starting to resume again, the need to build out capacity to keep ahead of customer demand on the network are all coming to fruition. I think we're executing well. So we're essentially setting ourselves up to benefit from that recovery in the market. So that improved market condition is something that I think is going to be very good for us going forward. So I don't think this -- the demand strength is not a short-lived thing from my perspective. I have confidence that the combination of market dynamics and our own execution, product differentiation, go-to-market strength is all going to work for us on a sustainable basis."

I think we're laying the foundation with Metro this year for growth next year. So this would be a growth vector within the automated WAN and especially in the service provider segment for next year. And again, there's a very important element of our automated WAN solution that is software. And this is where our Paragon automation suite comes into the picture. We've recently rounded out that solution, introduced new capabilities into the market and actually won a competitive win with a Tier 1 telecom operator in Asia Pacific just recently, in fact, which I think speaks volumes to the strength of that software solution that we now have in the market and will only get stronger in time.

So from a revenue perspective, I don't believe it impacted our Q2 results materially. I mean we're very pleased with the results we posted of $1.172 billion, which is towards the high end of our range. Obviously, the profitability metrics were also quite strong in Q2. So I don't believe it had an impact on our future results. That said, it is something we're considering as we set the guidance for Q3 and the rest of the year. We did increase the full year revenue guidance again for the second time this year, up to 6% full year year-on-year growth, and previously, we were at 4% to 5%. So we are able to secure the supply, at least we believe we'll be able to secure the supply to go ahead and increase our revenue guidance. So it's not impacting us very negatively. However, it is part of that guide. We are definitely considering our ability to secure supply when we set our forward guidance. From a gross margin perspective, what's happening is we talked on the last call, at this point in time, we clearly knew on the last call that there were going to be some pressures because of the supply constraints, but we also expect at that time to have some alleviating pressures coming back towards us from the COVID perspective. So we were expecting some reduction in freight cost towards the second half of the year. Our current expectation does not call for that anymore. So we're seeing freight costs remain elevated throughout the rest of the year. That's our current anticipation. That coupled with with the increased component costs that we're seeing and expedite fees, et cetera, as resulted in us bringing the full year guide down from 60% to 59.5%. So I do believe these are temporary transitory costs, if you will. They should -- we should recover from these. That said, I do think it will take at least a few quarters, right? It's not something I anticipate recovering from in this quarter or next or, but I do think we will recover from this in the longer term. and allow us to expand our gross margins and operating profits even more robustly than this year's level where we do expect some operating margin expansion as well as earnings growth to be faster than revenue. So the profitability metrics are quite strong this year despite these pressures -- as these pressures alleviate, it should just allow us to double down on our profitability goals."

So Enterprise, I'm very pleased with our performance. And we have been doing well, performing well through -- from the beginning of the onset of the pandemic despite end market disruptions that our industry has faced. There's no doubt the economic uncertainty as a result of COVID persists, but it's getting better. And elements of the enterprise market that have essentially shut down, like take, for example, traditional [indiscernible] Enterprise are starting to recover again and projects are starting to emerge, and that will open up net new opportunities for us. And it's a good time because our differentiation in this space has never been better, quite frankly. We're seeing great growth in the AI-driven enterprise, of course, Mist being a very important component of that, but I also want to emphasize that there's another leg to the Enterprise tool and that is the data center. We've always done quite well in the data center space in the Enterprise. But I think now with the addition of the Apstra team, the technology, we've created some real lift to our solution to the differentiation in that space. So from a mix standpoint, the phenomenal growth and momentum just continues. Mist solution revenue which includes wireless, it includes wired, it includes software, it grew at nearly 2x year-over-year. If you think about Mist all up in terms of annualized order run rate, we're now over $400 million. So it's a pretty significant component of the total Juniper business. And then add to that, although it's early days with Apstra, the initial feedback from customers, the initial win rate has exceeded our expectations. And quite frankly, the pipeline that we've built has been absolutely phenomenal. So I think that Apstra and the data center opportunities have a lot of the early signals that we got from Mist shortly after we made that acquisition in 2019."

And clearly, we are anticipating some of the shortages and some of the buffer stocks, some of the resiliency efforts we put into place starting last year, really helped us in the first half and are going to continue to help us in the second half. However, material is getting tighter. So it is something that's going to impact us a bit, and we wanted to make sure we factor that into our second half guide, which again is up from where we were earlier in the year and on a full year basis in Q3. So I'm pretty pleased with the results. And I think given the strength of the bookings and the backlog we built, not normally we set up for a good second half, a good full year FY '21, but it's likely to leak into FY '22 as well. So I think it gives us a good head start. This bookings growth that we're seeing and the momentum that we have now is allowing for a solid revenue growth well above our at least low single-digit guidance range for this year and actually sets us up pretty favorably as we enter into 2022."

Clearly, you did, but it may have been in line with what you had expected. Therefore, you're saying we didn't see a variance from our expectations. And I don't think that was the question that was asked. I think the question was asked was if you had no supply constraints, how much impact, what is it -- how much larger were the revenues have been. So could you clarify that point? Because I think you're answering a different question than what he was asking and what analysts probably heard relative to that key question. The other thing I wanted to clarify is you gave growth rates in software, both in revenues and ARR, you also gave revenue growth in security products. Can you give us what the organic growth rates were on those two?"

So from a -- yes, just to clarify, the comment about supply constraints and the impact it had on Q2 was with our own guidance from where we expected the quarter to land. So we did factor in some supply constraints when we set our Q2 guidance. And you're right that the quarter played out actually a little bit more favorably than we expected, but largely in line, and it didn't negatively impact our ability to hit our results in Q2. The one area that it is impacting the results, and we called that out in the prepared remarks was in gross margin, which was negatively impacted by about 50 basis points. Gross margin was quite solid, above the midpoint of Q2 at 60%, but it would have been 60.5% were it not for some of these transitory costs, both of kind of a carryover from last year's COVID-related freight costs as well as some of the supply constraints that are starting to impact Q2. So yes, to clarify that, that is what we intended to say. 
On the organic -- I mean, we don't break out the organic versus nonorganic. I'm trying to understand when you say nonorganic, are you're rarely referring to the most recent acquisitions of the last 3 quarters or so. And I can tell you, those are on track, we're very excited about the momentum we're seeing there. We expect them to add 1 point of revenue growth. So that's in the $45 million to $50 million area on a full year basis. Those numbers, on a quarterly basis, aren't that impactful really to our overall software growth and/or our security growth. They are a significant minority as compared to the strength we have in our security business and our software business. They're a big part of our future, both software as well as security, but to date, Q2 results were not significantly impacted by those most recent acquisitions. Clearly, if you go back to the Mist acquisition days, there's a significant impact on our growth due to Mist on the software side, in particular, 0 impact to security. But on the software side, this is a big driver for our software business, particularly our Software as a Service business, which is embedded in that number."

It was a record quarter for us in that timeframe. Our Cloud orders, in fact, were up over 100% year-over-year. So we're seeing real great strength there, and it's broad-based. We indicated in the last quarter that there has been a resumption of spend by our largest cloud provider customer that continued into the Q2 timeframe, but it also is true for the rest of the hyperscale customers as well as what we define as cloud majors. So Tier 2, Tier 3 cloud providers where the -- defined as customers whose businesses depend on delivering some sort of Cloud services. It continues from there. Momentum and strength, double-digit, well into double-digit territory in terms of both switching and routing, WAN and data center and then 400-gig wins. The momentum we're seeing of 400-gig wins across large Tier 1 hyperscale customers as well as the broader cloud major customers is very, very encouraging. And there, I'd say that the differentiation that we have introduced into the market with our products across the full stack of technology from our network operating system, Gentiva, our silicon technology. We have inserted silicon capabilities that are now in the market that we anticipated would be differentiators, things around security, for example, that have now resulted in wins for us, and that gives us a lot of confidence that what we -- the design point that we have chosen that we have decided on are actually paying off for us. So this is why Hulu, we're now anticipating that we're going to grow faster than the full year guide that we provided for cloud provider in the last Analyst Day."

Mix is the biggest determinant, product and/or vertical is a high correlation. However, even within vertical sometimes you might have some customer mix where you're more advantaged than other periods of time, maybe their geographic as an example, where we do have a higher margin in, say, the U.S. Tier 1s than we might in some parts of Asia as an example. So there's a lot of mix to consider, but generally speaking, you're correct in that the vertical/product mix and aggregate was unfavorable. We offset some of that with some software growth, which is a little more slanted, particularly the off-box, higher-margin software is a little more -- as a percentage a little higher in our enterprise, our cloud-ready data center, AI-driven enterprise businesses than it is our traditional kind of service provider routing domain where we do have a fair amount of software, but it's more on box and has less margin impact overall. So that is part of the mix going forward. And the last thing I'd call out Q2, we saw a very strong services gross margin in Q2, which was the primary reason why our gross margin was beyond the midpoint of our guidance. the product margin came in largely in line with our expectations, even with the mix shift that you're talking about, but services exceeded our expectations, which resulted in the overall increase from midpoint."

So I mean, clearly, it's broad-based and it's very encouraging, and it bodes well for future quarters in terms of revenue, in terms of visibility that we have. 
You're right. In terms of the specific wins and the use cases within hyperscalers, our wins are WAN and inter data center not yet intradata center, although these continue to be opportunities that we pursue, and the rest of the cloud provider space, we have wins across the board that include WAN, data center interconnect as well as inside of the data center.

We reported better-than-expected Q2 results, delivering a second consecutive quarter, which saw year-over-year revenue growth across all verticals and",1883,"Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss our Q2 2021 results. 
We reported better-than-expected Q2 results, delivering a second consecutive quarter, which saw year-over-year revenue growth across all verticals and geographies. We also experienced record orders in Q2, which helped us grow backlog, both sequentially and year-over-year. Momentum is strong entering the second half of the year. I'm encouraged by the diversity of the strength we are seeing, which is spread across verticals, customer solutions and geographies. While the strength is due in part to improve trends with some of our large strategic customers, particularly in the Cloud and Service Provider verticals, we're also seeing strong momentum with new logos and an increased number of deals greater than $1 million, especially in the Enterprise vertical. 
I would call out 3 factors driving our momentum: First, our focus on leading the industry and delivering simplified operations and a superior user experience, what we call experience-first networking is resonating in the market; our AI and software management tools are second to none and deliver meaningful customer value that's enabling us to accelerate our success and take share, particularly in the Enterprise campus and the data center market, but also in Service Provider and Cloud verticals. 
By leveraging software control points like Mist, Apstra and Juniper Paragon to improve customer operations and experience, we're not only creating sticky new software revenue stream, but also creating platforms that pull through a broader suite of core Juniper infrastructure. 
Second, our teams are executing extremely well. Our internal alignment around customer solutions and investments in our go-to-market organization are enabling us to capitalize on our technical differentiation and benefit from improved end market conditions we're seeing. In addition, our customer satisfaction ratings are at record highs, reflecting the strong work of our engineering and services organization as well as our supply chain team, which continues to work tirelessly to meet customer demand in an extremely tight supply environment. 
Third, we are seeing improved end market conditions across verticals and geographies. As global businesses reopen and companies look to bring workers back to the office, many projects which were halted are resuming, and many new ones are starting as digital transformation and clarification initiatives accelerate. 
Enterprise, Cloud and Service Provider customers are all recognizing the strategic importance of the network and investing to support a more distributed workforce, which is increasingly reliant on high bandwidth applications such as real-time video collaboration. While the demand environment is strong, we, like others in our industry, are managing through significant supply chain challenges. Customers have become more aware of these challenges and many are either placing orders early or providing significantly greater visibility into future projects. 
This is particularly true with some of our large strategic customers especially in the Cloud and Service Provider verticals. We view these early orders and insight into our customers' longer-term plans as a positive development. Importantly, even excluding these accelerations, orders are estimated to have experienced mid-teens growth in the period with healthy momentum across verticals and customer solutions. Based on this trend, we now expect to grow our business approximately 6% in 2021 on a full year basis despite the challenging supply chain backdrop. I'm excited by the momentum we're seeing. The investments we're making are paying off, and I'm increasingly confident in our ability to not only grow our business this year, but to do so on a sustainable basis. 
Our strategy is down, and we're investing and succeeding in several big industry opportunities that should provide attractive tailwind over the next few years. The first area we're winning is the Enterprise transition to AI-driven Cloud architectures. Mist was one of the first to deliver on this vision with wireless and since the acquisition, we have brought the same automation, insight and agility to the wired land and now the win. This unique client-to-cloud approach for AI delivers superior end user and operator experiences, which is enabling us to both land new full stack wins defined as Wi-Fi, wired and SD-WAN and expand our opportunity with large existing accounts. 
While marketing messages can sound similar, we believe Juniper with Mist AI has fundamental architectural advantages that will stand the test of time, including a purpose-built microservices Cloud architecture, 6 generation data science expertise, a unified AI engine across the land, wireless LAN SD-WAN and AI-driven support, led by the industry's only conversational systems market. 
This differentiation has enabled us to take share in key networking segments, which we believe will continue as the $20 billion campus in branch market transitions to AI-driven Cloud architectures in the years to come. We're also continuing to see success with our 400-gig offerings, both in wide area as well as data center use cases. We now maintain more than 200 wins that span across hyperscale Service Provider and Cloud major accounts, which is up materially on a quarter-over-quarter basis. We remain optimistic regarding our ability to not only protect our footprint, but also to capture new opportunities in these larger accounts. We continue to expect 400-gig deployments to begin later this year and present increasing tailwinds over the next few years. 
In addition, we're optimistic about our 5G metro opportunity. We believe the investments we're making in our Juniper Paragon automation suite as well as our ACF metro access and aggregation portfolio will position us to capitalize on this sizable and growing market. While it remains early, we're seeing healthy customer interest in our new metro portfolio, and we expect to continue to introduce new solutions over the next 18 months that should further enhance our ability to succeed in this market. 
Now I'd like to provide some additional insights into the quarter and address some of the key developments we're seeing from a customer solutions perspective. Starting with our automated WAN solution, while revenues slightly declined year-over-year due to the timing of shipments in the Cloud, we experienced strong orders with solid momentum in both our Service Provider and Cloud segment. We saw healthy demand across both our MX and PTX product families and improved adoption of our newer products as well as our automation software portfolio. 
Our 400-gig solutions are performing well and enabling us to not only protect our existing footprint, but also to secure several net new wins. While we are continuing to see strong customer demand for our automated WAN solutions, these products are currently the most impacted by supply chain challenges and therefore, the most difficult for us to predict. As a result, despite very strong orders, we now expect our results from this segment to return to within the range of our long-term model, calling for a minus 1% decline to a 3% growth during the year, with supply likely to be the biggest determinant of where we will ultimately fall within this range. 
Our Cloud-ready data center solutions experienced 28% year-over-year growth during the June quarter, an encouraging order trend from our Cloud, Enterprise and Service Provider customers. We saw strong momentum with new logos as well as an increase in average deal size in the period, including a meaningful increase in deals over $1 million. After exceeded expectations for a second consecutive quarter and it's creating a significant buzz in the market, this is leading to more software opportunities and full stack data center wins. Customer interest in our Cloud-ready data center portfolio is high, and we remain optimistic regarding the outlook of this business. 
For the year, we believe our Cloud-ready data center business is now tracking at the slightly above the high end of our long-term model, looking for 5% to 9% growth year-over-year. 
Finally, our AI-driven Enterprise solutions also grew 28% year-over-year. Our Mist AI differentiation continues to resonate in the market as new logos increased 130% year-over-year and Mist orders experienced another quarter of solid triple-digit growth. Our Mistified revenue from wireless LAN, wired assurance, Marvis Virtual Network Assistant and associated EX pull-through nearly doubled year-over-year, and we saw another quarter of record ES pull-through. I believe the missed pull-through opportunity will continue to grow, thanks to the recent introduction of the EX-4400, a groundbreaking new access switch that combines true Enterprise-grade scalability and performance with the ease of AI-driven Cloud operations. 
Mist also positively impacted our brand security business, which performed well in Q2, and we continue to make progress with 128 Technology, which we are integrating with our SRX Secure Branch Gateways under a common Cloud and AI umbrella. The pipeline of SD-WAN opportunities remains strong, thanks to these technology differences, coupled with the unique synergy potential of a unified client-to-cloud Enterprise portfolio from Juniper with end-to-end automation insight and action. 
In addition to strength with large Fortune 500 customers, we continue to see very strong momentum in the channel and success with smaller commercial accounts during Q2, which highlights the value of our AI-driven Enterprise offerings to customers of all sizes and across all verticals. We believe Mist AI continues to offer unique and market-leading differentiation resulting in the best user and operator experiences. I remain encouraged by the momentum we're seeing in this business and remain confident our AI-driven Enterprise solutions are likely to see double-digit growth in 2021. 
Our security revenue experienced strong results during the June quarter, and orders also exceeded expectations. Strength was especially notable in the high end of the market where we have historically been strong, although we saw growth across all customer verticals and most product families. Our connected security strategy is gaining traction in the market because the convergence of networking security provides us with a competitive advantage in the portions of the market where we are currently focused. We believe our technical strength in both security and networking will continue to provide tailwinds in future quarters and should enable our security business to achieve our growth objectives. 
Our software momentum is also strong. Our software and related services revenue grew 59% year-over-year in Q2 as we experienced growth with ratable subscription, solid uptake of our Flex software licenses and strong sales of certain perpetual on-box licenses. ARR grew 32% year-over-year in the period driven by a combination of mix subscriptions, ratable security software offering and the related services associated with these software offerings. We experienced record software orders in the quarter due to broad-based strength across verticals and use cases. We're seeing ongoing strength in ratable subscription offerings and improved adoption of our on-box select licenses, which are seeing traction across all of the customer verticals that we serve. 
Based on the momentum we're seeing, we remain confident in the long-term software and ARR targets we presented at our recent Investor Day. I'd like to mention that our Services team delivered another solid quarter and continued growth on a year-over-year basis due to strong renewals and service attach rates. Our services team continues to execute extremely well to ensure our customers receive an excellent experience. 
I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders. 
I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail."

I will start by discussing our second quarter results and end with some color on our outlook. We ended the second quarter of 2021 at $1.172 billion in revenue, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.43, both",997,"Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. 
I will start by discussing our second quarter results and end with some color on our outlook. We ended the second quarter of 2021 at $1.172 billion in revenue, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.43, both above the midpoint of our guidance. 
Revenue was up 8% year-over-year, with growth across all verticals and geographies. We experienced record levels of product orders during the second quarter with significant strength across all verticals and customer solutions. We believe some of this strength is attributable to industry supply chain challenges that are causing certain customers to place orders early in an effort to secure supply when needed. 
These early orders resulted in an increase in backlog and provide us with improved visibility into the second half of 2021. Even after adjusting for these early orders, total product orders are estimated to have grown mid-teens year-over-year, exceeding our expectations, with year-over-year growth across all verticals and customer solutions. 
Looking at our revenue by vertical. On a year-over-year basis, Service Provider grew 2%; Cloud grew 12%; and Enterprise grew 12%. All verticals grew on a sequential basis. 
From a customer solution perspective, automated WAN solutions declined 3% year-over-year, while PTS product family posted year-over-year growth, our MX offerings declined year-over-year. While our automated WAN revenue declined due to the timing of shipments, orders grew year-over-year. 
Cloud-ready data center revenue increased 28% year-over-year as we experienced strong demand for our QFX product family across all customer verticals and geographies. 
And finally, AI-driven Enterprise revenue increased 28% versus last year. Our Mist and EX product families both grew year-over-year. As Rami mentioned, total software and related services revenue was $173 million, an increase of 59% year-over-year. And our annual recurring revenue, or ARR, grew 32% year-over-year. 
Total security revenue which includes security products as well as services related to our security solutions was $172 million, an increase of 11% year-over-year. Security product sales grew 21% year-over-year. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, 4 were Cloud, 5 were Service Provider and 1 was an Enterprise. 
Our top 10 customers accounted for 33% of our total revenue as compared to 30% in Q2 2020. Non-GAAP gross margin was 60%, which was above the midpoint of our guidance, primarily due to higher revenue and lower service delivery costs. If it weren't for elevated logistics and other supply chain-related costs, we would have posted non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 60.5%. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 9% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, slightly above the high end of our guidance range, primarily due to higher variable compensation related to better-than-expected order momentum. Non-GAAP operating margin was 15.8% for the quarter which exceeded our expectations and the midpoint of the guidance looking for 14.6%. 
We exited the quarter with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $1.8 billion. The sequential increase was due to strong free cash flow generation, which was partially offset by our capital return program. Cash flow from operations was $257 million. From a capital returns perspective, we paid $65 million in dividends, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share and repurchased $110 million worth of shares in the second quarter. 
Turning to our guidance. As I'm sure you are all aware, there is a worldwide shortage of semiconductors impacting many industries. Similar to others, we are experiencing ongoing supply constraints, which have resulted in extended lead times and elevated costs. We have invested to strengthen our supply chain and have increased inventory purchase commitments over the course of the last year. We continue to work closely with our suppliers to further enhance our resiliency and limit disruptions outside of our control to the best of our ability. Despite these actions, we believe extended lead times and elevated costs will likely persist for at least the next few quarters. 
While the situation is dynamic at this point in time, we believe we will have access to sufficient semiconductor supply to meet our full year financial forecast. 
Looking specifically at the third quarter. At the midpoint of guidance, revenue is expected to be up 5.5% year-over-year. We expect supply constraints to be particularly tight in the third quarter, which has been factored into our guidance. We expect our third quarter non-GAAP gross margins to be impacted by higher component costs related to supply constraints and higher expected service delivery costs. At the midpoint of guidance, earnings are expected to grow faster than revenue in the period despite the expected pressure from supply constraints. 
Moving on to our expectations for 2021. We have updated our full year revenue growth and profitability expectations to account for our better-than-expected Q2 results, and current expectations for the second half of 2021. We now expect full year revenue growth of approximately 6%, a point of which is expected to come from recently acquired assets. Our revised top line outlook is 150 basis points higher than the midpoint of our previous expectation of 4% to 5%. From a vertical perspective for 2021, Cloud is expected to grow faster than our long-term range of 1% to 5%. Enterprise is expected to grow towards the high end of our long-term model range of 5% to 9%, and Service Provider is expected to be flat to slightly up versus last year toward the high end of our guidance range. 
While non-GAAP gross margin can be difficult to predict, we now expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 59.5% for 2021, down from our previous expectation of approximately 60% due to the elevated freight and costs related to supply constraints we are now experiencing. 
We continue to expect full year non-GAAP operating margin to be flat to slightly up versus 2020 levels. On a full year basis, we expect non-GAAP earnings to grow faster than revenue. 
In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success, especially in this challenging environment. Now I'd like to open the call for questions."

We're encouraged by the momentum that we're seeing across the business internationally and also Tier 1 Service Provider strength in this country, in the U.S., also encouraged by the number of wins, 400-gig wins, which aren't really contributing to revenue in a very meaningful way yet, but I expect that to change in the second half of the year. Technology strong new products, both MX and PTX routing products are performing very well. So I like the trends that we're seeing in SP all up. Certainly, a great start of the year, there are a lot of dynamics around the second half of the year, supply being one element of that dynamic that we just have to keep a watchful eye on.

That will take some time to play through as we do have a fair amount of backlog that was on previous pricing levels that still need to kind of ship. But as we continue to increase our bookings going forward, we should see a positive impact from our recent pricing changes. It wasn't across the board for all products, but it was a good percentage of our products in an attempt to offset some of the pressures we're seeing. 
But it will play out over a fair period of time. Something we do periodically, making sure we have the right price for the right value that we deliver to our customers, it's something we're very focused on and something that we expect to play out in the form of improved profitability over time. It didn't have an impact on Q2 results. The price change came towards the end of the second quarter, and it really will play out over the next several quarters rather than have any impact on Q2."

I mean we do expect volume to be up, our software mix should be up, which would be obviously tailwinds and potentially positive drivers to gross margin improvement -- potential gross margin improvement.

What I like about this momentum is that it is really diverse. It cuts across geos, it cuts across our customer solutions, it cuts across the vertical segments. So we're firing on all cylinders on that front. There is definitely a COVID-related element where customers are, let's say, making sure that they're getting ahead of potential supply constraints. 
But even factoring that out, we're seeing very solid order momentum with new projects that are starting, old projects that were paused that are starting to resume again, the need to build out capacity to keep ahead of customer demand on the network are all coming to fruition. I think we're executing well. So we're essentially setting ourselves up to benefit from that recovery in the market. So that improved market condition is something that I think is going to be very good for us going forward. So I don't think this -- the demand strength is not a short-lived thing from my perspective.

I think we're laying the foundation with Metro this year for growth next year. So this would be a growth vector within the automated WAN and especially in the Service Provider segment for next year. 
And again, there's a very important element of our automated WAN solution that is software. And this is where our Paragon automation suite comes into the picture. We've recently rounded out that solution, introduced new capabilities into the market and actually won a competitive win with a Tier 1 telecom operator in Asia Pacific just recently, in fact, which I think speaks volumes to the strength of that software solution that we now have in the market and will only get stronger in time.

From a gross margin perspective, what's happening is we talked on the last call, at this point in time, we clearly knew on the last call that there were going to be some pressures because of the supply constraints, but we also expect at that time to have some alleviating pressures coming back towards us from the COVID perspective. So we were expecting some reduction in freight cost towards the second half of the year. Our current expectation does not call for that anymore. So we're seeing freight costs remain elevated throughout the rest of the year. That's our current anticipation. That coupled with the increased component costs that we're seeing and expedite fees, et cetera, as resulted in us bringing the full year guide down from 60% to 59.5%. 
So I do believe these are temporary transitory costs, if you will. They should -- we should recover from these. That said, I do think it will take at least a few quarters, right? It's not something I anticipate recovering from in this quarter or next or, but I do think we will recover from this in the longer term. and allow us to expand our gross margins and operating profits even more robustly than this year's level where we do expect some operating margin expansion as well as earnings growth to be faster than revenue. So the profitability metrics are quite strong this year despite these pressures. As these pressures alleviate, it should just allow us to double down on our profitability goals."

First, I did want to go back to the kind of this Q4 implied revenue guidance. I understand the supply chain impacts, but it does seem like you guys were able to kind of beat numbers on the top line, the last 2 quarters, you were able to fight through that somewhat. It sounds like you have supply for the year and clearly, the orders are there. So maybe what's changing with the ability to continue with mid-single or mid- to high single-digit growth in Q4 compared to what you're able to do in the prior 2 quarters? And then secondly, if we could just dig a little bit more into the Enterprise. Rami, you talked about the $1 million deals. Can you kind of just give us an update there, maybe scale that a little bit, talk a little bit about win rates and where you are with Salesforce. Is this more to grow from here? Is it also getting more at-bats, if you can give us an update on Enterprise?"

Maybe I'll start with the second question first, and then Ken, I'll pass it to you to talk a little bit more about the supply chain related questions.

Maybe I'll start with the second question first, and then Ken, I'll pass it to you to talk a little bit more about the supply chain related questions. So Enterprise, I'm very pleased with our performance. And we have been doing well, performing well through -- from the beginning of the onset of the pandemic despite end market disruptions that our industry has faced. There's no doubt the economic uncertainty as a result of COVID persists, but it's getting better. And elements of the Enterprise market that have essentially shut down, like take, for example, traditional [ carpeted ] Enterprise are starting to recover again and projects are starting to emerge, and that will open up net new opportunities for us. And it's a good time because our differentiation in this space has never been better, quite frankly. We're seeing great growth in the AI-driven Enterprise, of course, Mist being a very important component of that, but I also want to emphasize that there's another leg to the Enterprise tool and that is the data center. We've always done quite well in the data center space in the Enterprise. 
But I think now with the addition of the Apstra team, the technology, we've created some real lift to our solution to the differentiation in that space. So from a mix standpoint, the phenomenal growth and momentum just continues. Mist solution revenue which includes wireless, it includes wired, it includes software, it grew at nearly 2x year-over-year. If you think about Mist all up in terms of annualized order run rate, we're now over $400 million. So it's a pretty significant component of the total Juniper business. And then add to that, although it's early days with Apstra, the initial feedback from customers, the initial win rate has exceeded our expectations. And quite frankly, the pipeline that we've built has been absolutely phenomenal. So I think that Apstra and the data center opportunities have a lot of the early signals that we got from Mist shortly after we made that acquisition in 2019."

And on the Q4 guide perspective, as you mentioned, Tim, we had a very solid first half, beat our midpoint of guidance, both in Q1 and Q2, raised guidance in Q2 and raised again in Q3 here on this call, and raised the full year at 6%. So we're pleased with the execution and the momentum we're seeing on the revenue side. That said, supply constraints are tighter now than they were in the first half. I mean a lot of this has to do with this -- our own inventory levels. And clearly, we are anticipating some of the shortages and some of the buffer stocks, some of the resiliency efforts we put into place starting last year, really helped us in the first half and are going to continue to help us in the second half. 
However, material is getting tighter. So it is something that's going to impact us a bit, and we wanted to make sure we factor that into our second half guide, which again is up from where we were earlier in the year and on a full year basis in Q3. So I'm pretty pleased with the results. And I think given the strength of the bookings and the backlog we built, not normally we set up for a good second half, a good full year FY '21, but it's likely to leak into FY '22 as well. So I think it gives us a good head start. This bookings growth that we're seeing and the momentum that we have now is allowing for a solid revenue growth well above our at least low single-digit guidance range for this year and actually sets us up pretty favorably as we enter into 2022."

Because I think you're answering a different question than what he was asking and what analysts probably heard relative to that key question. The other thing I wanted to clarify is you gave growth rates in software, both in revenues and ARR, you also gave revenue growth in security products.

So from a -- yes, just to clarify, the comment about supply constraints and the impact it had on Q2 was with our own guidance from where we expected the quarter to land. So we did factor in some supply constraints when we set our Q2 guidance. And you're right that the quarter played out actually a little bit more favorably than we expected, but largely in line, and it didn't negatively impact our ability to hit our results in Q2. The one area that is impacting the results, and we called that out in the prepared remarks was in gross margin, which was negatively impacted by about 50 basis points. Gross margin was quite solid, above the midpoint of Q2 at 60%, but it would have been 60.5% were it not for some of these transitory costs, both of kind of a carryover from last year's COVID-related freight costs as well as some of the supply constraints that are starting to impact Q2. So yes, to clarify that, that is what we intended to say. 
On the organic -- I mean, we don't break out the organic versus nonorganic. I'm trying to understand when you say nonorganic, are you're rarely referring to the most recent acquisitions of the last 3 quarters or so. And I can tell you, those are on track, we're very excited about the momentum we're seeing there. We expect them to add one point of revenue growth. So that's in the $45 million to $50 million area on a full year basis. Those numbers, on a quarterly basis, aren't that impactful really to our overall software growth and/or our security growth. 
They are a significant minority as compared to the strength we have in our security business and our software business. They're a big part of our future, both software as well as security, but to date, Q2 results were not significantly impacted by those most recent acquisitions. Clearly, if you go back to the Mist acquisition days, there's a significant impact on our growth due to Mist on the software side, in particular, 0 impact to security. But on the software side, Mist is a big driver for our software business, particularly our Software as a Service business, which is embedded in that number."

It was a record quarter for us in that timeframe. Our Cloud orders, in fact, were up over 100% year-over-year. So we're seeing real great strength there, and it's broad-based. We indicated in the last quarter that there has been a resumption of spend by our largest Cloud provider customer that continued into the Q2 timeframe, but it also is true for the rest of the hyperscale customers as well as what we define as Cloud majors. So Tier 2, Tier 3 Cloud providers where the -- defined as customers whose businesses depend on delivering some sort of Cloud services. It continues from there. 
Momentum and strength, double-digit, well into double-digit territory in terms of both switching and routing, WAN and data center and then 400-gig wins. The momentum we're seeing of 400-gig wins across large Tier 1 hyperscale customers as well as the broader Cloud major customers is very, very encouraging. And dare I say that the differentiation that we have introduced into the market with our products across the full stack of technology from our network operating system, Junos Evolved to our silicon technology. We have inserted silicon capabilities that are now in the market that we anticipated would be differentiators, things around security, for example, that have now resulted in wins for us, and that gives us a lot of confidence that what we -- the design point that we have chosen that we have decided on are actually paying off for us. So this is why we're now anticipating that we're going to grow faster than the full year guide that we provided for Cloud provider in the last Analyst Day."

Mix is the biggest determinant, product and/or vertical is a high correlation. However, even within vertical sometimes you might have some customer mix where you're more advantaged than other periods of time, maybe their geographic as an example, where we do have a higher margin in, say, the U.S. Tier 1s than we might in some parts of Asia as an example. So there's a lot of mix to consider, but generally speaking, you're correct in that the vertical/product mix and aggregate was unfavorable. We offset some of that with some software growth, which is a little more slanted, particularly the off-box, higher-margin software is a little more -- as a percentage a little higher in our Enterprise, our Cloud-ready data center, AI-driven Enterprise businesses than it is our traditional kind of Service Provider routing domain where we do have a fair amount of software, but it's more on box and has less margin impact overall. 
So that is part of the mix going forward. And the last thing I'd call out Q2, we saw a very strong services gross margin in Q2, which was the primary reason why our gross margin was beyond the midpoint of our guidance. The product margin came in largely in line with our expectations, even with the mix shift that you're talking about, but services exceeded our expectations, which resulted in the overall increase from midpoint."

You're right. In terms of the specific wins and the use cases within hyperscalers, our wins are WAN and inter data center not yet intradata center, although these continue to be opportunities that we pursue, and the rest of the Cloud Provider space, we have wins across the board that include WAN, data center interconnect as well as inside of the data center.

We reported better-than-expected Q2 results, delivering a second consecutive quarter, which saw year-over-year revenue growth across all verticals and geographies. We also experienced record orders in Q2, which helped us grow backlog, both sequentially and year-over-year. Momentum is strong entering the second half of the year. I'm encouraged by the diversity of the strength we are seeing, which is spread across verticals, customer solutions and geographies. While the strength is due in part to improve trends with some of our large strategic customers, particularly in the Cloud and Service Provider verticals, we're also seeing strong momentum with new logos and an increased number of deals greater than $1 million, especially in the Enterprise vertical. 
I would call out 3 factors driving our momentum: First, our focus on leading the industry and delivering simplified operations and a superior user experience, what we call experience-first networking is resonating in the market; our AI and software management tools are second to none and deliver meaningful customer value that's enabling us to accelerate our success and take share, particularly in the Enterprise campus and the data center market, but also in Service Provider and Cloud verticals. 
By leveraging software control points like Mist, Apstra and Juniper Paragon to improve customer operations and experience, we're not only creating sticky new software revenue stream, but also creating platforms that pull through a broader suite of core Juniper infrastructure. 
Second, our teams are executing extremely well. Our internal alignment around customer solutions and investments in our go-to-market organization are enabling us to capitalize on our technical differentiation and benefit from improved end market conditions we're seeing. In addition, our customer satisfaction ratings are at record highs, reflecting the strong work of our engineering and services organization as well as our supply chain team, which continues to work tirelessly to meet customer demand in an extremely tight supply environment. 
Third, we are seeing improved end market conditions across verticals and geographies. As global businesses reopen and companies look to bring workers back to the office, many projects which were halted are resuming, and many new ones are starting as digital transformation and clarification initiatives accelerate. 
Enterprise, Cloud and Service Provider customers are all recognizing the strategic importance of the network and investing to support a more distributed workforce, which is increasingly reliant on high bandwidth applications such as real-time video collaboration. While the demand environment is strong, we, like others in our industry, are managing through significant supply chain challenges. Customers have become more aware of these challenges and many are either placing orders early or providing significantly greater visibility into future projects. 
This is particularly true with some of our large strategic customers especially in the Cloud and Service Provider verticals. We view these early orders and insight into our customers' longer-term plans as a positive development. Importantly, even excluding these accelerations, orders are estimated to have experienced mid-teens growth in the period with healthy momentum across verticals and customer solutions. Based on this trend, we now expect to grow our business approximately 6% in 2021 on a full year basis despite the challenging supply chain backdrop. I'm excited by the momentum we're seeing. The investments we're making are paying off, and I'm increasingly confident in our ability to not only grow our business this year, but to do so on a sustainable basis. 
Our strategy is down, and we're investing and succeeding in several big industry opportunities that should provide attractive tailwind over the next few years. The first area we're winning is the Enterprise transition to AI-driven Cloud architectures. Mist was one of the first to deliver on this vision with wireless and since the acquisition, we have brought the same automation, insight and agility to the wired land and now the win. This unique client-to-cloud approach for AI delivers superior end user and operator experiences, which is enabling us to both land new full stack wins defined as Wi-Fi, wired and SD-WAN and expand our opportunity with large existing accounts. 
While marketing messages can sound similar, we believe Juniper with Mist AI has fundamental architectural advantages that will stand the test of time, including a purpose-built microservices Cloud architecture, 6 generation data science expertise, a unified AI engine across the land, wireless LAN SD-WAN and AI-driven support, led by the industry's only conversational systems market. 
This differentiation has enabled us to take share in key networking segments, which we believe will continue as the $20 billion campus and branch market transitions to AI-driven Cloud architectures in the years to come. We're also continuing to see success with our 400-gig offerings, both in wide area as well as data center use cases. We now maintain more than 200 wins that span across hyperscale Service Provider and Cloud major accounts, which is up materially on a quarter-over-quarter basis. We remain optimistic regarding our ability to not only protect our footprint, but also to capture new opportunities in these larger accounts. We continue to expect 400-gig deployments to begin later this year and present increasing tailwinds over the next few years. 
In addition, we're optimistic about our 5G metro opportunity. We believe the investments we're making in our Juniper Paragon automation suite as well as our ACF metro access and aggregation portfolio will position us to capitalize on this sizable and growing market. While it remains early, we're seeing healthy customer interest in our new metro portfolio, and we expect to continue to introduce new solutions over the next 18 months that should further enhance our ability to succeed in this market. 
Now I'd like to provide some additional insights into the quarter and address some of the key developments we're seeing from a customer solutions perspective. Starting with our automated WAN solution, while revenues slightly declined year-over-year due to the timing of shipments in the Cloud, we experienced strong orders with solid momentum in both our Service Provider and Cloud segment. We saw healthy demand across both our MX and PTX product families and improved adoption of our newer products as well as our automation software portfolio. 
Our 400-gig solutions are performing well and enabling us to not only protect our existing footprint, but also to secure several net new wins. While we are continuing to see strong customer demand for our automated WAN solutions, these products are currently the most impacted by supply chain challenges and therefore, the most difficult for us to predict. As a result, despite very strong orders, we now expect our results from this segment to return to within the range of our long-term model, calling for a minus 1% decline to a 3% growth during the year, with supply likely to be the biggest determinant of where we will ultimately fall within this range. 
Our Cloud-ready data center solutions experienced 28% year-over-year growth during the June quarter, an encouraging order trend from our Cloud, Enterprise and Service Provider customers. We saw strong momentum with new logos as well as an increase in average deal size in the period, including a meaningful increase in deals over $1 million. After exceeded expectations for a second consecutive quarter and it's creating a significant buzz in the market, this is leading to more software opportunities and full stack data center wins. Customer interest in our Cloud-ready data center portfolio is high, and we remain optimistic regarding the outlook of this business. 
For the year, we believe our Cloud-ready data center business is now tracking at the slightly above the high end of our long-term model, looking for 5% to 9% growth year-over-year. 
Finally, our AI-driven Enterprise solutions also grew 28% year-over-year. Our Mist AI differentiation continues to resonate in the market as new logos increased 130% year-over-year and Mist orders experienced another quarter of solid triple-digit growth. Our Mistified revenue from wireless LAN, wired assurance, Marvis Virtual Network Assistant and associated EX pull-through nearly doubled year-over-year, and we saw another quarter of record ES pull-through. I believe the missed pull-through opportunity will continue to grow, thanks to the recent introduction of the EX-4400, a groundbreaking new access switch that combines true Enterprise-grade scalability and performance with the ease of AI-driven Cloud operations. 
Mist also positively impacted our brand security business, which performed well in Q2, and we continue to make progress with 128 Technology, which we are integrating with our SRX Secure Branch Gateways under a common Cloud and AI umbrella. The pipeline of SD-WAN opportunities remains strong, thanks to these technology differences, coupled with the unique synergy potential of a unified client-to-cloud Enterprise portfolio from Juniper with end-to-end automation insight and action. 
In addition to strength with large Fortune 500 customers, we continue to see very strong momentum in the channel and success with smaller commercial accounts during Q2, which highlights the value of our AI-driven Enterprise offerings to customers of all sizes and across all verticals. We believe Mist AI continues to offer unique and market-leading differentiation resulting in the best user and operator experiences. I remain encouraged by the momentum we're seeing in this business and remain confident our AI-driven Enterprise solutions are likely to see double-digit growth in 2021. 
Our security revenue experienced strong results during the June quarter, and orders also exceeded expectations. Strength was especially notable in the high end of the market where we have historically been strong, although we saw growth across all customer verticals and most product families. Our connected security strategy is gaining traction in the market because the convergence of networking security provides us with a competitive advantage in the portions of the market where we are currently focused. We believe our technical strength in both security and networking will continue to provide tailwinds in future quarters and should enable our security business to achieve our growth objectives. 
Our software momentum is also strong. Our software and related services revenue grew 59% year-over-year in Q2 as we experienced growth with ratable subscription, solid uptake of our Flex software licenses and strong sales of certain perpetual on-box licenses. ARR grew 32% year-over-year in the period driven by a combination of mix subscriptions, ratable security software offering and the related services associated with these software offerings. We experienced record software orders in the quarter due to broad-based strength across verticals and use cases. We're seeing ongoing strength in ratable subscription offerings and improved adoption of our on-box Flex licenses, which are seeing traction across all of the customer verticals that we serve. 
Based on the momentum we're seeing, we remain confident in the long-term software and ARR targets we presented at our recent Investor Day. I'd like to mention that our Services team delivered another solid quarter and continued growth on a year-over-year basis due to strong renewals and service attach rates. Our services team continues to execute extremely well to ensure our customers receive an excellent experience. 
I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders. 
I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail."

I will start by discussing our second quarter results and end with some color on our outlook. We ended the second quarter of 2021 at $1.172 billion in revenue, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.43, both",997,"Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. 
I will start by discussing our second quarter results and end with some color on our outlook. We ended the second quarter of 2021 at $1.172 billion in revenue, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.43, both above the midpoint of our guidance. 
Revenue was up 8% year-over-year, with growth across all verticals and geographies. We experienced record levels of product orders during the second quarter with significant strength across all verticals and customer solutions. We believe some of this strength is attributable to industry supply chain challenges that are causing certain customers to place orders early in an effort to secure supply when needed. 
These early orders resulted in an increase in backlog and provide us with improved visibility into the second half of 2021. Even after adjusting for these early orders, total product orders are estimated to have grown mid-teens year-over-year, exceeding our expectations, with year-over-year growth across all verticals and customer solutions. 
Looking at our revenue by vertical. On a year-over-year basis, Service Provider grew 2%; Cloud grew 12%; and Enterprise grew 12%. All verticals grew on a sequential basis. 
From a customer solution perspective, automated WAN solutions declined 3% year-over-year, while PTS product family posted year-over-year growth, our MX offerings declined year-over-year. While our automated WAN revenue declined due to the timing of shipments, orders grew year-over-year. 
Cloud-ready data center revenue increased 28% year-over-year as we experienced strong demand for our QFX product family across all customer verticals and geographies. 
And finally, AI-driven Enterprise revenue increased 28% versus last year. Our Mist and EX product families both grew year-over-year. As Rami mentioned, total software and related services revenue was $173 million, an increase of 59% year-over-year. And our annual recurring revenue, or ARR, grew 32% year-over-year. 
Total security revenue which includes security products as well as services related to our security solutions was $172 million, an increase of 11% year-over-year. Security product sales grew 21% year-over-year. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, 4 were Cloud, 5 were Service Provider and 1 was an Enterprise. 
Our top 10 customers accounted for 33% of our total revenue as compared to 30% in Q2 2020. Non-GAAP gross margin was 60%, which was above the midpoint of our guidance, primarily due to higher revenue and lower service delivery costs. If it weren't for elevated logistics and other supply chain-related costs, we would have posted non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 60.5%. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 9% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, slightly above the high end of our guidance range, primarily due to higher variable compensation related to better-than-expected order momentum. Non-GAAP operating margin was 15.8% for the quarter which exceeded our expectations and the midpoint of the guidance looking for 14.6%. 
We exited the quarter with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $1.8 billion. The sequential increase was due to strong free cash flow generation, which was partially offset by our capital return program. Cash flow from operations was $257 million. From a capital returns perspective, we paid $65 million in dividends, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share and repurchased $110 million worth of shares in the second quarter. 
Turning to our guidance. As I'm sure you are all aware, there is a worldwide shortage of semiconductors impacting many industries. Similar to others, we are experiencing ongoing supply constraints, which have resulted in extended lead times and elevated costs. We have invested to strengthen our supply chain and have increased inventory purchase commitments over the course of the last year. We continue to work closely with our suppliers to further enhance our resiliency and limit disruptions outside of our control to the best of our ability. Despite these actions, we believe extended lead times and elevated costs will likely persist for at least the next few quarters. 
While the situation is dynamic at this point in time, we believe we will have access to sufficient semiconductor supply to meet our full year financial forecast. 
Looking specifically at the third quarter. At the midpoint of guidance, revenue is expected to be up 5.5% year-over-year. We expect supply constraints to be particularly tight in the third quarter, which has been factored into our guidance. We expect our third quarter non-GAAP gross margins to be impacted by higher component costs related to supply constraints and higher expected service delivery costs. At the midpoint of guidance, earnings are expected to grow faster than revenue in the period despite the expected pressure from supply constraints. 
Moving on to our expectations for 2021. We have updated our full year revenue growth and profitability expectations to account for our better-than-expected Q2 results, and current expectations for the second half of 2021. We now expect full year revenue growth of approximately 6%, a point of which is expected to come from recently acquired assets. Our revised top line outlook is 150 basis points higher than the midpoint of our previous expectation of 4% to 5%. From a vertical perspective for 2021, Cloud is expected to grow faster than our long-term range of 1% to 5%. Enterprise is expected to grow towards the high end of our long-term model range of 5% to 9%, and Service Provider is expected to be flat to slightly up versus last year toward the high end of our guidance range. 
While non-GAAP gross margin can be difficult to predict, we now expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 59.5% for 2021, down from our previous expectation of approximately 60% due to the elevated freight and costs related to supply constraints we are now experiencing. 
We continue to expect full year non-GAAP operating margin to be flat to slightly up versus 2020 levels. On a full year basis, we expect non-GAAP earnings to grow faster than revenue. 
In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success, especially in this challenging environment. Now I'd like to open the call for questions."

We're encouraged by the momentum that we're seeing across the business internationally and also Tier 1 Service Provider strength in this country, in the U.S., also encouraged by the number of wins, 400-gig wins, which aren't really contributing to revenue in a very meaningful way yet, but I expect that to change in the second half of the year. Technology strong new products, both MX and PTX routing products are performing very well. So I like the trends that we're seeing in SP all up.

I mean we do expect volume to be up, our software mix should be up, which would be obviously tailwinds and potentially positive drivers to gross margin improvement -- potential gross margin improvement.

What I like about this momentum is that it is really diverse. It cuts across geos, it cuts across our customer solutions, it cuts across the vertical segments.

But even factoring that out, we're seeing very solid order momentum with new projects that are starting, old projects that were paused that are starting to resume again, the need to build out capacity to keep ahead of customer demand on the network are all coming to fruition. I think we're executing well. So we're essentially setting ourselves up to benefit from that recovery in the market. So that improved market condition is something that I think is going to be very good for us going forward. So I don't think this -- the demand strength is not a short-lived thing from my perspective.

It cuts across every geography, Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific. You're right, EMEA has been especially strong, growing 10% year-over-year in the Q2 timeframe and that is true. We saw growth across all verticals and all solution areas in EMEA. But even in the Americas, we saw growth in every vertical, we saw a special strength in data center opportunities and added Enterprise opportunities across those verticals. And in Asia Pacific, I think we're executing extremely well there as well with growth in the Cloud vertical, in the Enterprise and strength in data center, AI-driven Enterprise solutions. So I'm very encouraged, as I just mentioned earlier, with the diversity of the strength that we're seeing across geographies. There's definitely a market dynamic where things are working to our favor. But I think there's also this -- the fact that we are executing extremely well to capture that market opportunity."

I'm quite frankly, very excited about the metro opportunity and the solutions that we're bringing to market today. We already have elements of that solution that are available, shipping with very solid early interest despite the fact that the solution is not really fully complete. We plan to round out that solution over the next year, 1.5 years or so with more and more products that will enter into the market. I think we're laying the foundation with Metro this year for growth next year. So this would be a growth vector within the automated WAN and especially in the Service Provider segment for next year. 
And again, there's a very important element of our automated WAN solution that is software. And this is where our Paragon automation suite comes into the picture. We've recently rounded out that solution, introduced new capabilities into the market and actually won a competitive win with a Tier 1 telecom operator in Asia Pacific just recently, in fact, which I think speaks volumes to the strength of that software solution that we now have in the market and will only get stronger in time. So the net of it is, I think it's going to be a wonderful opportunity for us, and I'm quite bullish about it."

So from a revenue perspective, I don't believe it impacted our Q2 results materially. I mean we're very pleased with the results we posted of $1.172 billion, which is towards the high end of our range. Obviously, the profitability metrics were also quite strong in Q2. So I don't believe it had an impact on our Q2 results. That said, it is something we're considering as we set the guidance for Q3 and the rest of the year. We did increase the full year revenue guidance again for the second time this year, up to 6% full year year-on-year growth, and previously, we were at 4% to 5%. So we are able to secure the supply, at least we believe we'll be able to secure the supply to go ahead and increase our revenue guidance. So it's not impacting us very negatively. However, it is part of that guide. We are definitely considering our ability to secure supply when we set our forward guidance. 
From a gross margin perspective, what's happening is we talked on the last call, at this point in time, we clearly knew on the last call that there were going to be some pressures because of the supply constraints, but we also expect at that time to have some alleviating pressures coming back towards us from the COVID perspective. So we were expecting some reduction in freight cost towards the second half of the year. Our current expectation does not call for that anymore. So we're seeing freight costs remain elevated throughout the rest of the year. That's our current anticipation. That coupled with the increased component costs that we're seeing and expedite fees, et cetera, has resulted in us bringing the full year guide down from 60% to 59.5%. 
So I do believe these are temporary transitory costs, if you will. They should -- we should recover from these. That said, I do think it will take at least a few quarters, right? It's not something I anticipate recovering from in this quarter or next or, but I do think we will recover from this in the longer term and allow us to expand our gross margins and operating profits even more robustly than this year's level where we do expect some operating margin expansion as well as earnings growth to be faster than revenue. So the profitability metrics are quite strong this year despite these pressures. As these pressures alleviate, it should just allow us to double down on our profitability goals."

Maybe I'll start with the second question first, and then Ken, I'll pass it to you to talk a little bit more about the supply chain related questions. So Enterprise, I'm very pleased with our performance. And we have been doing well, performing well through -- from the beginning of the onset of the pandemic despite end market disruptions that our industry has faced. There's no doubt the economic uncertainty as a result of COVID persists, but it's getting better. And elements of the Enterprise market that have essentially shut down, like take, for example, traditional [ carpeted ] Enterprise are starting to recover again and projects are starting to emerge, and that will open up net new opportunities for us. And it's a good time because our differentiation in this space has never been better, quite frankly. We're seeing great growth in the AI-driven Enterprise, of course, Mist being a very important component of that, but I also want to emphasize that there's another leg to the Enterprise tool and that is the data center. We've always done quite well in the data center space in the Enterprise. 
But I think now with the addition of the Apstra team, the technology, we've created some real lift to our solution to the differentiation in that space. So from a mix standpoint, the phenomenal growth and momentum just continues. Mist solution revenue which includes wireless, it includes wired, it includes software, it grew at nearly 2x year-over-year. If you think about Mist all up in terms of annualized order run rate, we're now over $400 million. So it's a pretty significant component of the total Juniper business. And then add to that, although it's early days with Apstra, the initial feedback from customers, the initial win rate has exceeded our expectations. And quite frankly, the pipeline that we've built has been absolutely phenomenal. So I think that Apstra and the data center opportunities have a lot of the early signals that we got from Mist shortly after we made that acquisition in 2019."

And on the Q4 guide perspective, as you mentioned, Tim, we had a very solid first half, beat our midpoint of guidance, both in Q1 and Q2, raised guidance in Q2 and raised again in Q3 here on this call, and raised the full year at 6%. So we're pleased with the execution and the momentum we're seeing on the revenue side. That said, supply constraints are tighter now than they were in the first half. I mean a lot of this has to do with this -- our own inventory levels. And clearly, we are anticipating some of the shortages and some of the buffer stocks, some of the resiliency efforts we put into place starting last year, really helped us in the first half and are going to continue to help us in the second half. 
However, material is getting tighter. So it is something that's going to impact us a bit, and we wanted to make sure we factor that into our second half guide, which again is up from where we were earlier in the year and on a full year basis in Q3. So I'm pretty pleased with the results. And I think given the strength of the bookings and the backlog we built, not normally we set up for a good second half, a good full year FY '21, but it's likely to leak into FY '22 as well. So I think it gives us a good head start. This bookings growth that we're seeing and the momentum that we have now is allowing for a solid 6% revenue growth well above our at least low single-digit guidance range for this year and actually sets us up pretty favorably as we enter into 2022."

So from a -- yes, just to clarify, the comment about supply constraints and the impact it had on Q2 was with our own guidance from where we expected the quarter to land. So we did factor in some supply constraints when we set our Q2 guidance. And you're right that the quarter played out actually a little bit more favorably than we expected, but largely in line, and it didn't negatively impact our ability to hit our results in Q2. The one area that is impacting the results, and we called that out in the prepared remarks was in gross margin, which was negatively impacted by about 50 basis points. Gross margin was quite solid, above the midpoint of Q2 at 60%, but it would have been 60.5% were it not for some of these transitory costs, both of kind of a carryover from last year's COVID-related freight costs as well as some of the supply constraints that are starting to impact Q2. So yes, to clarify that, that is what we intended to say. 
On the organic -- I mean, we don't break out the organic versus nonorganic. I'm trying to understand when you say nonorganic, are you really referring to the most recent acquisitions of the last 3 quarters or so. And I can tell you, those are on track, we're very excited about the momentum we're seeing there. We expect them to add 1 point of revenue growth. So that's in the $45 million to $50 million area on a full year basis. Those numbers, on a quarterly basis, aren't that impactful really to our overall software growth and/or our security growth. 
They are a significant minority as compared to the strength we have in our security business and our software business. They're a big part of our future, both software as well as security, but to date, Q2 results were not significantly impacted by those most recent acquisitions. Clearly, if you go back to the Mist acquisition days, there's a significant impact on our growth due to Mist on the software side, in particular, 0 impact to security. But on the software side, Mist is a big driver for our software business, particularly our Software as a Service business, which is embedded in that number."

So Tier 2, Tier 3 Cloud providers where the -- defined as customers whose businesses depend on delivering some sort of Cloud services. It continues from there. 
Momentum and strength, double-digit, well into double-digit territory in terms of both switching and routing, WAN and data center and then 400-gig wins. The momentum we're seeing of 400-gig wins across large Tier 1 hyperscale customers as well as the broader Cloud major customers is very, very encouraging. And dare I say that the differentiation that we have introduced into the market with our products across the full stack of technology from our network operating system, Junos Evolved to our silicon technology. We have inserted silicon capabilities that are now in the market that we anticipated would be differentiators, things around security, for example, that have now resulted in wins for us, and that gives us a lot of confidence that what we -- the design point that we have chosen that we have decided on are actually paying off for us.

Mix is the biggest determinant, product and/or vertical is a high correlation. However, even within vertical sometimes you might have some customer mix where you're more advantaged than other periods of time, maybe they're geographic as an example, where we do have a higher margin in, say, the U.S. Tier 1s than we might in some parts of Asia as an example. So there's a lot of mix to consider, but generally speaking, you're correct in that the vertical/product mix in aggregate was unfavorable. We offset some of that with some software growth, which is a little more slanted, particularly the off-box, higher-margin software is a little more -- as a percentage a little higher in our Enterprise, our Cloud-ready data center, AI-driven Enterprise businesses than it is our traditional kind of Service Provider routing domain where we do have a fair amount of software, but it's more on box and has less margin impact overall. 
So that is part of the mix going forward. And the last thing I'd call out Q2, we saw a very strong services gross margin in Q2, which was the primary reason why our gross margin was beyond the midpoint of our guidance. The product margin came in largely in line with our expectations, even with the mix shift that you're talking about, but services exceeded our expectations, which resulted in the overall increase from midpoint."

Certainly, they're very strong in the Cloud Provider space, but from an order standpoint, double-digit growth in Service Provider double-digit growth in Enterprise as well. And then I just provided you with color of over 100% growth in orders in the Cloud Provider segment. So I mean, clearly, it's broad-based and it's very encouraging, and it bodes well for future quarters in terms of revenue, in terms of visibility that we have. 
You're right. In terms of the specific wins and the use cases within hyperscalers, our wins are WAN and inter-data center not yet intra-data center, although these continue to be opportunities that we pursue, and the rest of the Cloud Provider space, we have wins across the board that include WAN, data center interconnect as well as inside of the data center. 
Okay. So I think that was our last question. And maybe I'd like to close with just a couple of thoughts. I'm very encouraged by the momentum in the business, I like the diversity and the strength that we are seeing. It speaks to our strategy, it speaks to the smart investments that we're making, it speaks to the strong execution by the team, which I'm very proud of. I believe that our end markets are recovering and that we're set up to benefit from that recovery. And I also think that the demand strength that we're building as well as the backlog that we have now allows us -- sets us up to deliver greater improvements in profitability next year, especially as some of the transitory supply chain-related costs start to receive. So this remains a very important focus area for myself and my management team.

We reported better-than-expected Q2 results, delivering a second consecutive quarter, which saw year-over-year revenue growth across all verticals and geographies. We also experienced record orders in Q2, which helped us grow backlog, both sequentially and year-over-year. Momentum is strong entering the second half of the year. I'm encouraged by the diversity of the strength we are seeing, which is spread across verticals, customer solutions and geographies. While the strength is due in part to improve trends with some of our large strategic customers, particularly in the Cloud and Service Provider verticals, we're also seeing strong momentum with new logos and an increased number of deals greater than $1 million, especially in the Enterprise vertical. 
I would call out 3 factors driving our momentum: First, our focus on leading the industry and delivering simplified operations and a superior user experience, what we call experience-first networking is resonating in the market; our AI and software management tools are second to none and deliver meaningful customer value that's enabling us to accelerate our success and take share, particularly in the Enterprise campus and the data center market, but also in Service Provider and Cloud verticals. 
By leveraging software control points like Mist, Apstra and Juniper Paragon to improve customer operations and experience, we're not only creating sticky new software revenue stream, but also creating platforms that pull through a broader suite of core Juniper infrastructure. 
Second, our teams are executing extremely well. Our internal alignment around customer solutions and investments in our go-to-market organization are enabling us to capitalize on our technical differentiation and benefit from improved end market conditions we're seeing. In addition, our customer satisfaction ratings are at record highs, reflecting the strong work of our engineering and services organization as well as our supply chain team, which continues to work tirelessly to meet customer demand in an extremely tight supply environment. 
Third, we are seeing improved end market conditions across verticals and geographies. As global businesses reopen and companies look to bring workers back to the office, many projects which were halted are resuming, and many new ones are starting as digital transformation and clarification initiatives accelerate. 
Enterprise, Cloud and Service Provider customers are all recognizing the strategic importance of the network and investing to support a more distributed workforce, which is increasingly reliant on high bandwidth applications such as real-time video collaboration. While the demand environment is strong, we, like others in our industry, are managing through significant supply chain challenges. Customers have become more aware of these challenges and many are either placing orders early or providing significantly greater visibility into future projects. 
This is particularly true with some of our large strategic customers especially in the Cloud and Service Provider verticals. We view these early orders and insight into our customers' longer-term plans as a positive development. Importantly, even excluding these accelerations, orders are estimated to have experienced mid-teens growth in the period with healthy momentum across verticals and customer solutions. Based on this trend, we now expect to grow our business approximately 6% in 2021 on a full year basis despite the challenging supply chain backdrop. I'm excited by the momentum we're seeing. The investments we're making are paying off, and I'm increasingly confident in our ability to not only grow our business this year, but to do so on a sustainable basis. 
Our strategy is down, and we're investing and succeeding in several big industry opportunities that should provide attractive tailwind over the next few years. The first area we're winning is the Enterprise transition to AI-driven Cloud architectures. Mist was one of the first to deliver on this vision with wireless and since the acquisition, we have brought the same automation, insight and agility to the wired land and now the win. This unique client-to-cloud approach for AI delivers superior end user and operator experiences, which is enabling us to both land new full stack wins defined as Wi-Fi, wired and SD-WAN and expand our opportunity with large existing accounts. 
While marketing messages can sound similar, we believe Juniper with Mist AI has fundamental architectural advantages that will stand the test of time, including a purpose-built microservices Cloud architecture, 6 generation data science expertise, a unified AI engine across the land, wireless LAN SD-WAN and AI-driven support, led by the industry's only conversational systems market. 
This differentiation has enabled us to take share in key networking segments, which we believe will continue as the $20 billion campus and branch market transitions to AI-driven Cloud architectures in the years to come. We're also continuing to see success with our 400-gig offerings, both in wide area as well as data center use cases. We now maintain more than 200 wins that span across hyperscale Service Provider and Cloud major accounts, which is up materially on a quarter-over-quarter basis. We remain optimistic regarding our ability to not only protect our footprint, but also to capture new opportunities in these larger accounts. We continue to expect 400-gig deployments to begin later this year and present increasing tailwinds over the next few years. 
In addition, we're optimistic about our 5G metro opportunity. We believe the investments we're making in our Juniper Paragon automation suite as well as our ACF metro access and aggregation portfolio will position us to capitalize on this sizable and growing market. While it remains early, we're seeing healthy customer interest in our new metro portfolio, and we expect to continue to introduce new solutions over the next 18 months that should further enhance our ability to succeed in this market. 
Now I'd like to provide some additional insights into the quarter and address some of the key developments we're seeing from a customer solutions perspective. Starting with our automated WAN solution, while revenues slightly declined year-over-year due to the timing of shipments in the Cloud, we experienced strong orders with solid momentum in both our Service Provider and Cloud segment. We saw healthy demand across both our MX and PTX product families and improved adoption of our newer products as well as our automation software portfolio. 
Our 400-gig solutions are performing well and enabling us to not only protect our existing footprint, but also to secure several net new wins. While we are continuing to see strong customer demand for our automated WAN solutions, these products are currently the most impacted by supply chain challenges and therefore, the most difficult for us to predict. As a result, despite very strong orders, we now expect our results from this segment to return to within the range of our long-term model, calling for a minus 1% decline to a 3% growth during the year, with supply likely to be the biggest determinant of where we will ultimately fall within this range. 
Our Cloud-ready data center solutions experienced 28% year-over-year growth during the June quarter, an encouraging order trend from our Cloud, Enterprise and Service Provider customers. We saw strong momentum with new logos as well as an increase in average deal size in the period, including a meaningful increase in deals over $1 million. After exceeded expectations for a second consecutive quarter and it's creating a significant buzz in the market, this is leading to more software opportunities and full stack data center wins. Customer interest in our Cloud-ready data center portfolio is high, and we remain optimistic regarding the outlook of this business. 
For the year, we believe our Cloud-ready data center business is now tracking at the slightly above the high end of our long-term model, looking for 5% to 9% growth year-over-year. 
Finally, our AI-driven Enterprise solutions also grew 28% year-over-year. Our Mist AI differentiation continues to resonate in the market as new logos increased 130% year-over-year and Mist orders experienced another quarter of solid triple-digit growth. Our Mistified revenue from wireless LAN, wired assurance, Marvis Virtual Network Assistant and associated EX pull-through nearly doubled year-over-year, and we saw another quarter of record ES pull-through. I believe the missed pull-through opportunity will continue to grow, thanks to the recent introduction of the EX-4400, a groundbreaking new access switch that combines true Enterprise-grade scalability and performance with the ease of AI-driven Cloud operations. 
Mist also positively impacted our brand security business, which performed well in Q2, and we continue to make progress with 128 Technology, which we are integrating with our SRX Secure Branch Gateways under a common Cloud and AI umbrella. The pipeline of SD-WAN opportunities remains strong, thanks to these technology differences, coupled with the unique synergy potential of a unified client-to-cloud Enterprise portfolio from Juniper with end-to-end automation insight and action. 
In addition to strength with large Fortune 500 customers, we continue to see very strong momentum in the channel and success with smaller commercial accounts during Q2, which highlights the value of our AI-driven Enterprise offerings to customers of all sizes and across all verticals. We believe Mist AI continues to offer unique and market-leading differentiation resulting in the best user and operator experiences. I remain encouraged by the momentum we're seeing in this business and remain confident our AI-driven Enterprise solutions are likely to see double-digit growth in 2021. 
Our security revenue experienced strong results during the June quarter, and orders also exceeded expectations. Strength was especially notable in the high end of the market where we have historically been strong, although we saw growth across all customer verticals and most product families. Our connected security strategy is gaining traction in the market because the convergence of networking security provides us with a competitive advantage in the portions of the market where we are currently focused. We believe our technical strength in both security and networking will continue to provide tailwinds in future quarters and should enable our security business to achieve our growth objectives. 
Our software momentum is also strong. Our software and related services revenue grew 59% year-over-year in Q2 as we experienced growth with ratable subscription, solid uptake of our Flex software licenses and strong sales of certain perpetual on-box licenses. ARR grew 32% year-over-year in the period driven by a combination of mix subscriptions, ratable security software offering and the related services associated with these software offerings. We experienced record software orders in the quarter due to broad-based strength across verticals and use cases. We're seeing ongoing strength in ratable subscription offerings and improved adoption of our on-box Flex licenses, which are seeing traction across all of the customer verticals that we serve. 
Based on the momentum we're seeing, we remain confident in the long-term software and ARR targets we presented at our recent Investor Day. I'd like to mention that our Services team delivered another solid quarter and continued growth on a year-over-year basis due to strong renewals and service attach rates. Our services team continues to execute extremely well to ensure our customers receive an excellent experience. 
I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders. 
I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail."

I will start by discussing our second quarter results and end with some color on our outlook. We ended the second quarter of 2021 at $1.172 billion in revenue, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.43, both",997,"Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. 
I will start by discussing our second quarter results and end with some color on our outlook. We ended the second quarter of 2021 at $1.172 billion in revenue, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.43, both above the midpoint of our guidance. 
Revenue was up 8% year-over-year, with growth across all verticals and geographies. We experienced record levels of product orders during the second quarter with significant strength across all verticals and customer solutions. We believe some of this strength is attributable to industry supply chain challenges that are causing certain customers to place orders early in an effort to secure supply when needed. 
These early orders resulted in an increase in backlog and provide us with improved visibility into the second half of 2021. Even after adjusting for these early orders, total product orders are estimated to have grown mid-teens year-over-year, exceeding our expectations, with year-over-year growth across all verticals and customer solutions. 
Looking at our revenue by vertical. On a year-over-year basis, Service Provider grew 2%; Cloud grew 12%; and Enterprise grew 12%. All verticals grew on a sequential basis. 
From a customer solution perspective, automated WAN solutions declined 3% year-over-year, while PTS product family posted year-over-year growth, our MX offerings declined year-over-year. While our automated WAN revenue declined due to the timing of shipments, orders grew year-over-year. 
Cloud-ready data center revenue increased 28% year-over-year as we experienced strong demand for our QFX product family across all customer verticals and geographies. 
And finally, AI-driven Enterprise revenue increased 28% versus last year. Our Mist and EX product families both grew year-over-year. As Rami mentioned, total software and related services revenue was $173 million, an increase of 59% year-over-year. And our annual recurring revenue, or ARR, grew 32% year-over-year. 
Total security revenue which includes security products as well as services related to our security solutions was $172 million, an increase of 11% year-over-year. Security product sales grew 21% year-over-year. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, 4 were Cloud, 5 were Service Provider and 1 was an Enterprise. 
Our top 10 customers accounted for 33% of our total revenue as compared to 30% in Q2 2020. Non-GAAP gross margin was 60%, which was above the midpoint of our guidance, primarily due to higher revenue and lower service delivery costs. If it weren't for elevated logistics and other supply chain-related costs, we would have posted non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 60.5%. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 9% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, slightly above the high end of our guidance range, primarily due to higher variable compensation related to better-than-expected order momentum. Non-GAAP operating margin was 15.8% for the quarter which exceeded our expectations and the midpoint of the guidance looking for 14.6%. 
We exited the quarter with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $1.8 billion. The sequential increase was due to strong free cash flow generation, which was partially offset by our capital return program. Cash flow from operations was $257 million. From a capital returns perspective, we paid $65 million in dividends, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share and repurchased $110 million worth of shares in the second quarter. 
Turning to our guidance. As I'm sure you are all aware, there is a worldwide shortage of semiconductors impacting many industries. Similar to others, we are experiencing ongoing supply constraints, which have resulted in extended lead times and elevated costs. We have invested to strengthen our supply chain and have increased inventory purchase commitments over the course of the last year. We continue to work closely with our suppliers to further enhance our resiliency and limit disruptions outside of our control to the best of our ability. Despite these actions, we believe extended lead times and elevated costs will likely persist for at least the next few quarters. 
While the situation is dynamic at this point in time, we believe we will have access to sufficient semiconductor supply to meet our full year financial forecast. 
Looking specifically at the third quarter. At the midpoint of guidance, revenue is expected to be up 5.5% year-over-year. We expect supply constraints to be particularly tight in the third quarter, which has been factored into our guidance. We expect our third quarter non-GAAP gross margins to be impacted by higher component costs related to supply constraints and higher expected service delivery costs. At the midpoint of guidance, earnings are expected to grow faster than revenue in the period despite the expected pressure from supply constraints. 
Moving on to our expectations for 2021. We have updated our full year revenue growth and profitability expectations to account for our better-than-expected Q2 results, and current expectations for the second half of 2021. We now expect full year revenue growth of approximately 6%, a point of which is expected to come from recently acquired assets. Our revised top line outlook is 150 basis points higher than the midpoint of our previous expectation of 4% to 5%. From a vertical perspective for 2021, Cloud is expected to grow faster than our long-term range of 1% to 5%. Enterprise is expected to grow towards the high end of our long-term model range of 5% to 9%, and Service Provider is expected to be flat to slightly up versus last year toward the high end of our guidance range. 
While non-GAAP gross margin can be difficult to predict, we now expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 59.5% for 2021, down from our previous expectation of approximately 60% due to the elevated freight and costs related to supply constraints we are now experiencing. 
We continue to expect full year non-GAAP operating margin to be flat to slightly up versus 2020 levels. On a full year basis, we expect non-GAAP earnings to grow faster than revenue. 
In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success, especially in this challenging environment. Now I'd like to open the call for questions."

Technology strong new products, both MX and PTX routing products are performing very well. So I like the trends that we're seeing in SP all up.

So Q3, we definitely think that the supply constraints are particularly tight, and we mentioned that on the prepared remarks and obviously factored that into our guidance, both our top line guidance as well as our gross margin guidance. Q4, while we haven't given specific Q4 gross margin guidance, we have provided the full year and I think your math is pretty directionally correct where it applies somewhat flattish Q4 as compared to Q3. That said, it's a little bit too early to call with any more specificity than that. I mean we do expect volume to be up, our software mix should be up, which would be obviously tailwinds and potentially positive drivers to gross margin improvement -- potential gross margin improvement. However, given the supply dynamics, and quite honestly, the unknown aspects as we continue to work through this, we think it's prudent to kind of keep the guidance where we have it on a full year basis."

What I like about this momentum is that it is really diverse. It cuts across geos, it cuts across our customer solutions, it cuts across the vertical segments. So we're firing on all cylinders on that front. There is definitely a COVID-related element where customers are, let's say, making sure that they're getting ahead of potential supply constraints. 
But even factoring that out, we're seeing very solid order momentum with new projects that are starting, old projects that were paused that are starting to resume again, the need to build out capacity to keep ahead of customer demand on the network are all coming to fruition. I think we're executing well. So we're essentially setting ourselves up to benefit from that recovery in the market. So that improved market condition is something that I think is going to be very good for us going forward. So I don't think this -- the demand strength is not a short-lived thing from my perspective. I have confidence that the combination of market dynamics and our own execution, product differentiation, go-to-market strength is all going to work for us on a sustainable basis."

We've raised the year now to 6% on a full year basis. It's the second time this year since February that we've raised the full year guidance on the revenue side.

I think we're laying the foundation with Metro this year for growth next year. So this would be a growth vector within the automated WAN and especially in the Service Provider segment for next year. 
And again, there's a very important element of our automated WAN solution that is software. And this is where our Paragon automation suite comes into the picture. We've recently rounded out that solution, introduced new capabilities into the market and actually won a competitive win with a Tier 1 telecom operator in Asia Pacific just recently, in fact, which I think speaks volumes to the strength of that software solution that we now have in the market and will only get stronger in time.

So from a revenue perspective, I don't believe it impacted our Q2 results materially. I mean we're very pleased with the results we posted of $1.172 billion, which is towards the high end of our range. Obviously, the profitability metrics were also quite strong in Q2. So I don't believe it had an impact on our Q2 results. That said, it is something we're considering as we set the guidance for Q3 and the rest of the year. We did increase the full year revenue guidance again for the second time this year, up to 6% full year year-on-year growth, and previously, we were at 4% to 5%. So we are able to secure the supply, at least we believe we'll be able to secure the supply to go ahead and increase our revenue guidance. So it's not impacting us very negatively. However, it is part of that guide. We are definitely considering our ability to secure supply when we set our forward guidance. 
From a gross margin perspective, what's happening is we talked on the last call, at this point in time, we clearly knew on the last call that there were going to be some pressures because of the supply constraints, but we also expect at that time to have some alleviating pressures coming back towards us from the COVID perspective. So we were expecting some reduction in freight cost towards the second half of the year. Our current expectation does not call for that anymore. So we're seeing freight costs remain elevated throughout the rest of the year. That's our current anticipation. That coupled with the increased component costs that we're seeing and expedite fees, et cetera, has resulted in us bringing the full year guide down from 60% to 59.5%. 
So I do believe these are temporary transitory costs, if you will. They should -- we should recover from these. That said, I do think it will take at least a few quarters, right? It's not something I anticipate recovering from in this quarter or next or, but I do think we will recover from this in the longer term and allow us to expand our gross margins and operating profits even more robustly than this year's level where we do expect some operating margin expansion as well as earnings growth to be faster than revenue. So the profitability metrics are quite strong this year despite these pressures. As these pressures alleviate, it should just allow us to double down on our profitability goals."

Maybe I'll start with the second question first, and then Ken, I'll pass it to you to talk a little bit more about the supply chain related questions. So Enterprise, I'm very pleased with our performance. And we have been doing well, performing well through -- from the beginning of the onset of the pandemic despite end market disruptions that our industry has faced. There's no doubt the economic uncertainty as a result of COVID persists, but it's getting better. And elements of the Enterprise market that have essentially shut down, like take, for example, traditional [ carpeted ] Enterprise are starting to recover again and projects are starting to emerge, and that will open up net new opportunities for us. And it's a good time because our differentiation in this space has never been better, quite frankly. We're seeing great growth in the AI-driven Enterprise, of course, Mist being a very important component of that, but I also want to emphasize that there's another leg to the Enterprise tool and that is the data center. We've always done quite well in the data center space in the Enterprise. 
But I think now with the addition of the Apstra team, the technology, we've created some real lift to our solution to the differentiation in that space. So from a mix standpoint, the phenomenal growth and momentum just continues. Mist solution revenue which includes wireless, it includes wired, it includes software, it grew at nearly 2x year-over-year. If you think about Mist all up in terms of annualized order run rate, we're now over $400 million. So it's a pretty significant component of the total Juniper business. And then add to that, although it's early days with Apstra, the initial feedback from customers, the initial win rate has exceeded our expectations. And quite frankly, the pipeline that we've built has been absolutely phenomenal. So I think that Apstra and the data center opportunities have a lot of the early signals that we got from Mist shortly after we made that acquisition in 2019."

So we're pleased with the execution and the momentum we're seeing on the revenue side. That said, supply constraints are tighter now than they were in the first half. I mean a lot of this has to do with this -- our own inventory levels. And clearly, we are anticipating some of the shortages and some of the buffer stocks, some of the resiliency efforts we put into place starting last year, really helped us in the first half and are going to continue to help us in the second half. 
However, material is getting tighter. So it is something that's going to impact us a bit, and we wanted to make sure we factor that into our second half guide, which again is up from where we were earlier in the year and on a full year basis in Q3. So I'm pretty pleased with the results. And I think given the strength of the bookings and the backlog we built, not normally we set up for a good second half, a good full year FY '21, but it's likely to leak into FY '22 as well. So I think it gives us a good head start. This bookings growth that we're seeing and the momentum that we have now is allowing for a solid 6% revenue growth well above our at least low single-digit guidance range for this year and actually sets us up pretty favorably as we enter into 2022."

So from a -- yes, just to clarify, the comment about supply constraints and the impact it had on Q2 was with our own guidance from where we expected the quarter to land. So we did factor in some supply constraints when we set our Q2 guidance. And you're right that the quarter played out actually a little bit more favorably than we expected, but largely in line, and it didn't negatively impact our ability to hit our results in Q2. The one area that is impacting the results, and we called that out in the prepared remarks was in gross margin, which was negatively impacted by about 50 basis points. Gross margin was quite solid, above the midpoint of Q2 at 60%, but it would have been 60.5% were it not for some of these transitory costs, both of kind of a carryover from last year's COVID-related freight costs as well as some of the supply constraints that are starting to impact Q2. So yes, to clarify that, that is what we intended to say. 
On the organic -- I mean, we don't break out the organic versus nonorganic. I'm trying to understand when you say nonorganic, are you really referring to the most recent acquisitions of the last 3 quarters or so. And I can tell you, those are on track, we're very excited about the momentum we're seeing there. We expect them to add 1 point of revenue growth. So that's in the $45 million to $50 million area on a full year basis. Those numbers, on a quarterly basis, aren't that impactful really to our overall software growth and/or our security growth. 
They are a significant minority as compared to the strength we have in our security business and our software business. They're a big part of our future, both software as well as security, but to date, Q2 results were not significantly impacted by those most recent acquisitions. Clearly, if you go back to the Mist acquisition days, there's a significant impact on our growth due to Mist on the software side, in particular, 0 impact to security. But on the software side, Mist is a big driver for our software business, particularly our Software as a Service business, which is embedded in that number."

So Tier 2, Tier 3 Cloud providers where the -- defined as customers whose businesses depend on delivering some sort of Cloud services. It continues from there. 
Momentum and strength, double-digit, well into double-digit territory in terms of both switching and routing, WAN and data center and then 400-gig wins. The momentum we're seeing of 400-gig wins across large Tier 1 hyperscale customers as well as the broader Cloud major customers is very, very encouraging. And dare I say that the differentiation that we have introduced into the market with our products across the full stack of technology from our network operating system, Junos Evolved to our silicon technology. We have inserted silicon capabilities that are now in the market that we anticipated would be differentiators, things around security, for example, that have now resulted in wins for us, and that gives us a lot of confidence that what we -- the design point that we have chosen that we have decided on are actually paying off for us. So this is why we're now anticipating that we're going to grow faster than the full year guide that we provided for Cloud provider in the last Analyst Day."

So I'm imagining that your software business is contributing more favorably or disproportionately to Data Center and Enterprise segments, and that's helping those segments have better gross margin than they have historically.

Mix is the biggest determinant, product and/or vertical is a high correlation. However, even within vertical sometimes you might have some customer mix where you're more advantaged than other periods of time, maybe they're geographic as an example, where we do have a higher margin in, say, the U.S. Tier 1s than we might in some parts of Asia as an example. So there's a lot of mix to consider, but generally speaking, you're correct in that the vertical/product mix in aggregate was unfavorable. We offset some of that with some software growth, which is a little more slanted, particularly the off-box, higher-margin software is a little more -- as a percentage a little higher in our Enterprise, our Cloud-ready data center, AI-driven Enterprise businesses than it is our traditional kind of Service Provider routing domain where we do have a fair amount of software, but it's more on box and has less margin impact overall. 
So that is part of the mix going forward. And the last thing I'd call out Q2, we saw a very strong services gross margin in Q2, which was the primary reason why our gross margin was beyond the midpoint of our guidance. The product margin came in largely in line with our expectations, even with the mix shift that you're talking about, but services exceeded our expectations, which resulted in the overall increase from midpoint."

So I mean, clearly, it's broad-based and it's very encouraging, and it bodes well for future quarters in terms of revenue, in terms of visibility that we have. 
You're right. In terms of the specific wins and the use cases within hyperscalers, our wins are WAN and inter-data center not yet intra-data center, although these continue to be opportunities that we pursue, and the rest of the Cloud Provider space, we have wins across the board that include WAN, data center interconnect as well as inside of the data center. 
Okay. So I think that was our last question. And maybe I'd like to close with just a couple of thoughts. I'm very encouraged by the momentum in the business, I like the diversity and the strength that we are seeing.

I believe that our end markets are recovering and that we're set up to benefit from that recovery. And I also think that the demand strength that we're building as well as the backlog that we have now allows us -- sets us up to deliver greater improvements in profitability next year, especially as some of the transitory supply chain-related costs start to receive.

Lead time. On an unadjusted basis, orders grew by more than 50% year-over-year for a second consecutive quarter, and our ending backlog has now increased by more than $1 billion as compared to year-end 2020. Order momentum was strong across verticals, customer solutions and geographies with each of these categories experiencing growth well into double-digit territory. 
Needless to say, our team is executing extremely well. Our strategy is working, and the investments we have made in technologies that enhance customer operations and improve the end user experience, what we call experience-first networking are allowing us to differentiate across the markets we serve. This technical differentiation along with the investments we've made in our go-to-market organization are paying off and enabling us to take share and capitalize on some of the big market transitions that are beginning to unfold across the verticals we serve. This is particularly true in the enterprise market, where customers are increasingly recognizing the value delivered by platforms such as Miss and Astra that dramatically reduce deployment time, eliminate trouble ticket and reduce mean time to resolution for network problems. These platforms are not only enabling us to win new logos in the campus and the data center, but also to pull through other Juniper products that present meaningful opportunities to expand with customers over time. In the cloud and service provider verticals, we're seeing strong early adoption of our 400-gig capable platform due to the strength of our Junos Evolved operating system, our differentiated silicon capabilities and the deep engagement we maintain with these important customers. These factors are not only enabling us to maintain our core franchises, but also to secure a new footprint, including a large new hyperscale WAN deployment that should present tailwinds for our business over the next few years. I'm also encouraged by the early customer interest in our metro routing portfolio, which addresses a large and fast-growing market where historically we have in place. We expect this opportunity to steadily ramp through the course of next year as new products come to market and service provider 5G investments steadily increased. The bottom line is that I remain very optimistic regarding our future prospects despite the supply chain challenges we are currently navigating. I believe these challenges are likely to prove transitory in nature and the strong order momentum we're seeing and the backlog we have developed sets us up extremely well to deliver improved growth and profitability in 2022 and beyond. While it remains early, and we'll provide a more detailed 2022 outlook when we report our Q4 results. Based on current backlog and the order strength we're continuing to see in the market, we currently expect to deliver at least mid-single-digit sales growth and at least a point of operating margin expansion in 2022. 
Our expectations for 2022 do not assume a material improvement in supply chain constraints. Now I'd like to provide some additional insights into the quarter and address some key developments we're seeing from a customer solutions perspective. 
Starting with our automated WAN solutions. While revenue declined year-over-year due entirely to supply chain constraints, we experienced another quarter of strong order growth with solid momentum in both our service provider and cloud segments. We saw healthy demand across both our MX and PTX product families and strong adoption of our newer products as well as our automation software portfolio. Our 400-gig solutions are performing well and enables us to not only protect our existing footprint but also to secure a new win that includes several large opportunities with our cloud customers, including the hyperscale opportunity I previously referenced. Driven in part by these opportunities, our cloud orders saw a second consecutive quarter of triple-digit growth year-over-year. While we are continuing to see strong customer demand for our automated WAN solutions,  these products are currently the most impacted by supply chain challenges. 
As a result, we continue to expect revenue from this segment to be within the range of our long-term model, calling for a 1% decline to a 3% growth this year despite the strong demand we are seeing. Our cloud-ready data center solutions experienced 26% year-over-year revenue growth in Q3 and and another quarter of encouraging order trends from our cloud, enterprise and service provider customers. We continue to see strong momentum with new logos and deals greater than $1 million. As I mentioned last quarter, Astra is creating a significant buzz in the market, which is not only leading to more software opportunities but also full stack data center wins. Customer interest in our cloud-ready data center portfolio is high, and we continue to be optimistic about the outlook of this business. Based on the momentum we're seeing, our cloud-ready data center business is now tracking to meet or exceed the high end of our long-term model, looking for 5% to 9% growth year-over-year. Finally, our AI-driven enterprise solutions significantly outpaced the market and grew 35% year-over-year. Our Mist AI differentiation continues to win in the market as wireless orders experienced another record quarter with triple-digit growth and a record number of deals greater than $1 million. Our mystified revenue of wireless LAN, wired access Margaret's virtual network assistance and associated EX pull-through nearly doubled year-over-year, and we experienced record EX pull-through in the period. With this pull-through revenue growing more than 200% year-over-year. This momentum enabled EX to achieve the highest level of sales since 2014. We expect this momentum to continue in future quarters as customers increasingly recognize the value of AI-driven cloud operations including new and innovative features such as EVPN VXLAN fabric management in the Mist Cloud, which was launched this quarter. On a year-to-date basis, our mystified revenue has more than doubled year-over-year. We are also seeing very positive results with our AI-driven SD-WAN solution, which earned Juniper distinction as the only visionary in the Gartner WAN Edge Magic Quadrant published last quarter. 
We saw a record quarter for our Session Smart Router portfolio acquired from 128 Technology with triple-digit year-over-year growth and key wins in various sectors like retail and banking plus especially strong traction with the federal government. In addition, branch SRX sales last quarter hit a 2-year high, the pipeline for our AI-driven SDWAN is strong as both prospects and partners are gravitating towards the unique benefits provided by Juniper AI Ops with assured client-to-cloud experiences. We are particularly encouraged by the number of full stack multimillion dollar wins we are seeing in the campus and branch, where companies are turning to Juniper for a combination of their wired access, wireless access and when Edge needs. Examples include a prominent retail chain in North America, a multinational energy company, a European multinational retailer and a leading international construction company in Europe and managed services providers in North America and Europe. This highlights the value of our AI-driven enterprise offerings to customers and partners across all verticals and all geos. We believe Mist AI continues to offer unique and market-leading differentiation, including self-driving operations and predictive actions driven by our virtual network assistant market resulting in the best user and operator experiences. I am very pleased with the momentum we're seeing in this business and now expect our AI-driven enterprise solutions to see at least 20% growth in 2021. Our security revenue experienced strong results in Q3 with total revenue growing 9% year-over-year and product revenue increasing by 16% year-over-year, which marks a third consecutive quarter of double-digit product growth. Strength was broad-based across our high end, midrange and branch SRX product as well as our virtual SRX offerings. Our connected security strategy is gaining traction in the market because the convergence of networking and security provides us with a competitive advantage.  And we continue to receive third-party accolades on our solutions from organizations such as ICSA and Nate open, often vesting all competitors in head-to-head tests. We believe our technical strength in both security and networking will continue to provide tailwinds in future quarters and should enable us to grow our security business during the current year. Our software momentum accelerated in Q3. Software and related services revenue grew 67% year-over-year as we experienced growth with ratable subscriptions solid uptake of our Flex software licenses and strong sales of certain perpetual on-box licenses. ARR grew 34% year-over-year, driven by a combination of misdsubscription ratable security software offerings and the related services associated with these software offerings. We experienced record software orders in the quarter due to broad-based strength across verticals and customer solutions. Momentum is strong, both ratable subscriptions offerings as well as on Box licenses. Based on the momentum we're seeing, we're currently tracking ahead of the long-term total software and ARR targets we presented at our recent Investor Day. I'd like to mention that our Services team delivered another solid quarter and continued to grow on a year-over-year basis due to strong renewals and service attach rates. Our Services team continues to execute extremely well to ensure our customers receive an excellent experience. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is substantial to creating value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail."

I will start by discussing our third quarter results and end with some color on our outlook. We ended the third quarter of 2021 at $1.189 billion in revenue, slightly below the midpoint of our guidance, but up 4% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. The modest revenue shortfall as compared to our guidance was due to the negative impact of supply chain constraints. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.46, in line with our guidance. 
During the third quarter, momentum in product orders remained strong, showing exceptional year-over-year growth for the second consecutive quarter. We saw significant order growth across all verticals and all geographies and all customer solutions. Some of this order strength continues to be attributable to industry supply chain challenges that are causing certain customers to place orders early in an effort to secure supply when needed. Even after adjusting for these early orders, total product orders are estimated to have grown in the mid-teens year-over-year. This is the third consecutive quarter of mid-teens bookings growth after adjusting for early orders. It's important to mention that our backlog has increased by more than $1 billion relative to the start of the year. 
Looking at our revenue by vertical. On a year-over-year basis, cloud grew 20%. Enterprise grew 7% and service provider declined 6%. We saw double-digit year-over-year order growth in service provider. However, the timing of shipments due to supply constraints impacted revenue. Turning to Customer Solutions. On a year-over-year basis, cloud-ready data center increased 26%, and [Indiscernible] Enterprise increased 35%. Automated WAN solutions revenue was negatively impacted by supply constraints and declined 12% year-over-year. However, orders grew double digits versus the last year. Total software and related services revenue was $204 million, which was an increase of 67% year-over-year, and ARR grew 34% year-over-year. 
As Rami mentioned, we are pleased that our software-related metrics were at record levels in the third quarter and are tracking ahead of the targets we shared at our Investor Day in February. Total security revenue was $160 million, growing 9% year-over-year. Security product revenue grew 16% year-over-year. 
In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, 6 were Cloud, 3 were Service Provider and 1 was an enterprise. Our top 10 customers accounted for 31% of our total revenue, consistent with the third quarter of 2020. Non-GAAP gross margin was 60.1%, which was above our guidance midpoint, primarily driven by favorable product and customer mix. If not for elevated supply chain cost due to COVID-19, we would have posted non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 61.5%.
Non-GAAP operating expense increased 8% year-over-year and was essentially flat sequentially, slightly below our guidance midpoint. Non-GAAP operating margin was 16.6% for the quarter, which slightly exceeded our expectations. We exited the third quarter with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $1.8 billion. Cash flow from operations was $137 million in the third quarter. From a capital return perspective, we paid $65 million in dividends, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share and repurchased $50 million worth of shares in the third quarter. 
Now I'd like to provide some color on our guidance, which you could find detailed in the CFO commentary is available on our Investor Relations website. Consistent with prior quarters in 2021, the worldwide shortage of semiconductors and other components is impacting many industries, caused in part by the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic. Similar to others, we are experiencing ongoing component shortages which has resulted in extended lead times and elevated costs of certain products. We continue to work to resolve the effect of the supply chain challenges and have increased inventory levels and purchase commitments. We are working closely with our suppliers to further enhance our resiliency and mitigate the effects of recent disruptions outside of our control. We believe that even with these actions, extended lead times and elevated costs will likely persist for at least the next few quarters. While the situation is dynamic at this point in time, we believe we will have access to sufficient supplies of semiconductors and other components to meet our financial forecast. At the midpoint of our guidance, revenue is expected to grow 3.5%. This would be the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. We expect our fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margin to decline sequentially due to higher costs related to supply constraints and product mix. If not for the elevated supply chain cost, we would have forecasted non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 61%. We believe these elevated supply chain cost will prove to be transitory over time, but will likely remain elevated for the next several quarters. I'd like to point out that despite an expected sequential decline in non-GAAP gross margin in Q4. On a full year basis, our guidance remains approximately 59.5%, which is in line with what we provided previously. While there is a lot unknown about the future due to the pandemic and other macroeconomic uncertainty, we would like to provide a few comments on our outlook for 2022. 
We presuming no further COVID-19-related economic deterioration. Based on the current order momentum we are seeing in the anticipated Q4 2021 ending backlog, we expect at least mid-single-digit revenue growth on a full year basis in 2022. In addition, we expect to see at least 100 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin expansion on a full year basis. This guidance is not dependent on improvements in lead times or easing of industry supply chain constraints. We expect to see seasonal patterns from a revenue, non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating expense perspective. As a reminder, our non-GAAP gross margin tends to be sequentially lower in the first quarter with gradual volume-related improvements throughout the course of the year. In addition, operating expense is typically sequentially higher in the first quarter due to the reset of variable compensation and fringe costs. 
In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success, especially in this challenging environment. Now I'd like to open the call for questions."

It just so happens, as you might imagine, for automated WAN, the predominant product is routing. Routing is one of the more complex products that we need to build. They use the most amount of sophisticated semiconductor components and for that reason, the discrepancy between revenue and orders is going to be greater for auto weighted win and by connection also for the service provider. Having said that, I'm very pleased with both our service provider and our automated WAN momentum, especially from a booking standpoint. I should mention every solution area, automated WAN, [Indiscernible] data center and the AI-driven enterprise, had order growth of over 50%. It's just that the automated WAN had a biggest impact from when it came to supply chain challenges. I really like the fact that our newer product that we've introduced into the market, line cards for the MX line cards for the PTX are performing very well. That's something that we monitor closely. We've talked a lot about the metro opportunity, which in large part hasn't really positively helped us in any significant way that really, I think next year and the year after is when it kicks in. But nonetheless, we're seeing very solid early momentum with record orders for our ACX product line, which is predominantly used in that metro opportunity. And the last thing I'll say about automated WAN, which is very encouraging, is our 400-gig win rate. So while we don't necessarily see a ton of revenue yet with 400-gig deployment. We are looking at very solid wins and also growing orders at this point, which is reflected in the automated WAN order growth."

So we are expecting the supply chain cost to remain elevated throughout next year. I still believe they're transitory, and I could be positively surprised where we might see some of that reduction maybe late next year. But at this point, we are presuming that it's going to remain elevated on the cost side. On the pricing side, we are absolutely taking pricing actions to try to protect our gross margin. At this point, I feel that we are going to be able to protect much of our gross margin. It's a little too early to call exactly how that's going to play out. The other thing I would also add is the timing. I do expect that the cost to hit us a little earlier, as you can see from the results, costs have already started to hit us and the pricing actions will take some time to feather in, particularly because we have such a large backlog at the old prices. So we need to burn through the backlog at kind of legacy pricing, if you will. And as we make pricing actually going forward, we'll realize that benefit in 2022, but it might not be evenly throughout the year."

Every vertical is performing extremely well in every solution area is performing extremely well. enterprise, I'd say, is going to be a significant growth driver for us. So assuming, again, supply chain goes our way, I think the differentiation that we have in the market the win rate, the net new wins we're getting sets us up to perform extremely well.

So if you remove that, our strength in the enterprise is phenomenal. We're seeing significant wins of net new opportunities, and there are 2 things that are driving that today. One is our AI-driven enterprise solution, campus and branch that includes the mist for wireless, wired and WAN that's achieving new records every single quarter. triple-digit revenue growth for Mist. The first triple-digit bookings quarter for Mist wireless significant EX wired switching pull-through of the Mist portfolio, all of these are contributing to that portion of the enterprise business. The second vector of growth within the enterprise as a data center there as well over 50% year-over-year order growth, significant differentiation with Astra as a management solution for the data center very solid win rate.

And there are some very unique aspects to our Apstra software offerings. First and foremost, it's the only open solution in the market today. None of our peer automation solutions work on anything but their own switching infrastructure, Apstra works on our own switches as well as Sonic as well as our competitors switches. That turns out to be a highly desirable feature of the technology. Apstra is designed ground up to scale to the largest data centers that's very meaningful for large enterprises, especially in financial services and manufacturing and other similar verticals and Apstra invented, pioneered the concept of intent-based networking.

And I think I did mention that it's not just about WiFi. Although WiFi in and of itself was a record and hit triple-digit bookings for the first time in the Q3 time frame. We saw a record number of EX pull-through both in units but also in revenue as well. So that has always been the strategy for miss, not just by WiFi. It's that entire client to cloud connection that includes WiFi, wired, and when we're seeing the full benefit in wireless and wired as we integrate 120 technology into the WAN, which is really going to happen by the end of this year and the first part of next year, I think we'll see a similar pull-through effect happening on that side as well.

Is that the right way to think about it? And then I have a quick follow-up."

That delta the revenue or the numbers you just quoted. And those were the -- those are the revenue that we could ever arguably should have recognized already, right, in Q3. That plus 10%, that $70 million you're referring to, that if there were not supply constraints, we would have recognized approximately that much more revenue is really the math I want to understand. From a backlog build, it's much greater than that because customers are placing orders at a faster rate."

So when I think about your commentary about at least mid-single-digit revenue growth, that sounds like about 1.5 points of that growth comes from the backlog pushed from, let's say, 3Q into 4Q, and I would imagine you're expecting something similar in Q4.

So I think that gives us confidence in our revenue outlook of at least mid-single-digit revenue growth. The reason why we're not guiding more than at least single digits is supply constrained. So we're supply constrained today, and we're expecting to be supply constrained next year as well. So how much of that backlog and how quickly we're able to ship it is still uncertain at this point, but we feel very good about at least mid-single-digit growth due to the strength of our backlog due to the strength of the momentum we're seeing on the booking side. Quite honestly, the execution we have in the field and the product differentiation we enjoy. So there's a lot of reasons to be more bullish. The one reason to be somewhat prudent is supply, and that's something that's keeping us kind of at the at least mid-single-digit level at this point."

So we already are seeing some of the elevated costs related to component shortages, freight, et cetera, and we expect those costs to remain elevated throughout next year. And in some cases, perhaps get a little worse. Other cases perhaps get a little bit better, but we expect elevated costs throughout all of next year, and we're already experiencing those. We've given you not only the gross margin reported, but the adjusted gross margin, just to account for that those extra costs, which we do believe are transitory. However, at this point, we're assuming it's not going to go away in 2022, it will be beyond that. On the pricing side, we are taking actions. I think many of our competitors are taking similar actions. It will take some time for us to -- for those actions to really hit our P&L. I do expect them to be beneficial to 2022, but the timing will be a little more back-end loaded because we are carrying such a large backlog, right? We have nearly $1.5 billion of backlog. We talked about growing at over $1 billion. We started the year with $420 million. So we're nearly at $1.5 billion. That takes some time to burn through, and that's not going to be impacted by the pricing actions as much as the future of orders will be -- so you'll start to see some benefit. How that all plays out is something we're -- it's just too early for us to quantify and provide outlook on. But what I am confident on is our profitability will grow next year and op margin will expand by at least 100 basis points."

We experienced very strong demand during the September quarter and delivered a fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, even though supply chain challenges impacted revenue in the period. 
Orders saw another quarter of mid-teens year-over-year growth when adjusted to account for extended lead time. On an unadjusted basis, orders grew by more than 50% year-over-year for a second consecutive quarter, and our ending backlog has now increased by more than $1 billion as compared to year-end 2020. Order momentum was strong across verticals, customer solutions and geographies, with each of these categories experiencing growth well into double-digit territory. 
Needless to say, our team is executing extremely well. Our strategy is working, and the investments we have made in technologies that enhance customer operations and improve the end user experience, what we call experience-first networking, are allowing us to differentiate across the markets we serve. This technical differentiation along with the investments we've made in our go-to-market organization are paying off and enabling us to take share and capitalize on some of the big market transitions that are beginning to unfold across the verticals we serve. 
This is particularly true in the enterprise market where customers are increasingly recognizing the value delivered by platforms such as Mist and Apstra that dramatically reduce deployment time, eliminate trouble ticket and reduce mean time to resolution for network problems. These platforms are not only enabling us to win new logos in the campus and the data center, but also to pull through other Juniper products that present meaningful opportunities to expand with customers over time. 
In the cloud and service provider verticals, we're seeing strong early adoption of our 400-gig capable platform due to the strength of our Junos Evolved operating system, our differentiated silicon capabilities and the deep engagement we maintain with these important customers. These factors are not only enabling us to maintain our core franchises, but also to secure a new footprint, including a large new hyperscale WAN deployment that should present tailwinds for our business over the next few years. 
I'm also encouraged by the early customer interest in our metro routing portfolio, which addresses a large and fast-growing market where historically we have in place. We expect this opportunity to steadily ramp through the course of next year as new products come to market and service providers' 5G investments steadily increased. 
The bottom line is that I remain very optimistic regarding our future prospects despite the supply chain challenges we are currently navigating. I believe these challenges are likely to prove transitory in nature, and the strong order momentum we're seeing and the backlog we have developed sets us up extremely well to deliver improved growth and profitability in 2022 and beyond. 
While it remains early, and we'll provide a more detailed 2022 outlook when we report our Q4 results, based on current backlog and the order strength we're continuing to see in the market, we currently expect to deliver at least mid-single-digit sales growth and at least a point of operating margin expansion in 2022. Our expectations for 2022 do not assume a material improvement in supply chain constraints. 
Now I'd like to provide some additional insights into the quarter and address some key developments we're seeing from a customer solutions perspective. Starting with our automated WAN solutions. While revenue declined year-over-year due entirely to supply chain constraints, we experienced another quarter of strong order growth with solid momentum in both our service provider and cloud segments. 
We saw healthy demand across both our MX and PTX product families and strong adoption of our newer products as well as our automation software portfolio. Our 400-gig solutions are performing well and enables us to not only protect our existing footprint but also to secure a new win that includes several large opportunities with our cloud customers, including the hyperscale opportunity I previously referenced. Driven in part by these opportunities, our cloud orders saw a second consecutive quarter of triple-digit growth year-over-year. While we are continuing to see strong customer demand for our automated WAN solutions, these products are currently the most impacted by supply chain challenges. 
As a result, we continue to expect revenue from this segment to be within the range of our long-term model, calling for a 1% decline to a 3% growth this year despite the strong demand we are seeing. Our cloud-ready data center solutions experienced 26% year-over-year revenue growth in Q3 and another quarter of encouraging order trends from our cloud, enterprise and service provider customers. We continue to see strong momentum with new logos and deals greater than $1 million. 
As I mentioned last quarter, Apstra is creating a significant buzz in the market, which is not only leading to more software opportunities but also full stack data center wins. Customer interest in our cloud-ready data center portfolio is high, and we continue to be optimistic about the outlook of this business. Based on the momentum we're seeing, our cloud-ready data center business is now tracking to meet or exceed the high end of our long-term model, looking for 5% to 9% growth year-over-year. 
Finally, our AI-driven enterprise solutions significantly outpaced the market and grew 35% year-over-year. Our Mist AI differentiation continues to win in the market as wireless orders experienced another record quarter with triple-digit growth and a record number of deals greater than $1 million. Our Mistified revenue of wireless LAN, wired access, Marvis virtual network assistance and associated EX pull-through nearly doubled year-over-year, and we experienced record EX pull-through in the period with this pull-through revenue growing more than 200% year-over-year. 
This momentum enabled EX to achieve the highest level of sales since 2014. We expect this momentum to continue in future quarters as customers increasingly recognize the value of AI-driven cloud operations including new and innovative features such as EVPN VXLAN fabric management in the Mist Cloud, which was launched this quarter. On a year-to-date basis, our Mistified revenue has more than doubled year-over-year. 
We are also seeing very positive results with our AI-driven SD-WAN solution, which earned Juniper distinction as the only visionary in the Gartner WAN Edge Magic Quadrant published last quarter. We saw a record quarter for our Session Smart Router portfolio acquired from 128 Technology with triple-digit year-over-year growth and key wins in various sectors like retail and banking, plus especially strong traction with the federal government. 
In addition, branch SRX sales last quarter hit a 2-year high. The pipeline for our AI-driven SDWAN is strong as both prospects and partners are gravitating towards the unique benefits provided by Juniper AIOps with assured client-to-cloud experiences. We are particularly encouraged by the number of full stack multimillion dollar wins we are seeing in the campus and branch, where companies are turning to Juniper for a combination of their wired access, wireless access and WAN Edge needs. 
Examples include a prominent retail chain in North America, a multinational energy company, a European multinational retailer and a leading international construction company in Europe and managed services providers in North America and Europe. This highlights the value of our AI-driven enterprise offerings to customers and partners across all verticals and all geos. We believe Mist AI continues to offer unique and market-leading differentiation, including self-driving operations and predictive actions driven by our virtual network assistant Marvis, resulting in the best user and operator experiences. I am very pleased with the momentum we're seeing in this business and now expect our AI-driven enterprise solutions to see at least 20% growth in 2021. 
Our security revenue experienced strong results in Q3, with total revenue growing 9% year-over-year and product revenue increasing by 16% year-over-year, which marks a third consecutive quarter of double-digit product growth. Strength was broad-based across our high end, midrange and branch SRX products as well as our virtual SRX offerings. Our connected security strategy is gaining traction in the market because the convergence of networking and security provides us with a competitive advantage. And we continue to receive third-party accolades on our solutions from organizations such as ICSA and NetSecOPEN, often vesting all competitors in head-to-head tests. We believe our technical strength in both security and networking will continue to provide tailwinds in future quarters and should enable us to grow our security business during the current year. 
Our software momentum accelerated in Q3. Software and related services revenue grew 67% year-over-year as we experienced growth with ratable subscriptions, solid uptake of our Flex software licenses and strong sales of certain perpetual on-box licenses. ARR grew 34% year-over-year, driven by a combination of Mist subscription, ratable security software offerings and the related services associated with these software offerings. 
We experienced record software orders in the quarter due to broad-based strength across verticals and customer solutions. Momentum is strong, both ratable subscriptions offerings as well as on-box licenses. Based on the momentum we're seeing, we're currently tracking ahead of the long-term total software and ARR targets we presented at our recent Investor Day. 
I'd like to mention that our services team delivered another solid quarter and continued to grow on a year-over-year basis due to strong renewals and service attach rates. Our services team continues to execute extremely well to ensure customers receive an excellent experience. 
I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is substantial to creating value for our stakeholders. 
I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail."

I will start by discussing our third quarter results and end with some color on our outlook. We ended the third quarter of 2021 at $1.189 billion in revenue, slightly below the midpoint of our guidance, but u",1008,"Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start by discussing our third quarter results and end with some color on our outlook. We ended the third quarter of 2021 at $1.189 billion in revenue, slightly below the midpoint of our guidance, but up 4% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. The modest revenue shortfall as compared to our guidance was due to the negative impact of supply chain constraints. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.46, in line with our guidance. 
During the third quarter, momentum in product orders remained strong, showing exceptional year-over-year growth for the second consecutive quarter. We saw significant order growth across all verticals, all geographies and all customer solutions. Some of this order strength continues to be attributable to industry supply chain challenges that are causing certain customers to place orders early in an effort to secure supply when needed. Even after adjusting for these early orders, total product orders are estimated to have grown in the mid-teens year-over-year. This is the third consecutive quarter of mid-teens bookings growth after adjusting for early orders. It's important to mention that our backlog has increased by more than $1 billion relative to the start of the year. 
Looking at our revenue by vertical. On a year-over-year basis, cloud grew 20%. Enterprise grew 7% and service provider declined 6%. We saw double-digit year-over-year order growth in service provider. However, the timing of shipments due to supply constraints impacted revenue. 
Turning to Customer Solutions. On a year-over-year basis, cloud-ready data center increased 26%, and AI-driven enterprise increased 35%. Automated WAN solutions revenue was negatively impacted by supply constraints and declined 12% year-over-year. However, orders grew double digits versus the last year. 
Total software and related services revenue was $204 million, which was an increase of 67% year-over-year. And ARR grew 34% year-over-year. As Rami mentioned, we are pleased that our software-related metrics were at record levels in the third quarter and are tracking ahead of the targets we shared at our Investor Day in February. 
Total security revenue was $160 million, growing 9% year-over-year. Security product revenue grew 16% year-over-year. 
In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, 6 were cloud, 3 were service provider and 1 was an enterprise. Our top 10 customers accounted for 31% of our total revenue, consistent with the third quarter of 2020. 
Non-GAAP gross margin was 60.1%, which was above our guidance midpoint, primarily driven by favorable product and customer mix. If not for elevated supply chain cost due to COVID-19, we would have posted non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 61.5%.
Non-GAAP operating expense increased 8% year-over-year and was essentially flat sequentially, slightly below our guidance midpoint. Non-GAAP operating margin was 16.6% for the quarter, which slightly exceeded our expectations. 
We exited the third quarter with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $1.8 billion. Cash flow from operations was $137 million in the third quarter. From a capital return perspective, we paid $65 million in dividends, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share, and repurchased $50 million worth of shares in the third quarter. 
Now I'd like to provide some color on our guidance, which you could find detailed in the CFO commentary available on our Investor Relations website. Consistent with prior quarters in 2021, the worldwide shortage of semiconductors and other components is impacting many industries, caused in part by the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic. Similar to others, we are experiencing ongoing component shortages which has resulted in extended lead times and elevated costs of certain products. We continue to work to resolve the effect of the supply chain challenges and have increased inventory levels and purchase commitments. We are working closely with our suppliers to further enhance our resiliency and mitigate the effects of recent disruptions outside of our control. 
We believe that even with these actions, extended lead times and elevated costs will likely persist for at least the next few quarters. While the situation is dynamic at this point in time, we believe we will have access to sufficient supplies of semiconductors and other components to meet our financial forecast. At the midpoint of our guidance, revenue is expected to grow 3.5%. This would be the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. 
We expect our fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margin to decline sequentially due to higher costs related to supply constraints and product mix. If not for the elevated supply chain cost, we would have forecasted non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 61%. We believe these elevated supply chain costs will prove to be transitory over time, but will likely remain elevated for the next several quarters. 
I'd like to point out that despite an expected sequential decline in non-GAAP gross margin in Q4, on a full year basis, our guidance remains approximately 59.5%, which is in line with what we provided previously. While there is a lot unknown about the future due to the pandemic and other macroeconomic uncertainty, we would like to provide a few comments on our outlook for 2022. 
Presuming no further COVID-19-related economic deterioration, based on the current order momentum we are seeing, and the anticipated Q4 2021 ending backlog, we expect at least mid-single-digit revenue growth on a full year basis in 2022. In addition, we expect to see at least 100 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin expansion on a full year basis. This guidance is not dependent on improvements in lead times or easing of industry supply chain constraints. 
We expect to see seasonal patterns from a revenue, non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating expense perspective. As a reminder, our non-GAAP gross margin tends to be sequentially lower in the first quarter, with gradual volume-related improvements throughout the course of the year. In addition, operating expense is typically sequentially higher in the first quarter due to the reset of variable compensation and fringe costs. 
In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success, especially in this challenging environment. Now I'd like to open the call for questions."

It just so happens, as you might imagine, for automated WAN, the predominant product is routing. Routing is one of the more complex products that we need to build. They use the most amount of sophisticated semiconductor components, and for that reason, the discrepancy between revenue and orders is going to be greater for automated WAN and by connection, also for the service provider. 
Now having said that, I'm very pleased with both our service provider and our automated WAN momentum, especially from a booking standpoint. I should mention every solution area, automated WAN, cloud-ready data center and the AI-driven enterprise had order growth of over 50%. It's just that the automated WAN had a biggest impact from when it came to supply chain challenges. 
I really like the fact that our newer product that we've introduced into the market, line cards for the MX, line cards for the PTX are performing very well. That's something that we monitor closely. We've talked a lot about the metro opportunity, which in large part hasn't really positively helped us in any significant way that, really, I think next year and the year after is when it kicks in. But nonetheless, we're seeing very solid early momentum with record orders for our ACX product line, which is predominantly used in that metro opportunity. 
And the last thing I'll say about automated WAN, which is very encouraging, is our 400-gig win rate. So while we don't necessarily see a ton of revenue yet with 400-gig deployment. We are looking at very solid wins and also growing orders at this point, which is reflected in the automated WAN order growth."

On the pricing side, we are absolutely taking pricing actions to try to protect our gross margin. At this point, I feel that we are going to be able to protect much of our gross margin. It's a little too early to call exactly how that's going to play out. 
The other thing I would also add is the timing. I do expect that the cost to hit us a little earlier. As you can see from the results, costs have already started to hit us and the pricing actions will take some time to feather in, particularly because we have such a large backlog at the old prices. So we need to burn through the backlog at kind of legacy pricing, if you will. And as we make pricing actually going forward, we'll realize that benefit in 2022. But it might not be evenly throughout the year."

If a supply chain situation does start to materially improve next year, then I think there is upside to that number. So I would just start with that. 
In terms of where that growth comes in. Every vertical is performing extremely well, and every solution area is performing extremely well. Enterprise, I'd say, is going to be a significant growth driver for us. So assuming, again, supply chain goes our way, I think the differentiation that we have in the market, the win rate, the net new wins we're getting sets us up to perform extremely well. 
Service provider, I think, could actually do exceptionally well and even compete with the enterprise vertical just from the standpoint of the significant backlog that we've built thus far. So it's going to be very difficult to predict exact stack ordering of contributors to that growth, primarily because it's going to be very much determined by the supply chain situation."

We're seeing significant wins of net new opportunities, and there are 2 things that are driving that today. One is our AI-driven enterprise solutions, campus and branch that includes the Mist for wireless, wired and WAN. That's achieving new records every single quarter, triple-digit revenue growth for Mist. The first triple-digit bookings quarter for Mist wireless significant EX wired switching pull-through of the Mist portfolio, all of these are contributing to that portion of the enterprise business. 
The second vector of growth within the enterprise as a data center there as well over 50% year-over-year order growth, significant differentiation with Apstra as a management solution for the data center, very solid win rate.

But one way to look at it is the difference between our adjusted bookings on a product perspective, which is 15% or mid-teens in Q3 year-over-year as compared to our revenue growth on a product perspective of 5%. So it's easily to imply that there's an extra 10% of revenue growth that did not happen due to supply constraints. And that would have really lifted all boats, enterprise, cloud and SP."

And one thing I would say, Simon, yes, we have purchase orders throughout all of next year. In some cases, out 50 weeks; in other cases, out 80 weeks, in an attempt to secure supply. 
And these are noncancelable committed purchase orders with pricing. That said, this pricing environment is kind of taking that and throwing it out the window. We are seeing costs going up despite the fact that we have orders in place. So we are expecting -- the orders we have in place are not necessarily the price we're going to pay, whether it's disguised in the form of an expedite fee or purchase price bearings, et cetera, we're seeing costs going up in advance of those orders being fulfilled if that makes sense."

Let me start with your question about Apstra. So first, I'll just say very quickly that we never anticipated that the Apstra would be a significant opportunity in the hyperscale space, primarily because the top 5 hyperscale customers tend to develop their own automation software. That being said, everything outside of hyperscale, enterprise, service provider, even cloud majors is an opportunity. Where we have thus far seen the quickest win rates, the biggest pipeline build is in the enterprise, large to midsized enterprise companies. 
And as I mentioned earlier, it's extremely encouraging the rate at which we are taking down new opportunities. There is absolutely a demand for this kind of automation technology for the data center space. And there are some very unique aspects to our Apstra software offering. First and foremost, it's the only open solution in the market today. None of our peer automation solutions work on anything but their own switching infrastructure. Apstra works on our own switching as well as SONiC as well as our competitors switches. That turns out to be a highly desirable feature of the technology. 
Apstra is designed ground up to scale to the largest data centers that's very meaningful for large enterprises, especially in financial services and manufacturing and other similar verticals. And Apstra invented, pioneered the concept of intent-based networking. So from an operational experience standpoint, there really is nothing as good as it's in the market. So very, very pleased with the performance thus far, and I think this is going to be a great growth driver for us in the future."

Q3 was no difference in terms of the quarter-over-quarter record we continue to make. This was a record AI-driven enterprise orders quarter and record AI-driven revenue quarter for us. 
Order growth is well into double digits growth in all customer verticals, SP, enterprise and cloud providers that are all embracing the technology. And I think I did mention that it's not just about WiFi. Although WiFi in and of itself was a record and hit triple-digit bookings for the first time in the Q3 time frame. We saw a record number of EX pull-through both in units but also in revenue as well. So that has always been the strategy for Mist not just by WiFi, it's that entire client to cloud connection that includes WiFi, wired and WAN. We're seeing the full benefit in wireless and wired as we integrate 120 Technology into the WAN, which is really going to happen by the end of this year and the first part of next year. I think we'll see a similar pull-through effect happening on that side as well. So the momentum has just been really strong. I expect that to continue for sure."

On the pricing side, we are taking actions. I think many of our competitors are taking similar actions. It will take some time for us to -- for those actions to really hit our P&L. I do expect them to be beneficial to 2022, but the timing will be a little more back-end loaded because we are carrying such a large backlog, right? We have nearly $1.5 billion of backlog. We talked about growing at over $1 billion. We started the year with $420 million. So we're nearly at $1.5 billion. 
That takes some time to burn through, and that's not going to be impacted by the pricing actions as much as the future of orders will be. So you'll start to see some benefit.

Second quarter of triple-digit order growth. And I love the broad-based strength that we're seeing. So we're seeing an expansion within hyperscale of opportunities and diversity across the 4 or 5 big hyperscale customers. So it's not just our traditionally largest cloud provider customer that's driving that growth. There's also other hyperscale customers. And add to that, the cloud majors, Tier 2, Tier 3 cloud providers that are also performing very well. There's an additional element of strength and broad-based diversity, and that is in the technology space. So routing, switching and security are all performing really well within the cloud provider segment."

However, I will say I'm looking at the hot off the press earnings results from our -- the hyperscale cloud providers looking at their CapEx rates and feeling very good about that because as long as their business is performing well, they will need to invest in their infrastructure to maintain that strength to keep up with the demand that they are seeing, and we will benefit from that. As simple as that. Our footprint in routing within hyperscale is phenomenal. We've maintained that footprint despite many attempts by competitors to take slices of it away from us. And then as you go into the top 10 and the cloud majors, it's not just about routing. It's about routing and switching for us."

Many companies are exploring and implementing it. And I can tell you that so far, we've taken some actions. We'll continue to look at opportunities going forward, all in an effort to protect our gross margin. 
The input costs are absolutely rising. I think that's not a secret. It starts upstream with the wafers and the fabs and then moves into our component suppliers, and they're seeing higher costs and they're looking to pass those on to us. And we're looking to pass those on to our customers. And so far, we feel that -- we feel confident we are going to benefit from the actions we're taking, but we -- it's just too early to commit to gross margin inputs -- gross margin outputs for next year."

That's sort of how I would answer that question. And then in the campus and branch, in particular, yes, I mean, there are going to be cost pressures there just like anywhere else. But the thing about campus and branch that makes me feel very good is the level of differentiation, and this is a software-led differentiation has never been stronger, and it allows us to win to compete and win on value. So there are opportunities that we are winning now fairly routinely where we are not price leaders, and yet we're able to garner a greater price just because of the differentiation that we have with that solution."
