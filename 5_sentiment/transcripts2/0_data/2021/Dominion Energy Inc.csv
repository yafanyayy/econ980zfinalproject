I want to start by outlining Dominion Energy's compelling shareholder return proposition. We expect to grow our earnings per share by 6.5% per year through at least 2025, supported by our updated $32 billion 5",1298,"Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by outlining Dominion Energy's compelling shareholder return proposition. We expect to grow our earnings per share by 6.5% per year through at least 2025, supported by our updated $32 billion 5-year capital growth plan. We offer an attractive dividend yield of approximately 3.5%, reflecting a target payout ratio of 65% and an expected long-term dividend per share growth rate of 6%. 
This resulting 10% total shareholder return proposition is combined with an industry-leading ESG profile, characterized by what we believe is the largest regulated decarbonization investment opportunity in the country. We plan to invest tens of billions of dollars over the next several years to the benefit of the environment, our customers, our communities and our local economies. 
Our strategy is anchored on a pure-play state-regulated utility operating profile that centers around 5 premier states, as shown on Slide 5. I'll share the philosophy with a common sense approach to energy policy and regulation puts a priority on safety, reliability, affordability and, increasingly, sustainability. These states also strive to create environments that promote sensible economic growth, which like the rising tide lifts all boats. 
For instance, 3 of these state jurisdictions rank consistently in the top 4 best states for business as determined by independent analysis carried out by CNBC and by Forbes. Our state-regulated utility model offers investors increased predictability and is enhanced by our concentration in these fast-growing, constructive and business-friendly states. 
Turning to Slide 6. Dominion is a purpose-driven company and has adopted a comprehensive stakeholder approach. We are driven by the belief that the world's best companies consider the interest not just of investors but also employees, customers and communities and the well-being of the environment. Our actions are grounded in adherence to our 5 core values, and we embrace transparency and stakeholder engagement as hallmarks of responsible corporate citizenship. 
The well-being of our over 17,000 employees is critical to our long-term success, and there is no measure more important to our company than the safety performance of our employees. 2020 represented by a wide margin the safest year of operations in the history of our company, as depicted on Slide 7. This result did not happen overnight. As you can see, it takes years of dedicated effort to drive sustainable improvement. I congratulate my colleagues on this significant achievement. 
Turning now to our customers and communities. We believe that it is not enough that we provide energy safely. We must also provide energy that is affordable. We are pleased the residential rates at our 2 electric utilities compare favorably to state, national and, where applicable, state averages. Looking forward, we expect our customers to be very competitive even as we invest heavily to transform our system's carbon footprint. Bob will address this more comprehensively in his remarks. 
With regard to our community initiatives during 2020, which are described on Slide 8. First, the impact of COVID-19 on our customers during 2020 was obviously significant, which is why we voluntarily took immediate action at the onset of the pandemic to suspend service disconnections. In doing this, we avoided what otherwise would have been disconnection of over 255,000 customer accounts. We also developed extended and flexible payment plans, resulting in over 330,000 enrollments. And we contributed $18 million toward direct energy assistance for our most vulnerable customers. 
In Virginia, we supported special session legislation, which gave customers a fresh start by forgiving over $125 million of customer arrears. We also agreed to a pause in our South Carolina rate case proceeding, ensuring that the results of that case will not impact customers until late this year. 
Second, we've built on our long-standing legacy of supporting social equity by committing $25 million to 11 historically Black colleges and universities, funding an additional $10 million for scholarships for underrepresented minority groups and creating a $5 million social justice fund that supports community efforts to address the impacts of racism. This is in addition to the diversity and inclusion initiatives within our company that Bob will address. As you can tell, we are extremely proud of these accomplishments, and I thank all of my Dominion Energy colleagues who contributed to these successes in what was obviously an extraordinarily challenging year. 
Turning now to Slide 9. We have rolled forward our 5-year capital growth plan to capture the years 2021 through 2025. This has resulted in a $10 billion or 43% increase to the plan we shared with you in the spring of 2019 as adjusted for the Gas Transmission & Storage sale. We now project $32 billion of growth capital investment on behalf of our customers, over 80% of which reduces or enables emissions reductions. We plan to invest $17 billion in zero carbon generation and energy storage, including regulated offshore wind, solar and nuclear relicensing. Another $6 billion in electric grid enhancements, such as electric transmission and grid modernization, which will enable our system to be more resilient to cyber and climate threats and more responsive to increasing intermittent generation. 
And we plan to invest $3 billion on the modernization of our LDC networks as well as on renewable natural gas development, thereby increasing safety and reliability while driving emissions down. Jim and Bob will provide more color on these industry-leading investment programs in a moment. 
As meaningful as these near-term plans are, consider on Slide 10 how they compare to the long-term scope and duration of our overall decarbonization opportunity. Our initiatives extend well beyond our 5-year plan. We have identified over $70 billion of green investment opportunity between 2020 and 2035, nearly all of which will qualify for regulated cost of service recovery. This is, as far as we can tell, the largest regulated decarbonization investment opportunity in the industry. 
And the accelerating electrification of the transportation sector promises to drive growing demand for utility-scale, zero and low-carbon generation for many years to come. The company's long-term transformation has multiple beneficiaries: our customers who want more sustainable energy; our local communities, which benefit from the economic growth and tax revenue to the company's investments; our employees who develop the best practices of the transition to a low-carbon future; in the environment, via the emissions reductions we illustrate on Slide 11. 
Through 2019, inclusive of asset divestitures, we have successfully reduced our enterprise-wide CO2-equivalent emissions by around 55%. This is great progress but we have more to do. By 2035, we expect to improve that reduction to between 70% and 80% versus baseline on our way to net 0 by 2050. As shown on the right side of the slide, by 2035, we expect that approximately 95% of our company-owned generation will be either 0 or low emitting, a remarkable transformation from our 2005 mix. 
Before turning it over to Jim, I will summarize the actions and events of 2020 that have positioned Dominion to thrive for years to come. We took care of one another, and in so doing, we achieved an all-time safety record. We took quick action to work with our customers to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We announced our ambition to be net 0 by 2050. The Virginia Clean Economy Act was adopted by the general assembly, which puts the state on a cutting-edge path to decarbonization and positions the state as a hub for the global green economy transition. 
We advanced our strategic positioning by selling our Gas Transmission & Storage assets to focus on our premier state-regulated utility operations. We simultaneously initiated best-in-class earnings and dividend growth rates. We reported our 20th consecutive quarter of weather-normal results that met or exceeded the midpoint of our quarterly guidance. And we transitioned both our CEO and Lead Director roles. With that, I will turn it over to Jim."
267105,700658153,2208695,"Dominion Energy, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2021",2021-02-12,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tom, and good morning. Our fourth quarter 2020 operating earnings, as shown on Slide 14, were $0.81 per share, which included a $0.01 hurt from worse-than-normal weather in our utility service territories. Both actual and weather-normalized res",1180,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning. Our fourth quarter 2020 operating earnings, as shown on Slide 14, were $0.81 per share, which included a $0.01 hurt from worse-than-normal weather in our utility service territories. Both actual and weather-normalized results were above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance range. Full year 2020 operating earnings per share were $3.54, above the midpoint of our guidance range and included a $0.09 hurt from weather. Weather-normalized results of $3.63 were at the top of our annual guidance range. 
Note that our fourth quarter and 2020 GAAP and operating earnings, together with comparative periods, are adjusted to account for discontinued operations, including those associated with the sale of assets to Berkshire Hathaway Energy. And then a summary of such adjustments between operating and reported results is, as usual, included in Schedule 2 of our earnings release kit. 
As shown on Slide 15, this represents our 20th consecutive quarter, so 5 years now, of delivering weather-normal results that meet or exceed the midpoint of our quarterly guidance range. We've highlighted here the July 5 Gas Transmission & Storage sale announcement on the chart as this was obviously -- obviously has had an impact on our original annual guidance, which is, of course, prior to that transaction. But regardless, we believe the historic consistency across our quarterly results is worth highlighting and it's a track record we are absolutely focused on extending. 
Turning now to Slide -- to guidance on Slide 16. As usual, we are providing a range for the year, which is designed primarily to account for variations from normal weather. We are initiating 2021 operating EPS guidance of $3.70 to $4 per share. The midpoint of this range is in line with the indicative guidance midpoint range we provided in July. Measured midpoint to midpoint, we expect approximately 10% growth in 2021, also consistent with our July guidance. Looking longer term, we expect operating EPS to grow off the 2021 base at around 6.5% per year through 2025. Finally, we expect first quarter 2021 operating earnings per share to be between $1 and $1.15. 
Turning to Slide 17. We expect our 2021 full year dividend to be $2.52, reflecting our target payout ratio of approximately 65%. We're also extending the long-range dividend per share growth rate of 6% off that '21 base through 2025. 
Slide 18 provides a breakdown of the 5-year growth CapEx roll-forward which Tom introduced. For more details on this, I would point to the very comprehensive appendix materials. We've really put some effort into providing all the more granular detail, which we expect will be useful for understanding and modeling each part of this growth profile. 
But just a few items I'll highlight here. We are forecasting a total 5-year rate base CAGR of around 9%, broken out here by segment and by major driver. I would note that nearly 3/4 of this planned growth CapEx is eligible for rider recovery. That nomenclature varies but capital invested under riders, rate adjustment clauses or trackers, as they're called in various jurisdictions, allows for more timely recovery of prudently incurred investments and costs. They're filed and trued-up at least annually in single issue proceedings, so outside of the more time-consuming and less frequent general base rate proceedings. 
In some of our jurisdictions, including Virginia, rider recovery mechanisms utilize a forward-looking or projected test period and/or allows for our construction work in progress, all of which minimizes traditional regulatory lag that, in other cases, can prevent utilities from earning at their authorized return levels. Rider-eligible CapEx programs varies a little by state, but prominent examples for us include offshore wind, solar, energy storage, nuclear licensing, electric transmission, strategic undergrounding, grid transformation, rural broadband and gas distribution, infrastructure, integrity and modernization spending. 
On that theme, and turning to Slide 19, we illustrate how base investments and rider investments are expected to trend at Dominion Energy Virginia through the 5-year plan. You'll note that the Virginia base investment balance is growing at about 6% annually, driven primarily by new customer connections and maintenance spending. By contrast, the rider investment balance in Virginia, which comprises half of DEV's investment base today, is expected to grow at nearly 20% annually on average. 
Since the Virginia rider investment programs are reviewed and trued up annually, they are not included in the triennial review process, the first of which, of course, will commence next month. Based on these growth trends, the base investment balance as a percentage of total DEV declines from 37% to 27% by 2025. It also shrinks dramatically as a percentage of overall Dominion Energy. 
On Slide 20, we refresh our outlook for sources and uses of cash. So on average, between '21 and '23, we expect to generate annual operating cash flow of around $6.6 billion, return around $2.4 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividend and invest nearly $8 billion a year on growth and maintenance CapEx on behalf of our customers. Our financing plan assumes we issue around $400 million of equity annually through our existing DRIP and ATM programs, with the residual financing needs satisfied by net fixed income issuance. 
Again, and as shown on Slide 21, these are multiyear averages. To be clear, in 2021, we don't expect any issuance under our ATM program. This equity guidance is consistent with our prior guidance for the '21 through '24 period. We view this level of steady equity issuance under existing programs as prudent, EPS accretive and in the context of our very sizable growth capital spending program, appropriate to keep our consolidated credit metrics within the guidelines for our strong credit rating categories. 
To that point, as shown on Slide 22, our consolidated credit metrics have continued their steady improvement as has our pension plan's funded status. We're all very proud of these results. We continue to target high BBB range credit ratings for our parent company and single A range ratings for our regulated operating companies. 
Before I summarize my remarks, let me spend a minute on O&M. As demonstrated by our 2020 results, we're focusing on driving O&M through improved processes, innovative use of technology and other best practice cost initiatives to keep normalized O&M flat through the forecast period. This reflects the successful continuation of our flat normalized O&M efforts we discussed in more detail at our last Investor Day. 
So with that, I'll summarize. We reported fourth quarter and full year 2020 operating EPS, which were above the midpoint of our guidance, extending our track record to 5 years of meeting or exceeding the quarterly midpoint on a weather-normal basis. We initiated 2021 full year operating EPS guidance that represents a 10% annual increase midpoint to midpoint. We affirmed 6.5% operating EPS growth from '21 [ through '25 ] We introduced a $32 billion 5-year growth CapEx plan that drives an approximately 9% rate base growth. We expect highly disproportionate rider investment spending across our segment. And our balance sheet and credit profile remain in very good health. With that, I'll turn it over to Bob."
267105,700658153,2208695,"Dominion Energy, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2021",2021-02-12,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 25, which provides an overview of the Virginia Clean Economy Act. The law mandates a renewable energy portfolio standard that over the next 25 years moves towards a 0 carbon future. In order to",3039,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 25, which provides an overview of the Virginia Clean Economy Act. The law mandates a renewable energy portfolio standard that over the next 25 years moves towards a 0 carbon future. In order to achieve the RPS milestones, the law calls on the state's utilities to add significant amounts of wind and solar power generation as well as battery storage, ramps up energy efficiency and demand side management programs, requires the use of Virginia-based renewable energy credits, mandates that Virginia join the regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and requires the retirement of substantial coal-fired generation by 2025 and all ossified units by 2046, subject to reliability and energy security considerations. 
The largest single investment project come out of the passage of the VCEA is Dominion Energy's initial 2.6-gigawatt offshore wind deployment, as described on Slide 26. I'm not going to go through every line item on this slide but will highlight the following: first, the project, which is the largest of its kind in North America, is very much on track. This project will provide a boost to Virginia's growing green economy by creating hundreds of jobs, hundreds of millions of dollars of economic output and millions of dollars of tax revenue for the state and localities. It will also propel Virginia closer to achieving its goal to become a major hub for the burgeoning offshore wind value chain up and down the country's East Coast. 
Second, as was contemplated in the VCEA, we intend this investment to be 100% regulated and eligible for rider recovery. Finally, the VCEA provides very specific requirements on the presumption of prudency for investment in the project as shown here, which we are confident that we will meet. 
On Slide 27, we list the major project milestones. In December of last year, we submitted our construction and operations plan to BOEM. We're encouraged by the incremental funding appropriated to BOEM late last year, with the specific direction to augment the agency's resources to process offshore wind permits as well as BOEM's recent recommencement of processing the vineyard wind application. As you likely know by now, we are the only owner in the United States to have completed an offshore wind BOEM permitting process successfully. Our 12-megawatt test project, which recently entered service, completed the BOEM permitting process in 2019, and we're applying lessons learned during that process to our present application. 
The other item I'll highlight is on the left-hand side of this slide. The lease is positioned in shallow water, outside of major maritime shipping lanes, away from any other offshore wind leaseholds and not in a region that supports a significant commercial fishing industry. We expect to receive final permits in mid-2023 and complete project construction around the end of 2026. 
The VCEA calls for another 2.6 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2036. While our near-term focus is on successfully executing on our initial deployment, we look forward to finding ways to support the state's additional offshore wind capacity goals. The VCEA provides that the cost of any offshore wind project will be borne by our customers only in proportion to our ownership of the project. 
While offshore wind may be our largest single renewable energy project, the aggregate capacity of solar generation called for by the VCEA is over 3x larger. In accordance with the law, 65% of the target amount is to be utility-owned. This is not new ground for us or for the commission. To date, we've made 4 cost of service rider recovery filings for solar projects in Virginia, 3 representing around 400 megawatts have been approved in the most recent filing is pending approval. We expect to make additional filings annually as we work toward the over 10 gigawatts of regulated solar capacity called for by the law. 
Current solar technology requires around 10 acres for every megawatt of installed capacity. Rough math suggests, therefore, that the utility-owned target of around 10,000 megawatts will require around 100,000 acres of land. We've been hard at work to secure enough land to support our long-range goal, and I'm pleased to report that in less than a year, we've put 63,000 acres under option. 
Turning to Slide 29. What started with an 8-megawatt facility in Georgia in 2013 has today become a portfolio of over 2.2 gigawatts, representing over $5 billion of investment. Our early focus was on the development of long-term contracted projects, mostly outside of Virginia, that allowed us to develop the expertise and competency to undertake the substantial regulated solar build-out in Virginia that I just described. Going forward, you can see that our emphasis shifts, and a very significant majority of our solar capacity investment will take place under regulated cost of service recovery mechanisms in Virginia. 
Growth in long-term contracted solar is limited and driven by large customer requests for bilateral, 100% renewable power supply. As increasing intermittent generation sources proliferate in our system, energy storage will be critical to maintaining reliable service. We observed, with keen interest, a recent example of the negative consequences that occur for customers when rapid changes in intermittent generation are not accommodated with sufficient storage and/or quick-start gas-fired generation. Hence, the VCEA prudently calls for the development of nearly 3 gigawatts of energy storage by 2036, 65% of which is to be utility-owned and rider eligible. 
Admittedly, we're starting small when it comes to developing technologies in this area, [ 16 megawatts ] of pilot projects across 3 different sites and 3 different use case scenarios, as shown on the right side of Slide 30. But starting small has its advantages, as we saw in both our offshore wind and solar development strategies. We're rapidly developing expertise that will ensure we're providing the maximum value to customers as we fulfill the targets of the VCEA. 
In our estimation, the success of greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets requires the ongoing viability of existing nuclear facilities. That's why we filed for 20-year license extensions for our 4 Virginia regulated units. Today, these facilities account for 30% of Virginia's total electric output, around 90% of Virginia's 0 carbon electricity. Based on PJM's carbon intensity rate, the ongoing operation of these plants will effectively avoid CO2 emissions of 16 million tons per year. 
Key milestones for the relicensing process are shown on Slide 31. We expect to submit for rider cost recovery approval in the second half of this year. Our near-term focus is on the Virginia unit. But under the appropriate circumstances, life extensions over the long term at our other 3 units may be advisable. Successful nuclear life extension is a win for customers and the environment. 
The transition to a clean energy future means reduced reliance on coal-fired generation. As Tom showed, in 2005, more than half our company's power production was from coal-fired generation. By 2035, we project that to be closer to 5%, perhaps lower if the South Carolina prefers an accelerated decarbonization plan as part of our IRP refiling. 
From an investment-based perspective, which is a rough approximation of earnings contribution, you can see, on Slide 32, the role coal-fired generation plays in our financial performance, driven by facility retirements and noncoal investment. We're mindful that this shift has the potential to be disruptive to employees and communities and are being purposeful in our efforts to ameliorate any such negative consequences. You'll also note that 0 carbon generation grows significantly such that by 2025, over 60% of our investment base will consist of electric wires and 0 carbon generation. 
Turning to Slide 33. Let me address customer rates with a focus on Virginia. First, between 2008 and 2020, our typical residential customer rate increased, on average, by less than 1% per year, which is much lower than average annual inflation over that period of closer to 2%. Second, based on EIA data, our typical customer rate is 13% lower than the national average and 36% lower than other states, that like Virginia have joined And third, going forward, we see typical residential rates increasing by a compound annual growth rate of around 2.9% through 2030, which is a comprehensive estimate and includes, among other factors, the impact of the decarbonization investment programs we've discussed today. 
If we move the starting point back to 2008, that rate of increase falls to 2.1%, which is lower than projected inflation for 2021. It's incumbent upon us to deliver energy that is safe, reliable, increasingly sustainable and affordable. 
Now on Slide 34, let me address the upcoming triennial review proceeding. Note, we've developed detailed slides in the appendix that we believe will be helpful to you on this topic. First, the triennial review process will commence next month and conclude late this year. Second, this triennial review will cover 4 years of performance from 2017 through 2020 and compares our earned return to our allowed return of 9.9%, inclusive of a 70 basis point power. 
Third, and as Jim pointed out, the review applies only to the Virginia-based portion of our rate base. Rider investments are outside the scope of the proceeding. And finally, to the extent the commission concludes that available revenues, inclusive of adjustments for impairments, weather and other factors, are greater than customer credit reinvestments, it may order a refund as well as a forward-looking revenue reduction of up to $50 million. 
So let me point out just 2 factors that we know will be part of the first review process. First, we've invested nearly $300 million in the on-time and on-budget completion of the 12-megawatt offshore wind test project. We've indicated we will not seek a revenue increase from customers associated with this project. Rather, we will apply that investment as needed as a customer credit reinvestment offset. 
Second, we provided over $125 million of arrears relief in Virginia to assist customers, many of whom have faced financial hardship as a result of COVID. Naturally, we're focused on the triennial review filing next month, but we also get questions from time to time regarding the second triennial review, which is expected to conclude in almost 4 years. 
A few observations there, which are shown on Slide 35. First, we're in the very early days, 43 days, I think, of that review period. So obviously, we have quite a way to go before being in a position to file the precise regulatory inputs for that proceeding. What we do know, however, is that the structure of the review will be similar to [ T1 ]. This includes the ability, for instance, to use customer credit reinvestment offsets, which allow us to invest in projects for the benefit of customers. 
Second, as Jim described well, the robust growth of our asset base at DEV is concentrated around rider recoverable investments that are outside the scope of triennial available earnings reviews. Combined with growth at our other state-regulated operating segments, the proportion of the company's earnings and cash flows which are subject to triennial earnings tests will naturally diminish over the forecast and beyond. 
Third, the very nature of our business as a state-regulated utility company is working with regulators to deliver beneficial outcomes for both customers and investors. It's something we've been doing for many years. We expect to continue to apply the experience we've gained to upcoming rate proceedings of all varieties, including the triennial reviews. We firmly believe that there are a number of paths that converge on a single objective: serving customers, employees, communities, the environment and investors. 
On top of that, we're incredibly excited about what Dominion Energy is planning to accomplish well beyond the next 2 triennial reviews. Specifically, over the next 15 years, the investment of upwards of $70 billion of green capital, nearly all of which will grow earnings under regulated rider mechanisms and significantly reduce emissions while maintaining competitive customer rates. We don't believe any other company in the United States offers the duration, visibility and scope of regulated decarbonization growth that Dominion Energy now offers. 
Shifting gears a little on Slide 36, we summarize the status of the pending South Carolina general rate case proceeding, which is presently in a 6-month pause, which we supported. As part of the pause, the commission ordered the parties to report, on a monthly basis, on their progress toward reaching a settlement. We can't report to you this morning on the status of current negotiations, obviously, but we look forward to continuing to engage with parties to the case in hopes of finding a suitable resolution to bring before the clinician for approval. 
In the meantime, our commitment to customers is unwavering. Over the last approximately 15 years, we've reduced average annual customer outage minutes or by 40%. Investments made in prior periods, including the years covered by our recent rate case filing, are critical to system reliability and the continuation of this trend to the benefit of our customers. We're committed to meeting 100% of our merger commitments, establishing trust with our customers and communities and working toward an increasingly sustainable future for South Carolinians. 
In that regard, let me provide an update on our integrated resource plan. Briefly, the commission asked us to refile the plan and consider, among other changes, accelerated renewable energy deployment and increased sensitivities to potential carbon pricing. In the table on the right-hand side, you can see how one of the cases we filed with our original IRP called [ Plan 8 ], is indicative of the potential for accelerated decarbonization at only slightly higher customer cost as compared to the prior base plan. Plan 8 would retire 1,300 megawatts of coal-fired generation in 2028 and add 300 megawatts of storage and 700 megawatts of new solar, which would result in a nearly 60% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030 and only cost approximately 3% more than the base plan. We look forward to engaging with all stakeholders on this planning process. 
On Slide 38, we provide key elements of our gas distribution segment growth and sustainability strategy. Our utilities operate in some of the fastest-growing areas of the country, with annual customer growth rates approaching 3% in 2 of our 3 largest markets. These customers simply prefer natural gas service for cooking, heating and other residential, commercial and industrial applications. 
We're also fortunate to operate jurisdictions for regulation prioritize safety and reliability. Decoupling mechanisms promote the implementation of increased efficiency measures, which help to reduce customer bills. And infrastructure modernization and integrity trackers allow us to make critical investments and upgrades that both reduce emissions and raise the bar on safe and reliable service. 
When it comes to natural gas distribution, location matters. We know that for natural gas to be relevant in the future, we must continue to focus on increasing the sustainability of our service. We've adopted a ambitious Scope 1 emission targets but that isn't enough. We're now looking at Scope 3 emissions in cutting-edge ways. We formalized our support for federal methane regulation. And we're working towards procurement practices that encourage enhanced disclosures by upstream counterparties on their emissions and methane reduction programs. 
Further, we're considering a preference for suppliers and shippers who adopt a net 0 commitment. For downstream emissions, we plan to increase our annual spend on energy efficiency by 45% over the next 5 years and provide our customers with access to a carbon calculator and carbon offsets. We're also developing plans which will require collaboration with policymakers and regulators to increase access to RNG for our customers and, ultimately, to initiate mandatory RNG blend levels that would act to offset our customers' carbon footprint. 
And finally, we're pursuing innovative hydrogen use cases, which we discuss in more detail in the appendix. This includes our participation as a founding member of the Low Carbon Resources Initiative that just surpassed $100 million of funding from over 30 industry members. 
I'll conclude my remarks by addressing several important topics we took in 2020 that enhanced our industry-leading ESG profile. In February, we announced the goal of net 0 carbon and methane emissions by 2050. Over the summer, as the nation began to reexamine important points around race, we built upon our existing legacy of social equity by committing $40 million to social justice and equity causes. In October, we published our latest Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Report, which conforms with the major best-in-class reporting standards, including the Global Reporting Initiative, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and the UN Sustainable Development Goals framework. 
Also in October, we established a new commitment to increase our total workforce diversity by 1% each year. During 2020, we got up to a strong start, with half of our company's new hires being diverse. And in November, we announced our report for the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, or TCFD, making us 1 of only 6 utilities to adopt such support. 
Looking ahead on Slide 40, we have more to do. In January, as I mentioned, we publicly formalized our support for federal methane regulations. During the second quarter of this year, we'll publish an updated climate report that will reflect TCFD recommended methodologies. And throughout 2021, we'll advance our efforts to address Scope 3 emissions, firstly, in our gas distribution businesses, as I previously described. 
These and other ESG-oriented efforts have been recognized by leading third-party assessment services, as shown on Slide 41. By each measure, our performance exceeds the sector average. We've been recognized as part of the leadership band by CDP for our climate and water disclosure; as trendsetters for the third consecutive year by the CPA-Zicklin report on political accountability and transparency; and as part of the Just 100 for the second consecutive year by Just Capital for our actions to promote increased equity. 
I'll conclude the call on Slide 42, which you saw in Tom's remarks as well. We are taking steps today to chart a course that over the next decades will put our company on a remarkable journey to becoming the most sustainable energy company in America. Our future is bright, and we're focused on executing this plan for the benefit of our employees, customers and communities, the environment and our investors. With that, we're ready to take questions."

We're -- as I mentioned earlier, we're only 43 days into a 3-year period that's going to be reviewed, and we don't even file the case for more than 3 years. So not surprisingly, lots of details to come. I do think it's important, though, when we look at developing a long-term growth rate, we look at a variety of planning scenarios. We don't assume a single outcome for the 2024 triennial or any other major planning assumption that far out in our plan. 
I will say 1 theme that is certainly assumed in all of our forecasted outcomes. 2024 are in the other years that Virginia regulation continues to be constructive, just the way it's worked over the years, which has provided our customers with solid reliability rates more than 10% below the national average and a greener and greener generation portfolio. 
And then I think it's also important to remember, as Jim and I talked about earlier, that a portion of our base rates -- that the portion of our earnings that come from base rates in Virginia decline as we go through time, and riders and other mechanisms outside Virginia grow in importance. Our growth between now and the '24 triennial and then after the '24 triennial is driven by rider investments that are outside the '24 triennial or any other triennial proceeding."

And I'm not sure if everyone has the full deck in program but for future references, it's set out on Page 60 in the appendix. But you're right, the total rate base in Virginia has not changed other than through the passage of time and the completion of the year. 
But what we did do is we refined the calculation of the elements of total rate base. We have been showing the schedule since like 2019 when we started this, I guess, our last Investor Day, where we, at that time, the triennial was very far away, we were trying to make it simple. So we lumped some things together. And now we've refined that. And the refinement relates to about $4 billion of rate base that previously, we had categorized as Virginia-based and other, and the $4 billion is really the other. And we've now reallocated that to other categories. 
So what's in the other? Those are contracts where we serve various entities in the state, municipalities, the state of Virginia itself, the federal government, entities like that, where the contracts reflect different economic construct. Some of them are just sort of negotiated. Those are in the other category and our new slide and others track more some of the riders, whether it's a transmission rider or legacy A6 riders. So we've reallocated, to be more precise. Now Virginia-based is not Virginia-based and other. It's just Virginia-based, and it brings down that number to about $9 billion. So I think that's helpful to folks as they do math on to have that more refined division on the various buckets of our total Virginia rate base."

I guess that's a function of the timing of our fourth quarter call and the session. So I'm glad you asked us. We would have been disappointed if we didn't get 1 this year. 
It's been now, I guess, more than 15 years since I worked in the governor's office in Virginia, but there are a few things about the legislative process that I think are probably still true. The first one, the legislature doesn't follow a script that -- you make a mistake or you make predictions with certainty about the outcome of legislation at your peril, and I think that is still true. 
The second is that bill for it to become law have to clear a number of hurdles. It's not just 1 House or the other, it's both Houses and it's committees of both Houses. And an example of that from this year's session would be the 1 bill introduced in the Senate that related to our regulatory model was defeated in committee on a pretty strong bipartisan vote. 
And then the last thing that is still true about the legislature in Virginia is it moves quickly. So I don't think we're going to have to wait a long time. This year, the timing has been a little bit different, as you mentioned. The session went -- it's constitutionally mandated 30 days and then the governor called a special session, but the process is still moving pretty quickly. And so I think those bills that you're referring to will be resolved relatively soon because that's the way the Virginia General Assembly moves. We'll keep an eye on them. But I think it's important to remember that they've got hurdles they would still have to clear before they could become law."

So we have our long-term EPS growth guidance of 6.5%, which is intended to be more precise than our peers as opposed to a 200 basis point range. 
And what we do every year as we go along that 6.5% long-term growth rate, we choose a midpoint for our annual guidance. And around that midpoint, we have a range. And every quarter, we mention that, that range is intended primarily to capture different weather outcomes. Now going back a few years, that range was pretty wide. Within the last 5 years, it was $0.50, then it was $0.45. [indiscernible] $0.30. 
But the primary reason for that range this year included is to incorporate -- to accommodate various weather outcomes. The midpoint of the range is [ 3 85 ]. And we're very confident in making that number. And in continuing our track record of meeting or exceeding on a weather-normal basis, like we talked about for the last 5 years. So there's a range, there's a midpoint. That midpoint, again as I said in my prepared remarks, is consistent with the very narrow range of potential midpoint we guided in July.

But the other is O&M. And let me give some kind of high-level thoughts on that. We talked at our last Investor Day about flat normalized O&M, so normalized is normalizing for new riders that haven't associated acquired O&M or things like pension benefits, which discount rates and the like, make that number go up and down. So we normalize for all that. 
And then we keep it flat. And in 2019, we gave an estimate that by keeping it flat for 3 years across our entire business, we were going to stay versus a 2% escalator like $200-ish million in cumulative basis, and we did. So now it's still flat and we're rolling that out for the full 5-year period. Now we did have some savings that actually went down a little bit in 2019 -- sorry, in 2020 from COVID, not all that's permanent. 
But our effort to keep that flat O&M  inflation or wage increases and things like that, it's not easy. But it's not through big things like some of our peers have talked about step changes in O&M discovered during COVID. We had some COVID savings for sure, but our approach is a little bit different. It's kind of programmatic, is pushing cost savings as part of the system, the culture, so finding ways to use technology and work smarter throughout the business. 
So we have examples of that, that helps us keep that flat O&M. They're tiny in comparison to Dominion: electronic timesheets and electronic signatures. I mean, got along this, they're all tiny. But they add up and that the kind of thing, the small efforts throughout the company, every state, every location that allow us to keep that normalized OEM flat. And the reason we do that is to make room in the customer bill. Yes, it helps out on the customer side and potentially also creates room in that bill for the capital spending that also benefits customers. So that's kind of our other lever we have in managing customer bill is continuing to manage that flat O&M."

That's -- we make those decisions based on the sustainability of those plants going forward or if there's a change in the law or those kinds of things. So I think that's an important thing to keep in mind. 
And then the other is that you are sort of conflating 2 different topics, I think. One is this customer credit reinvestment offset, which is provided for by statute. Those are projects that are either grid transformation projects or renewable projects, where that capital investment can be applied as essentially the customer benefit in an earnings sharing mechanism. When you calculate what the -- when the triennial review is done and there are available earnings, there's an earnings sharing mechanism. And then for the customer portion of that to either be a refund or one of these renewable or grid transformation projects. 
I think what you're thinking of is if there is -- if we retire a plant early, there's a write-down. And then that expense would be treated logically as an expense in the period if there are available earnings. That's the best for customers. It's what long-standing practice has been in Virginia. So 2 sort of slightly different things you're talking about there. Both have some impact on the calculation and the triennial, but we're obviously a long ways away from the second triennial here."

I want to start by outlining Dominion Energy's compelling shareholder return proposition. We expect to grow our earnings per share by 6.5% per year through at least 2025, supported by our updated $32 billion 5",1299,"Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by outlining Dominion Energy's compelling shareholder return proposition. We expect to grow our earnings per share by 6.5% per year through at least 2025, supported by our updated $32 billion 5-year capital growth plan. We offer an attractive dividend yield of approximately 3.5%, reflecting a target payout ratio of 65% and an expected long-term dividend per share growth rate of 6%.
This resulting 10% total shareholder return proposition is combined with an industry-leading ESG profile, characterized by what we believe is the largest, regulated decarbonization investment opportunity in the country. We plan to invest tens of billions of dollars over the next several years to the benefit of the environment, our customers, our communities and our local economies.
Our strategy is anchored on a pure-play, state-regulated utility operating profile that centers around 5 premier states, as shown on Slide 5. I'll share the philosophy with a common sense approach to energy policy and regulation puts a priority on safety, reliability, affordability, and increasingly, sustainability. These states also strive to create environments that promote sensible economic growth, which, like the rising tide, lifts all boats.
For instance, 3 of these state jurisdictions rank consistently in the top 4 best states for business as determined by independent analysis carried out by CNBC and by Forbes. Our state-regulated utility model offers investors increased predictability and is enhanced by our concentration in these fast-growing, constructive and business-friendly states.
Turning to Slide 6. Dominion is a purpose-driven company and has adopted a comprehensive stakeholder approach. We are driven by the belief that the world's best companies consider the interest, not just of investors, but also employees, customers and communities and the well-being of the environment. Our actions are grounded in adherence to our 5 core values, and we embrace transparency and stakeholder engagement as hallmarks of responsible corporate citizenship. 
The well-being of our over 17,000 employees is critical to our long-term success, and there is no measure more important to our company than the safety performance of our employees. 2020 represented, by a wide margin, the safest year of operations in the history of our company, as depicted on Slide 7. This result did not happen overnight. As you can see, it takes years of dedicated effort to drive sustainable improvement. I congratulate my colleagues on this significant achievement.
Turning now to our customers and communities. We believe that it is not enough that we provide energy safely. We must also provide energy that is affordable. We are pleased the residential rates at our 2 electric utilities compare favorably to state, national, and, where applicable, RGGI state averages. Looking forward, we expect our customers to be very competitive, even as we invest heavily to transform our system's carbon footprint. Bob will address this more comprehensively in his remarks.
With regard to our community initiatives during 2020, which are described on Slide 8. First, the impact of COVID-19 on our customers during 2020 was obviously significant, which is why we voluntarily took immediate action at the onset of the pandemic to suspend service disconnections. In doing this, we avoided what otherwise would have been disconnection of over 255,000 customer accounts. We also developed extended and flexible payment plans, resulting in over 330,000 enrollments. And we contributed $18 million toward direct energy assistance for our most vulnerable customers.
In Virginia, we supported special session legislation, which gave customers a fresh start by forgiving over $125 million of customer arrears. We also agreed to a pause in our South Carolina rate case proceeding, ensuring that the results of that case will not impact customers until late this year.
Second, we've built on our long-standing legacy of supporting social equity by committing $25 million to 11 historically Black colleges and universities, funding an additional $10 million for scholarships for underrepresented minority groups and creating a $5 million social justice fund that supports community efforts to address the impacts of racism. This is in addition to the diversity and inclusion initiatives within our company that Bob will address. 
As you can tell, we are extremely proud of these accomplishments, and I thank all of my Dominion Energy colleagues who contributed to these successes in what was obviously an extraordinarily challenging year. 
Turning now to Slide 9. We have rolled forward our 5-year capital growth plan to capture the years 2021 through 2025. This has resulted in a $10 billion or 43% increase to the plan we shared with you in the spring of 2019 as adjusted for the Gas Transmission & Storage sale. We now project $32 billion of growth capital investment on behalf of our customers, over 80% of which reduces or enables emissions reductions. We plan to invest $17 billion in zero-carbon generation and energy storage, including regulated offshore wind, solar and nuclear relicensing. Another $6 billion in electric grid enhancements, such as electric transmission and grid modernization, which will enable our system to be more resilient to cyber and climate threats and more responsive to increasing intermittent generation. And we plan to invest $3 billion on the modernization of our LDC networks, as well as on renewable natural gas development, thereby increasing safety and reliability while driving emissions down. Jim and Bob will provide more color on these industry-leading investment programs in a moment.
As meaningful as these near-term plans are, consider, on Slide 10, how they compare to the long-term scope and duration of our overall decarbonization opportunity. Our initiatives extend well beyond our 5-year plan. We have identified over $70 billion of green investment opportunity between 2020 and 2035, nearly all of which will qualify for regulated cost of service recovery. This is, as far as we can tell, the largest, regulated decarbonization investment opportunity in the industry. 
And the accelerating electrification of the transportation sector promises to drive growing demand for utility-scale, zero and low-carbon generation for many years to come. The company's long-term transformation has multiple beneficiaries: our customers, who want more sustainable energy; our local communities, which benefit from the economic growth and tax revenue to the company's investments; our employees, who develop the best practices of the transition to a low-carbon future; and the environment via the emissions reductions we illustrate on Slide 11. 
Through 2019, inclusive of asset divestitures, we have successfully reduced our enterprise-wide, CO2-equivalent emissions by around 55%. This is great progress but we have more to do. By 2035, we expect to improve that reduction to between 70% and 80% versus baseline on our way to net 0 by 2050. As shown on the right side of the slide, by 2035, we expect that approximately 95% of our company-owned generation will be either 0 or low emitting, a remarkable transformation from our 2005 dispatch mix.
Before turning it over to Jim, I will summarize the actions and events of 2020 that have positioned Dominion to thrive for years to come. We took care of one another. And in so doing, we achieved an all-time safety record. We took quick action to work with our customers to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We announced our ambition to be net 0 by 2050. The Virginia Clean Economy Act was adopted by the general assembly, which puts the state on a cutting-edge path to decarbonization and positions the state as a hub for the global green economy transition.
We advanced our strategic positioning by selling our Gas Transmission & Storage assets to focus on our premier, state-regulated utility operations. We simultaneously initiated best-in-class earnings and dividend growth rates. We reported our 20th consecutive quarter of weather-normal results that met or exceeded the midpoint of our quarterly guidance, and we transitioned both our CEO and lead director roles. 
With that, I will turn it over to Jim."

Our fourth quarter 2020 operating earnings, as shown on Slide 14, were $0.81 per share, which included a $0.01 hurt from worse-than-normal weather in our utility service territories. Both actual and weather-normalized results were above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance range. Full year 2020 operating earnings per share were $3.54, above the midpoint of our guidance range and included a $0.09 hurt from weather. Weather-normalized results of $3.63 were at the top of our annual guidance range.
Note that our fourth quarter and 2020 GAAP and operating earnings, together with comparative periods, are adjusted to account for discontinued operations, including those associated with the sale of assets to Berkshire Hathaway Energy. And then a summary of such adjustments between operating and reported results is, as usual, included in Schedule 2 of our earnings release kit.
As shown on Slide 15, this represents our 20th consecutive quarter, so 5 years now, of delivering weather-normal results that meet or exceed the midpoint of our quarterly guidance range. We've highlighted here the July 5 Gas Transmission & Storage sale announcement on the chart as this was obviously -- obviously has had an impact on our original annual guidance, which is, of course, set prior to that transaction. But regardless, we believe the historic consistency across our quarterly results is worth highlighting, and it's a track record we are absolutely focused on extending.
Turning now to Slide -- to guidance on Slide 16. As usual, we are providing a range for the year, which is designed primarily to account for variations from normal weather. We are initiating 2021 operating EPS guidance of $3.70 to $4 per share. The midpoint of this range is in line with the indicative guidance midpoint range we provided in July. Measured midpoint to midpoint, we expect approximately 10% growth in 2021, also consistent with our July guidance. Looking longer term, we expect operating EPS to grow off the 2021 base at around 6.5% per year through 2025. Finally, we expect first quarter 2021 operating earnings per share to be between $1 and $1.15.
Turning to Slide 17. We expect our 2021 full year dividend to be $2.52, reflecting our target payout ratio of approximately 65%. We're also extending the long-range dividend per share growth rate of 6% off that '21 base through 2025.
Slide 18 provides a breakdown of the 5-year growth CapEx roll-forward which Tom introduced. For more details on this, I would point to the very comprehensive appendix materials. We've really put some effort into providing all the more granular detail which we expect will be useful for understanding and modeling each part of this growth profile. 
But just a few items I'll highlight here. We are forecasting a total 5-year rate base CAGR of around 9%, broken out here by segment and by major driver. I would note that nearly 3/4 of this planned growth CapEx is eligible for rider recovery. That nomenclature varies, but capital invested under riders, rate adjustment clauses or trackers, as they're called in various jurisdictions, allows for more timely recovery of prudently incurred investments and costs. They're filed and trued up at least annually in single-issue proceedings, so outside of the more time-consuming and less frequent general base rate proceedings.
In some of our jurisdictions, including Virginia, rider recovery mechanisms utilize a forward-looking or projected test period and/or allows for a construction work in progress, all of which minimizes traditional regulatory lag that, in other cases, can prevent utilities from earning at their authorized return levels. Rider-eligible CapEx programs varies a little by state, but prominent examples for us include offshore wind, solar, energy storage, nuclear relicensing, electric transmission, strategic undergrounding, grid transformation, rural broadband and gas distribution, infrastructure, integrity and modernization spending. 
On that theme, and turning to Slide 19, we illustrate how base investments and rider investments are expected to trend at Dominion Energy Virginia through the 5-year plan. You'll note that the Virginia base investment balance is growing at about 6% annually driven primarily by new customer connections and maintenance spending. By contrast, the rider investment balance in Virginia, which comprises half of DEV's investment base today, is expected to grow at nearly 20% annually on average. 
Since the Virginia rider investment programs are reviewed and trued up annually, they are not included in the triennial review process, the first of which, of course, will commence next month. Based on these growth trends, the base investment balance as a percentage of total DEV declines from 37% to 27% by 2025. It also shrinks dramatically as a percentage of overall Dominion Energy.
On Slide 20, we refresh our outlook for sources and uses of cash. So on average, between '21 and '23, we expect to generate annual operating cash flow of around $6.6 billion, return about -- around $2.4 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividend and invest nearly $8 billion a year on growth and maintenance CapEx on behalf of our customers. Our financing plan assumes we issue around $400 million of equity annually through our existing DRIP and ATM programs with the residual financing needs satisfied by net fixed income issuance.
Again, and as shown on Slide 21, these are multiyear averages. To be clear, in 2021, we don't expect any issuance under our ATM program. This equity guidance is consistent with our prior guidance for the '21 through '24 period. We view this level of steady equity issuance under existing programs as prudent, EPS-accretive, and in the context of our very sizable growth capital spending program, appropriate to keep our consolidated credit metrics within the guidelines for a strong credit ratings category. 
To that point, as shown on Slide 22, our consolidated credit metrics have continued their steady improvement as has our pension plan's funded status. We're all very proud of these results. We continue to target high BBB range credit ratings for our parent company and single A range ratings for our regulated operating companies.
Before I summarize my remarks, let me spend just a minute on O&M. As demonstrated by our 2020 results, we're focusing on driving O&M through improved processes, innovative use of technology and other best practice cost initiatives to keep normalized O&M flat through the forecast period. This reflects the successful continuation of our flat normalized O&M efforts we discussed in more detail at our last Investor Day.
So with that, I'll summarize. We reported fourth quarter and full year 2020 operating EPS, which were above the midpoint of our guidance, extending our track record to 5 years of meeting or exceeding the quarterly midpoint on a weather-normal basis. We initiated 2021 full year operating EPS guidance that represents a 10% annual increase midpoint to midpoint. We affirmed 6.5% operating EPS growth from '21 through '25. We introduced a $32 billion 5-year growth CapEx plan that drives an approximately 9% rate base growth. We expect highly disproportionate rider investment spending across our segment, and our balance sheet and credit profile remain in very good health. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Bob."
267105,700658153,2208967,"Dominion Energy, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2021",2021-02-12,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 25, which provides an overview of the Virginia Clean Economy Act. The law mandates a renewable energy portfolio standard that, over the next 25 years, moves towards a zero-carbon future. In orde",3025,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 25, which provides an overview of the Virginia Clean Economy Act. The law mandates a renewable energy portfolio standard that, over the next 25 years, moves towards a zero-carbon future. In order to achieve the RPS milestones, the law calls on the state's utilities to add significant amounts of wind and solar power generation as well as battery storage, ramps up energy efficiency and demand side management programs, requires the use of Virginia-based renewable energy credits, mandates that Virginia join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and requires the retirement of substantial coal-fired generation by 2025 and all fossil-fired units by 2046, subject to reliability and energy security considerations.
The largest single investment project come out of the passage of the VCEA is Dominion Energy's initial 2.6-gigawatt offshore wind deployment, as described on Slide 26. I'm not going to go through every line item on this slide but will highlight the following: first, the project, which is the largest of its kind in North America, is very much on track. This project will provide a boost to Virginia's growing green economy by creating hundreds of jobs, hundreds of millions of dollars of economic output and millions of dollars of tax revenue for the state and localities. It will also propel Virginia closer to achieving its goal to become a major hub for the burgeoning offshore wind value chain up and down the country's East Coast. Second, as was contemplated in the VCEA, we intend this investment to be 100% regulated and eligible for rider recovery. Finally, the VCEA provides very specific requirements on the presumption of prudency for investment in the project, as shown here, which we are confident that we will meet. 
On Slide 27, we list the major project milestones. In December of last year, we submitted our construction and operations plan to BOEM. We're encouraged by the incremental funding appropriated to BOEM late last year with a specific direction to augment the agency's resources to process offshore wind permits as well as BOEM's recent recommencement of processing the Vineyard Wind application. As you likely know by now, we are the only owner in the United States to have completed an offshore wind BOEM permitting process successfully. Our 12-megawatt test project, which recently entered service, completed the BOEM permitting process in 2019, and we're applying lessons learned during that process to our present application.
The other item I'll highlight is on the left-hand side of this slide. The lease is positioned in shallow water, outside of major maritime shipping lanes, away from any other offshore wind leaseholds and not in a region that supports a significant commercial fishing industry. We expect to receive final permits in mid-2023 and complete project construction around the end of 2026.
The VCEA calls for another 2.6 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2036. While our near-term focus is on successfully executing on our initial deployment, we look forward to finding ways to support the state's additional offshore wind capacity goals. The VCEA provides that the cost of any offshore wind project will be borne by our customers only in proportion to our ownership of the project.
While offshore wind may be our largest single renewable energy project, the aggregate capacity of solar generation called for by the VCEA is over 3x larger. In accordance with the law, 65% of the target amount is to be utility-owned. This is not new ground for us or for the commission. To date, we've made 4 cost-of-service rider recovery filings for solar projects in Virginia. Three, representing around 400 megawatts have been approved, and the most recent filing is pending approval. We expect to make additional filings annually as we work toward the over 10 gigawatts of regulated solar capacity called for by the law.
Current solar technology requires around 10 acres for every megawatt of installed capacity. Rough math suggests, therefore, that the utility-owned target of around 10,000 megawatts will require around 100,000 acres of land. We've been hard at work to secure enough land to support our long-range goal. And I'm pleased to report that in less than a year, we've put 63,000 acres under option. 
Turning to Slide 29. What started with an 8-megawatt facility in Georgia in 2013 has today become a portfolio of over 2.2 gigawatts, representing over $5 billion of investment. Our early focus was on the development of long-term contracted projects, mostly outside of Virginia, that allowed us to develop the expertise and competency to undertake the substantial regulated solar build-out in Virginia that I just described. Going forward, you can see that our emphasis shifts, and a very significant majority of our solar capacity investment will take place under regulated cost-of-service recovery mechanisms in Virginia.
Growth in long-term contracted solar is limited and driven by large customer requests for bilateral, 100% renewable power supply. As increasing intermittent generation sources proliferate in our system, energy storage will be critical to maintaining reliable service. We observed, with keen interest, the recent example of the negative consequences that occur for customers when rapid changes in intermittent generation are not accommodated with sufficient storage and/or quick-start gas-fired generation. Hence, the VCEA prudently calls for the development of nearly 3 gigawatts of energy storage by 2036, 65% of which is to be utility-owned and rider-eligible. 
Admittedly, we're starting small when it comes to developing technologies in this area, 16 megawatts of pilot projects across 3 different sites and 3 different use case scenarios, as shown on the right side of Slide 30. But starting small has its advantages as we saw in both our offshore wind and solar development strategies. We're rapidly developing expertise that will ensure we're providing the maximum value to customers as we fulfill the targets of the VCEA.
In our estimation, the success of greenhouse gas emission reduction targets requires the ongoing viability of existing nuclear facilities. That's why we filed for 20-year license extensions for our 4 Virginia-regulated units. Today, these facilities account for 30% of Virginia's total electric output and around 90% of Virginia's zero-carbon electricity. Based on PJM's carbon intensity rate, the ongoing operation of these plants will effectively avoid CO2 emissions of 16 million tons per year. 
Key milestones for the relicensing process are shown on Slide 31. We expect to submit for rider cost recovery approval in the second half of this year. Our near-term focus is on the Virginia unit. But under the appropriate circumstances, life extensions over the long term at our other 3 units may be advisable. Successful nuclear life extension is a win for customers and the environment. 
The transition to a clean energy future means reduced reliance on coal-fired generation. As Tom showed, in 2005, more than half our company's power production was from coal-fired generation. By 2035, we project that to be closer to 5%, perhaps lower, if the South Carolina Commission prefers an accelerated decarbonization plan as part of our IRP refiling. 
From an investment-based perspective, which is a rough approximation of earnings contribution, you can see, on Slide 32, the diminished role coal-fired generation plays in our financial performance driven by facility retirements and non-coal investment. We're mindful that this shift has the potential to be disruptive to employees and communities and are being purposeful in our efforts to ameliorate any such negative consequences. You'll also note that zero-carbon generation grows significantly such that, by 2025, over 60% of our investment base will consist of electric wires and zero-carbon generation. 
Turning to Slide 33. Let me address customer rates with a focus on Virginia. First, between 2008 and 2020, our typical residential customer rate increased, on average, by less than 1% per year, which is much lower than average annual inflation over that period of closer to 2%. Second, based on EIA data, our typical customer rate is 13% lower than the national average and 36% lower than other states that, like Virginia, have joined RGGI. And third, going forward, we see typical residential rates increasing by a compound annual growth rate of around 2.9% through 2030, which is a comprehensive estimate and includes, among other factors, the impact of the decarbonization investment programs we've discussed today. If we move the starting point back to 2008, that rate of increase falls to 2.1%, which is lower than projected inflation for 2021. It's incumbent upon us to deliver energy that is safe, reliable, increasingly sustainable and affordable. 
Now on Slide 34, let me address the upcoming triennial review proceeding. Note, we've developed detailed slides in the appendix that we believe will be helpful to you on this topic. First, the triennial review process will commence next month and conclude late this year. Second, this triennial review will cover 4 years of performance from 2017 through 2020 and compares our earned return to our allowed return of 9.9%, inclusive of a 70 basis point power. Third, and as Jim pointed out, the review applies only to the Virginia-based portion of our rate base. Rider investments are outside the scope of the proceeding. And finally, to the extent the commission concludes that available revenues, inclusive of adjustments for impairments, weather and other factors, are greater than customer credit reinvestments, it may order a refund as well as a forward-looking revenue reduction of up to $50 million. 
So let me point out just 2 factors that we know will be part of the first review process. First, we've invested nearly $300 million in the on-time and on-budget completion of the 12-megawatt offshore wind test project. We've indicated we will not seek a revenue increase from customers associated with this project. Rather, we will apply that investment, as needed, as a customer credit reinvestment offset. Second, we've provided over $125 million of arrears relief in Virginia to assist customers, many of whom have faced financial hardship as a result of COVID. 
Naturally, we're focused on the triennial review filing next month, but we also get questions from time to time regarding the second triennial review, which is expected to conclude in almost 4 years.
A few observations there, which are shown on Slide 35. First, we're in the very early days, 43 days, I think, of that review period. So obviously, we have quite a ways to go before being in a position to file the precise regulatory inputs for that proceeding. What we do know, however, is that the structure of the review will be similar to T1. This includes the ability, for instance, to use customer credit reinvestment offsets, which allow us to invest in projects for the benefit of customers. 
Second, as Jim described well, the robust growth of our asset base at DEV is concentrated around rider-recoverable investments that are outside the scope of triennial available earnings reviews. Combined with growth at our other state-regulated operating segments, the proportion of the company's earnings and cash flows, which are subject to triennial earnings tests, will naturally diminish over the forecast and beyond.
Third, the very nature of our business as a state-regulated utility company is working with regulators to deliver beneficial outcomes for both customers and investors. It's something we've been doing for many years. We expect to continue to apply the experience we've gained to upcoming rate proceedings of all varieties, including the triennial reviews. We firmly believe that there are a number of paths that converge on a single objective: serving customers, employees, communities, the environment and investors. 
On top of that, we're incredibly excited about what Dominion Energy is planning to accomplish well beyond the next 2 triennial reviews. Specifically, over the next 15 years, the investment of upwards of $70 billion of green capital, nearly all of which will grow earnings under regulated rider mechanisms and significantly reduce emissions while maintaining competitive customer rates. We don't believe any other company in the United States offers the duration, visibility and scope of regulated decarbonization growth that Dominion Energy now offers. 
Shifting gears a little on Slide 36, we summarize the status of the pending South Carolina general rate case proceeding, which is presently in a 6-month pause which we supported. As part of the pause, the commission ordered the parties to report, on a monthly basis, on their progress toward reaching a settlement. We can't report to you this morning on the status of current negotiations, obviously, but we look forward to continuing to engage with parties to the case in hopes of finding a suitable resolution to bring before the commission for approval.
In the meantime, our commitment to customers is unwavering. Over the last approximately 15 years, we've reduced average annual customer outage minutes or SAIDI by 40%. Investments made in prior periods, including the years covered by our recent rate case filing, are critical to system reliability and the continuation of this trend to the benefit of our customers. We're committed to meeting 100% of our merger commitments, establishing trust with our customers and communities and working toward an increasingly sustainable future for South Carolinians.
In that regard, let me provide an update on our integrated resource plan. Briefly, the commission asked us to refile the plan and consider, among other changes, accelerated renewable energy deployment and increased sensitivities to potential carbon pricing. In the table on the right-hand side, you can see how one of the cases we filed with our original IRP, called Plan 8, is indicative of the potential for accelerated decarbonization at only slightly higher customer cost as compared to the prior base plan. Plan 8 would retire 1,300 megawatts of coal-fired generation in 2028 and add 300 megawatts of storage and 700 megawatts of new solar, which would result in a nearly 60% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030 and only cost approximately 3% more than the base plan. We look forward to engaging with all stakeholders on this planning process.
On Slide 38, we provide key elements of our gas distribution segment growth and sustainability strategy. Our utilities operate in some of the fastest-growing areas of the country with annual customer growth rates approaching 3% in 2 of our 3 largest markets. These customers simply prefer natural gas service for cooking, heating and other residential, commercial and industrial applications.
We're also fortunate to operate in jurisdictions where regulation prioritizes safety and reliability. Decoupling mechanisms promote the implementation of increased efficiency measures, which help to reduce customer bills. And infrastructure modernization and integrity trackers allow us to make critical investments and upgrades that both reduce emissions and raise the bar on safe and reliable service.
When it comes to natural gas distribution, location matters. We know that for natural gas to be relevant in the future, we must continue to focus on increasing the sustainability of our service. We've adopted an ambitious Scope 1 emission targets, but that isn't enough. We're now looking at Scope 3 emissions in cutting-edge ways. We formalized our support for federal methane regulation, and we're working towards procurement practices that encourage enhanced disclosures by upstream counterparties on their emissions and methane-reduction programs. 
Further, we're considering a preference for suppliers and shippers who adopt a net zero commitment. For downstream emissions, we plan to increase our annual spend on energy efficiency by 45% over the next 5 years and provide our customers with access to a carbon calculator and carbon offsets. We're also developing plans which will require collaboration with policymakers and regulators to increase access to RNG for our customers, and ultimately, to initiate mandatory RNG blend levels that would act to offset our customers' carbon footprint. 
And finally, we're pursuing innovative hydrogen use cases, which we discuss in more detail in the appendix. This includes our participation as a founding member of the Low-Carbon Resources Initiative that just surpassed $100 million of funding from over 30 industry members. 
I'll conclude my remarks by addressing several important topics we took in 2020 that enhanced our industry-leading ESG profile. In February, we announced the goal of net zero-carbon and methane emissions by 2050. Over the summer, as the nation began to reexamine important points around race, we built upon our existing legacy of social equity by committing $40 million to social justice and equity causes. In October, we published our latest Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Report, which conforms with the major best-in-class reporting standards, including the Global Reporting Initiative, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and the UN Sustainable Development Goals framework. 
Also in October, we established a new commitment to increase our total workforce diversity by 1% each year. During 2020, we got up to a strong start with half of our company's new hires being diverse. And in November, we announced our formal support for the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, or TCFD, making us 1 of only 6 utilities to adopt such support. 
Looking ahead on Slide 40, we have more to do. In January, as I mentioned, we publicly formalized our support for federal methane regulations. During the second quarter of this year, we'll publish an updated climate report that will reflect TCFD-recommended methodologies. And throughout 2021, we'll advance our efforts to address Scope 3 emissions, firstly, in our gas distribution businesses, as I previously described.
These and other ESG-oriented efforts have been recognized by leading third-party assessment services, as shown on Slide 41. By each measure, our performance exceeds the sector average. We've been recognized as part of the leadership band by CDP for our climate and water disclosure, as trendsetters for the third consecutive year by the CPA-Zicklin report on political accountability and transparency and as part of the Just 100 for the second consecutive year by JUST Capital for our actions to promote increased equity.
I'll conclude the call on Slide 42, which you saw in Tom's remarks as well. We are taking steps today to chart a course that over the next decades will put our company on a remarkable journey to becoming the most sustainable energy company in America. Our future is bright, and we're focused on executing this plan for the benefit of our employees, customers and communities, the environment and our investors. 
With that, we're ready to take questions."

We're -- as I mentioned earlier, we're only 43 days into a 3-year period that's going to be reviewed, and we don't even file the case for more than 3 years. So not surprisingly, lots of details to come. 
I do think it's important, though, when we look at developing a long-term growth rate, we look at a variety of planning scenarios. We don't assume a single outcome for the 2024 triennial or any other major planning assumption that far out in our plan. 
I will say one theme that is certainly assumed in all of our forecasted outcomes. 2024 or any other years that Virginia regulation continues to be constructive, just the way it's worked over the years, which has provided our customers with solid reliability rates more than 10% below the national average and a greener and greener generation portfolio. 
And then I think it's also important to remember, as Jim and I talked about earlier, that a portion of our base rates that -- the portion of our earnings that come from base rates in Virginia decline as we go through time, and riders and other mechanisms outside Virginia grow in importance. Our growth between now and the '24 triennial and then after the '24 triennial is driven by rider investments that are outside the '24 triennial or any other triennial proceeding."

But for future references, it's set out on Page 60 in the appendix. 
But you're right. The total rate base in Virginia has not changed, other than the passage of time and the completion of the year. But what we did do is we refined the calculation of the elements of total rate base. We have been showing the schedule since like 2019 when we started this, I guess, our last Investor Day, where we, at that time, the triennial was very far away. We were trying to make it simple, so we lumped some things together. And now we've refined that. And the refinement relates to about $4 billion of rate base that, previously, we had categorized as Virginia-based and other. And the $4 billion is really the other. And we've now reallocated that to other categories.
So what's in the other? Those are contracts where we serve various entities in the state, municipalities, the state of Virginia itself, the federal government, entities like that, where the contracts reflect different economic construct. Some of them are just sort of negotiated. Those are in the other category in our new -- I don't know, new slide. And others track more some of the riders, whether it's a transmission rider or legacy A6 riders. So we've reallocated, to be more precise. Now Virginia-based is not Virginia-based and other. It's just Virginia-based, and it brings down that number to about $9 billion. 
So I think that's helpful to folks as they do math and sensitivities to have that more refined division on the various buckets of our total Virginia rate base."

I guess that's a function of the timing of our fourth quarter call and the session, so I'm glad you asked us. We would have been disappointed if we didn't get one this year. 
It's been now, I guess, more than 15 years since I worked in the governor's office in Virginia, but there are a few things about the legislative process that I think are probably still true. The first one, the legislature doesn't follow a script. You make a mistake or you make predictions with certainty about the outcome of legislation at your peril, and I think that is still true. 
The second is that bill for it to become law have to clear a number of hurdles. It's not just one House or the other. It's both Houses, and it's committees of both Houses. And an example of that from this year's session would be the one bill introduced in the Senate that related to our regulatory model was defeated in committee on a pretty strong bipartisan vote.
And then the last thing that is still true about the legislature in Virginia is it moves quickly, so I don't think we're going to have to wait a long time. This year, the timing has been a little bit different, as you mentioned. The session went -- it's constitutionally mandated 30 days, and then the governor called a special session, but the process is still moving pretty quickly. And so I think those bills that you're referring to will be resolved relatively soon because that's the way the Virginia General Assembly moves. We'll keep an eye on them, but I think it's important to remember that they've got hurdles they would still have to clear before they could become law."

Well, let me walk through the elements of our guidance. So we have our long-term EPS growth guidance of 6.5%, which is intended to be more precise than our peers as opposed to a 200 basis point range. 
And what we do every year, as we go along that 6.5% long-term target rate, we choose a midpoint for our annual guidance. And around that midpoint, we have a range. And every quarter, we mention that, that range is intended primarily to capture different weather outcomes.
Now going back a few years, that range was pretty wide. Within the last 5 years, it's $0.50, then it was $0.45, $0.30. 
But the primary reason for that range, this year included, is to incorporate -- to accommodate various weather outcomes. The midpoint of the range is [ 3.85 ], and we're very confident in making that number and continuing our track record of meeting or exceeding on a weather-normal basis, like we talked about for the last 5 years. 
So there's a range. There's a midpoint. That midpoint, again, as I said in my prepared remarks, is consistent with the very narrow range of potential midpoint that we guided in July, not related to the South Carolina process."

That's a great question, Michael. And you're right. For us, in the regulated environment that we're talking about, the extension of the ITCs and various tax credits is customer-rate beneficial and doesn't change the investment return but definitely reduces the rate that customers pay. So we'll look at whether there are opportunities. 
We have a pretty aggressive plan, as you've seen. And the Virginia Clean Economy Act last year passed an aggressive plan. So we're moving very quickly. If there are opportunities to advance, we'll take them. But the main effect of ITC extension is going to be benefit to customers on rate."

Most of what we do that relates to ITC is in a regulated format, where it benefits our customers, as Bob said. 
But 2 years ago at Investor Day, we gave some guidance that, that ITC recognition and earnings would be somewhere in the up to $0.15 per year range. And where we've been is really below that. In '18, we're at $0.09. In '19, we're $0.11. In '20, we were at $0.16. But we still plan to trend within that run rate up to 15% -- $0.15 per year guidance, so not a big impact in that area.

ITC is one element which will benefit customers, for sure, but the other is O&M. And let me give some kind of high-level thoughts on that. We talked at our last Investor Day about flat normalized O&M. So normalized is normalizing for new riders that haven't associated acquired O&M or things like pension benefits, which discount rates and the like, make that number go up and down. So we normalize for all that, and then we keep it flat. 
And in 2019, we gave an estimate that by keeping it flat for 3 years across our entire business, we were going to stay versus a 2% escalator like $200-ish million in cumulative basis, and we did. So now it's still flat, and we're rolling that out for the full 5-year period. 
Now we did have some savings that actually went down a little bit in 2019 -- sorry, in 2020 from COVID, not all that's permanent. But our effort to keep that flat O&M, so negating inflation or wage increases and things like that, it's not easy. But it's not through big things, like some of our peers have talked about, step changes in O&M discovered during COVID. We had some COVID savings, for sure, but our approach is a little bit different. It's kind of programmatic. It's pushing cost savings as part of the system, the culture, so finding ways to use technology and work smarter throughout the business. 
So we have examples of that, that helps us keep that flat O&M. They're tiny in comparison to Dominion: electronic timesheets and electronic signatures, and they've gone along this, they're all tiny, but they add up. And that the kind of thing, the small efforts throughout the company, every state, every location that allow us to keep that normalized OEM flat. And the reason we do that is to make room in the customer bill. Yes. It helps out on the customer side and potentially also creates room in that bill for the capital spending that also benefits customers. So that's kind of our other lever we have in managing customer bill is continuing to manage that flat O&M."

One is, obviously, we don't make decisions on fossil retirements based on the timing related to a regulatory proceeding. That's -- we make those decisions based on the sustainability of those plants going forward or if there's a change in the law or those kinds of things. So I think that's an important thing to keep in mind. 
And then the other is that you are sort of conflating 2 different topics, I think. One is this customer credit reinvestment offset, which is provided for by statute. Those are projects that are either grid transformation projects or renewable projects, where that capital investment can be applied as essentially the customer benefit in an earnings sharing mechanism. 
When you calculate what the -- when the triennial review is done and there are available earnings, there's an earnings sharing mechanism and then for the customer portion of that to either be a refund or one of these renewable or grid transformation projects. 
I think what you're thinking of is if there is -- if we retire a plant early, there's a write-down. And then that expense would be treated logically as an expense in the period if there are available earnings. That's for customers. It's what long-standing practice has been in Virginia. 
So 2 sort of slightly different things you're talking about there. Both have some impact on the calculation and the triennial, but we're obviously a long ways away from the second triennial here."

I'd also like to express my thanks for the messages of condolence that we've received from across the country and from around the world. Thank you all. As Bob said, we will very much miss Tom. 
Let me now turn to our business update. Following the in-depth review and roll forward of our capital spending outlook we provided last quarter, our prepared remarks today will be relatively brief. We are very focused on overall execution, including extending our track record of meeting or exceeding our quarterly guidance midpoints as we did again this quarter. 
I'll start my review on Slide 4, with a reminder of Dominion Energy's compelling total shareholder return proposition. We expect to grow our earnings per share by 6.5% per year through at least 2025, supported by our updated $32 billion 5-year growth capital plan. Keep in mind that over 80% of that capital investment is emissions reduction enabling and that over 70% is rider eligible. We offer an attractive dividend yield of approximately 3.2%, reflecting a target payout ratio of 65% and an expected long-term dividend per share growth rate of 6%. This resulting approximately 10% total shareholder return proposition is combined with an attractive pure-play, state-regulated utility profile characterized by industry-leading ESG credentials and the largest regulated decarbonization investment opportunity in the country, as shown on the next slide. Our 15-year opportunity is estimated to be over $70 billion, with multiple programs that extend well beyond our 5-year plan and skew meaningfully towards rider style regulated cost of service recovery. We believe we offer the largest the broadest in scope, the longest in duration and the most visible regulated decarbonization opportunity among U.S. utilities. The successful execution of this plan will benefit our customers, communities, employees and the environment. 
Turning now to earnings. Our first quarter 2021 operating earnings as shown on Slide 6, were $1.09 per share, which included a $0.01 hurt from worse than normal weather in our utility service territories. This represents our 21st consecutive quarter, so over 5 years now, of delivering weather-normal quarterly results that meet or exceed the midpoint of our quarterly guidance range. GAAP earnings for the quarter were $1.23 per share. The difference between GAAP and operating earnings for the 3 months ended March 31 was primarily attributable to a net benefit associated with nuclear decommissioning trusts and economic hedging activities partially offset by other charges. A summary of such adjustments between operating and reported results as usual, included in Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit. 
Turning on to guidance on Slide 7. As usual, we're providing a quarterly guidance range, which is designed primarily to account for variations from normal weather. For the second quarter of 2021, we expect operating earnings to be between $0.70 and $0.80 per share. We are affirming our existing full year and long-term operating earnings and dividend guidance as well. No changes here from prior guidance. 
Turning to Slide 8 and briefly on financing. Since January, we've issued $1.3 billion of long-term debt, consistent with our 2021 financing plan guidance at a weighted average cost of 2.4%. Thanks to all who participated in these important offerings and as a reminder, we'll have additional fixed income issuance at Dominion Energy Virginia, at gas distribution at Dominion Energy South Carolina and at our parent company during the remainder of the year. For avoiding some doubt, there's no change to our prior common equity issuance guidance. 
Wrapping up my remarks, let me touch briefly on potential changes to the Federal Tax Code. Obviously, it's still early days with a lot of unknowns. But at a high level, we see an increase in the corporate tax rate as being close to neutral on operating earnings based on, as is the case for all regulated entities, the assumed pass-through for cost of service operations, an increase in parent level interest tax shield and the extension and expansion of clean or green tax credits, all of which will be offset by higher taxes on our contracted assets segment earnings. We also expect modest improvement in credit metrics. We're monitoring the contemplated minimum tax rules closely and would note the administration's support for renewable development suggests the ability to use renewable credits to offset any such minimum tax rule. More to come over time on that front. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob."

As shown on Slide 9, through the first 3 months of 2021, we're tracking closely to the record-setting OSHA rate that we achieved in 2020. In addition, we're seeing record low levels of lost time and restricted duty cases, which measure more severe incidents. Of course, the only acceptable number of safety incidents is 0, and we will continue to work toward that critical goal. 
Let me provide a few updates around our execution across the strategy. We're pleased that the 2.6-gigawatt Coastal Virginia offshore wind project has been declared a covered project under Title 41 of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act program, also known as FAST 41. The federal permitting targets now published under that program are consistent with the project schedule that we shared on the fourth quarter call in February. Key schedule milestones are shown side by side on Slide 10. We continue to be encouraged by the current administration's efforts to provide a pathway to timely processing of offshore wind projects. 
In the meantime, we're advancing the project as follows: we're processing competitive solicitations for equipment and services to achieve the best possible value for customers and in accordance with the prudency requirements of the VCEA. Interest in those RFPs has been robust. We're analyzing performance data from our test turbines, which have been operational for several months now and are to date, generating at capacity factors that are higher than our initial expectations. Recall, we had assumed a lifetime capacity factor of around 41% for the full-scale deployment. Further evaluation of turbine design and wind resource in addition to the data we're gathering in real time, suggest that our original assumption is too low. Higher generation would result in lower energy costs for customers. We're monitoring raw material costs, and it seems to be the case across a number of industries right now, we're observing higher prices. In the case of steel, for example, the return of pandemic-idled steelmaking capacity hasn't yet caught up to global demand. We'll continue to monitor raw material cost trends as we move towards procurement later in the project time line. 
We're moving into the detailed design phase for onshore transmission. As we observed within the industry recently, utility systems are only as good as they are resilient, which is one of the reasons that we made the decision in 2019 to go the extra distance to connect to our 500 kV transmission system. to ensure that the project's power will be available when our customers need it most. We believe that decisions we're making around onshore engineering configurations will ultimately result in the best value for customers. And finally, our Jones Act-compliant wind turbine installation vessel is being constructed and is on track for delivery in late 2023. We expect the vessel will be an invaluable resource to DEV as well as to the U.S. offshore wind industry. We expect to announce further details on nonaffiliate vessel charters in the near term. 
In summary, lots of very exciting progress, which will continue through the summer, including our expected notice of intent from BOEM in June. As is typical for a project of this size at this phase of development, there will be some puts and takes as work continues. Taken as a whole, there's no change to our confidence around the project's expected LCOE range of $80 to $90 per megawatt hour. Near the end of the year, we'll file our CPCN and rider applications with the Virginia State Corporation Commission and we'll be in a position at that time to provide additional details around contractor selection and terms, project components, transmission routing, project costs, capacity factors and permitting. 
Turning to updates around other select emissions reduction programs, on solar, on Friday, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved our most recent clean energy filing, which included 500 megawatts of solar capacity across 9 projects, including over 80 megawatts of utility-owned solar, the fourth consecutive such approval. We also recently issued an RFP for an additional 1,000 megawatts of solar and onshore wind as well as 100 megawatts of energy storage and 100 megawatts of small-scale solar projects and 8 megawatts of solar to support our community solar program. Our next clean energy filing, which we expect to include solar and battery storage projects will take place later this year. 
Since our last call, we've continued to derisk our plan to meet the VCEA solar milestone by putting another 30,000 acres of land under option, bringing the total to nearly 100,000 acres of optioned or exclusive land agreements, which is enough to support the approximately 10 gigawatts of utility-owned solar as called for by the Virginia Clean Economy Act. Our nuclear life extension, just this morning, the NRC authorized 20-year life extensions for our 2 Surry units in Virginia. The Surry station provides around 15% of the state's total electricity and around 45% of the state's zero carbon generation. This authorization is a critical step in ensuring the plant will continue to provide significant environmental and economic benefits for many years to come. We expect to file with the SEC for rider recovery of relicensing spend late this year for both Surry and North Anna stations. 
Our gas distribution business, as we've discussed in the past, our gas utility operations are enhancing sustainability and working to reduce Scope 1 and 3 emissions with focused efforts around energy efficiency, renewable natural gas and hydrogen blending, operational modifications and potential changes around procurement practices. For example, as part of our recently filed natural gas rate case in North Carolina, we asked the North Carolina Utilities Commission to approve 5 new sustainability-oriented programs: hydrogen blending pilot, that's part of our goal to be able to blend hydrogen across our entire gas utility footprint by 2030, a new option to allow our customers to purchase RNG attributes and 3 new energy efficiency programs. 
Finally, in South Carolina. The South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff recently filed a report finding that our revised IRP met the requirements of the law and the Public Service Commission's order requiring the modified filing. As a reminder, the preferred plan and the revised filing calls for the retirement of all coal-fired generation in our South Carolina system by the end of the decade, which helps to drive a projected carbon reduction of nearly 60% by 2030 as compared to 2005. While the IRP is an informational filing does not provide approval or disapproval for any specific capital project, we look forward to continuing to talk with stakeholders, including the commission about an increasingly low carbon future. An order is expected from the Public Service Commission by June 18. 
Turning to the regulatory landscape, let me provide a brief update on our Virginia triennial review filing, which we submitted at the end of March. As shown on Slide 12, the filing highlights Dominion Energy Virginia's exceptionally reliable and affordable service. The state's careful and thoughtful approach to utility regulation has resulted in a model that prioritizes long-term planning that protects customers from service disruptions and bill shocks. Consider these facts, 99.9% average reliability delivered at rates that are between 8% and 35% lower than comparable peer groups. We're proud of our record and the work we do to serve customers every single day. Our filing also reflects over $200 million of customer arrears forgiveness as directed by the general assembly, relief that is helping our most vulnerable customers address the financial impacts of COVID-19. The filing also identifies nearly $5 billion of investment in rate base on behalf of our customers over the 4-year review period, including $300 million of capital investment in renewable energy and grid transformation projects that we believe meet the eligibility criteria for reinvestment credits for customers. 
The commission's procedural schedule is shown here. We've included additional details regarding the case as filed in the appendix for your review and look forward to engaging with stakeholders in coming months. It's clear to us that the existing regulatory model is working exceptionally well for customers, communities and the environment in Virginia. We're delivering increasingly clean energy while protecting reliability and safeguarding affordability. 
In South Carolina, we continue to engage in settlement discussions with the other parties as highlighted in our monthly filings before the commission. We aren't able to discuss specifics of that process, but can report that all parties appear committed to working toward a mutually agreeable resolution. 
Finally, let me highlight noteworthy developments in the legislative landscape for our company. In Virginia, during the now adjourned session, the Virginia General Assembly passed House Bill 1965, which adopts low and zero emissions vehicle programs that mirror vehicle emission standards in California. The law, which has been signed by the governor, ensures that more electric vehicles are manufactured and sold in Virginia. It will likely take a few years before we see the significant and inevitable ramp-up in electric vehicle adoption in our service territory, but we're taking steps today to be prepared for the incremental electric demand and associated infrastructure. That includes regional coordination with other utilities to ensure highway corridors that ensure seamless charging networks, support for in-territory EV charging infrastructure, which includes a significant investment in a variety of grid transformation projects, as well as the rollout of time-of-use programs. 
At the federal level, we're encouraged by the support we're seeing for our offshore wind project. We applaud efforts to increase funding for the research and development of technologies that will allow the utility industry to drive further carbon emissions reductions. We're philosophically aligned with the current administration and wanting to accelerate decarbonization across the utility value chain, while also recognizing that the energy we deliver must remain reliable and affordable. It's still early, but we're engaging in the process of policy formation and monitoring developments closely and continue to believe we are well positioned to succeed in an increasingly decarbonized world. 
I'll conclude the call with the summary on Slide 13. Our safety performance year-to-date is tracking closely to our record-setting achievement from last year. We reported our 21st consecutive quarterly result that normalized for weather, meets or exceeds the midpoint of our guidance range. We affirmed our existing long-term earnings and dividend guidance. We're focused on executing across the largest regulated decarbonization investment opportunity in the nation to the benefit of our customers. And we're aggressively pursuing our vision to be the most sustainable energy company in America. 
With that, we're ready to take your questions."

We're hearing a lot about this topic across the industry this quarter, of course. For us, let me walk through it. So there's no impact for us at all in our electric operations, of course, given our geographic location. On the gas side, very minimal cost impact in Ohio, West Virginia, North Carolina, those businesses kind of leveraged their storage assets to minimize purchasing during that week. In Utah, it's interesting, though, we did see increased gas purchases. We saw price spikes in the Rockies region for gas during that week, of course. And we saw -- we had increased gas purchases of our own during that period in the range of about $60 million. Now as a reminder, those costs are covered by customers, but we think it's a modest cost to customers. So no financial impact to the company from that. 
But what's interesting is the strength of the operational and the regulatory design there, really saved customers very significant costs during that period. And those are twofold. One is [ Wexpro ], The regulated fuel supply arm. So during that week, customers got the benefit of that cost of service supply, so insulated from price spikes. And then second, contracting. Questar Gas is, I think it's the largest contractor for a storage capacity for Clay Basin there in the Rockies region. So without those features, that $60 million would have been multiples to many multiples higher. So pretty positive reflection of the operational and regulatory profile there. But overall, big picture, pretty manageable and scale for us. Bob?"

And that is absolutely the #1 priority for our customers, is keeping the lights on. 
And so on the generation side, that means things like having diverse fuel mix, making sure the design basis for equipment is right for the circumstances under which it's going to operate, considerations for fuel security, firm transportation for natural gas. And on the T&D side, it would be advanced simulations of the effect of events on the grid, innovative equipment and engineering new voltage control devices, for example, And it means a robust communications infrastructure. And in Virginia, all of those types of investments that I was just describing are contemplated in both the Clean Economy Act and Grid Transformation and Security Act from 2018, things like grid mod, strategic undergrounding storage. 
So we feel very good about that now. But we're reviewing to see whether any of our resiliency efforts need to be expanded or we need to add new resiliency programs. And we do that all the time, by the way. We learn from experiences on our own system and other systems. So I'd just sum up by saying nothing changes on the clean energy capital investment front. We're confident we will continue that investment and operate reliably and the scope of any additional reliability investments and resiliency investments remains to be seen, but we're studying what is best for our customers right now as we've been doing for decades."

So we're really moving forward with that. We're looking to expand that if it's successful to a small customer use application and then follow the pilots in our other service territories. In fact, we requested a similar pilot at a training facility as part of our North Carolina rate case. So we're starting small, very important on hydrogen blending. 
So we see a combination of moving forward with continued pilots and testings of hydrogen blending throughout our LDC system, including putting it into the LDC, production and even methanation in the future. as well as an increased percentage of RNG into the system, which is really one-for-one offset with methane. So increased RNG, increased hydrogen blending possibly towards methanation as we move to continue to decarbonize the LVC system."

We announced our intention to spend about $650 million on 2 main partnerships. We've been focusing on the agricultural RNG. So the hog farms with Smithfield and the dairy farms with Vanguard renewables. We have 1 project that's in service as of the second half of last year. We have 3 projects under construction now and expect to have about 5 more under construction later this year. So we're really ramping up on actually bringing forward the projects. 
On the demand side, we really see a significant strong demand right now from a variety of customers. You can see the people like the refiners that have LCFS obligations to make, and we see more states looking to implement LCFS standards. We see utilities, both on the power generation side and direct customer use side, and then we see a lot of colleges and universities and other corporations that are kind of carbon conscious fires that are looking to offset their fossil usage. So we really see a lot of demand starting to pick up for multiyear contract terms at attractive prices. 
So long term, we're still looking at these projects as critical supply sources for our LDCs as an important tool for customers to achieve net zero. And so starting to access through our green therm tariff that we already have in Utah now and have requested in North Carolina and will continue to do so. But we're really continuing to see strong demand and our projects are ramping up."

And when do you think that will happen? And how many years do you think in the future would you have to wait for that?"

In fact, it was part of our thinking when we committed to net zero by 2050 across both our gas and electric businesses, was blending renewable natural gas and hydrogen into the system as part of a component of that. So it certainly already worked into the plans, I believe, of numerous utilities in their net zero plans, especially RNG and the agricultural RNG, which is why we're trying to attract so much of it into our LDC systems and with regulators and investing in it to get it in the networks is because it's so much more carbon negative than a lot of other forms. So instead of just being carbon neutral, you just get a lot of bang for the buck out of smaller quantities of it to help meet those net zero goals."

I'd also like to express my thanks for the messages of condolence that we've received from across the country and from around the world. Thank you all. As Bob said, we will very much miss Tom.  
Let me now turn to our business update. Following the in-depth review and roll forward of our capital spending outlook we provided last quarter, our prepared remarks today will be relatively brief. We are very focused on overall execution, including extending our track record of meeting or exceeding our quarterly guidance midpoints as we did again this quarter.  
I'll start my review on Slide 4, with a reminder of Dominion Energy's compelling total shareholder return proposition. We expect to grow our earnings per share by 6.5% per year through at least 2025, supported by our updated $32 billion 5-year growth capital plan. Keep in mind that over 80% of that capital investment is emissions reduction enabling and that over 70% is rider eligible. We offer an attractive dividend yield of approximately 3.2%, reflecting a target payout ratio of 65% and an expected long-term dividend per share growth rate of 6%. This resulting approximately 10% total shareholder return proposition is combined with an attractive pure-play, state-regulated utility profile characterized by industry-leading ESG credentials and the largest regulated decarbonization investment opportunity in the country, as shown on the next slide.  
Our 15-year opportunity is estimated to be over $70 billion, with multiple programs that extend well beyond our 5-year plan and skew meaningfully towards rider-style regulated cost of service recovery. We believe we offer the largest, the broadest in scope, the longest in duration and the most visible regulated decarbonization opportunity among U.S. utilities. The successful execution of this plan will benefit our customers, communities, employees and the environment.  
Turning now to earnings. Our first quarter 2021 operating earnings, as shown on Slide 6, were $1.09 per share, which included a $0.01 hurt from worse than normal weather in our utility service territories. This represents our 21st consecutive quarter, so over 5 years now, of delivering weather-normal quarterly results that meet or exceed the midpoint of our quarterly guidance range. 
GAAP earnings for the quarter were $1.23 per share. The difference between GAAP and operating earnings for the 3 months ended March 31 was primarily attributable to a net benefit associated with nuclear decommissioning trusts and economic hedging activities, partially offset by other charges. A summary of such adjustments between operating and reported results is, as usual, included in Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit.  
Turning on to guidance on Slide 7. As usual, we're providing a quarterly guidance range, which is designed primarily to account for variations from normal weather. For the second quarter of 2021, we expect operating earnings to be between $0.70 and $0.80 per share. We are affirming our existing full year and long-term operating earnings and dividend guidance as well. No changes here from prior guidance.  
Turning to Slide 8 and briefly on financing. Since January, we've issued $1.3 billion of long-term debt, consistent with our 2021 financing plan guidance at a weighted average cost of 2.4%. Thanks to all who participated in these important offerings and as a reminder, we'll have additional fixed income issuance at Dominion Energy, Virginia, at gas distribution at Dominion Energy South Carolina and at our parent company during the remainder of the year. For avoiding some doubt, there's no change to our prior common equity issuance guidance.  
Wrapping up my remarks, let me touch briefly on potential changes to the Federal Tax Code. Obviously, it's still early days with a lot of unknowns. But at a high level, we see an increase in the corporate tax rate as being close to neutral on operating earnings based on, as is the case for all regulated entities, the assumed pass-through for cost of service operations, an increase in parent level interest tax shield and the extension and expansion of clean or green tax credits, all of which will be offset by higher taxes on our contracted assets segment earnings. 
We also expect modest improvement in credit metrics. We're monitoring the contemplated minimum tax rules closely and we'd note the administration's support for renewable development suggests the ability to use renewable credits to offset any such minimum tax rule. More to come over time on that front. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob."

In addition, we're seeing record low levels of lost time and restricted duty",1753,"Thank you, Jim. I'll begin with safety. As shown on Slide 9, through the first 3 months of 2021, we're tracking closely to the record-setting OSHA rate that we achieved in 2020. In addition, we're seeing record low levels of lost time and restricted duty cases, which measure more severe incidents. Of course, the only acceptable number of safety incidents is 0, and we will continue to work toward that critical goal. 
Let me provide a few updates around our execution across the strategy. We're pleased that the 2.6-gigawatt Coastal Virginia offshore wind project has been declared a covered project under Title 41 of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act program, also known as FAST 41. The federal permitting targets now published under that program are consistent with the project schedule that we shared on the fourth quarter call in February. Key schedule milestones are shown side by side on Slide 10. We continue to be encouraged by the current administration's efforts to provide a pathway to timely processing of offshore wind projects. 
In the meantime, we're advancing the project as follows: we're processing competitive solicitations for equipment and services to achieve the best possible value for customers and in accordance with the prudency requirements of the VCEA. Interest in those RFPs has been robust. We're analyzing performance data from our test turbines, which have been operational for several months now and are, to date, generating at capacity factors that are higher than our initial expectations. Recall, we had assumed a lifetime capacity factor of around 41% for the full-scale deployment. 
Further evaluation of turbine design and wind resource, in addition to the data we're gathering in real time, suggest that our original assumption is too low. Higher generation would result in lower energy costs for customers. We're monitoring raw material costs, and it seems to be the case across a number of industries right now, we're observing higher prices. In the case of steel, for example, the return of pandemic-idled steelmaking capacity hasn't yet caught up to global demand. We'll continue to monitor raw material cost trends as we move towards procurement later in the project time line. 
We're moving into the detailed design phase for onshore transmission. As we observed within the industry recently, utility systems are only as good as they are resilient, which is one of the reasons that we made the decision in 2019 to go the extra distance to connect to our 500 kV transmission system to ensure that the project's power will be available when our customers need it most. We believe that decisions we're making around the onshore engineering configurations will ultimately result in the best value for customers. 
And finally, our Jones Act-compliant wind turbine installation vessel is being constructed and is on track for delivery in late 2023. We expect the vessel will be an invaluable resource to DEV as well as to the U.S. offshore wind industry. We expect to announce further details on nonaffiliate vessel charters in the near term. 
In summary, lots of very exciting progress, which will continue through the summer, including our expected notice of intent from BOEM in June. As is typical for a project of this size at this phase of development, there will be some puts and takes as work continues. Taken as a whole, there's no change to our confidence around the project's expected LCOE range of $80 to $90 per megawatt hour. Near the end of the year, we'll file our CPCN and rider applications with the Virginia State Corporation Commission and we'll be in a position at that time to provide additional details around contractor selection and terms, project components, transmission routing, project costs, capacity factors and permitting. 
Turning to updates around other select emissions reduction programs. On solar, on Friday, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved our most recent clean energy filing, which included 500 megawatts of solar capacity across 9 projects, including over 80 megawatts of utility-owned solar, the fourth consecutive such approval. We also recently issued an RFP for an additional 1,000 megawatts of solar and onshore wind as well as 100 megawatts of energy storage and 100 megawatts of small-scale solar projects and 8 megawatts of solar to support our community solar program. Our next clean energy filing, which we expect to include solar and battery storage projects, will take place later this year. 
Since our last call, we've continued to derisk our plan to meet the VCEA solar milestone by putting another 30,000 acres of land under option, bringing the total to nearly 100,000 acres of options or exclusive land agreements, which is enough to support the approximately 10 gigawatts of utility-owned solar as called for by the Virginia Clean Economy Act. 
On nuclear life extension, just this morning, the NRC authorized 20-year life extensions for our 2 Surry units in Virginia. The Surry station provides around 15% of the state's total electricity and around 45% of the state's zero carbon generation. This authorization is a critical step in ensuring the plant will continue to provide significant environmental and economic benefits for many years to come. We expect to file with the SEC for rider recovery of relicensing spend late this year for both Surry and North Anna stations. 
Our gas distribution business, as we've discussed in the past, our gas utility operations are enhancing sustainability and working to reduce Scope 1 and 3 emissions, with focused efforts around energy efficiency, renewable natural gas and hydrogen blending, operational modifications and potential changes around procurement practices. For example, as part of our recently filed natural gas rate case in North Carolina, we asked the North Carolina Utilities Commission to approve 5 new sustainability-oriented programs: hydrogen blending pilot, that's part of our goal to be able to blend hydrogen across our entire gas utility footprint by 2030; a new option to allow our customers to purchase RNG attributes; and 3 new energy efficiency programs. 
Finally, in South Carolina. The South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff recently filed a report finding that our revised IRP met the requirements of the law and the Public Service Commission's order requiring the modified filing. As a reminder, the preferred plan and the revised filing calls for the retirement of all coal-fired generation in our South Carolina system by the end of the decade, which helps to drive a projected carbon reduction of nearly 60% by 2030 as compared to 2005. 
While the IRP is an informational filing, it does not provide approval or disapproval for any specific capital project. We look forward to continuing to talk with stakeholders, including the commission, about an increasingly low-carbon future. An order is expected from the Public Service Commission by June 18. 
Turning to the regulatory landscape, let me provide a brief update on our Virginia triennial review filing, which we submitted at the end of March. As shown on Slide 12, the filing highlights Dominion Energy Virginia's exceptionally reliable and affordable service. The state's careful and thoughtful approach to utility regulation has resulted in a model that prioritizes long-term planning that protects customers from service disruptions and bill shocks. 
Consider these facts, 99.9% average reliability delivered at rates that are between 8% and 35% lower than comparable peer groups. We're proud of our record and the work we do to serve customers every single day. Our filing also reflects over $200 million of customer arrears forgiveness as directed by the general assembly, relief that is helping our most vulnerable customers address the financial impacts of COVID-19. The filing also identifies nearly $5 billion of investment in rate base on behalf of our customers over the 4-year review period, including $300 million of capital investment in renewable energy and grid transformation projects that we believe meet the eligibility criteria for reinvestment credits for customers. 
The commission's procedural schedule is shown here. We've included additional details regarding the case as filed in the appendix for your review and look forward to engaging with stakeholders in coming months. It's clear to us that the existing regulatory model is working exceptionally well for customers, communities and the environment in Virginia. We're delivering increasingly clean energy while protecting reliability and safeguarding affordability. 
In South Carolina, we continue to engage in settlement discussions with the other parties as highlighted in our monthly filings before the commission. We aren't able to discuss specifics of that process, but can report that all parties appear committed to working toward a mutually agreeable resolution. 
Finally, let me highlight noteworthy developments in the legislative landscape for our company. In Virginia, during the now adjourned session, the Virginia General Assembly passed House Bill 1965, which adopts low and zero emissions vehicle programs that mirror vehicle emission standards in California. The law, which has been signed by the governor, ensures that more electric vehicles are manufactured and sold in Virginia. It will likely take a few years before we see the significant and inevitable ramp-up in electric vehicle adoption in our service territory, but we're taking steps today to be prepared for the incremental electric demand and associated infrastructure. That includes regional coordination with other utilities to ensure highway corridors that ensure seamless charging networks, support for in-territory EV charging infrastructure, which includes a significant investment in a variety of grid transformation projects, as well as the rollout of time-of-use programs. 
At the federal level, we're encouraged by the support we're seeing for our offshore wind project. We applaud efforts to increase funding for the research and development of technologies that will allow the utility industry to drive further carbon emissions reductions. We're philosophically aligned with the current administration in wanting to accelerate decarbonization across the utility value chain, while also recognizing that the energy we deliver must remain reliable and affordable. It's still early, but we're engaging in the process of policy formation and monitoring developments closely and continue to believe we are well positioned to succeed in an increasingly decarbonized world. 
I'll conclude the call with the summary on Slide 13. Our safety performance year-to-date is tracking closely to our record-setting achievement from last year. We reported our 21st consecutive quarterly result that normalized for weather, meets or exceeds the midpoint of our guidance range. We affirmed our existing long-term earnings and dividend guidance. We're focused on executing across the largest regulated decarbonization investment opportunity in the nation for the benefit of our customers. And we're aggressively pursuing our vision to be the most sustainable energy company in America. 
With that, we're ready to take your questions."

We're hearing a lot about this topic across the industry this quarter, of course. For us, let me walk through it. So there's no impact for us at all in our electric operations, of course, given our geographic location. On the gas side, very minimal cost impact in Ohio, West Virginia, North Carolina. Those businesses kind of leveraged their storage assets to minimize purchasing during that week. In Utah, it's interesting, though, we did see increased gas purchases. We saw price spikes in the Rockies region for gas during that week, of course. And we saw -- we had increased gas purchases of our own during that period in the range of about $60 million, 6-0. Now as a reminder, those costs are covered by customers, but we think it's a modest cost to customers, so no financial impact to the company from that. 
But what's interesting is the strength of the operational and the regulatory design there really saved customers very significant costs during that period. And those are twofold. One is Wexpro, the regulated fuel supply arm. So during that week, customers got the benefit of that cost of service supply, so insulated from price spikes. And then second, contracting. Questar Gas is, I think, it's the largest contractor for a storage capacity for Clay Basin there in the Rockies region. So without those features, that $60 million would have been multiples to many multiples higher. So pretty positive reflection of the operational and regulatory profile there. But overall, big picture, pretty manageable and scale for us. Bob?"

[indiscernible]. Shar, as we're looking forward. I think it's important to remember that the regulatory models in the states where we do business and particularly our electric states in Virginia and South Carolina are very well suited to operate a reliable system for our customers. And that is absolutely the #1 priority for our customers, is keeping the lights on. 
And so on the generation side, that means things like having diverse fuel mix, making sure the design basis for equipment is right for the circumstances under which it's going to operate, considerations for fuel security, firm transportation for natural gas. And on the T&D side, it would be advanced simulations of the effect of events on the grid, innovative equipment and engineering new voltage control devices, for example. And it means a robust communications infrastructure. And in Virginia, all of those types of investments that I was just describing are contemplated in both the Clean Economy Act and the Grid Transformation and Security Act from 2018, things like grid mod, strategic undergrounding storage. 
So we feel very good about that now, but we're reviewing to see whether any of our resiliency efforts need to be expanded or we need to add new resiliency programs. And we do that all the time, by the way. We learn from experiences on our own system and other systems. So I'd just sum up by saying nothing changes on the clean energy capital investment front. We're confident we will continue that investment and operate reliably. And the scope of any additional reliability investments and resiliency investments remains to be seen, but we're studying what is best for our customers right now as we've been doing for decades."

So we're really moving forward with that. We're looking to expand that, if it's successful, to a small customer use application and then follow the pilots in our other service territories. In fact, we requested a similar pilot at a training facility as part of our North Carolina rate case. So we're starting small, very important on hydrogen blending. 
So we see a combination of moving forward with continued pilots and testings of hydrogen blending throughout our LDC system, including putting it into the LDC, production and even methanation in the future, as well as an increased percentage of RNG into the system, which is really one-for-one offset with methane. So increased RNG, increased hydrogen blending possibly towards methanation as we move to continue to decarbonize the LVC system."

We announced our intention to spend about $650 million on 2 main partnerships. We've been focusing on the agricultural RNG. So the hog farms with Smithfield and the dairy farms with Vanguard Renewables. We have one project that's in service as of the second half of last year. We have 3 projects under construction now and expect to have about 5 more under construction later this year. So we're really ramping up on actually bringing forward the projects. 
On the demand side, we really see a significant strong demand right now from a variety of customers. You can see the people like the refiners that have LCFS obligations to make, and we see more states looking to implement LCFS standards. We see utilities, both on the power generation side and direct customer use side. And then we see a lot of colleges and universities and other corporations that are kind of carbon conscious buyers that are looking to offset their fossil usage. So we really see a lot of demand starting to pick up for multiyear contract terms at attractive prices. 
So long term, we're still looking at these projects as critical supply sources for our LDCs as an important tool for customers to achieve net zero. And so starting to access through our green therm tariff that we already have in Utah now and have requested in North Carolina and will continue to do so. But we're really continuing to see strong demand, and our projects are ramping up."

That's what the Clean Economy Act is, it's quite specific on this point that for the new solar build, 65% is to be utility in and 35% is to be third-party or PPA, and sort of the total amount of that is on the order of 1,000 megawatts a year for the next 15.

I know there's some competition for utility investors attention this morning, a couple of competing calls in this time slot. So thank you for joining our call, and we promised to keep our call today somewhat brief. 
Before I report on our strong quarterly financial results, I'm going to start with a recap of our compelling investment proposition and highlight our focus on the consistent execution of our repositioned strategy. We expect to grow our earnings per share 6.5% per year through at least 2025 and supported by a $32 billion 5-year growth capital plan. As outlined on our fourth quarter call in February, over 80% of that capital investment is emissions reduction enabling, and over 70% is rider recovery eligible. We offer a nearly 3.5% yield and expect dividends per share to grow 6% per year based on a target payout ratio of 65%. Taken together, Dominion Energy offers an approximately 10% total return premised on a pure-play, state-regulated utility profile, operating in premier regions of the country. More on that lasting in a minute. Our industry-leading ESG positioning includes the largest regulated decarbonization investment opportunity in the nation, which, as you'll hear in today's prepared remarks, is steadily transforming from opportunity to reality. 
Turning now to earnings. Our second quarter 2021 operating earnings, as shown on Slide 4, were $0.76 per share, which included a one pending hurt from worse than normal weather in our utility service territories. Both actual results and weather-normalized results of $0.77 were above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance range. So this is our 22nd consecutive quarter, so 5.5 years now, of delivering weather-normal quarterly results that meet or exceed the midpoint of our quarterly guidance range. Note that our second quarter and year-to-date GAAP and operating earnings, together with comparative periods, are adjusted to account for discontinued operations, including those associated with our gas transmission and storage assets. 
Second quarter GAAP earnings were $0.33 per share and reflect the mark-to-market impact of economic hedging activities, unrealized changes in the value of our nuclear decommissioning trust funds, the contribution from Questar pipeline, which will continue to be accounted for as discontinued operations until divested and other adjustments. A summary of all adjustments between operating and reported results is, as usual, included in Schedule 2 of our earnings release kit. 
Turning now to guidance on Slide 5. As usual, we're providing a quarterly guidance range which is designed primarily to account for variations from normal weather. For the third quarter of 2021, we expect operating earnings to be between $0.95 and $1.10 per share. We are affirming our existing full year and long-term operating earnings and dividend growth guidance as well. No changes here from prior communications. 
Through the first half of the year, weather-normal operating EPS of $1.86 represents approximately half of our full year guidance midpoint. So we are tracking nicely in line with our expectations. We'll provide our formal fourth quarter earnings guidance, as is typical, on our next earnings call, but let me provide some commentary on the implied cadence of our earnings over the second half of the year. 
While Q3 guidance is roughly in line with weather-normal results from a year ago, we will see a multitude of small year-over-year helps in Q4 such as normal course regulated rider growth, the impact of the South Carolina electric rate settlement, strengthening sales, modest margin help, including from Millstone, continued expense management and tax timing that combined, will help us to deliver solid second half results. We continue to be very focused on extending our track record of achieving weather-normal results, at least equal to the midpoint of our guidance on both a quarterly and annual basis. 
Turning now to a couple of macro items. First, overall electric sales trends. In Virginia, weather-normalized sales increased 1.2% year-over-year in the second quarter and 3.2% in South Carolina. In both states, increased usage from commercial and industrial segments overcame declines among residential users as the stay-at-home impact of COVID reined some context on that. You'll recall that demand in DOM zone last year was despite the pandemic pretty resilient due to robust residential and data center demand. So it's not surprising to see South Carolina's relatively higher growth in Q2, given the larger toll COVID had on sales there last year. We're encouraged by the strong return of commercial and industrial volumes in South Carolina in the second quarter. And looking ahead, we expect electric sales growth in our Virginia and South Carolina service territories to continue to a run rate of 1% to 1.5% per year, so similar to what we were observing prepandemic. 
Next, let me discuss what we're seeing around input prices. As discussed on last quarter's call, we're continuing to monitor raw material costs. And it seems to be the case across a number of industries right now, we're observing higher prices, although we have seen a moderation in the upward pressure over the last few months, especially in steel. Despite these cost pressures, as it relates to offshore wind, in particular, we remain confident in our ability to deliver that project in line with our previously guided levelized cost of energy range of $80 to $90 per megawatt hour. 
On the solar side, we're seeing, again, what others seemed to be seeing, supply is tight, and prices for steel, poly and glass are up, but our 2021 projects remain on track with most material now already on site. We're beginning to see moderation in pricing and relief from modest shipping constraints, which bodes well, we expect, for our post-2021 projects. So again, we're watching but no material financial impacts at this time. 
Let me address a few additional topics on Slide 6. First, Questar pipeline. Last month, Dominion Energy and Berkshire Hathaway Energy mutually agreed to terminate our planned sale of Questar pipeline as a result of ongoing uncertainty associated with the timing and the likelihood of ultimately achieving Hart-Scott renewal clearance. 
A few thoughts here. First, that we obviously felt that a timely clearance and closing was the logical outcome given the facts and circumstances surrounding that transaction. We did build into the original Berkshire sale contract, the flexibility to easily accommodate a termination if needed, Second, we are already at a reasonably advanced stage of an alternate competitive sale process for Questar Pipeline with expected closing by the end of this year. Third, its termination has no impact on the sale of the gas transmission storage assets to Berkshire, which we successfully completed back in November of last year and which represented approximately 80% of the originally announced transaction value. And finally, this termination nor the outcome of the ongoing sale process impacts Dominion Energy's existing financial guidance. As mentioned, Questar pipeline will continue to be accounted for as discontinued operations excluded from the company's calculation of operating earnings. 
Briefly, on credit, we've continued to deliberately enhance our qualitative and quantitative credit measures. Last month, we were pleased to see Fitch upgrade Dominion Energy South Carolina's credit rating from BBB+ to A-. Fitch cited both improved regulatory relationships, including the unanimous approval of the General Electric rate settlement, which Bob will discuss in some more detail, as well as good balance sheet management. 
So let me turn now to a couple of ESG-related topics. In June, we announced the successful syndication of sustainability-linked credit facilities totaling $6.9 billion, and we very much appreciate the efforts and support of all the banks who work with us on what we view as a very interesting new type of financing. The $6 billion master credit facility links pricing to achievement of annual renewable electric generation and diversity and inclusion milestones. And the $900 million supplemental facility presents a first-of-its-kind structure where pricing benefits accrue for draws related to qualified environmental and social spending programs. So in other words, going forward, if we meet or exceed our quantifiable goals in these areas, our borrowing costs decline. And of course, the opposite is also true. If we fail to meet our goals, we pay more. But for this financing, we're very much putting our money where our mouth is when it comes to ESG performance. And we're looking for more ways to deploy green capital raises as we execute on our fixed income financing plan during the balance of the year. 
In July, we issued an updated and comprehensive climate report, which reflects the task force on climate-related financial disclosures, or TCFD, methodology. We are just 1 of 6 U.S. electric utilities that have pledged formal support for TCFD. As described in the report, which is available on our website, we have modeled several potential pathways to achieve net zero emissions across our electric and gas business that reflect 1.5-degree scenarios and are consistent with the Paris Agreement on climate change. The climate report shows we are a leader in both greenhouse gas emission reductions over the last 15 years and in our commitment to transparent progress towards our goal of net zero emissions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

I'll begin my prepared remarks by commenting on our safety performance. As shown on Slide 7, I'm very pleased that our results over the first 2 quarters of this year surpassed even our record-setting results from last",2385,"Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin my prepared remarks by commenting on our safety performance. As shown on Slide 7, I'm very pleased that our results over the first 2 quarters of this year surpassed even our record-setting results from last year. Our safety performance matters immensely to our more than 17,000 employees, to their families and to the communities we serve, which is why it matters so much to us and why it's our first core value. 
Turning to Slide 8. I often describe our pure-play state-regulated strategy as centering around 5 premier states, all of which share the philosophy that a common sense approach to energy policy and regulation puts a priority on safety, reliability, affordability and, increasingly, sustainability. 
We were pleased that CNBC's list of America's top states for business ranked Virginia, North Carolina and Utah as 1, 2 and 3, respectively, a podium sweep for 3 of our 5 primary jurisdictions with a fourth major service territory, Ohio, also ranking in the top 10. This is the second consecutive #1 ranking for Virginia. Obviously, an assessment of this variety is just one of several possible ways to evaluate state-specific business environments, but we're pleased with the independent confirmation of what we observe every day working on the ground in all of our regions. We've strategically repositioned our business around the state-regulated utility model in order to offer investors increased stability, which is further enhanced by our concentration in these fast-growing, constructive and business-friendly states. 
Next, I'd like to highlight the outstanding work done across our operating segments by the women and men of Dominion Energy, who exemplify our core values of safety, ethics, excellence, embracing change and One Dominion Energy. At gas distribution, our colleagues have collaborated across our national footprint to share best practices, resulting in a nearly 20% reduction of third-party excavation damage to our underground infrastructure as compared to 2019. Each instance of damage prevention enhances the safety and reliability of our system while also reducing the emissions profile of our operations. 
At Dominion Energy South Carolina, our ability to work in close partnership with state and local officials, combined with our commitment to meet an aggressive time line for electric and gas service delivery, were key to attracting a new $400 million brewery to the state last year. The facility is expected to create 300 local jobs and is one of the largest breweries built in the United States in the last 25 years. Being on time, however, wasn't good enough for our South Carolina colleagues, who safely completed the infrastructure upgrades and installation ahead of an already ambitious schedule. We take pride in examples like this that demonstrate how DESC plays a key role in supporting South Carolina's economic and job growth. 
And in Virginia, despite several days of near-record peak demand in June, our generation colleagues delivered exceptional performance as evidenced by the absence during those periods of any forced outages across our fleet. Our transmission and distribution team members kept the grid operating flawlessly under demanding load conditions while also keeping pace with robust residential connects and remarkable data center demand growth, which continues the trend of robust growth over the last several years with no end in sight. 
I'll now turn to updates around the execution of our growth plan. The 2.6 gigawatt Coastal Virginia offshore wind project received its notice of intent, or NOI, from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management in early July, consistent with the time line we had previously communicated. The issuance of an NOI formally commenced the federal permitting review, which, based on our previously disclosed time line, is expected to take about 2 years. Key schedule milestones are shown on Slide 10. 
Later this year, we'll file our CPCN and rider applications with the Virginia State Corporation Commission. In June, we announced an agreement with Orsted and Eversource, under which they will charter our Jones Act-compliant wind turbine installation vessel for the construction of 2 offshore wind farms in the Northeast. The vessel remains on track for delivery in late 2023 and will be an invaluable resource to DEV as well as to the growing U.S. offshore wind industry. 
Turning to Slide 11. The Virginia triannual review is currently in discovery phase, and the company is providing timely responses to requests for information, all of which generally conform with what we would reasonably expect during a rate proceeding of this size and complexity. As a reminder, the earnings review applies only to the Virginia base portion of our rate base, which becomes smaller as a percentage of DEV and Dominion Energy during our forecast period. Virginia rider investments like offshore wind, solar, battery storage, nuclear life extension and electric transmission, which are outside the scope of the proceeding, represent the vast majority of the growth at DEV. 
We've provided a summary of our filing position as well as key milestones in the procedural schedule. A few items to reiterate here. First, our filing highlights the compelling value we've provided to customers during the review period of 2017 through 2020. We've delivered safe and reliable service at affordable rates that are well below regional, ready and national averages, all while taking aggressive steps to accelerate decarbonization by pursuing early retirement of fossil fuel and power generation units. Second, at the direction of the general assembly, we've provided over $200 million of customer arrears forgiveness to assist families and businesses in overcoming financial difficulties caused by the pandemic. Third, we've invested over $300 million in CCRO-eligible projects, including our offshore wind test project, which is the first operational wind turbines built in federal waters in the United States. Finally, our filing reports a regulatory return that aligns closely to our authorized ROE plus the 70 basis point color. Inclusive of arrears forgive us, this financial result warrants neither refund nor a change to revenues. 
While offshore wind and the triennial review are understandably areas of focus, we'd be remiss if we didn't also highlight the blocking and tackling we're doing to advance other very material growth investments and their associated regulatory processes for the benefit of our customers, communities and the environment. Since our last update, we received our fourth consecutive regulatory approval for investments in utility-owned rider recoverable solar projects. We've now surpassed 1,000 megawatts of Dominion Energy-owned solar generation in service in Virginia, and there is a lot more to come. In fact, our pipeline of company-owned solar projects in Virginia under various stages of development currently totals nearly 4,000 megawatts, which gives us great confidence in our ability to achieve the solar capacity targets set forth in Virginia law and which support our long-term growth capital plans. 
In the very near term, about 25 days to be specific, we'll make our next and largest today clean energy submission. We expect the filing to include as many as 1,100 megawatts of utility-owned and PPA solar, roughly consistent with the 65-35 split identified in the Virginia Clean Economy Act. It will also include around 100 megawatts of battery storage, including 70 megawatts of utility-owned projects. Taken together, the filing will represent as much as $1.5 billion of utility-owned and rider-eligible investment, further derisking our growth capital guidance provided on our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. 
Next, the State Corporation Commission approved our inaugural renewable portfolio standard development plan and rider filings. This annual accounting is mandated under the VCEA and provide a status update on the company's progress towards meeting both near- and long-term requirements under the state's RPS targets. We received commission approval for our Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or REGI, rider file. Under state law, Virginia has joined with other REGI states to promote a marketplace for emissions credits with the goal of significantly reducing greenhouse gases over time, and this approval allows for timely recovery of our cost of compliance. 
Next, we received authorization from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to extend the life of our 2 nuclear units at the Surry power station for an additional 20 years. These units currently provide around 45% of the state's zero carbon generation and under this authorization will be upgraded to continue providing significant environmental and economic benefits for many years to come. We expect to file for rider cost recovery associated with license renewal capital investment later this year. 
And last but not least, progress on our grid's transformation plans. Our first phase covering 2019 through 2021 is well underway, and we recently filed our Phase II plan with Virginia regulators covering the years 2022 and '23. The second phase includes approximately $669 million in capital investment, which is needed to facilitate and optimize the integration of distributed energy resources while continuing to address the reality that reliability and security are vital to our company and its customers. We expect the final CPCN order around the end of the year. 
Our customers and our policymakers have made it abundantly clear. They want cleaner energy, and they want it delivered safely, reliably and affordably. We're therefore very pleased to be executing on that vision on multiple fronts while extending the track record of constructive regulatory outcomes to the benefit of all stakeholders. 
Turning now to our gas distribution business. We're leading the industry in initiatives to reduce the carbon footprint of our essential natural gas distribution services. Our efforts include modifications to our operating and maintenance procedures, systemic pipeline and other aging infrastructure replacement, third-party damage prevention, piloting applications for hydrogen blending, producing and promoting the use of carbon-beneficial renewable natural gas and offering innovative customer programs. 
For example, in Utah, we're seeking approval for a program that would enable customers to purchase voluntary carbon offsets. For around $5 per month on a typical residential bill, customers that opt into the program will offset the carbon impact of their gas distribution use. This program, which like our existing green therm program, allows customers to make choices about how to manage and lower their individual carbon profiles is just one way we're reimagining how gas distribution service intersects with an increasingly sustainable energy future. Along those lines, our hydrogen blending pilot in Utah is performing in line with expectations, and we're in the planning stages of expanding the pilot to test communities. We filed for a similar blending pilot in North Carolina and are evaluating appropriate next steps for blending in our Ohio system. 
And as it relates to our already industry-leading renewable natural gas platform, we're pleased to announce an expansion of our strategic alliance with Vanguard Renewables. As a result, we expect to grow our dairy RNG portfolio from 6 projects in 5 states to 22 projects in 7 states through the second half of the decade and enhance our development pipeline with specific projects towards our aspirational goal of investing up to $2 billion by 2035. Our current pipeline of projects will result in an estimated annual reduction of 5.5 million metric tons of CO2 which is the equivalent to removing 1.2 million cars from the road. 
Turning now to South Carolina. On July 21, the South Carolina Public Service Commission with the support of all parties unanimously approved the proposed comprehensive settlement in the pending general electric rate case. We appreciate the collaborative approach among the parties over the last 6 months, which allowed us to produce this agreement that provides significant customer benefits, as shown on Slide 14; supports our ability to continue providing safe, reliable, affordable and increasingly sustainable energy; and aligns with our existing consolidated financial earnings guidance. Further, the approval allows all parties to turn the page and focus on South Carolina's bright energy future. 
It's also worth noting that the commission also recently approved our modified IRP, which favors a plan that would result in the retirement of all coal-fired generation in our South Carolina system by the end of the decade. While the IRP is an informational filing and does not provide approval or disapproval for any specific capital project, we look forward to continuing to work with stakeholders, including the commission, to drive towards an increasingly low carbon future. 
Before I summarize these prepared remarks and open the line for your questions, I'd like to recognize 3 interrelated organizational changes we announced yesterday that will affect our team and our Investor Relations efforts. First, Senior Vice President, Craig Wagstaff, who's provided over 10 years of exemplary leadership for our gas utility operations in Utah, Idaho and Wyoming, will be retiring early next year. And I can say definitively on behalf of all of our colleagues, he will be sorely missed. Craig joined Questar Corp. in 1984, and we have benefited greatly from his contributions since the Dominion Energy Questar merger in 2016. Best wishes to Craig and his family and his retirement. 
We ask Steven Ridge, our current Vice President of Investor Relations, to relocate to Salt Lake City and, effective October 1, assume the role of Vice President and General Manager for our Western natural gas distribution operations. Steven has been a valuable member of our IR efforts over the last nearly 4 years. And I think it's gotten to know most of you pretty well. We have every confidence in his ability to follow Craig's long-standing example of serving our Utah, Wyoming and Idaho customers and communities well. 
And finally, David McFarland, who's been working on our Investor Relations team since October of last year, will assume responsibility for our IR efforts as Steven transitions into his new role later this year. We congratulate David on this new opportunity. Our investors should expect no change to our aim to provide consistently a high level of responsiveness and accuracy they've grown to expect from our current IR team. 
With that, let me summarize our remarks on Slide 15. Our safety performance year-to-date is on track to improve upon last year's record-setting achievement. We reported our 22nd consecutive quarterly result, as normalized for weather, meets or exceeds the midpoint of our guidance range. We affirmed our existing annual and long-term earnings guidance and our dividend growth guidance. We're focused on executing across project construction and achieving regulatory outcomes that serve our customers well, and we're aggressively pursuing our vision to become the most sustainable regulated energy company in America. With that, we're ready to take your questions."

And to the extent that there's broad-based support that allow a commercialization in a way that can be quick and customer beneficial, we think that's very important and certainly something that we support. And obviously, clean energy manufacturing tax credits, which can help enable U.S. renewable supply, particularly offshore wind and solar, we think, are really valuable. So we're very much engaged in Washington and participating in the process. We like the direction that it's going. Details yet to come, but we think there are some real possibilities there."

So we'll get a sense then, but it's a rate case covering a 4-year period and then setting rates going forward with the guardrail you mentioned. So I wouldn't be surprised if we see a pretty wide variety of opinions expressed by the parties. 
But if you take a step back and just think about the bigger picture here in that case, we have rates below national regional averages. Our performance of our utility is outstanding on the generation and the wire side. And we're reducing our emissions and improving -- reducing our impact on the environment. And so that's a pretty good place to be in a rate case. So we feel very good about that. 
As to T2, that's obviously -- we're only a few months into the period that is going to be reviewed for T2. So a lot of details yet to go on the second triennial. But the tools that are in the toolbox, like the customer credit reinvestment offset will be available to us in triennial 2. And then as we pointed out in our prepared remarks, and as we've noted for some time, as we move forward in this plan, the portion of our earnings that come from Virginia base as opposed to the rest of the business and, in Virginia, in particular, the riders, decreases as a percentage of the overall amount. So I think those are important considerations to keep in mind. Obviously, a long ways to go between now and triennial 2. But we've got tools in the toolbox and the percentage of our earnings affected by triennial 2 as compared to the rest of the company will continue to decrease."

So last time, bear in mind, I think about $200 million of capital got approved in the filing last time, but some things have changed since that last filing. The most significant one is that the Virginia Clean Economy Act has passed, and we now have an obligation to seek approval for a substantial amount of renewables over the course of the next 1.5 decades , offshore wind, storage, all of that. And we're going to need to modify the grid in order to make sure that we keep operating in that environment. And that's what we told the commission in that filing. Things like distributed energy resource management system will be incredibly important in this new world that we're moving into. 
So the Clean Economy Act is different. That didn't exist when we filed last time. Obviously, we also have the benefit of what we heard from the commission and the order on the last filing, and we can target and we have targeted what we're doing with this most recent filing based on precisely what they told us last time. And then some of this filing is continuation of programs that they did approve last time. As I mentioned, they approved $200 million of capital in the last filing. So all of those factors lead us to believe that we should have a lot of confidence in that filing. We'll  hear, as I said in the opening, around the end of this year, but it's a strong filing. It's important for us as we integrate additional renewables to make sure that we operate the system well."

Sure. Good morning, Jeremy. Diane Leopold here. So as Bob outlined in his prepared remarks, we really see RNG as a great way to intersect the essential gas service that we provide in reliable and affordable means to our customers in all of our states with our local gas distribution companies and enhanced sustainability. So while this is a very early phase of development with renewable natural gas that we have been on the path on for the last several years, we decided in our investments to focus on agricultural RNG, so our swine and our dairy partnerships. And the reason we did that is because we believe that was the most carbon-negative, carbon-beneficial means to capture methane and repurpose that waste stream for a more environmentally friendly use. 
So when it comes to the actual investment side of it, we now already have between, both partnerships, one project in service, which happens to be a swine project; and 5 projects under construction; and several more under construction by year-end. So as we were looking at our Vanguard partnership, we were really moving forward with development of a lot of prospects at a good rate, and we saw enough interest in the demand for this renewable natural gas, multiyear contracts with customers that are interested in ensuring a source of supply for their sustainability targets. 
So we're really looking to develop these projects in the short to medium term for these customers. It could be the transportation market. It could be other local distribution companies. It could be thermal industrial users. And then long term, look to our regulated gas customers to help them lower their carbon footprint. So we're working with stakeholders and regulators and policymakers towards that goal. And the green therm programs in Utah, and we've already asked for in North Carolina, is just one step in that path to try to move the renewable natural gas towards our regulated customers."

I know there's some competition for utility investors attention this morning, a couple of competing calls in this time slot. So thank you for joining our call, and we promise to keep our call today somewhat brief. 
Before I report on our strong quarterly financial results, I'm going to start with a recap of our compelling investment proposition and highlight our focus on the consistent execution of our repositioned strategy. We expect to grow earnings per share 6.5% per year through at least 2025 supported by a $32 billion 5-year growth capital plan. As outlined on our fourth quarter call in February, over 80% of that capital investment is emissions reduction enabling and over 70% is rider recovery eligible. 
We offer a nearly 3.5% yield and expect dividends per share to grow 6% per year based on a target payout ratio of 65%. Taken together, Dominion Energy offers an approximately 10% total return premised on a pure-play, state-regulated utility profile, operating in premier regions of the country. More on that lasting in a minute. Our industry-leading ESG positioning includes the largest regulated decarbonization investment opportunity in the nation, which, as you'll hear in today's prepared remarks, is steadily transforming from opportunity to reality. 
Turning now to earnings. Our second quarter 2021 operating earnings, as shown on Slide 4, were $0.76 per share, which included $0.01 hurt from worse than normal weather in our utility service territories. Both actual results and weather-normalized results of $0.77 were above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance range. So this is our 22nd consecutive quarter, so 5.5 years now, of delivering weather-normal quarterly results that meet or exceed the midpoint of our quarterly guidance range. Note that our second quarter and year-to-date GAAP and operating earnings, together with comparative periods, are adjusted to account for discontinued operations, including those associated with our gas transmission and storage assets. 
Second quarter GAAP earnings were $0.33 per share and reflect the mark-to-market impact of economic hedging activities, unrealized changes in the value of our nuclear decommissioning trust funds,  the contribution from Questar pipeline, which will continue to be accounted for as discontinued operations until divested and other adjustments. A summary of all adjustments between operating and reported results is, as usual, included in Schedule 2 of our earnings release kit. 
Turning now to guidance on Slide 5. As usual, we're providing a quarterly guidance range which is designed primarily to account for variations from normal weather. For the third quarter of 2021, we expect operating earnings to be between $0.95 and $1.10 per share. We are affirming our existing full year and long-term operating earnings and dividend growth guidance as well. No changes here from prior communications. 
For the first half of the year, weather-normal operating EPS of $1.86 represents approximately half of our full year guidance midpoint. So we are tracking nicely in line with our expectations. We'll provide our formal fourth quarter earnings guidance, as is typical, on our next earnings call, but let me provide some commentary on the implied cadence of our earnings over the second half of the year. 
While Q3 guidance is roughly in line with weather-normal results from a year ago, we will see a multitude of small year-over-year helps in Q4, such as normal course regulated rider growth, the impact of the South Carolina electric rate settlement, strengthening sales, modest margin help, including -- from Millstone, continued expense management and tax timing that combined will help us to deliver solid second half results. We continue to be very focused on extending our track record of achieving weather-normal results, at least equal to the midpoint of our guidance on both a quarterly and annual basis. 
Turning now to our couple of macro items. First, overall electric sales trends. In Virginia, weather-normalized sales increased 1.2% year-over-year in the second quarter and 3.2% in South Carolina. In both states, increased usage from commercial and industrial segments overcame declines among residential users, as the stay-at-home impact of COVID waned, some context on that.  You'll recall that demand in DOM zone last year was despite the pandemic pretty resilient due to robust residential and data center demand. 
So it's not surprising to see South Carolina's relatively higher growth in Q2, given the larger toll COVID had on sales there last year. We're encouraged by the strong return of commercial and industrial volumes in South Carolina in the second quarter. And looking ahead, we expect electric sales growth in our Virginia and South Carolina service territories to continue to a run rate of 1% to 1.5% per year, so similar to what we were observing pre pandemic. 
Next, let me discuss what we're seeing around input prices. As discussed on last quarter's call, we're continuing to monitor raw material costs. And it seems to be the case across a number of industries right now, we're observing higher prices, although we have seen a moderation in the upward pressure over the last few months, especially in steel. Despite these cost pressures, as it relates to offshore wind, in particular, we remain confident in our ability to deliver that project in line with our previously guided levelized cost of energy range of $80 to $90 per megawatt hour. 
On the solar side, we're seeing, again, what others seem to be seeing, supply is tight, and prices for steel, poly and glass are up, but our 2021 projects remain on track with most material now already on site. We're beginning to see moderation in pricing and relief from modest shipping constraints, which bodes well, we expect, for our post-2021 projects. So again, we're watching but no material financial impacts at this time. 
Let me address a few additional topics on Slide 6. First, Questar pipeline. Last month, Dominion Energy and Berkshire Hathaway Energy mutually agreed to terminate our planned sale of Questar pipeline as a result of ongoing uncertainty associated with the timing and the likelihood of ultimately achieving Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance. 
A few thoughts here. First, though we obviously felt that a timely clearance [ of ] closing was the logical outcome given the facts and circumstances surrounding that transaction, we did build into the original Berkshire sale contract, the flexibility to easily accommodate a termination if needed. Second, we are already at a reasonably advanced stage of an alternate competitive sale process for Questar Pipeline with expected closing by the end of this year. Third, its termination has no impact on the sale of the gas transmission storage assets to Berkshire, which we successfully completed back in November of last year and which represented approximately 80% of the originally announced transaction value. And finally, this termination nor the outcome of the ongoing sale process impacts Dominion Energy's existing financial guidance. As mentioned, Questar pipeline will continue to be accounted for as discontinued operations excluded from the company's calculation of operating earnings.
Briefly, on credit, we've continued to deliberately enhance our qualitative and quantitative credit measures. Last month, we were pleased to see Fitch upgrade Dominion Energy South Carolina's credit rating from BBB+ to A-. Fitch cited both improved regulatory relationships, including the unanimous approval of the General Electric rate settlement, which Bob will discuss in some more detail, as well as good balance sheet management. 
So let me turn now to a couple of ESG-related topics. In June, we announced the successful syndication of sustainability-linked credit facilities totaling $6.9 billion, and we very much appreciate the efforts and support of all the banks who work with us on what we view as a very interesting new type of financing. 
The $6 billion master credit facility links pricing to achievement of annual renewable electric generation and diversity and inclusion milestones. And the $900 million supplemental facility presents a first-of-its-kind structure where pricing benefits accrue for draws related to qualified environmental and social spending programs. So in other words, going forward, if we meet or exceed our quantifiable goals in these areas, our borrowing costs decline. And of course, the opposite is also true. If we fail to meet our goals, we pay more. But [ through ] this financing, we're very much putting our money where our mouth is when it comes to ESG performance. And we're looking for more ways to deploy green capital raises as we execute on our fixed income financing plan during the balance of the year. 
In July, we issued an updated and comprehensive climate report, which reflects the task force on climate-related financial disclosures, or TCFD, methodology. We are just one of 6 U.S. electric utilities that have pledged formal support for TCFD. As described in the report, which is available on our website, we have modeled several potential pathways to achieve net zero emissions across our electric and gas business that reflect 1.5-degree scenario and are consistent with the Paris Agreement on climate change. The climate report shows we are a leader in both greenhouse gas emission reductions over the last 15 years and in our commitment to transparent progress towards our goal of net zero emissions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

I'll begin my prepared remarks by commenting on our safety performance. As shown on Slide 7, I'm very pleased that our results over the first 2 quarters of this year surpassed even our record-setting results from last",2384,"Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin my prepared remarks by commenting on our safety performance. As shown on Slide 7, I'm very pleased that our results over the first 2 quarters of this year surpassed even our record-setting results from last year. Our safety performance matters immensely to our more than 17,000 employees, to their families and to the communities we serve, which is why it matters so much to us and why it's our first core value. 
Turning to Slide 8. I often describe our pure-play state-regulated strategy as centering around 5 premier states, all of which share the philosophy that a common sense approach to energy policy and regulation puts a priority on safety, reliability, affordability and, increasingly, sustainability. 
We were pleased that CNBC's list of America's Top States for Business ranked Virginia, North Carolina and Utah as 1, 2 and 3, respectively, a podium sweep for 3 of our 5 primary jurisdictions with a fourth major service territory, Ohio, also ranking in the top 10. This is the second consecutive #1 ranking for Virginia. Obviously, an assessment of this variety is just one of several possible ways to evaluate state-specific business environments, but we're pleased with the independent confirmation of what we observe every day working on the ground in all of our regions. We've strategically repositioned our business around the state-regulated utility model in order to offer investors increased stability, which is further enhanced by our concentration in these fast-growing, constructive and business-friendly states. 
Next, I'd like to highlight the outstanding work done across our operating segments by the women and men of Dominion Energy, who exemplify our core values of safety, ethics, excellence, embracing change and One Dominion Energy. At Gas Distribution, our colleagues have collaborated across our national footprint to share best practices, resulting in a nearly 20% reduction of third-party excavation damage to our underground infrastructure as compared to 2019. Each instance of damage prevention enhances the safety and reliability of our system while also reducing the emissions profile of our operations. 
At Dominion Energy South Carolina, our ability to work in close partnership with state and local officials, combined with our commitment to meet an aggressive time line for electric and gas service delivery, were key to attracting a new $400 million brewery to the state last year. The facility is expected to create 300 local jobs and is one of the largest breweries built in the United States in the last 25 years. Being on time, however, wasn't good enough for our South Carolina colleagues, who safely completed the infrastructure upgrades and installation ahead of an already ambitious schedule. We take pride in examples like this that demonstrate how DESC plays a key role in supporting South Carolina's economic and job growth. 
And in Virginia, despite several days of near-record peak demand in June, our generation colleagues delivered exceptional performance as evidenced by the absence during those periods of any forced outages across our fleet. Our transmission and distribution team members kept the grid operating flawlessly under demanding load conditions while also keeping pace with robust residential connects and remarkable data center demand growth, which continues the trend of robust growth over the last several years with no end in sight. 
I'll now turn to updates around the execution of our growth plan. The 2.6 gigawatt Coastal Virginia offshore wind project received its notice of intent, or NOI, from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management in early July, consistent with the time line we had previously communicated. The issuance of an NOI formally commenced the federal permitting review, which, based on our previously disclosed time line, is expected to take about 2 years. Key schedule milestones are shown on Slide 10. 
Later this year, we'll file our CPCN and rider applications with the Virginia State Corporation Commission. In June, we announced an agreement with Ørsted and Eversource, under which they will charter our Jones Act-compliant wind turbine installation vessel for the construction of 2 offshore wind farms in the Northeast. The vessel remains on track for delivery in late 2023 and will be an invaluable resource to DEV as well as to the growing U.S. offshore wind industry. 
Turning to Slide 11. The Virginia triennial review is currently in discovery phase, and the company is providing timely responses to requests for information, all of which generally conform with what we would reasonably expect during a rate proceeding of this size and complexity. As a reminder, the earnings review applies only to the Virginia base portion of our rate base, which becomes smaller as a percentage of DEV and Dominion Energy during our forecast period. Virginia rider investments like offshore wind, solar, battery storage, nuclear life extension and electric transmission, which are outside the scope of the proceeding, represent the vast majority of the growth at DEV. 
We've provided a summary of our filing position as well as key milestones in the procedural schedule. A few items to reiterate here. First, our filing highlights the compelling value we've provided to customers during the review period of 2017 through 2020. We've delivered safe and reliable service at affordable rates that are well below regional, [ RGGI ] and national averages, all while taking aggressive steps to accelerate decarbonization by pursuing early retirement of fossil fuel and power generation units. Second, at the direction of the general assembly, we've provided over $200 million of customer arrears forgiveness to assist families and businesses in overcoming financial difficulties caused by the pandemic. Third, we've invested over $300 million in CCRO-eligible projects, including our offshore wind test project, which is the first operational wind turbines built in federal waters in the United States. Finally, our filing reports a regulatory return that aligns closely to our authorized ROE plus the 70 basis point collar. Inclusive of arrears forgiveness, this financial result warrants neither refund nor a change to revenues. 
While offshore wind and the triennial review are understandably areas of focus, we'd be remiss if we didn't also highlight the blocking and tackling we're doing to advance other very material growth investments and their associated regulatory processes for the benefit of our customers, communities and the environment. Since our last update, we received our fourth consecutive regulatory approval for investments in utility-owned rider recoverable solar projects. We've now surpassed 1,000 megawatts of Dominion Energy-owned solar generation in service in Virginia, and there is a lot more to come. In fact, our pipeline of company-owned solar projects in Virginia under various stages of development currently totals nearly 4,000 megawatts, which gives us great confidence in our ability to achieve the solar capacity targets set forth in Virginia law and which support our long-term growth capital plans. 
In the very near term, about 25 days to be specific, we'll make our next and largest to date clean energy submission. We expect the filing to include as many as 1,100 megawatts of utility-owned and PPA solar, roughly consistent with the 65-35 split identified in the Virginia Clean Economy Act.  It will also include around 100 megawatts of battery storage, including 70 megawatts of utility-owned projects. Taken together, the filing will represent as much as $1.5 billion of utility-owned and rider-eligible investment, further derisking our growth capital guidance provided on our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. 
Next, the State Corporation Commission  approved our inaugural renewable portfolio standard development plan and rider filings. This annual accounting is mandated under the VCEA and provide a status update on the company's progress towards meeting both near- and long-term requirements under the state's RPS targets. We received commission approval for our Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI, rider filing. Under state law, Virginia has joined with other RGGI states to promote a marketplace for emissions credits with the goal of significantly reducing greenhouse gases over time, and this approval allows for timely recovery of our cost of compliance. 
Next, we received authorization from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to extend the life of our 2 nuclear units at the Surry power station for an additional 20 years. These units currently provide around 45% of the state's zero carbon generation and under this authorization will be upgraded to continue providing significant environmental and economic benefits for many years to come. We expect to file for rider cost recovery associated with license renewal capital investment later this year. 
And last but not least, progress on our grid's transformation plans. Our first phase covering 2019 through 2021 is well underway, and we recently filed our Phase II plan with Virginia regulators covering the years 2022 and '23. The second phase includes approximately $669 million in capital investment, which is needed to facilitate and optimize the integration of distributed energy resources while continuing to address the reality that reliability and security are vital to our company and its customers. We expect the final CPCN order around the end of the year. 
Our customers and our policymakers have made it abundantly clear. They want cleaner energy, and they want it delivered safely, reliably and affordably. We're therefore very pleased to be executing on that vision on multiple fronts while extending the track record of constructive regulatory outcomes to the benefit of all stakeholders. 
Turning now to our gas distribution business. We're leading the industry in initiatives to reduce the carbon footprint of our essential natural gas distribution services. Our efforts include modifications to our operating and maintenance procedures, systemic pipeline and other aging infrastructure replacement, third-party damage prevention, piloting applications for hydrogen blending, producing and promoting the use of carbon-beneficial renewable natural gas and offering innovative customer programs. 
For example, in Utah, we're seeking approval for a program that would enable customers to purchase voluntary carbon offsets. For around $5 per month on a typical residential bill, customers that opt into the program will offset the carbon impact of their gas distribution use. This program, which like our existing GreenTherm program, allows customers to make choices about how to manage and lower their individual carbon profiles is just one way we're reimagining how gas distribution service intersects with an increasingly sustainable energy future. 
Along those lines, our hydrogen blending pilot in Utah is performing in line with expectations, and we're in the planning stages of expanding the pilot to test communities. We filed for a similar blending pilot in North Carolina and are evaluating appropriate next steps for blending in our Ohio system. 
And as it relates to our already industry-leading renewable natural gas platform, we're pleased to announce an expansion of our strategic alliance with Vanguard Renewables. As a result, we expect to grow our dairy RNG portfolio from 6 projects in 5 states to 22 projects in 7 states through the second half of the decade and enhance our development pipeline with specific projects towards our aspirational goal of investing up to $2 billion by 2035. Our current pipeline of projects will result in an estimated annual reduction of 5.5 million metric tons of CO2e, which is the equivalent to removing 1.2 million cars from the road. 
Turning now to South Carolina. On July 21, the South Carolina Public Service Commission with the support of all parties unanimously approved the proposed comprehensive settlement in the pending General Electric rate case. We appreciate the collaborative approach among the parties over the last 6 months, which allowed us to produce this agreement that provides significant customer benefits, as shown on Slide 14; supports our ability to continue providing safe, reliable, affordable and increasingly sustainable energy; and aligns with our existing consolidated financial earnings guidance. Further, the approval allows all parties to turn the page and focus on South Carolina's bright energy future. 
It's also worth noting that the commission also recently approved our modified IRP, which favors a plan that would result in the retirement of all coal-fired generation in our South Carolina system by the end of the decade. While the IRP is an informational filing and does not provide approval or disapproval for any specific capital project, we look forward to continuing to work with stakeholders, including the commission, to drive towards an increasingly low carbon future. 
Before I summarize these prepared remarks and open the line for your questions, I'd like to recognize 3 interrelated organizational changes we announced yesterday that will affect our team and our Investor Relations efforts. First, Senior Vice President, Craig Wagstaff, who's provided over 10 years of exemplary leadership for our gas utility operations in Utah, Idaho and Wyoming, will be retiring early next year. And I can say definitively on behalf of all of our colleagues, he will be sorely missed. Craig joined Questar Corp. in 1984, and we have benefited greatly from his contributions since the Dominion Energy-Questar merger in 2016. Best wishes to Craig and his family on his retirement. 
We ask Steven Ridge, our current Vice President of Investor Relations, to relocate to Salt Lake City and, effective October 1, assume the role of Vice President and General Manager for our Western natural gas distribution operations. Steven has been a valuable member of our IR efforts over the last nearly 4 years. And I think he's got to know most of you pretty well. We have every confidence in his ability to follow Craig's long-standing example of serving our Utah, Wyoming and Idaho customers and communities well. 
And finally, David McFarland, who's been working on our Investor Relations team since October of last year, will assume responsibility for our IR efforts as Steven transitions into his new role later this year. We congratulate David on this new opportunity. Our investors should expect no change to our aim to provide consistently a high level of responsiveness and accuracy they've grown to expect from our current IR team. 
With that, let me summarize our remarks on Slide 15. Our safety performance year-to-date is on track to improve upon last year's record-setting achievement. We reported our 22nd consecutive quarterly result, normalized for weather, meets or exceeds the midpoint of our guidance range. We affirmed our existing annual and long-term earnings guidance and our dividend growth guidance. We're focused on executing across project construction and achieving regulatory outcomes that serve our customers well, and we're aggressively pursuing our vision to become the most sustainable regulated energy company in America. With that, we're ready to take your questions."

So we'll obviously be watching as it makes its way through the process, pay attention to how the details get work out -- worked out for appropriations if the bill passes. 
A couple of specifics. We're very much in favor of support for R&D on clean technologies like hydrogen, small modular reactors. Those are things that we're focused on. And to the extent that there's broad-based support that allow a commercialization in a way that can be quick and customer beneficial, we think that's very important and certainly something that we support. And obviously, clean energy manufacturing tax credits, which can help enable U.S. renewable supply, particularly offshore wind and solar, we think, are really valuable. So we're very much engaged in Washington and participating in the process. We like the direction that it's going. Details yet to come, but we think there are some real possibilities there."

And we would expect, as in any rate proceeding, that there's going to be a wide variety of approaches and positions taken by the parties. We'll obviously know more, as you said in the question, early September we'll hear from interveners. And then a couple of weeks later, we'll hear from the staff. So we'll get a sense then, but it's a rate case covering a 4-year period and then setting rates going forward with the guardrail you mentioned. So I wouldn't be surprised if we see a pretty wide variety of opinions expressed by the parties. 
But if you take a step back and just think about the bigger picture here in that case, we have rates below national regional averages. Our performance of our utility is outstanding on the generation and the wire side. And we're reducing our emissions and improving -- reducing our impact on the environment. And so that's a pretty good place to be in a rate case. So we feel very good about that. 
As to T2, that's obviously -- we're only a few months into the period that is going to be reviewed for T2. So a lot of details yet to go on the second triennial. But the tools that are in the toolbox, like the customer credit reinvestment offset will be available to us in triennial 2. And then as we pointed out in our prepared remarks, and as we've noted for some time, as we move forward in this plan, the portion of our earnings that come from Virginia base as opposed to the rest of the business and, in Virginia, in particular, the riders, decreases as a percentage of the overall amount. So I think those are important considerations to keep in mind. Obviously, a long ways to go between now and triennial 2. But we've got tools in the toolbox and the percentage of our earnings affected by triennial 2 as compared to the rest of the company will continue to decrease."

So last time, bear in mind, I think about $200 million of capital got approved in the filing last time, but some things have changed since that last filing. The most significant one is that the Virginia Clean Economy Act has passed, and we now have an obligation to seek approval for a substantial amount of renewables over the course of the next 1.5 decades, solar, offshore wind, storage, all of that. And we're going to need to modify the grid in order to make sure that we keep operating in that environment. And that's what we told the commission in that filing. Things like distributed energy resource management system will be incredibly important in this new world that we're moving into. 
So the Clean Economy Act is different. That didn't exist when we filed last time. Obviously, we also have the benefit of what we heard from the commission and the order on the last filing, and we can target and we have targeted what we're doing with this most recent filing based on precisely what they told us last time. And then some of this filing is continuation of programs that they did approve last time. As I mentioned, they approved $200 million of capital in the last filing. So all of those factors lead us to believe that we should have a lot of confidence in that filing. We'll hear, as I said in the opening, around the end of this year, but it's a strong filing. It's important for us as we integrate additional renewables to make sure that we operate the system well."

Sure. Good morning, Jeremy. Diane Leopold here. So as Bob outlined in his prepared remarks, we really see RNG as a great way to intersect the essential gas service that we provide in reliable and affordable means to our customers in all of our states with our local gas distribution companies and enhanced sustainability. So while this is a very early phase of development with renewable natural gas that we have been on the path on for the last several years, we decided in our investments to focus on agricultural RNG, so our swine and our dairy partnerships. And the reason we did that is because we believe that was the most carbon-negative, carbon-beneficial means to capture methane and repurpose that waste stream for a more environmentally friendly use. 
So when it comes to the actual investment side of it, we now already have between, both partnerships, one project in service, which happens to be a swine project and 5 projects under construction and several more under construction by year-end. So as we were looking at our Vanguard partnership, we were really moving forward with development of a lot of prospects at a good rate, and we saw enough interest in the demand for this renewable natural gas, multiyear contracts with customers that are interested in ensuring a source of supply for their sustainability targets. 
So we're really looking to develop these projects in the short to medium term for these customers. It could be the transportation market. It could be other local distribution companies. It could be thermal industrial users. And then long term, look to our regulated gas customers to help them lower their carbon footprint. So we're working with stakeholders and regulators and policymakers towards that goal. And the green therm programs in Utah, and we've already asked for in North Carolina is just one step in that path to try to move the renewable natural gas towards our regulated customers."

I know there's some competition for utility investors attention this morning, a couple of competing calls in this time slot. So thank you for joining our call, and we promise to keep our call today somewhat brief. 
Before I report on our strong quarterly financial results, I'm going to start with a recap of our compelling investment proposition and highlight our focus on the consistent execution of our repositioned strategy. We expect to grow earnings per share 6.5% per year through at least 2025 supported by a $32 billion 5-year growth capital plan. As outlined on our fourth quarter call in February, over 80% of that capital investment is emissions reduction enabling and over 70% is rider recovery eligible. 
We offer a nearly 3.5% yield and expect dividends per share to grow 6% per year based on a target payout ratio of 65%. Taken together, Dominion Energy offers an approximately 10% total return premised on a pure-play, state-regulated utility profile, operating in premier regions of the country. More on that last theme in a minute. Our industry-leading ESG positioning includes the largest regulated decarbonization investment opportunity in the nation, which, as you'll hear in today's prepared remarks, is steadily transforming from opportunity to reality. 
Turning now to earnings. Our second quarter 2021 operating earnings, as shown on Slide 4, were $0.76 per share, which included $0.01 hurt from worse than normal weather in our utility service territories. Both actual results and weather-normalized results of $0.77 were above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance range. So this is our 22nd consecutive quarter, so 5.5 years now, of delivering weather-normal quarterly results that meet or exceed the midpoint of our quarterly guidance range. Note that our second quarter and year-to-date GAAP and operating earnings, together with comparative periods, are adjusted to account for discontinued operations, including those associated with our gas transmission and storage assets. 
Second quarter GAAP earnings were $0.33 per share and reflect the mark-to-market impact of economic hedging activities, unrealized changes in the value of our nuclear decommissioning trust funds,  the contribution from Questar pipeline, which will continue to be accounted for as discontinued operations until divested and other adjustments. A summary of all adjustments between operating and reported results is, as usual, included in Schedule 2 of our earnings release kit. 
Turning now to guidance on Slide 5. As usual, we're providing a quarterly guidance range which is designed primarily to account for variations from normal weather. For the third quarter of 2021, we expect operating earnings to be between $0.95 and $1.10 per share. We are affirming our existing full year and long-term operating earnings and dividend growth guidance as well. No changes here from prior communications. 
For the first half of the year, weather-normal operating EPS of $1.86 represents approximately half of our full year guidance midpoint. So we are tracking nicely in line with our expectations. We'll provide our formal fourth quarter earnings guidance, as is typical, on our next earnings call, but let me provide some commentary on the implied cadence of our earnings over the second half of the year. 
While Q3 guidance is roughly in line with weather-normal results from a year ago, we will see a multitude of small year-over-year helps in Q4, such as normal course regulated rider growth, the impact of the South Carolina electric rate settlement, strengthening sales, modest margin help, including -- from Millstone, continued expense management and tax timing that combined will help us to deliver solid second half results. We continue to be very focused on extending our track record of achieving weather-normal results, at least equal to the midpoint of our guidance on both a quarterly and annual basis. 
Turning now to a couple of macro items. First, overall electric sales trends. In Virginia, weather-normalized sales increased 1.2% year-over-year in the second quarter and 3.2% in South Carolina. In both states, increased usage from commercial and industrial segments overcame declines among residential users, as the stay-at-home impact of COVID waned, some context on that.  You'll recall that demand in DOM zone last year was despite the pandemic pretty resilient due to robust residential and data center demand. 
So it's not surprising to see South Carolina's relatively higher growth in Q2, given the larger toll COVID had on sales there last year. We're encouraged by the strong return of commercial and industrial volumes in South Carolina in the second quarter. And looking ahead, we expect electric sales growth in our Virginia and South Carolina service territories to continue to a run rate of 1% to 1.5% per year, so similar to what we were observing pre pandemic. 
Next, let me discuss what we're seeing around input prices. As discussed on last quarter's call, we're continuing to monitor raw material costs. And it seems to be the case across a number of industries right now, we're observing higher prices, although we have seen a moderation in the upward pressure over the last few months, especially in steel. Despite these cost pressures, as it relates to offshore wind, in particular, we remain confident in our ability to deliver that project in line with our previously guided levelized cost of energy range of $80 to $90 per megawatt hour. 
On the solar side, we're seeing, again, what others seem to be seeing, supply is tight, and prices for steel, poly and glass are up, but our 2021 projects remain on track with most material now already on site. We're beginning to see moderation in pricing and relief from modest shipping constraints, which bodes well, we expect, for our post-2021 projects. So again, we're watching but no material financial impacts at this time. 
Let me address a few additional topics on Slide 6. First, Questar pipeline. Last month, Dominion Energy and Berkshire Hathaway Energy mutually agreed to terminate our planned sale of Questar pipeline as a result of ongoing uncertainty associated with the timing and the likelihood of ultimately achieving Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance. 
A few thoughts here. First, though we obviously felt that a timely clearance to closing was the logical outcome given the facts and circumstances surrounding that transaction, we did build into the original Berkshire sale contract, the flexibility to easily accommodate a termination if needed. Second, we are already at a reasonably advanced stage of an alternate competitive sale process for Questar Pipeline with expected closing by the end of this year. Third, its termination has no impact on the sale of the gas transmission storage assets to Berkshire, which we successfully completed back in November of last year and which represented approximately 80% of the originally announced transaction value. And finally, neither this termination nor the outcome of the ongoing sale process impacts Dominion Energy's existing financial guidance. As mentioned, Questar pipeline will continue to be accounted for as discontinued operations excluded from the company's calculation of operating earnings.
Briefly, on credit, we've continued to deliberately enhance our qualitative and quantitative credit measures. Last month, we were pleased to see Fitch upgrade Dominion Energy South Carolina's credit rating from BBB+ to A-. Fitch cited both improved regulatory relationships, including the unanimous approval of the General Electric rate case settlement, which Bob will discuss in some more detail, as well as good balance sheet management. 
So let me turn now to a couple of ESG-related topics. In June, we announced the successful syndication of sustainability-linked credit facilities totaling $6.9 billion, and we very much appreciate the efforts and support of all the banks who work with us on what we view as a very interesting new type of financing. 
The $6 billion master credit facility links pricing to achievement of annual renewable electric generation and diversity and inclusion milestones. And the $900 million supplemental facility presents a first-of-its-kind structure where pricing benefits accrue for draws related to qualified environmental and social spending programs. So in other words, going forward, if we meet or exceed our quantifiable goals in these areas, our borrowing costs decline. And of course, the opposite is also true. If we fail to meet our goals, we pay more. But [ through ] this financing, we're very much putting our money where our mouth is when it comes to ESG performance. And we're looking for more ways to deploy green capital raises as we execute on our fixed income financing plan during the balance of the year. 
In July, we issued an updated and comprehensive climate report, which reflects the task force on climate-related financial disclosures, or TCFD, methodology. We are just one of 6 U.S. electric utilities that have pledged formal support for TCFD. As described in the report, which is available on our website, we have modeled several potential pathways to achieve net zero emissions across our electric and gas business that reflect 1.5-degree scenario and are consistent with the Paris Agreement on climate change. The climate report shows we are a leader in both greenhouse gas emission reductions over the last 15 years and in our commitment to transparent progress towards our goal of net zero emissions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

I'll begin my prepared remarks by commenting on our safety performance. As shown on Slide 7, I'm very pleased that our results over the first 2 quarters of this year surpassed even our record-setting results from last",2384,"Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin my prepared remarks by commenting on our safety performance. As shown on Slide 7, I'm very pleased that our results over the first 2 quarters of this year surpassed even our record-setting results from last year. Our safety performance matters immensely to our more than 17,000 employees, to their families and to the communities we serve, which is why it matters so much to us and why it's our first core value. 
Turning to Slide 8. I often describe our pure-play state-regulated strategy as centering around 5 premier states, all of which share the philosophy that a common sense approach to energy policy and regulation puts a priority on safety, reliability, affordability and, increasingly, sustainability. 
We were pleased that CNBC's list of America's Top States for Business ranked Virginia, North Carolina and Utah as 1, 2 and 3, respectively, a podium sweep for 3 of our 5 primary jurisdictions with a fourth major service territory, Ohio, also ranking in the top 10. This is the second consecutive #1 ranking for Virginia. Obviously, an assessment of this variety is just one of several possible ways to evaluate state-specific business environments, but we're pleased with the independent confirmation of what we observe every day working on the ground in all of our regions. We've strategically repositioned our business around the state-regulated utility model in order to offer investors increased stability, which is further enhanced by our concentration in these fast-growing, constructive and business-friendly states. 
Next, I'd like to highlight the outstanding work done across our operating segments by the women and men of Dominion Energy, who exemplify our core values of safety, ethics, excellence, embracing change and One Dominion Energy. At Gas Distribution, our colleagues have collaborated across our national footprint to share best practices, resulting in a nearly 20% reduction of third-party excavation damage to our underground infrastructure as compared to 2019. Each instance of damage prevention enhances the safety and reliability of our system while also reducing the emissions profile of our operations. 
At Dominion Energy South Carolina, our ability to work in close partnership with state and local officials, combined with our commitment to meet an aggressive time line for electric and gas service delivery, were key to attracting a new $400 million brewery to the state last year. The facility is expected to create 300 local jobs and is one of the largest breweries built in the United States in the last 25 years. Being on time, however, wasn't good enough for our South Carolina colleagues, who safely completed the infrastructure upgrades and installation ahead of an already ambitious schedule. We take pride in examples like this that demonstrate how DESC plays a key role in supporting South Carolina's economic and job growth. 
And in Virginia, despite several days of near-record peak demand in June, our generation colleagues delivered exceptional performance as evidenced by the absence during those periods of any forced outages across our fleet. Our transmission and distribution team members kept the grid operating flawlessly under demanding load conditions while also keeping pace with robust residential connects and remarkable data center demand growth, which continues the trend of robust growth over the last several years with no end in sight. 
I'll now turn to updates around the execution of our growth plan. The 2.6 gigawatt Coastal Virginia offshore wind project received its notice of intent, or NOI, from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management in early July, consistent with the time line we had previously communicated. The issuance of an NOI formally commenced the federal permitting review, which, based on our previously disclosed time line, is expected to take about 2 years. Key schedule milestones are shown on Slide 10. 
Later this year, we'll file our CPCN and rider applications with the Virginia State Corporation Commission. In June, we announced an agreement with Ørsted and Eversource, under which they will charter our Jones Act-compliant wind turbine installation vessel for the construction of 2 offshore wind farms in the Northeast. The vessel remains on track for delivery in late 2023 and will be an invaluable resource to DEV as well as to the growing U.S. offshore wind industry. 
Turning to Slide 11. The Virginia triennial review is currently in discovery phase, and the company is providing timely responses to requests for information, all of which generally conform with what we would reasonably expect during a rate proceeding of this size and complexity. As a reminder, the earnings review applies only to the Virginia base portion of our rate base, which becomes smaller as a percentage of DEV and Dominion Energy during our forecast period. Virginia rider investments like offshore wind, solar, battery storage, nuclear life extension and electric transmission, which are outside the scope of the proceeding, represent the vast majority of the growth at DEV. 
We've provided a summary of our filing position as well as key milestones in the procedural schedule. A few items to reiterate here. First, our filing highlights the compelling value we've provided to customers during the review period of 2017 through 2020. We've delivered safe and reliable service at affordable rates that are well below regional, [ RGGI ] and national averages, all while taking aggressive steps to accelerate decarbonization by pursuing early retirement of fossil fuel and power generation units. Second, at the direction of the general assembly, we've provided over $200 million of customer arrears forgiveness to assist families and businesses in overcoming financial difficulties caused by the pandemic. Third, we've invested over $300 million in CCRO-eligible projects, including our offshore wind test project, which is the first operational wind turbines built in federal waters in the United States. Finally, our filing reports a regulatory return that aligns closely to our authorized ROE plus the 70 basis point collar. Inclusive of arrears forgiveness, this financial result warrants neither refund nor a change to revenues. 
While offshore wind and the triennial review are understandably areas of focus, we'd be remiss if we didn't also highlight the blocking and tackling we're doing to advance other very material growth investments and their associated regulatory processes for the benefit of our customers, communities and the environment. Since our last update, we received our fourth consecutive regulatory approval for investments in utility-owned rider recoverable solar projects. We've now surpassed 1,000 megawatts of Dominion Energy-owned solar generation in service in Virginia, and there is a lot more to come. In fact, our pipeline of company-owned solar projects in Virginia under various stages of development currently totals nearly 4,000 megawatts, which gives us great confidence in our ability to achieve the solar capacity targets set forth in Virginia law and which support our long-term growth capital plans. 
In the very near term, about 25 days to be specific, we'll make our next and largest to date clean energy submission. We expect the filing to include as many as 1,100 megawatts of utility-owned and PPA solar, roughly consistent with the 65-35 split identified in the Virginia Clean Economy Act.  It will also include around 100 megawatts of battery storage, including 70 megawatts of utility-owned projects. Taken together, the filing will represent as much as $1.5 billion of utility-owned and rider-eligible investment, further derisking our growth capital guidance provided on our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. 
Next, the State Corporation Commission  approved our inaugural renewable portfolio standard development plan and rider filings. This annual accounting is mandated under the VCEA and provide a status update on the company's progress towards meeting both near- and long-term requirements under the state's RPS targets. We received commission approval for our Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI, rider filing. Under state law, Virginia has joined with other RGGI states to promote a marketplace for emissions credits with the goal of significantly reducing greenhouse gases over time, and this approval allows for timely recovery of our cost of compliance. 
Next, we received authorization from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to extend the life of our 2 nuclear units at the Surry power station for an additional 20 years. These units currently provide around 45% of the state's zero carbon generation and under this authorization will be upgraded to continue providing significant environmental and economic benefits for many years to come. We expect to file for rider cost recovery associated with license renewal capital investment later this year. 
And last but not least, progress on our grid transformation plans. Our first phase covering 2019 through 2021 is well underway, and we recently filed our Phase II plan with Virginia regulators covering the years 2022 and '23. The second phase includes approximately $669 million in capital investment, which is needed to facilitate and optimize the integration of distributed energy resources while continuing to address the reality that reliability and security are vital to our company and its customers. We expect the final CPCN order around the end of the year. 
Our customers and our policymakers have made it abundantly clear. They want cleaner energy, and they want it delivered safely, reliably and affordably. We're therefore very pleased to be executing on that vision on multiple fronts while extending the track record of constructive regulatory outcomes to the benefit of all stakeholders. 
Turning now to our gas distribution business. We're leading the industry in initiatives to reduce the carbon footprint of our essential natural gas distribution services. Our efforts include modifications to our operating and maintenance procedures, systemic pipeline and other aging infrastructure replacement, third-party damage prevention, piloting applications for hydrogen blending, producing and promoting the use of carbon-beneficial renewable natural gas and offering innovative customer programs. 
For example, in Utah, we're seeking approval for a program that would enable customers to purchase voluntary carbon offsets. For around $5 per month on a typical residential bill, customers that opt into the program will offset the carbon impact of their gas distribution use. This program, which like our existing GreenTherm program, allows customers to make choices about how to manage and lower their individual carbon profiles is just one way we're reimagining how gas distribution service intersects with an increasingly sustainable energy future. 
Along those lines, our hydrogen blending pilot in Utah is performing in line with expectations, and we're in the planning stages of expanding the pilot to test communities. We filed for a similar blending pilot in North Carolina and are evaluating appropriate next steps for blending in our Ohio system. 
And as it relates to our already industry-leading renewable natural gas platform, we're pleased to announce an expansion of our strategic alliance with Vanguard Renewables. As a result, we expect to grow our dairy RNG portfolio from 6 projects in 5 states to 22 projects in 7 states through the second half of the decade and enhance our development pipeline with specific projects towards our aspirational goal of investing up to $2 billion by 2035. Our current pipeline of projects will result in an estimated annual reduction of 5.5 million metric tons of CO2e, which is the equivalent to removing 1.2 million cars from the road. 
Turning now to South Carolina. On July 21, the South Carolina Public Service Commission with the support of all parties unanimously approved the proposed comprehensive settlement in the pending General Electric rate case. We appreciate the collaborative approach among the parties over the last 6 months, which allowed us to produce this agreement that provides significant customer benefits, as shown on Slide 14; supports our ability to continue providing safe, reliable, affordable and increasingly sustainable energy; and aligns with our existing consolidated financial earnings guidance. Further, the approval allows all parties to turn the page and focus on South Carolina's bright energy future. 
It's also worth noting that the commission also recently approved our modified IRP, which favors a plan that would result in the retirement of all coal-fired generation in our South Carolina system by the end of the decade. While the IRP is an informational filing and does not provide approval or disapproval for any specific capital project, we look forward to continuing to work with stakeholders, including the commission, to drive towards an increasingly low carbon future. 
Before I summarize these prepared remarks and open the line for your questions, I'd like to recognize 3 interrelated organizational changes we announced yesterday that will affect our team and our Investor Relations efforts. First, Senior Vice President, Craig Wagstaff, who's provided over 10 years of exemplary leadership for our gas utility operations in Utah, Idaho and Wyoming, will be retiring early next year. And I can say definitively on behalf of all of our colleagues, he will be sorely missed. Craig joined Questar Corp. in 1984, and we have benefited greatly from his contributions since the Dominion Energy-Questar merger in 2016. Best wishes to Craig and his family in his retirement. 
We've asked Steven Ridge, our current Vice President of Investor Relations, to relocate to Salt Lake City and, effective October 1, assume the role of Vice President and General Manager for our Western natural gas distribution operations. Steven has been a valuable member of our IR efforts over the last nearly 4 years and I think has gotten to know most of you pretty well. We have every confidence in his ability to follow Craig's long-standing example of serving our Utah, Wyoming and Idaho customers and communities well.
And finally, David McFarland, who's been working on our Investor Relations team since October of last year, will assume responsibility for our IR efforts as Steven transitions into his new role later this year. We congratulate David on this new opportunity. Our investors should expect no change to our aim to provide consistently a high level of responsiveness and accuracy they've grown to expect from our current IR team. 
With that, let me summarize our remarks on Slide 15. Our safety performance year-to-date is on track to improve upon last year's record-setting achievement. We reported our 22nd consecutive quarterly result, normalized for weather, meets or exceeds the midpoint of our guidance range. We affirmed our existing annual and long-term earnings guidance and our dividend growth guidance. We're focused on executing across project construction and achieving regulatory outcomes that serve our customers well, and we're aggressively pursuing our vision to become the most sustainable regulated energy company in America. With that, we're ready to take your questions."

So we'll obviously be watching as it makes its way through the process, pay attention to how the details get work out -- worked out for appropriations if the bill passes. 
A couple of specifics. We're very much in favor of support for R&D on clean technologies like hydrogen, small modular reactors. Those are things that we're focused on. And to the extent that there's broad-based support that allow a commercialization in a way that can be quick and customer beneficial, we think that's very important and certainly something that we support. And obviously, clean energy manufacturing tax credits, which can help enable U.S. renewable supply, particularly offshore wind and solar, we think, are really valuable. So we're very much engaged in Washington and participating in the process. We like the direction that it's going. Details yet to come, but we think there are some real possibilities there."

So we'll get a sense then, but it's a rate case covering a 4-year period and then setting rates going forward with the guardrail you mentioned. So I wouldn't be surprised if we see a pretty wide variety of opinions expressed by the parties. 
But if you take a step back and just think about the bigger picture here in that case, we have rates below national regional averages. Our performance of our utility is outstanding on the generation and the wire side. And we're reducing our emissions and improving -- reducing our impact on the environment. And so that's a pretty good place to be in a rate case. So we feel very good about that. 
As to T2, that's obviously -- we're only a few months into the period that is going to be reviewed for T2. So a lot of details yet to go on the second triennial. But the tools that are in the toolbox, like the customer credit reinvestment offset will be available to us in triennial 2. And then as we pointed out in our prepared remarks, and as we've noted for some time, as we move forward in this plan, the portion of our earnings that come from Virginia base as opposed to the rest of the business and, in Virginia, in particular, the riders, decreases as a percentage of the overall amount. So I think those are important considerations to keep in mind. Obviously, a long ways to go between now and triennial 2. But we've got tools in the toolbox and the percentage of our earnings affected by triennial 2 as compared to the rest of the company will continue to decrease."

And we're going to need to modify the grid in order to make sure that we keep operating in that environment. And that's what we told the commission in that filing. Things like distributed energy resource management system will be incredibly important in this new world that we're moving into. 
So the Clean Economy Act is different. That didn't exist when we filed last time. Obviously, we also have the benefit of what we heard from the commission and the order on the last filing, and we can target and we have targeted what we're doing with this most recent filing based on precisely what they told us last time. And then some of this filing is continuation of programs that they did approve last time. As I mentioned, they approved $200 million of capital in the last filing. So all of those factors lead us to believe that we should have a lot of confidence in that filing. We'll hear, as I said in the opening, around the end of this year, but it's a strong filing. It's important for us as we integrate additional renewables to make sure that we operate the system well."

Sure. Good morning, Jeremy. Diane Leopold here. So as Bob outlined in his prepared remarks, we really see RNG as a great way to intersect the essential gas service that we provide in reliable and affordable means to our customers in all of our states with our local gas distribution companies and enhanced sustainability. So while this is a very early phase of development with renewable natural gas that we have been on the path on for the last several years, we decided in our investments to focus on agricultural RNG, so our swine and our dairy partnerships. And the reason we did that is because we believe that was the most carbon-negative, carbon-beneficial means to capture methane and repurpose that waste stream for a more environmentally friendly use. 
So when it comes to the actual investment side of it, we now already have between, both partnerships, one project in service, which happens to be a swine project and 5 projects under construction and several more under construction by year-end. So as we were looking at our Vanguard partnership, we were really moving forward with development of a lot of prospects at a good rate, and we saw enough interest in the demand for this renewable natural gas, multiyear contracts with customers that are interested in ensuring a source of supply for their sustainability targets. 
So we're really looking to develop these projects in the short to medium term for these customers. It could be the transportation market. It could be other local distribution companies. It could be thermal industrial users. And then long term, look to our regulated gas customers to help them lower their carbon footprint. So we're working with stakeholders and regulators and policymakers towards that goal. And the green therm programs in Utah, and we've already asked for in North Carolina is just one step in that path to try to move the renewable natural gas towards our regulated customers."

I know there's some competition for utility investors attention this morning, a couple of competing calls in this time slot. So thank you for joining our call, and we promise to keep our call today somewhat brief. 
Before I report on our strong quarterly financial results, I'm going to start with a recap of our compelling investment proposition and highlight our focus on the consistent execution of our repositioned strategy. We expect to grow earnings per share 6.5% per year through at least 2025 supported by a $32 billion 5-year growth capital plan. As outlined on our fourth quarter call in February, over 80% of that capital investment is emissions reduction enabling and over 70% is rider recovery eligible. 
We offer a nearly 3.5% yield and expect dividends per share to grow 6% per year based on a target payout ratio of 65%. Taken together, Dominion Energy offers an approximately 10% total return premised on a pure-play, state-regulated utility profile, operating in premier regions of the country. More on that last theme in a minute. Our industry-leading ESG positioning includes the largest regulated decarbonization investment opportunity in the nation, which, as you'll hear in today's prepared remarks, is steadily transforming from opportunity to reality. 
Turning now to earnings. Our second quarter 2021 operating earnings, as shown on Slide 4, were $0.76 per share, which included $0.01 hurt from worse than normal weather in our utility service territories. Both actual results and weather-normalized results of $0.77 were above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance range. So this is our 22nd consecutive quarter, so 5.5 years now, of delivering weather-normal quarterly results that meet or exceed the midpoint of our quarterly guidance range. Note that our second quarter and year-to-date GAAP and operating earnings, together with comparative periods, are adjusted to account for discontinued operations, including those associated with our gas transmission and storage assets. 
Second quarter GAAP earnings were $0.33 per share and reflect the mark-to-market impact of economic hedging activities, unrealized changes in the value of our nuclear decommissioning trust funds,  the contribution from Questar pipeline, which will continue to be accounted for as discontinued operations until divested and other adjustments. A summary of all adjustments between operating and reported results is, as usual, included in Schedule 2 of our earnings release kit. 
Turning now to guidance on Slide 5. As usual, we're providing a quarterly guidance range which is designed primarily to account for variations from normal weather. For the third quarter of 2021, we expect operating earnings to be between $0.95 and $1.10 per share. We are affirming our existing full year and long-term operating earnings and dividend growth guidance as well. No changes here from prior communications. 
For the first half of the year, weather-normal operating EPS of $1.86 represents approximately half of our full year guidance midpoint. So we are tracking nicely in line with our expectations. We'll provide our formal fourth quarter earnings guidance, as is typical, on our next earnings call, but let me provide some commentary on the implied cadence of our earnings over the second half of the year. 
While Q3 guidance is roughly in line with weather-normal results from a year ago, we will see a multitude of small year-over-year helps in Q4, such as normal course regulated rider growth, the impact of the South Carolina electric rate settlement, strengthening sales, modest margin help, including -- from Millstone, continued expense management and tax timing that combined will help us to deliver solid second half results. We continue to be very focused on extending our track record of achieving weather-normal results, at least equal to the midpoint of our guidance on both a quarterly and annual basis. 
Turning now to a couple of macro items. First, overall electric sales trends. In Virginia, weather-normalized sales increased 1.2% year-over-year in the second quarter and 3.2% in South Carolina. In both states, increased usage from commercial and industrial segments overcame declines among residential users, as the stay-at-home impact of COVID waned, some context on that.  You'll recall that demand in DOM zone last year was despite the pandemic pretty resilient due to robust residential and data center demand. 
So it's not surprising to see South Carolina's relatively higher growth in Q2, given the larger toll COVID had on sales there last year. We're encouraged by the strong return of commercial and industrial volumes in South Carolina in the second quarter. And looking ahead, we expect electric sales growth in our Virginia and South Carolina service territories to continue to a run rate of 1% to 1.5% per year, so similar to what we were observing pre pandemic. 
Next, let me discuss what we're seeing around input prices. As discussed on last quarter's call, we're continuing to monitor raw material costs. And it seems to be the case across a number of industries right now, we're observing higher prices, although we have seen a moderation in the upward pressure over the last few months, especially in steel. Despite these cost pressures, as it relates to offshore wind, in particular, we remain confident in our ability to deliver that project in line with our previously guided levelized cost of energy range of $80 to $90 per megawatt hour. 
On the solar side, we're seeing, again, what others seem to be seeing, supply is tight, and prices for steel, poly and glass are up, but our 2021 projects remain on track with most material now already on site. We're beginning to see moderation in pricing and relief from modest shipping constraints, which bodes well, we expect, for our post-2021 projects. So again, we're watching but no material financial impacts at this time. 
Let me address a few additional topics on Slide 6. First, Questar pipeline. Last month, Dominion Energy and Berkshire Hathaway Energy mutually agreed to terminate our planned sale of Questar pipeline as a result of ongoing uncertainty associated with the timing and the likelihood of ultimately achieving Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance. 
A few thoughts here. First, though we obviously felt that a timely clearance to closing was the logical outcome given the facts and circumstances surrounding that transaction, we did build into the original Berkshire sale contract, the flexibility to easily accommodate a termination if needed. Second, we are already at a reasonably advanced stage of an alternate competitive sale process for Questar Pipeline with expected closing by the end of this year. Third, its termination has no impact on the sale of the gas transmission storage assets to Berkshire, which we successfully completed back in November of last year and which represented approximately 80% of the originally announced transaction value. And finally, neither this termination nor the outcome of the ongoing sale process impacts Dominion Energy's existing financial guidance. As mentioned, Questar pipeline will continue to be accounted for as discontinued operations excluded from the company's calculation of operating earnings.
Briefly, on credit, we've continued to deliberately enhance our qualitative and quantitative credit measures. Last month, we were pleased to see Fitch upgrade Dominion Energy South Carolina's credit rating from BBB+ to A-. Fitch cited both improved regulatory relationships, including the unanimous approval of the General Electric rate case settlement, which Bob will discuss in some more detail, as well as good balance sheet management. 
So let me turn now to a couple of ESG-related topics. In June, we announced the successful syndication of sustainability-linked credit facilities totaling $6.9 billion, and we very much appreciate the efforts and support of all the banks who work with us on what we view as a very interesting new type of financing. 
The $6 billion master credit facility links pricing to achievement of annual renewable electric generation and diversity and inclusion milestones. And the $900 million supplemental facility presents a first-of-its-kind structure where pricing benefits accrue for draws related to qualified environmental and social spending programs. So in other words, going forward, if we meet or exceed our quantifiable goals in these areas, our borrowing costs decline. And of course, the opposite is also true. If we fail to meet our goals, we pay more. But [ through ] this financing, we're very much putting our money where our mouth is when it comes to ESG performance. And we're looking for more ways to deploy green capital raises as we execute on our fixed income financing plan during the balance of the year. 
In July, we issued an updated and comprehensive climate report, which reflects the task force on climate-related financial disclosures, or TCFD, methodology. We are just one of 6 U.S. electric utilities that have pledged formal support for TCFD. As described in the report, which is available on our website, we have modeled several potential pathways to achieve net zero emissions across our electric and gas business that reflect 1.5-degree scenario and are consistent with the Paris Agreement on climate change. The climate report shows we are a leader in both greenhouse gas emission reductions over the last 15 years and in our commitment to transparent progress towards our goal of net zero emissions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

I'll begin my prepared remarks by commenting on our safety performance. As shown on Slide 7, I'm very pleased that our results over the first 2 quarters of this year surpassed even our record-setting results from last",2384,"Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin my prepared remarks by commenting on our safety performance. As shown on Slide 7, I'm very pleased that our results over the first 2 quarters of this year surpassed even our record-setting results from last year. Our safety performance matters immensely to our more than 17,000 employees, to their families and to the communities we serve, which is why it matters so much to us and why it's our first core value. 
Turning to Slide 8. I often describe our pure-play state-regulated strategy as centering around 5 premier states, all of which share the philosophy that a common sense approach to energy policy and regulation puts a priority on safety, reliability, affordability and, increasingly, sustainability. 
We were pleased that CNBC's list of America's Top States for Business ranked Virginia, North Carolina and Utah as 1, 2 and 3, respectively, a podium sweep for 3 of our 5 primary jurisdictions with a fourth major service territory, Ohio, also ranking in the top 10. This is the second consecutive #1 ranking for Virginia. Obviously, an assessment of this variety is just one of several possible ways to evaluate state-specific business environments, but we're pleased with the independent confirmation of what we observe every day working on the ground in all of our regions. We've strategically repositioned our business around the state-regulated utility model in order to offer investors increased stability, which is further enhanced by our concentration in these fast-growing, constructive and business-friendly states. 
Next, I'd like to highlight the outstanding work done across our operating segments by the women and men of Dominion Energy, who exemplify our core values of safety, ethics, excellence, embracing change and One Dominion Energy. At Gas Distribution, our colleagues have collaborated across our national footprint to share best practices, resulting in a nearly 20% reduction of third-party excavation damage to our underground infrastructure as compared to 2019. Each instance of damage prevention enhances the safety and reliability of our system while also reducing the emissions profile of our operations. 
At Dominion Energy South Carolina, our ability to work in close partnership with state and local officials, combined with our commitment to meet an aggressive time line for electric and gas service delivery, were key to attracting a new $400 million brewery to the state last year. The facility is expected to create 300 local jobs and is one of the largest breweries built in the United States in the last 25 years. Being on time, however, wasn't good enough for our South Carolina colleagues, who safely completed the infrastructure upgrades and installation ahead of an already ambitious schedule. We take pride in examples like this that demonstrate how DESC plays a key role in supporting South Carolina's economic and job growth. 
And in Virginia, despite several days of near-record peak demand in June, our generation colleagues delivered exceptional performance as evidenced by the absence during those periods of any forced outages across our fleet. Our transmission and distribution team members kept the grid operating flawlessly under demanding load conditions while also keeping pace with robust residential connects and remarkable data center demand growth, which continues the trend of robust growth over the last several years with no end in sight. 
I'll now turn to updates around the execution of our growth plan. The 2.6 gigawatt Coastal Virginia offshore wind project received its notice of intent, or NOI, from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management in early July, consistent with the time line we had previously communicated. The issuance of an NOI formally commenced the federal permitting review, which, based on our previously disclosed time line, is expected to take about 2 years. Key schedule milestones are shown on Slide 10. 
Later this year, we'll file our CPCN and rider applications with the Virginia State Corporation Commission. In June, we announced an agreement with Ørsted and Eversource, under which they will charter our Jones Act-compliant wind turbine installation vessel for the construction of 2 offshore wind farms in the Northeast. The vessel remains on track for delivery in late 2023 and will be an invaluable resource to DEV as well as to the growing U.S. offshore wind industry. 
Turning to Slide 11. The Virginia triennial review is currently in discovery phase, and the company is providing timely responses to requests for information, all of which generally conform with what we would reasonably expect during a rate proceeding of this size and complexity. As a reminder, the earnings review applies only to the Virginia base portion of our rate base, which becomes smaller as a percentage of DEV and Dominion Energy during our forecast period. Virginia rider investments like offshore wind, solar, battery storage, nuclear life extension and electric transmission, which are outside the scope of the proceeding, represent the vast majority of the growth at DEV. 
We've provided a summary of our filing position as well as key milestones in the procedural schedule. A few items to reiterate here. First, our filing highlights the compelling value we've provided to customers during the review period of 2017 through 2020. We've delivered safe and reliable service at affordable rates that are well below regional, [ RGGI ] and national averages, all while taking aggressive steps to accelerate decarbonization by pursuing early retirement of fossil fuel and power generation units. Second, at the direction of the general assembly, we've provided over $200 million of customer arrears forgiveness to assist families and businesses in overcoming financial difficulties caused by the pandemic. Third, we've invested over $300 million in CCRO-eligible projects, including our offshore wind test project, which is the first operational wind turbines built in federal waters in the United States. Finally, our filing reports a regulatory return that aligns closely to our authorized ROE plus the 70 basis point collar. Inclusive of arrears forgiveness, this financial result warrants neither refund nor a change to revenues. 
While offshore wind and the triennial review are understandably areas of focus, we'd be remiss if we didn't also highlight the blocking and tackling we're doing to advance other very material growth investments and their associated regulatory processes for the benefit of our customers, communities and the environment. Since our last update, we received our fourth consecutive regulatory approval for investments in utility-owned rider recoverable solar projects. We've now surpassed 1,000 megawatts of Dominion Energy-owned solar generation in service in Virginia, and there is a lot more to come. In fact, our pipeline of company-owned solar projects in Virginia under various stages of development currently totals nearly 4,000 megawatts, which gives us great confidence in our ability to achieve the solar capacity targets set forth in Virginia law and which support our long-term growth capital plans. 
In the very near term, about 25 days to be specific, we'll make our next and largest to date clean energy submission. We expect the filing to include as many as 1,100 megawatts of utility-owned and PPA solar, roughly consistent with the 65-35 split identified in the Virginia Clean Economy Act.  It will also include around 100 megawatts of battery storage, including 70 megawatts of utility-owned projects. Taken together, the filing will represent as much as $1.5 billion of utility-owned and rider-eligible investment, further derisking our growth capital guidance provided on our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. 
Next, the State Corporation Commission  approved our inaugural renewable portfolio standard development plan and rider filings. This annual accounting is mandated under the VCEA and provide a status update on the company's progress towards meeting both near- and long-term requirements under the state's RPS targets. We received commission approval for our Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI, rider filing. Under state law, Virginia has joined with other RGGI states to promote a marketplace for emissions credits with the goal of significantly reducing greenhouse gases over time, and this approval allows for timely recovery of our cost of compliance. 
Next, we received authorization from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to extend the life of our 2 nuclear units at the Surry power station for an additional 20 years. These units currently provide around 45% of the state's zero carbon generation and under this authorization will be upgraded to continue providing significant environmental and economic benefits for many years to come. We expect to file for rider cost recovery associated with license renewal capital investment later this year. 
And last but not least, progress on our grid transformation plans. Our first phase covering 2019 through 2021 is well underway, and we recently filed our Phase II plan with Virginia regulators covering the years 2022 and '23. The second phase includes approximately $669 million in capital investment, which is needed to facilitate and optimize the integration of distributed energy resources while continuing to address the reality that reliability and security are vital to our company and its customers. We expect the final CPCN order around the end of the year. 
Our customers and our policymakers have made it abundantly clear. They want cleaner energy, and they want it delivered safely, reliably and affordably. We're therefore very pleased to be executing on that vision on multiple fronts while extending the track record of constructive regulatory outcomes to the benefit of all stakeholders. 
Turning now to our gas distribution business. We're leading the industry in initiatives to reduce the carbon footprint of our essential natural gas distribution services. Our efforts include modifications to our operating and maintenance procedures, systemic pipeline and other aging infrastructure replacement, third-party damage prevention, piloting applications for hydrogen blending, producing and promoting the use of carbon-beneficial renewable natural gas and offering innovative customer programs. 
For example, in Utah, we're seeking approval for a program that would enable customers to purchase voluntary carbon offsets. For around $5 per month on a typical residential bill, customers that opt into the program will offset the carbon impact of their gas distribution use. This program, which like our existing GreenTherm program, allows customers to make choices about how to manage and lower their individual carbon profiles is just one way we're reimagining how gas distribution service intersects with an increasingly sustainable energy future. 
Along those lines, our hydrogen blending pilot in Utah is performing in line with expectations, and we're in the planning stages of expanding the pilot to test communities. We filed for a similar blending pilot in North Carolina and are evaluating appropriate next steps for blending in our Ohio system. 
And as it relates to our already industry-leading renewable natural gas platform, we're pleased to announce an expansion of our strategic alliance with Vanguard Renewables. As a result, we expect to grow our dairy RNG portfolio from 6 projects in 5 states to 22 projects in 7 states through the second half of the decade and enhance our development pipeline with specific projects towards our aspirational goal of investing up to $2 billion by 2035. Our current pipeline of projects will result in an estimated annual reduction of 5.5 million metric tons of CO2e, which is the equivalent to removing 1.2 million cars from the road. 
Turning now to South Carolina. On July 21, the South Carolina Public Service Commission with the support of all parties unanimously approved the proposed comprehensive settlement in the pending General Electric rate case. We appreciate the collaborative approach among the parties over the last 6 months, which allowed us to produce this agreement that provides significant customer benefits, as shown on Slide 14; supports our ability to continue providing safe, reliable, affordable and increasingly sustainable energy; and aligns with our existing consolidated financial earnings guidance. Further, the approval allows all parties to turn the page and focus on South Carolina's bright energy future. 
It's also worth noting that the commission also recently approved our modified IRP, which favors a plan that would result in the retirement of all coal-fired generation in our South Carolina system by the end of the decade. While the IRP is an informational filing and does not provide approval or disapproval for any specific capital project, we look forward to continuing to work with stakeholders, including the commission, to drive towards an increasingly low carbon future. 
Before I summarize these prepared remarks and open the line for your questions, I'd like to recognize 3 interrelated organizational changes we announced yesterday that will affect our team and our Investor Relations efforts. First, Senior Vice President, Craig Wagstaff, who's provided over 10 years of exemplary leadership for our gas utility operations in Utah, Idaho and Wyoming, will be retiring early next year. And I can say definitively on behalf of all of our colleagues, he will be sorely missed. Craig joined Questar Corp. in 1984, and we have benefited greatly from his contributions since the Dominion Energy-Questar merger in 2016. Best wishes to Craig and his family in his retirement. 
We've asked Steven Ridge, our current Vice President of Investor Relations, to relocate to Salt Lake City and, effective October 1, assume the role of Vice President and General Manager for our Western natural gas distribution operations. Steven has been a valuable member of our IR efforts over the last nearly 4 years and I think has gotten to know most of you pretty well. We have every confidence in his ability to follow Craig's long-standing example of serving our Utah, Wyoming and Idaho customers and communities well.
And finally, David McFarland, who's been working on our Investor Relations team since October of last year, will assume responsibility for our IR efforts as Steven transitions into his new role later this year. We congratulate David on this new opportunity. Our investors should expect no change to our aim to provide consistently a high level of responsiveness and accuracy they've grown to expect from our current IR team. 
With that, let me summarize our remarks on Slide 15. Our safety performance year-to-date is on track to improve upon last year's record-setting achievement. We reported our 22nd consecutive quarterly result, normalized for weather, meets or exceeds the midpoint of our guidance range. We affirmed our existing annual and long-term earnings guidance and our dividend growth guidance. We're focused on executing across project construction and achieving regulatory outcomes that serve our customers well, and we're aggressively pursuing our vision to become the most sustainable regulated energy company in America.

And to the extent that there's broad-based support that allow a commercialization in a way that can be quick and customer beneficial, we think that's very important and certainly something that we support. And obviously, clean energy manufacturing tax credits, which can help enable U.S. renewable supply, particularly offshore wind and solar, we think, are really valuable. So we're very much engaged in Washington and participating in the process. We like the direction that it's going. Details yet to come, but we think there are some real possibilities there."

So we'll get a sense then, but it's a rate case covering a 4-year period and then setting rates going forward with the guardrail you mentioned. So I wouldn't be surprised if we see a pretty wide variety of opinions expressed by the parties. 
But if you take a step back and just think about the bigger picture here in that case, we have rates below national regional averages. Our performance of our utility is outstanding on the generation and the wire side. And we're reducing our emissions and improving -- reducing our impact on the environment. And so that's a pretty good place to be in a rate case. So we feel very good about that. 
As to T2, that's obviously -- we're only a few months into the period that is going to be reviewed for T2. So a lot of details yet to go on the second triennial. But the tools that are in the toolbox, like the customer credit reinvestment offset will be available to us in triennial 2. And then as we pointed out in our prepared remarks, and as we've noted for some time, as we move forward in this plan, the portion of our earnings that come from Virginia base as opposed to the rest of the business and, in Virginia, in particular, the riders, decreases as a percentage of the overall amount. So I think those are important considerations to keep in mind. Obviously, a long ways to go between now and triennial 2. But we've got tools in the toolbox and the percentage of our earnings affected by triennial 2 as compared to the rest of the company will continue to decrease."

So last time, bear in mind, I think about $200 million of capital got approved in the filing last time, but some things have changed since that last filing. The most significant one is that the Virginia Clean Economy Act has passed, and we now have an obligation to seek approval for a substantial amount of renewables over the course of the next 1.5 decades, solar, offshore wind, storage, all of that. And we're going to need to modify the grid in order to make sure that we keep operating in that environment. And that's what we told the commission in that filing. Things like distributed energy resource management system will be incredibly important in this new world that we're moving into. 
So the Clean Economy Act is different. That didn't exist when we filed last time. Obviously, we also have the benefit of what we heard from the commission and the order on the last filing, and we can target and we have targeted what we're doing with this most recent filing based on precisely what they told us last time. And then some of this filing is continuation of programs that they did approve last time. As I mentioned, they approved $200 million of capital in the last filing. So all of those factors lead us to believe that we should have a lot of confidence in that filing. We'll hear, as I said in the opening, around the end of this year, but it's a strong filing. It's important for us as we integrate additional renewables to make sure that we operate the system well."

Sure. Good morning, Jeremy. Diane Leopold here. So as Bob outlined in his prepared remarks, we really see RNG as a great way to intersect the essential gas service that we provide in reliable and affordable means to our customers in all of our states with our local gas distribution companies and enhanced sustainability. So while this is a very early phase of development with renewable natural gas that we have been on the path on for the last several years, we decided in our investments to focus on agricultural RNG, so our swine and our dairy partnerships. And the reason we did that is because we believe that was the most carbon-negative, carbon-beneficial means to capture methane and repurpose that waste stream for a more environmentally friendly use. 
So when it comes to the actual investment side of it, we now already have between, both partnerships, one project in service, which happens to be a swine project and 5 projects under construction and several more under construction by year-end. So as we were looking at our Vanguard partnership, we were really moving forward with development of a lot of prospects at a good rate, and we saw enough interest in the demand for this renewable natural gas, multiyear contracts with customers that are interested in ensuring a source of supply for their sustainability targets. 
So we're really looking to develop these projects in the short to medium term for these customers. It could be the transportation market. It could be other local distribution companies. It could be thermal industrial users. And then long term, look to our regulated gas customers to help them lower their carbon footprint. So we're working with stakeholders and regulators and policymakers towards that goal. And the green therm programs in Utah, and we've already asked for in North Carolina is just one step in that path to try to move the renewable natural gas towards our regulated customers."

Let me begin with a recap of our compelling investment proposition and highlight our focus on the consistent execution of our strategy. We expect to grow our earnings per share by 6.5% per year to at least 2025",1476,"Thank you, David. Good morning, everybody. Let me begin with a recap of our compelling investment proposition and highlight our focus on the consistent execution of our strategy. 
We expect to grow our earnings per share by 6.5% per year to at least 2025. Growth that is driven by a $32 billion 5-year growth capital plan. As outlined on our fourth quarter call in February, over 80% of that capital investment is emissions reduction enabling and over decarbonization investment opportunity in the nation, which as you'll hear today, as you will hear here in today's prepared remarks is steadily transforming from opportunity to reality. 
We have quite a few exciting developments related to that transformation to discuss this morning, including the pending updates across our operating segments. Before handing it to Bob for those and other business updates, I'll discuss our third quarter results and related financial topics. 
First, our strong quarterly earnings. Our third quarter 2021 operating earnings, as shown on Slide 4, were $1.11 per share, which for this quarter represented normal weather in our utility service territories. These strong results were slightly above the top end of our quarterly guidance range. Positive factors as compared to last year include growth from regulated investment across electric and gas utility programs, higher electric [indiscernible] which was completed late last year. Negative factors as compared to last year include higher depreciation expense and a return to normal weather. This is our 23rd consecutive quarter, so almost 6 years now, of delivering weather-normal quarterly results that meet or feed the midpoint of our quarterly guidance ranges. Note that our third quarter and year-to-date gap discontinued operations, including those associated with the sale of our gas transmission and storage assets. 
Third quarter GAAP earnings were $0.79 per share [indiscernible] activities. Unrealized [indiscernible] which will continue to be accounted for as discontinued operations until divested a year-end and other adjustments. A summary of all adjustments between operating and reporting results as usual, included in Schedule 2 of the earnings earnings release kit. 
Turning now to guidance on Slide 5. As usual, we're providing a quarterly guidance range, which is designed primarily to account for variations from to be between $0.85 and $0.95 per share. Positive drivers as compared to last year are expected to be normal course regulated rider growth, continued modest strength 
[Audio Gap] 
this narrowed guidance range. We're also affirming long-term operating earnings and dividend growth guidance, no changes here from prior communications. We will, as usual, provide 2022 guidance on our fourth quarter call early in the new year, but we continue to expect the midpoint of our 2022 guidance range to be 6.5% higher than the midpoint of our '21 guidance range. We continue to be very focused on extending our track record of achieving weather-normal results at or above the midpoint of our guidance on both a quarterly and annual basis. 
On Slide 6, we've summarized several important financial milestones achieved since our last call. First, we issued $1 billion in 10-year green bonds at our parent company at a cost of 2.25%. This follows right on the heels of the $6.9 billion in sustainability-linked credit facilities, which we announced on last quarter's call. So a lot of activity in Dominion on these types of innovative financings that support our ESG objectives. Thanks to all who participated in this important offering. And as a reminder,  we'll have additional fixed income issuance at Dominion Energy Virginia, Dominion Energy South Carolina and in our parent company during the remainder of this year. 
In October, we announced the sale of Questar Pipelines to Southwest Gas Holdings. This all-cash transaction was valued at nearly $2 billion, including the assumption of about $430 million of existing debt. Proceeds from the sale will be used primarily to reduce parent-level debt. We very much expect to close by the end of this year, subject only to HSR approval. Obviously, there's quite a bit of press attention currently on some of the dynamics unfolding around various shareholders of Southwest Gas. But I would highlight that there is no early termination mechanism in our purchase and sale agreement. As a reminder, this transaction does not impact Dominion Energy's existing financial guidance this quarter or otherwise. Questar Pipeline has been and will continue to be accounted for as a discontinued operation excluded from our company's calculation of operating earnings. 
Next, as a result of our continued focus on both our capital allocation process and on our corporate credit profile, we've elected to monetize additional value from our investment in Cove Point by financing our stake with an attractive nonrecourse term loan. We've received binding commitments on a $2.5 billion nonrecourse term loan, which is at the entity that holds our 50% noncontrolling equity method investment in the Cove Point facility. Proceeds from this EPS-neutral financing are being used to reduce parent-level debt. Over the past few years, we've been -- we've taken intentional and significant steps to effectuate fundamental change to lower our business risks, to maximize the recycling of capital into our attractive regulated utility businesses and to improve our credit metrics. And this financing is another step along that same path. We expect this nonrecourse recapitalization to be completed by year-end. 
Bigger picture, this financing provides a good opportunity to take a quick look back on the capital flows from that asset at Cove Point. As you will recall, we invested approximately $4 billion in the construction of the Cove Point liquefaction project., And through the combination of prior stake sales and the project financing we're announcing today, we will have monetized well over $6 billion of capital to date, even before accounting for any distribution. 
Turning now to electric sales trends. Weather-normalized sales increased 2.4% year-over-year in the third quarter in Virginia and 1% in South Carolina. In both states, consistent with the trends seen last quarter, we've observed increasing usage from commercial and industrial segment overcoming declines among residential users as the stay-at-home impact of COVID waned. Looking ahead, we continue to expect electric sales growth in our Virginia and South Carolina service territories to continue at a run rate of 1% to 1.5% per year, similar to what we were observing pre-pandemic. So no changes there from prior communication. 
Next, let me discuss what we're seeing around rising natural gas prices as we're hearing a lot about this topic across the industry this quarter. We prioritize our customer rate affordability and implement price mitigation strategies across our businesses in a variety of ways to account for the impact of changes in gas prices. So across our electric and gas utilities, we have very clear-cut pass-through mechanisms for fuel costs. So this is less of an issue as to how the recent price increases may impact earnings if they're sustained, but rather how they'll impact our customer bills, something we obviously care about and we watch very closely. 
So let me share a little bit of color on what measures we have in place to mitigate those kinds of impacts. In our gas distribution service territories, we expect the bill impact of rising fuel prices to be less pronounced than what some recent headlines suggest due to a few things: the proximity of gas resources, our widespread use of storage to offset peak day requirements and the effectiveness of our gas supply hedging strategies. 
In our Western states, our unique state-regulated cost of service gas production also helps customers avoid price spikes. In fact, we estimate that our customers save over $100 million over just a 7-day period during the winter storms experienced last February, thanks to this regulatory structure. 
In our electric service territories, we also have long-standing risk mitigation strategies, including hedging and storage with most fuel costs trued up to customer bills on a delayed basis, a structure which helps to smooth out the bill impact of commodity swings. 
In summary, we certainly don't want to see any increased costs for any of our electric and gas customers. So we'll continue to employ these mitigation measures to keep any increases as muted as possible. But for the avoidance of doubt, we currently don't see any impact on our -- to our decarbonization-focused growth capital investment plan. 
And wrapping up, we'll plan to use our fourth quarter call early next year to provide a comprehensive update and roll forward of capital investment, financial outlook and related disclosures akin to the format of our last fourth quarter earnings call, which we believe was well received. Investors should expect further evidence in support of several fundamental Dominion Energy themes, compelling at earnings and dividend growth, combined with the largest regulated decarbonization opportunity in the industry, and an unyielding focus on extending our track record of successful project regulatory and financial performance. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

The agreement also includes 3 new clean energy programs, a new hydrogen blending pilot, which, like our existing lending pilot in Utah, is part of our goal to be ready to blend hydrogen across our entire gas utility footprint by 2030, a new option to allow our customers to purchase R&G attributes and a new and expanded energy efficiency programs. The settlement is pending commission approval. 
In Utah, we received approval for a program that would enable customers to purchase voluntary carbon offsets. For $5 per month on a typical residential bill, customers who opt into the program will fully offset the carbon impact of their gas distribution use. This program, which like our existing green therm program, allows customers to make choices about how to manage and lower their individual carbon profiles. It's just one example of our gas distribution service intersects with an increasingly sustainable energy future. 
In South Carolina, new rates were effective beginning September 1 after the South Carolina Public Service Commission with the support of all parties unanimously approved the proposed comprehensive settlement in the General Electric rate case. It's also worth noting that in September, we filed an interim update to our modified 2020 IRP. And Resource Plan 8 remains the preferred plan calling for the retirement of all coal-fired generation in our South Carolina system by the end of the decade. 
Turning now to Virginia. Last month, we announced a comprehensive rate settlement agreement in our pending triennial rate case, in conjunction with the State Corporation Commission staff, the Office of Attorney General and other intervener parties. We appreciate the balanced, reasonable and cost-effective approach among the parties, which allowed an agreement which supports continued capital investments in Virginia in order to meet the Commonwealth's clean energy priorities and the needs of customers. Those investments include the development of offshore wind, which I'll touch on in a few minutes, as well as growing one of the leading state-regulated utility solar and battery portfolios in the country. This settlement also provides significant customer benefits, as shown on Slide 9, and supports our existing financial earnings guidance. We're very pleased to be extending the track record of constructive regulatory outcomes to the benefit of all stakeholders. We look forward to a final order likely around the end of the year. 
We'll now move to our clean energy filings in Virginia as shown on Slide 10. In September, we made our largest to date, multi-project clean energy rider approval submission. The filing included about 1,000 megawatts of solar and battery storage, and we expect to receive an order from the FCC in the second quarter of 2022. In October, we filed provider cost recovery for the capital investment associated with extending the lives of our 2 nuclear units at the Surry Power Station and our 2 nuclear units at the North Anna Power Station, each for an additional 20 years. These units will be upgraded to continue providing significant environmental and economic benefits for many years to come. We expect to receive a final order by mid-2022. 
Lastly, we've made progress on our grid transformation plans. We participated in hearings with the commission. And based on our filings and testimony, the SEC staff supports or does not oppose approval for nearly all of our capital requests. We expect a final order late this year. 
Turning to offshore wind, where we have an exciting announcement. Today, we're filing our offshore wind application with the SCC, consistent with the project schedule that we communicated previously. Key project milestones are shown on Slide 11. The filing will outline the important details of our process and costs, including contractor selection and terms, project components, transmission routing, capacity factors and permitting. Due to the importance of today's filing milestone and especially given the sizable volume of information, which will be included in this filing. I'm going to spend a little more time than normal this morning summarizing the important aspects. 
Some background. First, this project represents a viable and needed opportunity for Virginia to achieve its clean energy goals. Once complete in late 2026 and, this project will generate enough clean energy to power up to 660,000 customer homes and avoid as much as 5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually, which is the carbon equivalent of removing more than 1 million cars off the road each year. Further, the project is essential to meeting the policy goals set forth in the VCEA and other legislation mandating the development and deployment of renewable generation resources. Lastly, as contemplated in the VCEA, this investment will be 100% regulated and eligible for rider recovery. As a reminder, capital invested under riders allow for more timely recovery of prudently incurred investments and costs. They're filed and trued up annually in single-issue proceedings. In Virginia, rider recovery mechanisms use a forward-looking test period and allow for construction work in progress, all of which minimizes traditional regulatory lag. 
As outlined on Slide 12, we estimate this project will create hundreds of jobs, hundreds of millions of dollars of economic output and millions of dollars of tax revenue for the state and localities as well as supporting Virginia in becoming a major hub for the burgeoning offshore wind industry in North America. For example, last week, Siemens Gamesa announced plans to establish the first offshore wind turbine blade factory in the United States. The facility, located in Hampton Roads, Virginia, will create new jobs and supply turbine blades to offshore wind projects in Virginia and throughout the North American offshore wind industry. 
Our filing details how we've satisfied the requirements for offshore wind, but let me touch on 3 key tests required for rider cost recovery. First, we've complied with the competitive procurement and solicitation standards for the project. Second, our projected levelized cost of energy, or LCOE, of $87 per megawatt hour is substantially lower than the $125 per megawatt hour maximum established by the VCEA. More on that theme in a moment. And third, the VCEA requires that the project's construction commences prior to 2024 for U.S. income tax purposes or as a plan to enter service prior to 2028. Our project schedule satisfies both milestones. 
The long-term cost to our customers of this project, which we believe is the most important metric for a regulated project of this nature, is $87 per megawatt hour and remains within previously guided levelized cost of energy range of $80 to $90 per megawatt hour. Potential savings realized through future tax legislation could also be passed on to customers. For example, it's still early, but we estimate that further expansion to tax credits benefiting offshore wind would reduce the cost of our customers to $80 per megawatt hour. As we've developed the project to its current stage, we've gained critical insights from 2 primary sources. First, our 12-megawatt pilot project, which consists of the only operating turbines in federal waters, has provided considerable benefit to the development and planning of the full-scale development. For example, the pilot project is providing better information about the wind resources off the coast of Virginia. Initially, we assumed a lifetime capacity factor of 41.5% for the full-scale deployment. After further evaluation of turbine design and wind resources, in addition to the realtime data we've gathered from our test turbines, we've determined that our original assumption was too low. We've revised the lifetime capacity factor to be 43.3%. This is beneficial both for the project as well as our customers because higher generation will result in a lower LCOE. 
Secondly, we've contracted with firms that have significant experience in offshore wind farm design, construction and operations to support the project. When we announced the project in September of 2019, the initial pre-engineering and pre-RFP estimated cost was approximately $8 billion. Since that time, through the process of detailed engineering and most importantly, through competitive solicitations for all components and services, we've now developed a detailed budget of approximately $10 billion. As I've been discussing across several quarterly calls now, the cost increase can be attributed to, among other things, commodity and general cost pressures, which seems to be the case across a number of industries right now; and the completion of the conceptual design phase for the onshore transmission route, which is on through extensive stakeholder engagement with consideration given for resiliency and connection into our existing 500 kV system; as well as to minimize impacts on the surrounding communities, including environmental justice communities, private lands, environment, scenic and historic resources. A summary of the major components of the competitive bidding process are outlined on Slide 14. These 5 major agreements collectively represent about $6.9 billion. The remaining project costs include $1.4 billion for onshore transmission substation facilities and currently projected system upgrades as well as approximately $1.5 billion for other project costs, including contingency. 
The onshore transmission facilities are necessary to interconnect the offshore generation components reliably and to maintain the structural integrity and reliability of the transmission system in compliance with mandatory NERC standards. As we observed within the industry recently, utility systems are only as good as they are resilient. Our decision to connect this project to the 500 kV transmission system meets these goals and provides the best mechanism to ensure that the project's power will be dispersed and used by customers throughout our service territory. We believe the decisions we're making around onshore engineering configurations will result in the best value for customers. 
As it relates to our Geneva-compliant wind turbine installation vessel, construction remains on track with delivery expected in late 2023, and we continue to expect it to be an invaluable resource to the growing U.S. offshore wind industry. 
Turning to Slide 15. Let me discuss how our project cost compares to the other U.S. offshore wind projects. A few observations. First, most of these unregulated or merchant projects remain in the permitting and approval process. For our project, I would note that it's the only state-regulated offshore wind project. We've made considerable progress on development to date and remain on track to complete construction in late 2026. 
Next, these offshore wind projects located up and down the East Coast, obviously differ significantly in their timing or vintage, size and scope. For example, the announced capital cost and expected LCOEs for some projects include the cost for necessary onshore transmission upgrades and interconnections as our budget does, but some do not. And some headlines focused on the year 1 PPA pricing for many of these unregulated or merchant projects without reflecting the full cost and incorporating such factors as pricing escalation, which we incorporate. Regardless, we show here a comparison based on publicly available information, including all such factors, of the levelized cost of energy of those merchant projects to our own regulated project. 
Turning to Slide 16. Let me address customer rates in Virginia, inclusive of our offshore wind project. First, a reminder that between 2008 and 2020, our typical residential customer rate increased on average by less than 1% per year, which is much lower than the average annual inflation over that period of closer to 2%. Second, based on EIA data, our typical customer rate is 17% lower than the national average and 36% lower than other states that like Virginia have joined Reg G. And third, going forward, we see typical residential rates increasing by a compound annual growth rate of around 2.1% through 2035, which is a comprehensive estimate and includes, among other factors, the impact of the decarbonization investment programs like our offshore wind project discussed today. If we move the starting point back to 2008, that rate of increase falls to 1.8%, which is lower than projected inflation for 2021. 
In summary, we continue to be on an unwavering path to meet Virginia's clean energy goals by 2045. And it's incumbent upon us to deliver energy that is safe, reliable, increasingly sustainable and affordable. 
With that, let me summarize our remarks on Slide 17. Our safety performance year-to-date is tracking closely to our record-setting achievement from last year. We reported our 23rd consecutive quarterly result that normalized for weather meets or exceeds the midpoint of our guidance range. We narrowed the range of our 2021 earnings guidance and affirmed our existing long-term earnings and our dividend growth guidance. We're focused on executing on project construction and achieving regulatory outcomes that serve our customers and we're aggressively pursuing our vision to be the most sustainable regulated energy company in America. 
Lastly, we look forward to seeing many of you next week in person at the EEI Financial Conference. With that, we're ready to take your questions."

It's a variety of inputs. And one of the things that we mentioned at the time was we assume that we're going to have constructive regulatory outcomes. And we've had those. We had one in South Carolina and in North Carolina and in this Virginia triennial. All of that is of supportive that 6.5% growth rate. So we were confident at the time we announced it. We remain confident. We think we've executed well on regulatory outcomes. And this most recent triennial settlement is a good example of that. 
The capital, we'll update capital on the fourth quarter call, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks. So the bottom line is we remain as confident in 6.5% as we did when we announced it."

As we said, it'd be in $80 to $90 per megawatt hour range, and we're squarely within that at $87. So you can't focus just on the capital input here on a project like this. You also have to focus on how much electricity is it generating since it's going to be generating more than we had previously assumed. That's what lands that customer impact, right, where we've been talking about in the $80 to $90 range."

In the last, if you look back over the last 15 years or so in Virginia, I think the party in power in the Governor's mansion has changed twice.

What's remained consistent throughout that period is that our company has maintained constructive relationships with members of both parties. And we don't see any reason that, that would change. And the reason is that what has remained also consistent over that period and even before is a bipartisan commitment to economic growth and jobs and the economy in Virginia. And if you look at what Governor-elect [indiscernible] ran on, not surprisingly, given his extensive business background, he ran on a platform of increasing jobs and economic growth. And we obviously support that. We're going to do everything we can to help him achieve the objectives of growing Virginia's economy. We do that by providing reliable electricity, by keeping energy prices affordable. We've done that over the years. That was -- our reliability and affordability were recognized by the FCC staff in the recent triennial review. So we have a track record there. So what I would expect is that Virginia will continue that bipartisan commitment to jobs and economic development. As witnessed in the announcement we talked about in our prepared remarks, the Siemens Gamesa offshore wind blade finishing factory, that was the result of bipartisan work. Both parties deserve credit for that kind of job creation in Tidewater, Virginia. We would expect that that's going to continue going forward."

A couple of quarters ago on this call, we were we were speculating as the impacts of a straight-up corporate rate increase, corporate tax rate increase, so how things have changed. 
But a few thoughts. Hard to say exactly what's going to be in the final version, but it does seem to us that something is going to pass. So we'll see here the next month or 2. We imagine it will include the clean energy tax incentives and the direct pay feature you're talking about. So that kind of thing, an extension of the tax credits and the refundable basis, it's pretty clear that's going to be valuable and will benefit probably both our customers and shareholders, we expect. I mean the incentives are going to reduce the cost of renewables to our customers could accelerate everything we're doing in our clean energy transition and probably provide some pretty nice cash flow features to fund additional capital investment. So it all seems pretty good. Details to come. 
Now in the same package, there's the minimum tax. So not too disturbing for us. We're already a cash taxpayer. Not everybody is. But that's going to be based on GAAP earnings. It doesn't start until '23 as the current proposal. So it's still early. How exactly that's going to work? There's a lot of detail to come. But even that part, we expect, as part of this overall package, we think it's all pretty manageable within our existing financial profile and financial trajectory. So we'll get more clarity over time. Maybe next quarter, we can be talking about facts instead of speculation. But it all looks like it's manageable as a package."

So the increase in the capital cost is one part of the LCOE. The increase in the capital cost on offshore wind, so a couple of things. Keep in mind, that's spread over 6 years. So when we do a 1-year roll forward, it's going to include that 2026 year. Previous version, it went to '25. So that will be included. But keep in mind there are some other gives and takes, some other moving parts in our plan. For example, we announced in our IRP in September that we were undertaking a postponement for further evaluation of a couple of things, like some CTs in Virginia and pump storage projects. So that's not in the current version of the near-term plan. So lot of gives and takes -- puts and takes. We're going to go through all that on the fourth quarter call.

I think that they've evolved to be pretty consistent with what we expected when the project was first announced. So we had a pretty good idea of what will be involved in terms of construction and construction onshore for the electric transmission. There may be some additional benefits probably with onshore electrical because that's going to be given what we had to do to route this and to make sure we're connecting to the 500 kV. That's part of what's driving the overall capital cost being greater. So bigger investment there. More job creation there. But I think the bottom line is this is going to be good for the Hampton Roads economy, good for the Virginia economy. And I think that, that Siemens Gamesa announcement is really important because it starts the process here in Virginia, a state that is very well positioned, given its location on the East Coast, given its port and the access to the port, unobstructed by bridges and the deepwater port, to be a real hub of offshore wind economic activity. We certainly support that. We supported that in working with Siemens Gamesa to put that blade factory here. So the more the better."

This is across both our swine and our dairy projects. All projects are going well, on time, on budget, and we're expecting to keep up that rough pace next year. So that's on the R&D side. On hydrogen, that certainly is at the pilot phase. Our Utah pilot, which was at a training facility in Salt Lake City, is just about complete. And the tests focused on residential and used appliances, leak survey equipment, nitrous oxide emissions, the results of those tests confirm that 5% hydrogen blend would not adversely affect the distribution system. All appliances operated safely. There weren't a lot of changes to -- in the system when the hydrogen was added. So we're still doing a few additional tests. We did increase hydrogen blend up to 10% and still did not see any significant impacts from that testing, but we want to keep doing some more testing on final results with that. So our next steps, we've been looking at several isolated regions on system to do a live test and started the initial design phase. We're meeting with the regulators on our test results and on our planned test. And we'll be meeting with them over the coming months so that we can launch an expanded pilot probably in early 2023. And then finally, as Bob mentioned, North Carolina, we're going to start a similar initial project in North Carolina, subject to commission approval of our settlement."

Let me begin with a recap of our compelling investment proposition and highlight our focus on the consistent execution of our strategy.We expect to grow our earnings per share by 6.5% per year to at least 2025.",1698,"Thank you, David. Good morning, everybody. Let me begin with a recap of our compelling investment proposition and highlight our focus on the consistent execution of our strategy.
We expect to grow our earnings per share by 6.5% per year to at least 2025. Growth that is driven by a $32 billion 5-year growth capital plan. As outlined on our fourth quarter call in February, over 80% of that capital investment is emissions reduction enabling, and over 70% is rider recovery eligible.
We offer a dividend yield of 3.5% and expect dividend per share to grow 6% per year based on a target payout ratio of 65%. Taken together, Dominion Energy offers an approximately 10% total return, premised on a pure-play, state-regulated utility profile, operating in premier regions of the country. Our industry-leading ESG positioning includes the largest regulated decarbonization investment opportunity in the nation, which as you'll hear today -- as you will hear here in today's prepared remarks is steadily transforming from opportunity to reality.
We have quite a few exciting developments related to that transformation to discuss this morning, including the pending settlement of our triennial review and our offshore wind application in Virginia, in addition to other positive updates across our operating segments. 
Before handing it to Bob for those and other business updates, I'll discuss our third quarter results and related financial topics. First, our strong quarterly earnings. Our third quarter 2021 operating earnings, as shown on Slide 4, were $1.11 per share, which for this quarter, represented normal weather in our utility service territories. These strong results were slightly above the top end of our quarterly guidance range. Positive factors as compared to last year include growth from regulated investment across electric and gas utility programs, higher electric sales due to increased usage from commercial and industrial segments, and the impact of the share repurchase completed late last year. 
Negative factors as compared to last year include higher depreciation expense and a return to normal weather. This is our 23rd consecutive quarter, so almost 6 years now, of delivering weather-normal quarterly results that meet or exceed the midpoint of our quarterly guidance ranges. Note that our third quarter and year-to-date GAAP and operating earnings, together with comparative period are adjusted to account for discontinued operations, including those associated with the sale of our gas transmission and storage assets.
Third quarter GAAP earnings were $0.79 per share and reflect the noncash mark-to-market impact of economic hedging activities, unrealized changes in the value of our nuclear decommissioning trust fund. The contribution from Questar Pipeline, which will continue to be accounted for as discontinued operations until divested at year-end, and other adjustments. A summary of all adjustments between operating and reporting results as usual, included in Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit. 
Turning now to guidance on Slide 5. As usual, we're providing a quarterly guidance range, which is designed primarily to account for variations from normal weather. For the fourth quarter of 2021, we expect operating earnings to be between $0.85 and $0.95 per share. Positive drivers as compared to last year are expected to be normal course regulated rider growth, continued modest strengthening of sales from commercial and industrial segment and slight margin help within contracted assets. 
Negative drivers as compared to last year are expected to be a slight catch-up in COVID-deferred O&M and tax timing. Given where we are in the year, we're narrowing our 2021 full year guidance range to $3.80 to $3.90 per share, preserving the same midpoint as our original guidance. Assuming normal weather for the remainder of the year, we expect operating earnings per share for 2021 to be in the upper half of this narrowed guidance range. 
We're also affirming long-term operating earnings and dividend growth guidance, no changes here from prior communications. We will, as usual, provide 2022 guidance on our fourth quarter call early in the new year, but we continue to expect the midpoint of our 2022 guidance range to be 6.5% higher than the midpoint of our '21 guidance range. We continue to be very focused on extending our track record of achieving weather-normal results at or above the midpoint of our guidance on both a quarterly and annual basis. 
On Slide 6, we've summarized several important financial milestones achieved since our last call. First, we issued $1 billion in 10-year green bonds at our parent company at a cost of 2.25%. This follows right on the heels of the $6.9 billion in sustainability-linked credit facilities, which we announced on last quarter's call. So a lot of activity in Dominion on these types of innovative financings that support our ESG objectives. Thanks to all who participated in this important offering. And as a reminder, we'll have additional fixed income issuance at Dominion Energy Virginia, Dominion Energy South Carolina and in our parent company during the remainder of this year. 
In October, we announced the sale of Questar Pipelines to Southwest Gas Holdings. This all-cash transaction was valued at nearly $2 billion, including the assumption of about $430 million of existing debt. Proceeds from the sale will be used primarily to reduce parent-level debt. We very much expect to close by the end of this year, subject only to HSR approval.
Obviously, there's quite a bit of press attention currently on some of the dynamics unfolding around various shareholders of Southwest Gas, but I would highlight that there is no early termination mechanism in our purchase and sale agreement. As a reminder, this transaction does not impact Dominion Energy's existing financial guidance this quarter or otherwise. Questar Pipeline has been and will continue to be accounted for as a discontinued operation excluded from our company's calculation of operating earnings. 
Next, as a result of our continued focus on both our capital allocation process and on our corporate credit profile, we've elected to monetize additional value from our investment in Cove Point by financing our stake with an attractive nonrecourse term loan. We've received binding commitments on a $2.5 billion nonrecourse term loan, which is at the entity that holds our 50% noncontrolling equity method investment in the Cove Point facility. Proceeds from this EPS-neutral financing are being used to reduce parent-level debt. 
Over the past few years, we've been -- we've taken intentional and significant steps to effectuate fundamental change to lower our business risks to maximize the recycling of capital into our attractive regulated utility businesses and to improve our credit metrics. And this financing is another step along that same path. We expect this nonrecourse recapitalization to be completed by year-end. 
Bigger picture, this financing provides a good opportunity to take a quick look back on the capital flows from that asset Cove Point. As you will recall, we invested approximately $4 billion and the construction of the Cove Point Liquefaction project. And through the combination of prior stake sales and the project financing we're announcing today, we will have monetized well over $6 billion of capital to date, even before accounting for any distribution.
Turning now to electric sales trends. Weather-normalized sales increased 2.4% year-over-year in the third quarter in Virginia and 1% in South Carolina. In both states, consistent with the trends seen last quarter, we've observed increasing usage from commercial and industrial segment, overcoming declines among residential users as the stay-at-home impact of COVID waned. Looking ahead, we continue to expect electric sales growth in our Virginia and South Carolina service territories to continue at a run rate of 1% to 1.5% per year, similar to what we were observing pre-pandemic, so no changes there from prior communication. 
Next, let me discuss what we're seeing around rising natural gas prices as we're hearing a lot about this topic across the industry this quarter. We prioritize our customer rate affordability and implement price mitigation strategies across our businesses in a variety of ways to account for the impact of changes in gas prices. So across our electric and gas utilities, we have very clear-cut pass-through mechanisms for fuel costs. 
So this is less of an issue as to how the recent price increases may impact earnings, if they're sustained, but rather how they'll impact our customer bills, something we obviously care about and we watch very closely. So let me share a little bit of color on what measures we have in place to mitigate those kinds of impacts.
In our gas distribution service territories, we expect the bill impact of rising fuel prices to be less pronounced than what some recent headlines suggest due to a few things: the proximity of gas resources, our widespread use of storage to offset peak day requirements and the effectiveness of our gas supply hedging strategies. In our Western states, our unique state-regulated cost of service gas production also helps customers avoid price spikes. In fact, we estimate that our customers save over $100 million over just a 7-day period during the winter storms experienced last February, thanks to this regulatory structure.
In our electric service territories, we also have long-standing risk mitigation strategies, including hedging and storage with most fuel costs trued up to customer bills on a delayed basis, a structure which helps to smooth out the bill impact of commodity swings. In summary, we certainly don't want to see any increased costs for any of our electric and gas customers, so we'll continue to employ these mitigation measures to keep any increases as muted as possible. But for the avoidance of doubt, we currently don't see any impact on our -- to our decarbonization-focused growth capital investment plan.
In wrapping up, we'll plan to use our fourth quarter call early next year to provide a comprehensive update and roll forward of capital investment, financial outlook and related disclosures, akin to the format of our last fourth quarter earnings call, which we believe was well received. Investors should expect further evidence in support of several fundamental Dominion Energy themes, compelling earnings and dividend growth, combined with the largest regulated decarbonization opportunity in the industry and an unyielding focus on extending our track record of successful projects, regulatory and financial performance. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

I'll start, as usual, by commenting on our safety performance. As shown on Slide 7, I'm very pleased that our results over the first 3 quarters of this year are tracking closely to the record-setting OSHA rate that we achieved in 2020. As it",2249,"Thanks, Jim. I'll start, as usual, by commenting on our safety performance. As shown on Slide 7, I'm very pleased that our results over the first 3 quarters of this year are tracking closely to the record-setting OSHA rate that we achieved in 2020. As it relates to our electric utilities, I would note that through the first 3 quarters of this year, we're in the top quartile of performance for the Southeastern Electric Exchange and combined incident rates. In fact, we're #1.
Now I'll turn to updates around the execution of our growth plan, as shown on Slide 8. At Gas Distribution, in North Carolina, we reached a comprehensive settlement with the public staff last month for our gas operations with rates based on a 9.6% ROE to be effective this month and generally in line with our financial plan expectations. The agreement also includes 3 new clean energy programs, a new hydrogen blending pilot, which, like our existing blending pilot in Utah, is part of our goal to be ready to blend hydrogen across our entire gas utility footprint by 2030, a new option to allow our customers to purchase RNG attributes and a new and expanded energy efficiency programs. The settlement is pending commission approval.
In Utah, we received approval for a program that would enable customers to purchase voluntary carbon offsets. For $5 per month on a typical residential bill, customers who opt into the program will fully offset the carbon impact of their gas distribution use. This program, which like our existing green therm program, allows customers to make choices about how to manage and lower their individual carbon profiles. It's just one example of our gas distribution service intersects with an increasingly sustainable energy future.
In South Carolina, new rates were effective beginning September 1 after the South Carolina Public Service Commission with the support of all parties unanimously approved the proposed comprehensive settlement in the General Electric rate case. It's also worth noting that in September, we filed an interim update to our modified 2020 IRP. And resource Plan 8 remains the preferred plan calling for the retirement of all coal-fired generation in our South Carolina system by the end of the decade.
Turning now to Virginia. Last month, we announced a comprehensive rate settlement agreement in our pending triennial rate case, in conjunction with the State Corporation Commission staff, the Office of Attorney General and other intervener parties. We appreciate the balanced, reasonable and cost-effective approach among the parties, which allowed an agreement which supports continued capital investments in Virginia in order to meet the Commonwealth's clean energy priorities and the needs of customers. Those investments include the development of offshore wind, which I'll touch on in a few minutes, as well as growing one of the leading state-regulated utility solar and battery portfolios in the country. 
This settlement also provides significant customer benefits, as shown on Slide 9, and supports our existing financial earnings guidance. We're very pleased to be extending the track record of constructive regulatory outcomes to the benefit of all stakeholders. We look forward to a final order likely around the end of the year.
We'll now move to our clean energy filings in Virginia as shown on Slide 10. In September, we made our largest to date, multi-project clean energy rider approval submission. The filing included about 1,000 megawatts of solar and battery storage, and we expect to receive an order from the SCC in the second quarter of 2022. In October, we filed provider cost recovery for the capital investment associated with extending the lives of our 2 nuclear units at the Surry Power Station and our 2 nuclear units at the North Anna Power Station, each for an additional 20 years. These units will be upgraded to continue providing significant environmental and economic benefits for many years to come. We expect to receive a final order by mid-2022.
Lastly, we've made progress on our grid transformation plans. We participated in hearings with the commission. And based on our filings and testimony, the SEC staff supports or does not oppose approval for nearly all of our capital requests. We expect a final order late this year.
Turning to offshore wind, where we have an exciting announcement. Today, we're filing our offshore wind application with the SCC, consistent with the project schedule that we communicated previously. Key project milestones are shown on Slide 11. The filing will outline the important details of our process and costs, including contractor selection and terms, project components, transmission routing, capacity factors and permitting. 
Due to the importance of today's filing milestone and especially given the sizable volume of information, which will be included in this filing. I'm going to spend a little more time than normal this morning summarizing the important aspects.
Some background. First, this project represents a viable and needed opportunity for Virginia to achieve its clean energy goals. Once complete in late 2026, this project will generate enough clean energy to power up to 660,000 customer homes and avoid as much as 5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually, which is the carbon equivalent of removing more than 1 million cars off the road each year. 
Further, the project is essential to meeting the policy goals set forth in the VCEA and other legislation mandating the development and deployment of renewable generation resources. Lastly, as contemplated in the VCEA, this investment will be 100% regulated and eligible for rider recovery. As a reminder, capital invested under riders allow for more timely recovery of prudently incurred investments and costs. They're filed and trued up annually in single-issue proceedings. In Virginia, rider recovery mechanisms use a forward-looking test period and allow for construction work in progress, all of which minimizes traditional regulatory lag.
As outlined on Slide 12, we estimate this project will create hundreds of jobs, hundreds of millions of dollars of economic output and millions of dollars of tax revenue for the state and localities as well as supporting Virginia in becoming a major hub for the burgeoning offshore wind industry in North America. For example, last week, Siemens Gamesa announced plans to establish the first offshore wind turbine blade factory in the United States. The facility, located in Hampton Roads, Virginia, will create new jobs and supply turbine blades to offshore wind projects in Virginia and throughout the North American offshore wind industry.
Our filing details how we've satisfied the requirements for offshore wind, but let me touch on 3 key tests required for rider cost recovery. First, we've complied with the competitive procurement and solicitation standards for the project. Second, our projected levelized cost of energy, or LCOE, of $87 per megawatt hour is substantially lower than the $125 per megawatt hour maximum established by the VCEA. More on that theme in a moment. And third, the VCEA requires that the project's construction commences prior to 2024 for U.S. income tax purposes or as a plan to enter service prior to 2028. Our project schedule satisfies both milestones.
The long-term cost to our customers of this project, which we believe is the most important metric for a regulated project of this nature, is $87 per megawatt hour and remains within previously guided levelized cost of energy range of $80 to $90 per megawatt hour. Potential savings realized through future tax legislation could also be passed on to customers. For example, it's still early, but we estimate that further expansion to tax credits benefiting offshore wind would reduce the cost of our customers to $80 per megawatt hour. 
As we've developed the project to its current stage, we've gained critical insights from 2 primary sources. First, our 12-megawatt pilot project, which consists of the only operating turbines in federal waters, has provided considerable benefit to the development and planning of the full-scale development. For example, the pilot project is providing better information about the wind resources off the coast of Virginia. Initially, we assumed a lifetime capacity factor of 41.5% for the full-scale deployment. After further evaluation of turbine design and wind resources, in addition to the realtime data we've gathered from our test turbines, we've determined that our original assumption was too low. We've revised the lifetime capacity factor to be 43.3%. This is beneficial both for the project as well as our customers because higher generation will result in a lower LCOE.
Secondly, we've contracted with firms that have significant experience in offshore wind farm design, construction and operations to support the project. When we announced the project in September of 2019, the initial pre-engineering and pre-RFP estimated cost was approximately $8 billion. Since that time, through the process of detailed engineering and most importantly, through competitive solicitations for all components and services, we've now developed a detailed budget of approximately $10 billion. 
As I've been discussing across several quarterly calls now, the cost increase can be attributed to, among other things, commodity and general cost pressures, which seems to be the case across a number of industries right now; and the completion of the conceptual design phase for the onshore transmission route, which has gone through extensive stakeholder engagement with consideration given for resiliency and connection into our existing 500 kV system; as well as to minimize impacts on the surrounding communities, including environmental justice communities, private lands, environment, scenic and historic resources. 
A summary of the major components of the competitive bidding process are outlined on Slide 14. These 5 major agreements collectively represent about $6.9 billion. The remaining project costs include $1.4 billion for onshore transmission substation facilities and currently projected system upgrades as well as approximately $1.5 billion for other project costs, including contingency.
The onshore transmission facilities are necessary to interconnect the offshore generation components reliably and to maintain the structural integrity and reliability of the transmission system in compliance with mandatory NERC standards. As we observed within the industry recently, utility systems are only as good as they are resilient. Our decision to connect this project to the 500 kV transmission system meets these goals and provides the best mechanism to ensure that the project's power will be dispersed and used by customers throughout our service territory. We believe the decisions we're making around onshore engineering configurations will result in the best value for customers.
As it relates to our Jones-Act-compliant wind turbine installation vessel, construction remains on track with delivery expected in late 2023, and we continue to expect it to be an invaluable resource to the growing U.S. offshore wind industry.
Turning to Slide 15. Let me discuss how our project costs compares to the other U.S. offshore wind projects. A few observations. First, most of these unregulated or merchant projects remain in the permitting and approval process. For our project, I would note that it's the only state-regulated offshore wind project. We've made considerable progress on development to date and remain on track to complete construction in late 2026.
Next, these offshore wind projects located up and down the East Coast, obviously differ significantly in their timing or vintage, size and scope. For example, the announced capital cost and expected LCOEs for some projects include the cost for necessary onshore transmission upgrades and interconnections as our budget does, but some do not. And some headlines focus on the year 1 PPA pricing for many of these unregulated or merchant projects without reflecting the full cost and incorporating such factors as pricing escalation, which we incorporate. Regardless, we show here a comparison based on publicly available information, including all such factors, of the levelized cost of energy of those merchant projects to our own regulated project.
Turning to Slide 16. Let me address customer rates in Virginia, inclusive of our offshore wind project. First, a reminder that between 2008 and 2020, our typical residential customer rate increased on average by less than 1% per year, which is much lower than the average annual inflation over that period of closer to 2%. Second, based on EIA data, our typical customer rate is 17% lower than the national average and 36% lower than other states that like Virginia have joined RGGI. 
And third, going forward, we see typical residential rates increasing by a compound annual growth rate of around 2.1% through 2035, which is a comprehensive estimate and includes, among other factors, the impact of the decarbonization investment programs like our offshore wind project discussed today. If we move the starting point back to 2008, that rate of increase falls to 1.8%, which is lower than projected inflation for 2021.
In summary, we continue to be on an unwavering path to meet Virginia's clean energy goals by 2045. And it's incumbent upon us to deliver energy that is safe, reliable, increasingly sustainable and affordable.
With that, let me summarize our remarks on Slide 17. Our safety performance year-to-date is tracking closely to our record-setting achievement from last year. We reported our 23rd consecutive quarterly result that, normalized for weather, meets or exceeds the midpoint of our guidance range. We narrowed the range of our 2021 earnings guidance and affirmed our existing long-term earnings and our dividend growth guidance. We're focused on executing on project construction and achieving regulatory outcomes that serve our customers well and we're aggressively pursuing our vision to be the most sustainable regulated energy company in America.
Lastly, we look forward to seeing many of you next week in person at the EEI Financial Conference. With that, we're ready to take your questions."

We were asked some about it, and we said that there's no obviously one input. We were asked a lot about this triennial at the time. There's no one input to setting a growth rate like that. It's a variety of inputs. And one of the things that we mentioned at the time was we assume that we're going to have constructive regulatory outcomes. 
And we've had those. We had one in South Carolina and in North Carolina and in this Virginia triennial. All of that is of supportive that 6.5% growth rate. So we were confident at the time we announced it. We remain confident. We think we've executed well on regulatory outcomes. And this most recent triennial settlement is a good example of that.
As the capital, we'll update capital on the fourth quarter call, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks. So the bottom line is we remain as confident in 6.5% as we did when we announced it."

It's a huge data dump, so I appreciate that incremental color you provided. The $87 LCOE capital costs are higher. So obviously, you're seeing some cost pressures despite being below the projections and still within the range, right? I think the initial cost, correct me if I'm wrong, was $8 billion. Can you touch on sort of the customer bill impact here as costs are higher, just isolating this project? And it seems that the input cost pressures are kind of widespread. So how do you sort of think about mitigating factors assuming these cost headwinds have some persistency?"

So the cost -- you're right, the capital cost number is that we've estimated earlier, now that we've done all of the competitive bidding process and moved from conceptual to firm contracts has gone up some. But as we mentioned, the production expectation, the capacity factor out of this has also gone up as we've gotten more data, which means that the customer bill impact is the same. 
As we said, it'd be in $80 to $90 per megawatt hour range, and we're squarely within that at $87. So you can't focus just on the capital input here on a project like this. You also have to focus on how much electricity is it generating since it's going to be generating more than we had previously assumed. That's what lands that customer impact, right, where we've been talking about in the $80 to $90 range."

In the last -- if you look back over the last 15 years or so in Virginia, I think the party in power in the Governor's mansion has changed twice. And the Virginia House of delegates, it's changed twice. And the State Senate, it's changed several times. The Senate wasn't up for election this time. It was the governor and House of Delegates. 
What's remained consistent throughout that period is that our company has maintained constructive relationships with members of both parties. And we don't see any reason that, that would change. And the reason is that what has remained also consistent over that period and even before is a bipartisan commitment to economic growth and jobs and the economy in Virginia. And if you look at what Governor-elect Youngkin ran on, not surprisingly, given his extensive business background, he ran on a platform of increasing jobs and economic growth. And we obviously support that. We're going to do everything we can to help him achieve the objectives of growing Virginia's economy. 
We do that by providing reliable electricity, by keeping energy prices affordable. We've done that over the years. That was our reliability and affordability, we're recognized by the SCC staff in the recent triennial review. So we have a track record there. So what I would expect is that Virginia will continue that bipartisan commitment to jobs and economic development. As witnessed in the announcement we talked about in our prepared remarks, the Siemens Gamesa offshore wind blade finishing factory, that was the result of bipartisan work. Both parties deserve credit for that kind of job creation in Tidewater, Virginia. We would expect that that's going to continue going forward."

A lot of commentary on that topic so far this earnings season. I've been listening to some of that. And I agree with -- certainly, the one thing that's come up a lot that it's super hard to speculate on moving target, pending and draft legislation hasn't landed yet. A couple of quarters ago on this call, we were speculating as the impacts of a straight-up corporate rate increase, corporate tax rate increase, so how things have changed.
But a few thoughts. Hard to say exactly what's going to be in the final version, but it does seem to us that something is going to pass. So we'll see here the next month or 2. We imagine it will include the clean energy tax incentives and the direct pay feature you're talking about. So that kind of thing. And extension of the tax credits and the refundable basis, it's pretty clear that's going to be valuable and will benefit probably both our customers and shareholders, we expect. I mean the incentives are going to reduce the cost of renewables to our customers, could accelerate everything we're doing in our clean energy transition and probably provide some pretty nice cash flow features to fund additional capital investment. So it all seems pretty good. Details to come.
Now in the same package, there's the minimum tax. So not too disturbing for us. We're already a cash taxpayer. Not everybody is. But that's going to be based on GAAP earnings. It doesn't start until '23 as the current proposal. So it's still early. How exactly that's going to work? There's a lot of detail to come. But even that part, we expect, as part of this overall package, we think it's all pretty manageable within our existing financial profile and financial trajectory. So we'll get more clarity over time. Maybe next quarter, we can be talking about facts instead of speculation. But it all looks like it's manageable as a package."

We're going to do a 1-year roll forward of our capital plan. And we'll go through everything that's related to that in detail like we did last year, or early this year.
So the increase in the capital cost is one part of the LCOE. The increase in the capital cost on offshore wind, so a couple of things. Keep in mind, that's spread over 6 years. So when we do a 1-year roll forward, it's going to include that 2026 year. Previous version, it went to '25. So that will be included. But keep in mind there are some other gives and takes, some other moving parts in our plan.
For example, we announced in our IRP in September that we were undertaking a postponement for further evaluation of a couple of things, like some CTs in Virginia and pumped storage projects. So that's not in the current version of the near-term plan. So lot of gives and takes -- puts and takes. We're going to go through all that on the fourth quarter call. But for the avoidance of doubt, we expect all those updates are going to be supportive of EPS and dividend growth guidance.

So yes, there's a lot of back and forth, right, in the press. We get that. But we don't see any impact on our transaction. Our agreement is -- intentionally, on both sides, it's air tight. Southwest Gas has fully committed financing. It's not dependent on completing equity issuance or anything like that. There are no conditions other than HSR.

I think that they've evolved to be pretty consistent with what we expected when the project was first announced.

There may be some additional benefits probably with onshore electrical because that's going to be given what we had to do to route this and to make sure we're connecting to the 500 kV. That's part of what's driving the overall capital cost being greater. So bigger investment there. More job creation there.
But I think the bottom line is this is going to be good for the Hampton Roads economy, good for the Virginia economy. And I think that, that Siemens Gamesa announcement is really important because it starts the process here in Virginia, a state that is very well positioned, given its location on the East Coast, given its port and the access to the port, unobstructed by bridges and the deepwater port, to be a real hub of offshore wind economic activity. We certainly support that. We supported that in working with Siemens Gamesa to put that blade factory here. So the more the better."

This is across both our swine and our dairy projects. All projects are going well, on time, on budget, and we're expecting to keep up that rough pace next year. So that's on the RNG side.
On hydrogen, now that certainly is at the pilot phase. Our Utah pilot, which was at a training facility in Salt Lake City, is just about complete. And the tests focused on residential end use appliances, leak survey equipment, nitrous oxide emissions, the results of those tests confirm that 5% hydrogen blend would not adversely affect the distribution system. All appliances operated safely. There weren't a lot of changes to -- in the system when the hydrogen was added. So we're still doing a few additional tests. We did increase hydrogen blend up to 10% and still did not see any significant impacts from that testing, but we want to keep doing some more testing on final results with that. 
So our next steps, we've been looking at several isolated regions on system to do a live test and started the initial design phase. We're meeting with the regulators on our test results and on our planned test. And we'll be meeting with them over the coming months so that we can launch an expanded pilot probably in early 2023. And then finally, as Bob mentioned, our North Carolina, we're going to start a similar initial project in North Carolina, subject to commission approval of our settlement."
