Even though it's late February, I still want to say Happy New Year because I expect that this year will be so much better in so many ways than the last year. At the same time, it's hard to believe that we're only",936,"Thanks, Jason, and good morning, everyone. Even though it's late February, I still want to say Happy New Year because I expect that this year will be so much better in so many ways than the last year. At the same time, it's hard to believe that we're only 7 weeks into 2021 because so much has already happened. It's been very intense in the last 1.5 months. 
And because things are happening so quickly, I think it's a good time to take a moment to review what we, at the Royal Caribbean Group, have been doing over the past year to adjust to the realities of the pandemic in the United States and wherever we sail and wherever we operate around the world. 
As we've summarized on Slide 2, 2020 was an unprecedented year in which our teams took on and accomplished actions that were unthinkable just 12 months ago. I think that there was not one job that stayed the same. In a few months, our teams moved our whole fleet into layup. We patriated more than 45,000 crew members to their hundreds of home countries, restructured our workforce, implemented new credit programs for our guests, took care of our travel agents and raised billions of dollars in new capital, all while working from home. 
It's been incredibly challenging, but everybody seems to worries to the occasion. Now the most important point to keep in mind is that while most of our ships are still sitting idle, and while we suspended most of our global operations through April -- at least to April, our company has also been moving ahead to create the conditions and to prepare for a healthy return to sailing. 
As we continue to navigate this crisis, we've made continued progress on many fronts, as noted on Slide 3. I want to especially speak about how we're engaging with various stakeholders, particularly governments and other actors in the travel industry to ensure that we can ramp up and restart quickly. I'll let Jason talk about the initiatives that we've taken on the finance side. 
First, let me recall what we've accomplished with our Healthy Sail Panel, for medical, public health, maritime, biosecurity and other experts. We've taken their 74 recommendations for a healthy return to service as the basis for over 2,000 separate protocols, from passenger testing before sailing, to physical distancing on board, to disembarkation of COVID symptomatic persons. All of these things will give our guests, our crew and the destinations, the confidence that the environment on the Royal Caribbean, Celebrity, Silversea or TUI Ship is safer than a walk down Main Street. 
We know that we not only need to provide an environment that protects our guests from COVID but also works to protect all of our people from having their vacations disrupted due to an isolated case. At the same time, we have to recognize that the panel's recommendations were intended to address a pre-vaccine environment. A lot has occurred over the last 4 months since their report was submitted. Not the least of which is that we're regularly vaccinating over 1.5 million people a day here in the United States and many elsewhere as well. And so we continue to work with the panel, led by Governor, Mike Leven and Dr. Scott Gottlieb, to identify the safest pathway forward in the new post-vaccine environment when we can protect our guests and crew as never before. And these conversations and the conclusions we draw from them will inform and advance our dialogue with governments around the world, including the CVC under its new leadership. At the same time, I believe strongly in the power of positive example. And in Singapore, we have a good one on how we can safely resume cruising while giving our guests the fun fill experience they expect. We've been operating that since early December. And even before that, we've had successful operations, which continue now in Germany and Canary Islands, Greece in the Middle East. 
These early returns to service not only provide vacations, but they provide an opportunity to demonstrate proof-of-concept as well. These early cruises provide valuable information about the best way to design and implement our health and safety protocols. They provide important learnings on how we can coordinate most effectively with governments, port authorities, travel partners and others to protect our guest, crew and destinations we visit. These early cruises have also given us the opportunity to design new attractive itineraries where we can better control the experience. 
Now after 11 months of pandemic, I think we all know that COVID fatigue is real. People are clamoring for the opportunity to have experience outside their homes. Every day, we see signs of people want to get out and get away. And once we're able to reopen and restart more broadly, we'll be ready to respond with our best-in-class hardware, including our new buildings, Odyssey of the Seas, Celebrity Apex and Silver Moon and our exclusive private destinations like Perfect Day at Cococay. 
Before I hand off to Jason, I do want to brag on our team just a little bit. Again, the dedication, commitment and the integrity of our employees throughout this very difficult period has been exceptional. And their individual and combined contributions have been extraordinary. I am impressed every day by what they do. 
I also want to give a shout out to our loyal and committed travel partners for their ongoing support and to our investors for their trust. So thank you all. And now I'd like to turn it back over to Jason. Jason?"

This morning, we reported an adjusted net loss of $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020 and a $3.9 billion for the full year. Due to the suspension of our global operations, we were able to operate only 20% of the revenue",1416,"Great. Thank you, Richard. This morning, we reported an adjusted net loss of $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020 and a $3.9 billion for the full year. Due to the suspension of our global operations, we were able to operate only 20% of the revenue cruises initially expected in our February 2020 guidance. This simple stat reflects the staggering impact that the pandemic brought to our company and the whole industry during 2020. 
In the fourth quarter, we were able to reduce our quarterly cruise operating expenses by more than 80% from $1.5 billion in Q4 of 2019 to $265 million in Q4 of 2020. We achieved this by expeditiously laying up our fleet and becoming extremely diligent, disciplined and agile in controlling our costs. Something similar can be said about our general CapEx, which were reduced by approximately 55% between 2020 and 2021.  I am incredibly grateful of the efforts from the entire corporation in managing through the toughest year in our history. 
From a financial standpoint, our top priority remains ensuring that we are in a strong liquidity position. While reducing our cash burn was and still is critical, another crucial liquidity action is accessing capital prudently and opportunistically while also managing our liabilities and our banking partners with our banking partners and export agencies. 
Since we suspended our global cruise operations, we have raised about $9.3 billion in new capital and have secured agreements to defer almost $2 billion of ship-related debt through the spring of 2022. These later efforts are reducing our expected debt maturities for 2021 to approximately $400 million. These successful transactions and negotiations were possible due to the strength of our brands, the relevancy of our product, and the great relationships that were built during decades of collaborative work with banks, shipyards and vendors.  I also want to highlight that this superb outcome was a huge undertaking executed by our amazing finance, legal and accounting teams. 
Now regarding our current liquidity position, we closed -- we closed 2020 fiscal year with $4.4 billion in available liquidity. We remain focused on further improving this position while also managing our operating and capital expenditures to ensure that our family of brands are well positioned for the return to serve. 
I will stress that as we return to service and stabilize our operations, our cash flow will be primarily driven -- our cash will be the primary driver to delever our balance sheet, return to investment-grade and create great shareholder value. 
As it pertains to our cash spend for the fourth quarter -- or during the fourth quarter, we spent approximately $1.3 billion, which includes the payment of approximately $300 million of bond that matured in November and approximately $180 million from collateral postings, commissions and financing fees. When excluding these, our average cash earn rate was on the lower end of our previously announced range, driven by the phenomenal diligence of our teams and some timing. Furthermore, this morning, we reaffirmed that the cash burn will be on average in the range of approximately $250 million to $290 million per month doing a prolonged suspension of operations. 
Over the last year, we have executed several measures to structurally reduce our cost base, realign our capital allocation and improve our scale and margins. Besides reducing our G&A expenses and streamlining procurement efforts, we successfully divested 3 of our oldest ships and entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Azamara brand. Reshaping our fleet efficiency and the corporation cost structure will help accelerate our margins by improving our operating leverage as we return to service. 
I will highlight that when we return to service and start to rev up our sales, we expect that customer deposits and cash flows from operations will further improve our cash position. At the same time, ramping up our business will also include start-up costs that relate to accruing our ships, health and safety protocols and increased sales and marketing activities. 
Because the environment is still very fluid, we are not able to provide further guidance or commentary on these figures. 
I will now provide an update on the booking environment and our capacity. While bookings remain below historical levels, we have been constantly impressed and humbled with a number of cruises booked throughout this extended out-of-service period. It's clear that a lot of people want to cruise. And we can't wait to welcome them back on board, our amazing brands and ships. 
Clearly, 2021 is not going to be a traditional year. And to this end, we did not plan for a traditional wave season. And therefore, our sales and marketing activities still remain anemic and extremely strategic. Currently, we don't expect to broadly ramp up our marketing until more ships come back into operation. Despite the lack of marketing spend, we have seen a 30% increase in new bookings since the beginning of the year when compared to November and December. 
Our Lift & Shift in future cruise credit programs have been very successful in both preserving cash and driving demand for future periods. Having said this, I will highlight that from a cumulative standpoint, almost 75% of our book business is new and not related to rebooking activities. The cumulative book position for sailings in the second half of 2021 is aligned with our expectations in terms of resumption of cruising with pricing higher than 2019, both including and excluding the dilutive impact of future cruise credits. 
It is probably too early in the booking window to talk too much about 2022, but behavior to date is quite similar to booking activities in previous years. Our book position for the first half of 2022 is within historical ranges at higher average prices. As I noted, we are not expecting a traditional wave season. However, we did see a similar increase in 2022 bookings over the past 6 weeks to increases seen in prior years. We think that this is a very encouraging stat given our muted sales and marketing efforts. 
Regarding our deployment, we are not ready to announce any specific surrounding the cadence with which we will be bringing our fleet back into service. Currently, we have canceled sailings on most of our ships through the end of April. Our brands operate in multiple markets around the globe therefore, the timing and pace of the ramp-up in capacity will likely vary by region based on local conditions. We are already operating Quantum of the Seas in Singapore, and our second shift in the water could also be outside of the U.S. 
We're also using the learnings from Singapore as well as from our TUI Cruises joint venture. Who has had ship sailing in Europe and the Canary Islands since August and November, which is helping us inform on how the ships will return to service. 
Our customer deposit balance at the end of December 2020 was $1.8 billion. This is relatively equal to the balances reported both at the end of September and at the end of June. We were able to maintain a similar customer deposit balance for 6 months despite the suspension of approximately 1,100 sailings because of the deposits collected on new bookings and the success of our future crews certificates and Lift & Shift options. 
Just over half the guests who booked -- who were booked on canceled sailings have requested a cash refund, with the other half either holding an FCC or Lift & Shifting their booking to our future crews. Also, approximately half of our customer deposit balance is associated with FCCs, and moreover, about 30% of the overall balance is nonrefundable. 
As it pertains to our expectations for 2021, I will note that the timing and trajectory of the recovery remains uncertain, and we are, therefore, unable to provide further guidance for the year. We do expect, however, to incur a net loss on both the U.S. GAAP and an adjusted basis for the first quarter and the full year of 2021. 
The magnitude of the loss will depend on many factors, including the timing and extent of our return to service. I will close my remarks by saying that we are clearly focused on what we can control. But as the vaccine distribution continues to accelerate, travel restrictions and advisories begin to ease and customer confidence begins to grow, we feel very optimistic about the future. 
With that, I will ask our operator to open up the call for a question-and-answer session. Shelby?"

And so they're trying to eye out when we're going to return to service, and they're going to be able to go and enjoy the vacations that they had previously planned. And so I think when you look at the first half of 2022, again, it's very, very early, the pricing that we're seeing relative to like-for-like for '19 shows that our rates are up with or without any application of future cruise certificates."

The Healthy Sail Panels work and all of those discussions were pre-vaccine and vaccine really does change it. We're really in an interim period where the vaccines are still relatively new. They're coming out amazing",379,"I'll try and answer that. You're right. The Healthy Sail Panels work and all of those discussions were pre-vaccine and vaccine really does change it. We're really in an interim period where the vaccines are still relatively new. They're coming out amazingly quickly, but it still is going to take months to get huge numbers of people vaccinated. And so we and the CDC and governments around the world are looking at how that would change it. And we don't have answers yet. I think one of the things everybody is looking to see is just how effective the vaccines are, and people actually want to see that happening. And one of the nice things we have is we can look at the example of Israel, where the vaccination level is one of the highest in the world. And therefore, they're able to make some very significant statistical correlations. And one of the things that you've seen coming out of there, for example, is that the number of people who get the disease or who have been vaccinated is the efficacy is as high or higher than the trials that were done, and this is now on larger numbers of people. So that makes it even more reliable. 
But more significantly, they're also saying the ability to prevent the disease being serious in people is even better than that. So these are -- in the history of vaccines in the world, these are really exciting kinds of levels that give us all a lot of hope. But we really need to see it in practice, and it's really hard to say while we're not yet at a point where enough people have been vaccinated that you could say, okay, everybody on board will have vaccinated, that sort of thing. But it is something we think that the vaccine is, of course, the ultimate weapon. And the fact that it is coming out and beginning to come out so quickly and that the pace of that is growing will be a basis for a new set of approaches.

But as an organization, we have and we continue to take advantage of this opportunity to analyze our costs and find ways to be more efficient.

It gives Azamara an opportunity to grow. And I think that it's a great brand that we think will do quite well under this other -- this other venture. 
I think moving into other ship sales and so forth, we remain opportunistic. I think we need to remember that pre-pandemic, all of these ships generated quite a bit of cash flow. And so it needs to -- for us, typically, the test on a ship is a little bit less -- it's a little bit less about the cash that we would receive. It's more strategic on whether we think this ship with -- whether it's in its current state or through some moderate investment is something that fits our brands -- we're on fit another brand within our organization or even with our JVs.

Yes, I mean, technically, the -- our operations in Europe are not subject to the CDC jurisdiction. But I think it's fair to say there's an awful lot of Americans who do fly out to Europe to join our European products, particularly for Royal and Celebrity. So nevertheless, we'll be guided by the protocols either through the Healthy Sail Panel or as they come from the European Union or the U.K. So we know that the operations in some of the European countries, particularly Germany, Italy have been ongoing for the past couple of months and the Canary as. And those protocols that have governed operations have basically been based on the Healthy Sail Panel or the clear member policies and then overlaid with specific instructions by the National Health Authority. I think what we're going to see is very similar to what we're going to see in the United States, which is as we continue to see infections decline and vaccines increase, then we're going to move to protocols that probably have some kind of hybrid between vaccines and testing. We are fortunate in a way that we're coming through the winter season. So it's incredibly low in terms of volume and revenue during the winter, but we're entering into the spring. And for the Royal Caribbean Group, we have multiple ships that are currently deployed into European operations. So it's going to be subject to the guidance from the European Union or U.K. Authorities, and we imagine that they'll be very similar to the guidelines that we'll get from the CDC. Does that help?

As Richard commented in his opening comments, we're really pleased with the performance of Quantum in Singapore. It's being an incredible learning experience for our company, and it's been a remarkable example of great collaboration between cruise company and the Health Ministry and the government of Singapore. So we've been operating now for close to 3 months. We've carried probably around 35,000 Singaporeans on ocean cruises. The customer satisfaction ironically is higher with our protocols than it was before our protocols, which is quite funny in a way. 
And our revenue has exceeded our expectations, both from a ticket and an onboard revenue perspective. So the overall performance of our products has been really quite strong. It's subject to a series of protocols that as you question, probably very similar to a framework that we may be operating with in the future out of the U.S. or Europe. But it's a changing landscape. So what we've started with in Singapore in terms of protocols are already being reviewed. And there's -- in the coming weeks, we expect some of those protocols to be changed. For example, load factor constraint in the beginning of our Singapore operations was capped at 50%. We're now in discussions about increasing that cap to 65% in the coming weeks. And some of the testing regime has changed. 
So one of the things that come from Quantum, well, 2 things. One is that operationally, we've really begun to understand how we can work together with the Health Ministry to safely operate a large cruise ship during the COVID times. And we've also gained from our investment in technology. So there are 2 technologies that have come from Quantum that really are game changing. One is the e-mastering, which completely transforms the whole process of lifeboat. And it's all done digitally through your iPhone or and an app. And the second is we've really developed technology for contact tracing, using a combination of technologies. One of them is a trace lit, which basically each guest wears and can tell exactly how long and they've been in contact with everybody else who's wearing a trace lit. And then we have artificial intelligence connected into basically CTV cameras that use facial and body recognition to then double check and verify contact tracing in the event that somebody did have COVID onboard to ship, we've been fortunate that, that hasn't happened. But that technology development is really, we think, groundbreaking and very sophisticated. 
And in our conversations that we had the week before last with the CDC, they specifically asked us to share that technology and what we've been doing in Singapore with them, which we've subsequently done. So there's a lot of lessons being learned. And I think, ultimately, it will create a foundation for how we'll operate. But again, the landscape is changing quite significantly as well with the vaccines on the rate."

So I think that's something that we think is a major positive. And obviously, as the vaccine spread down into the population by age group, we'll see that probably accelerate. And that's also true of Silversea which I think even before the holidays started to see an uplift in bookings coming in based upon age demographics. So that's -- we see that as a positive.

What we have seen more recently is not back to where it was pre-COVID, there has been an increase in the first of cruise coming back into the space. The other point that I would just add is, and some of this, I think, is because people are being vaccinated, and to Michael's point of 65 plus. But as the distribution or shop in the arm of the vaccines are being rolled out. We're seeing that there's a pretty strong relationship to booking volumes and vaccines. And so that is, I think something to point out that, one, there -- obviously, there the people 65 in order who are getting the vaccine, who are now becoming confident to travel. On the other side of it, it's also building confidence that we're getting closer to the other side of this, and people are beginning to realize that travel should be here sooner rather than later. And so I just want to make that point as well as there seems to be a tight relationship to that."

And I think we're more encouraged to see the really dramatic drop that we've been experiencing and the really nice rollout, particularly in the United States and the U.K. in the vaccine. But I think it's still too early for them or us to try and pinpoint, this is the threshold that allows us to move forward."

We've been -- I mean, as you can imagine, we've been working on return to service for many, many months, and we have multiple teams who've been working on all of the logistics and operations of this. And of course, all of the lessons that we've been learning from Quantum have been applied to the whole corporation in terms of planning and logistics. So I think there's a lot of variables and a lot of dynamics in returning a fleet to operation, but we've obviously been doing it for many, many decades in terms of bringing new ships to life. And we put a lot of energy now behind ensuring that we understand how and what we need to do to bring our ships back. 
One comment I'd like to make, which I think, is kind of interesting, and it's related to bringing our ships back and that is our crew members. We recently sent a survey to our entire crew database of around 70,000 employees. And we had 32,000 responses within 12 hours. And subsequently, within a couple of days, we've had 98% of all of our crew respond. And we asked them a couple of questions. We asked them are they planning on returning to work with us? And the unanimous response was yes. We can't wait to come back. We spoke to them about vaccines and the probability that they will be required to be vaccinated to work on the ships. And what did they think about that? 98% of the crew were completely in favor of that. And we also learned that over 4,000 of our crew have already been vaccinated at home. So that's another important element of return to service is the crew. And I think we are very encouraged by the results of the survey. And it literally was late last week. So I just wanted to give you that extra information."

But there's no really significant dynamic that's in front of us right now. And we do definitely see it as transitional. 
And in terms of the question of returning to our pre-COVID load factors, we obviously don't know. But I think our expectation is, once we go through the transitional phase that we will be returning to our pre-COVID load factors."

With regards to ship starting in Australia or China or Europe or elsewhere, for example, we literally are in discussions globally around the world with different governments and looking at where they are with COVID and vaccines, et cetera, et cetera. So I think the point is that there's a lot of opportunity that's starting to open up globally in terms of what's occurring with COVID. And so we are in discussions around the world. One of the products that we opened, this is not a product that would be the next product for Royal Caribbean to open up, but we opened of the Seas, Home Corning in Barbados, sailing out of Barbados in November of '21 on a mix of 7 and 14 night cruises into the Southern Caribbean and really focused into the North American, American, Canadian and the U.K. market. And it is exceeded our expectations quite significantly. I mean we literally sold 25% of our load factor within a couple of weeks. So back to Jason's point, there's a lot of demand, we think, is building up globally for vacations and crews and for Royal Caribbean. So we're quite kind of optimistic about where this is heading."

Even though it's late February, I still want to say Happy New Year because I expect that this year will be so much better in so many ways than the last year. At the same time, it's hard to believe that we're only",937,"Thanks, Jason, and good morning, everyone. Even though it's late February, I still want to say Happy New Year because I expect that this year will be so much better in so many ways than the last year. At the same time, it's hard to believe that we're only 7 weeks into 2021 because so much has already happened. It's been very intense in the last 1.5 months.
And because things are happening so quickly, I think it's a good time to take a moment to review what we, at the Royal Caribbean Group, have been doing over the past year to adjust to the realities of the pandemic in the United States and wherever we sail and wherever we operate around the world.
As we've summarized on Slide 2, 2020 was an unprecedented year in which our teams took on and accomplished actions that were unthinkable just 12 months ago. I think that there was not one job that stayed the same. In a few months, our teams moved our whole fleet into layup. We patriated more than 45,000 crew members to their hundreds of home countries, restructured our workforce, implemented new credit programs for our guests, took care of our travel agents and raised billions of dollars in new capital, all while working from home.
It's been incredibly challenging, but everybody seems to raise to the occasion. Now the most important point to keep in mind is that while most of our ships are still sitting idle, and while we suspended most of our global operations through April -- at least to April, our company has also been moving ahead to create the conditions and to prepare for a healthy return to sailing.
As we continue to navigate this crisis, we've made continued progress on many fronts, as noted on Slide 3. I want to especially speak about how we're engaging with various stakeholders, particularly governments and other actors in the travel industry to ensure that we can ramp up and restart quickly. I'll let Jason talk about the initiatives that we've taken on the finance side.
First, let me recall what we've accomplished with our Healthy Sail Panel, of medical, public health, maritime, biosecurity and other experts. We've taken their 74 recommendations for a healthy return to service as the basis for over 2,000 separate protocols, from passenger testing before sailing, to physical distancing on board, to disembarkation of COVID symptomatic persons. All of these things will give our guests, our crew and the destinations, the confidence that the environment on the Royal Caribbean, Celebrity, Silversea or TUI Ship is safer than a walk down Main Street.
We know that we not only need to provide an environment that protects our guests from COVID but also works to protect all of our people from having their vacations disrupted due to an isolated case. At the same time, we have to recognize that the panel's recommendations were intended to address a pre-vaccine environment. A lot has occurred over the last 4 months since sail report was submitted. Not the least of which is that we're regularly vaccinating over 1.5 million people a day here in the United States and many elsewhere as well. 
And so we continue to work with the panel, led by Governor, Mike Leavitt and Dr. Scott Gottlieb, to identify the safest pathway forward in the new post-vaccine environment when we can protect our guests and crew as never before. And these conversations and the conclusions we draw from them will inform and advance our dialogue with governments around the world, including the CDC under its new leadership. 
At the same time, I believe strongly in the power of positive example. And in Singapore, we have a good one on how we can safely resume cruising while giving our guests the fun fill experience they expect. We've been operating there since early December. And even before that, we've had successful operations, which continue now in Germany and Canary Islands, Greece in the Middle East.
These early returns to service not only provide vacations, but they provide an opportunity to demonstrate proof-of-concept as well. These early cruises provide valuable information about the best way to design and implement our health and safety protocols. They provide important learnings on how we can coordinate most effectively with governments, port authorities, travel partners and others to protect our guest, crew and the destinations we visit. These early cruises have also given us the opportunity to design new attractive itineraries where we can better control the experience.
Now after 11 months of pandemic, I think we all know that COVID fatigue is real. People are clamoring for the opportunity to have experience outside their homes. Every day, we see signs of people want to get out and get away. And once we're able to reopen and restart more broadly, we'll be ready to respond with our best-in-class hardware, including our new buildings, Odyssey of the Seas, Celebrity Apex and Silver Moon and our exclusive private destinations like Perfect Day at CocoCay.
Before I hand off to Jason, I do want to brag on our team just a little bit. Again, the dedication, commitment, and the integrity of our employees throughout this very difficult period has been exceptional. And their individual and combined contributions have been extraordinary. I am impressed every day by what they do.
I also want to give a shout out to our loyal and committed travel partners for their ongoing support and to our investors for their trust. So thank you all. And now I'd like to turn it back over to Jason. Jason?"

This morning, we reported an adjusted net loss of $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020 and a $3.9 billion for the full year. Due to the suspension of our global operations, we were able to operate only 20% of the revenue",1417,"Great. Thank you, Richard. This morning, we reported an adjusted net loss of $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020 and a $3.9 billion for the full year. Due to the suspension of our global operations, we were able to operate only 20% of the revenue cruises initially expected in our February 2020 guidance. This simple stat reflects the staggering impact that the pandemic brought to our company and the whole industry during 2020.
In the fourth quarter, we were able to reduce our quarterly cruise operating expenses by more than 80% from $1.5 billion in Q4 of 2019 to $265 million in Q4 of 2020. We achieved this by expeditiously laying up our fleet and becoming extremely diligent, disciplined and agile in controlling our costs. 
Something similar can be said about our general CapEx, which were reduced by approximately 55% between 2020 and 2021.  I am incredibly grateful of the efforts from the entire corporation in managing through the toughest year in our history.
From a financial standpoint, our top priority remains ensuring that we are in a strong liquidity position. While reducing our cash burn was and still is critical, another crucial liquidity action is accessing capital prudently and opportunistically while also managing our liabilities and our banking partners with our banking partners and export credit agencies.
Since we suspended our global cruise operations, we have raised about $9.3 billion in new capital and have secured agreements to defer almost $2 billion of ship-related debt through the spring of 2022. These later efforts are reducing our expected debt maturities for 2021 to approximately $400 million. These successful transactions and negotiations were possible due to the strength of our brands, the relevancy of our product, and the great relationships that were built during decades of collaborative work with banks, shipyards and vendors.  I also want to highlight that this superb outcome was a huge undertaking executed by our amazing finance, legal and accounting teams.
Now regarding our current liquidity position, we closed -- we closed 2020 fiscal year with $4.4 billion in available liquidity. We remain focused on further improving this position while also managing our operating and capital expenditures to ensure that our family of brands are well positioned for the return to serve.
I will stress that as we return to service and stabilize our operations, our cash flow will be primarily driven -- our cash will be the primary driver to delever our balance sheet, return to investment-grade, and create great shareholder value.
As it pertains to our cash spend for the fourth quarter -- or during the fourth quarter, we spent approximately $1.3 billion, which includes the payment of approximately $300 million of bond that matured in November and approximately $180 million from collateral postings, commissions, and financing fees. When excluding these, our average cash burn rate was on the lower end of our previously announced range, driven by the phenomenal diligence of our teams and some timing. 
Furthermore, this morning, we reaffirmed that the cash burn will be on average in the range of approximately $250 million to $290 million per month doing a prolonged suspension of operations.
Over the last year, we have executed several measures to structurally reduce our cost base, realign our capital allocation and improve our scale and margins. Besides reducing our G&A expenses and streamlining procurement efforts, we successfully divested 3 of our oldest ships and entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Azamara brand. Reshaping our fleets efficiency and the corporation cost structure will help accelerate our margins by improving our operating leverage as we return to service.
I will highlight that when we return to service and start to rev up our sales, we expect that customer deposits and cash flows from operations will further improve our cash position. At the same time, ramping up our business will also include start-up costs that relate to crewing our ships, health and safety protocols, and increased sales and marketing activities.
Because the environment is still very fluid, we are not able to provide further guidance or commentary on these figures.
I will now provide an update on the booking environment and our capacity. While bookings remain below historical levels, we have been constantly impressed and humbled with a number of cruises booked throughout this extended out-of-service period. It's clear that a lot of people want to cruise. And we can't wait to welcome them back on board, our amazing brands and ships.
Clearly, 2021 is not going to be a traditional year. And to this end, we did not plan for a traditional wave season. And therefore, our sales and marketing activities still remain anemic and extremely strategic. 
Currently, we don't expect to broadly ramp up our marketing until more ships come back into operation. Despite the lack of marketing spend, we have seen a 30% increase in new bookings since the beginning of the year when compared to November and December.
Our Lift & Shift in future cruise credit programs have been very successful in both preserving cash and driving demand for future periods. Having said this, I will highlight that from a cumulative standpoint, almost 75% of our book business is new and not related to rebooking activities. The cumulative book position for sailings in the second half of 2021 is aligned with our expectations in terms of resumption of cruising with pricing higher than 2019, both including and excluding the dilutive impact of future cruise credits.
It is probably too early in the booking window to talk too much about 2022, but behavior to date is quite similar to booking activities in previous years. Our book position for the first half of 2022 is within historical ranges at higher average prices. 
As I noted, we are not expecting a traditional wave season. However, we did see a similar increase in 2022 bookings over the past 6 weeks to increases seen in prior years. We think that this is a very encouraging stat giving our muted sales and marketing efforts.
Regarding our deployment, we are not ready to announce any specific surrounding the cadence with which we will be bringing our fleet back into service. Currently, we have canceled sailings on most of our ships through the end of April. Our brands operate in multiple markets around the globe therefore, the timing and pace of the ramp-up in capacity will likely vary by region based on local conditions. We were already operating Quantum of the Seas in Singapore, and our second shift in the water could also be outside of the U.S.
We're also using the learnings from Singapore as well as from our TUI Cruises joint venture. Who has had ship sailing in Europe and the Canary Islands since August and November, which is helping us inform on how the ships will return to service?
Our customer deposit balance at the end of December 2020 was $1.8 billion. This is relatively equal to the balances reported both at the end of September and at the end of June. We were able to maintain a similar customer deposit balance for 6 months despite the suspension of approximately 1,100 sailings because of the deposits collected on new bookings and the success of our future crews' certificates and Lift & Shift options.
Just over half the guests who booked -- who were booked on canceled sailings have requested a cash refund, with the other half either holding an FCC or lifting and shifting their booking to our future crews. Also, approximately half of our customer deposit balance is associated with FCCs, and moreover, about 30% of the overall balance is nonrefundable.
As it pertains to our expectations for 2021, I will note that the timing and trajectory of the recovery remains uncertain, and we are, therefore, unable to provide further guidance for the year. We do expect, however, to incur a net loss on both the U.S. GAAP and an adjusted basis for the first quarter and the full year of 2021.
The magnitude of the loss will depend on many factors, including the timing and extent of our return to service. I will close my remarks by saying that we are clearly focused on what we can control. But as the vaccine distribution continues to accelerate, travel restrictions and advisories begin to ease and customer confidence begins to grow, we feel very optimistic about the future.
With that, I will ask our operator to open up the call for a question-and-answer session. Shelby?"

We're really in an interim period where the vaccines are still relatively new. They're coming out amazingly quickly, but it still is going to take months to get huge numbers of people vaccinated. And so we and the CDC and then governments around the world are looking at how that would change it. And we don't have answers yet. 
I think one of the things everybody is looking to see is just how effective the vaccines are, and people actually want to see that happening. And one of the nice things we have is we can look at the example of Israel, where the vaccination level is one of the highest in the world. And therefore, they're able to make some very significant statistical correlations. And one of the things that you've seen coming out of there, for example, is that the number of people who get the disease or who have been vaccinated is the efficacy is as high or higher than the trials that were done, and this is now on larger numbers of people. So that makes it even more reliable.
But more significantly, they're also saying the ability to prevent the disease being serious in people is even better than that. So these are -- in the history of vaccines in the world, these are really exciting kinds of levels that give us all a lot of hope. But we really need to see it in practice, and it's really hard to say while we're not yet at a point where enough people have been vaccinated that you could say, okay, everybody on board will have been vaccinated, that sort of thing. But it is something we think that the vaccine is, of course, the ultimate weapon. And the fact that it is coming out and beginning to come out so quickly and that the pace of that is growing will be a basis for a new set of approaches. But we haven't -- nor that we nor the governments around the world or the Healthy Sail Panel has yet have been able to define exactly what that will look like."

But as an organization, we have, and we continue to take advantage of this opportunity to analyze our costs and find ways to be more efficient.

I think moving into other ship sales and so forth, we remain opportunistic. I think we need to remember that pre-pandemic, all of these ships generated quite a bit of cash flow. And so it needs to -- for us, typically, the test on a ship is a little bit less -- it's a little bit less about the cash that we would receive.

So nevertheless, we'll be guided by the protocols either through the Healthy Sail Panel or as they come from the European Union or the U.K. So we know that the operations in some of the European countries, particularly Germany, Italy have been ongoing for the past couple of months and the Canary isles. And those protocols that have governed operations have basically been based on the Healthy Sail Panel or the clear member policies and then overlaid with specific instructions by the National Health Authority. 
I think what we're going to see is very similar to what we're going to see in the United States, which is as we continue to see infections decline and vaccines increase, then we're going to move to protocols that probably have some kind of high breadth between vaccines and testing. 
We are fortunate in a way that we're coming through the winter season. So it's incredibly low in terms of volume and revenue during the winter, but we're entering into the spring. And for the Royal Caribbean Group, we have multiple ships that are currently deployed into European operations.

As Richard commented in his opening comments, we're really pleased with the performance of Quantum in Singapore. It's being an incredible learning experience for our company, and it's been a remarkable example of great collaboration between cruise company and the Health Ministry and the government of Singapore. So we've been operating now for close to 3 months. We've carried probably around 35,000 Singaporeans on ocean cruises. The customer satisfaction ironically is higher with our protocols than it was before our protocols, which is quite funny in a way.
And our revenue has exceeded our expectations, both from a ticket and an onboard revenue perspective. So the overall performance of our products has been really quite strong. It's subject to a series of protocols that as you question, probably very similar to a framework that we may be operating with in the future out of the U.S. or Europe. But it's a changing landscape. 
So what we've started with in Singapore in terms of protocols are already being reviewed. And there's -- in the coming weeks, we expect some of those protocols to be changed. For example, load factor constraint in the beginning of our Singapore operations was capped at 50%. We're now in discussions about increasing that cap to 65% in the coming weeks. And some of the testing regime has changed.
So one of the things that come from Quantum, well, 2 things. One is that operationally, we've really begun to understand how we can work together with the Health Ministry to safely operate a large cruise ship during the COVID times. And we've also gained from our investment in technology. So there are 2 technologies that have come from Quantum that really are game changing. One is the e-mastering, which completely transforms the whole process of lifeboat mastering. 
And it's all done digitally through your iPhone or and an app. And the second is we've really developed technology for contact tracing, using a combination of technologies. One of them is a trace lit, which basically each guest wears and can tell exactly how long and they've been in contact with everybody else who's wearing a trace lit. And then we have artificial intelligence connected into basically CTV (sic) [ CCTV ] cameras that use facial and body recognition to then double check and verify contact tracing in the event that somebody did have COVID onboard to ship, we've been fortunate that that hasn't happened. But that technology development is really, we think, groundbreaking and very sophisticated.
And in our conversations that we had the week before last with the CDC, they specifically asked us to share that technology and what we've been doing in Singapore with them, which we've subsequently done. So there's a lot of lessons being learned. And I think, ultimately, it will create a foundation for how we'll operate. But again, the landscape is changing quite significantly as well with the vaccines on the interaction rate."

One of the things that we've seen after -- really after we came out of the holidays early in January is a proportional increase in the number of guests booking who were 65 plus. And that has continued to increase. So as the weeks have passed, I belief, we don't know if this is a fact, but our belief is, is that a 65-plus are getting vaccinated, then they're obviously becoming more comfortable with booking, and we're seeing that very much in our bookings from about January forward. 
So I think that's something that we think is a major positive. And obviously, as the vaccine spread down into the population by age group, we'll see that probably accelerate. And that's also true of Silversea which I think even before the holidays started to see an uplift in bookings coming in based upon age demographics. So that's -- we see that as a positive.

What we have seen more recently that were brought back to where it was pre-COVID, there has been an increase in the first cruise coming back into the space. 
The other point that I would just add is, and some of this, I think, is because people are being vaccinated, and to Michael's point of 65 plus. But as the distribution or shop in the arm of the vaccines are being rolled out. We're seeing that there's a pretty strong relationship to booking volumes and vaccines. And so that is, I think something to point out that, one, there -- obviously, there the people 65 in order who are getting the vaccine, who are now becoming confident to travel. On the other side of it, it's also building confidence that we're getting closer to the other side of this, and people are beginning to realize that their travel should be here sooner rather than later. And so I just want to make that point as well as there seems to be a tight relationship to that."

We've been -- I mean, as you can imagine, we've been working on return to service for many, many months, and we have multiple teams who've been working on all of the logistics and operations of this. 
And of course, all of the lessons that we've been learning from Quantum have been applied to the whole corporation in terms of planning and logistics. So I think there's a lot of variables and then lot of dynamics in returning a fleet to operation, but we've obviously been doing it for many, many decades in terms of bringing new ships to life. And we put a lot of energy now behind ensuring that we understand how and what we need to do to bring our ships back.
One comment I'd like to make, which I think, is kind of interesting, and it's related to bringing our ships back and that is our crew members. We recently sent a survey to our entire crew database of around 70,000 employees. And we had 32,000 responses within 12 hours. And subsequently, within a couple of days, we've had 98% of all of our crew respond. And we asked them a couple of questions. We asked them are they planning on returning to work with us? 
And the unanimous response was, yes. We can't wait to come back. We spoke to them about vaccines and the probability that they will be required to be vaccinated to work on the ships. And what did they think about that? 98% of the crew were completely in favor of that. And we also learned that over 4,000 of our crew have already been vaccinated at home. So that's another important element of return to service is the crew. And I think we are very encouraged by the results of the survey. And it literally was late last week. So I just wanted to give you that extra nuggetive information."

And then the other question, and this is very minor, but I was just curious with the sale of the Empress and Majesty. Those were ships that my understanding. I thought those were the only Royal Caribbean ships that fit into the port in Havana, in Cuba. And I know that's like way out on your radar screen, but are there other ships that could potentially return to that market if that were to reopen?"

With regards to ship starting in Australia or China or Europe or elsewhere, for example, we literally are in discussions globally around the world with different governments and looking at where they are with COVID and vaccines, et cetera, et cetera. So I think the point is that there's a lot of opportunity that's starting to open up globally in terms of what's occurring with COVID. And so we are in discussions around the world. 
One of the products that we opened, this is not a product that would be the next product for Royal Caribbean to open up, but we opened Grandeur of the Seas, home-porting in Barbados, sailing out of Barbados in November of '21 on a mix of 7 and 14 night cruises into the Southern Caribbean and really focused into the North American, American, Canadian and the U.K. market. And it has exceeded our expectations quite significantly. I mean we literally sold 25% of our load factor within a couple of weeks. 
So back to Jason's point, there's a lot of demand, we think, is building up globally for vacations and crews and for Royal Caribbean. So we're quite kind of optimistic about where this is heading."

During this call, we will be referring to a few slides, which have been posted on our investor website, www.rclinvestor.com. 
Before we get started, I would like to refer you to our notice about forward-looking statements, which is on our first slide. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking. These statements do not guarantee future performance and do involve risks and uncertainties. Examples are described in our SEC filings and other disclosures.

And thank you, Carola, for your help and consistent support over many years with Royal Caribbean. You all know it's been painful to pass the 1-year mark since we suspended sailings in March of 2020 and to keep seeing most of our beautiful ship still sitting in anchor. However, I'd like to comment on some of the dramatic positive elements that we've just mentioned. 
The big change has been a significant improvement in the extent and the quality of our dialogue with the CDC. As I have said elsewhere, scientific knowledge does not advance well in the vacuum. More and better exchange of information and more and better understanding of other perspectives always leads to a better and healthier outcome. The CDC has recently significantly increased its efforts in this regard. And we really appreciate, and we would like to -- for undertaking this important effort. 
Last night, the CDC issued multiple very constructive clarifications and amplifications of its conditional sail order. They've addressed many of the items that concerned us in the order, in a manner that takes into account the recent advances in vaccines and medical science. We believe that this communication really helps us to see a clear and achievable pathway forward to a safe and healthy cruising in the near future. But an important caveat is that this is a very complex area, and we only received the letter last night. Furthermore, there are still a great many details to be provided in the future and others that need to be resolved. 
We need to be cautious about all of those. Nevertheless, we now have high hopes that if these details can be resolved quickly, it could be possible to restart cruising by mid-July. I would also emphasize that the restart does not mean that we will immediately go into full operation. While we are hopeful about restarting, that restart will be gradual and deliberate. Furthermore, our business looks long in advance. So it will take some time for the machinery to get back into full swing.  But the letter is a very constructive part of this process. And it indicates both the value of good communications and indicates the CDC's desire to see cruising reopen in a safe and healthy manner. 
As I said before, we share a common goal in both the CDC and the cruise industry, are determined to do this right. One of our strongest discussion points in these meetings with the CDC has been the data that we've collected from our cruises in Asia and Europe. As mentioned earlier, we have successfully carried over 125,000 passengers with only 21 COVID-19 cases, 21. That's a positivity rate of 0.01%. And as we've emphasized, all of this has been experienced without having the availability of vaccines. 
Our goal throughout this pandemic is then to make a cruise ship where we can control the environment safer than Main Street USA. We've already demonstrated our ability to do that, and we are now eager to resume life as so many other businesses are doing. And we are pleased that the CDC letter really does reflect an intention to treat us similarly to other industries in similar circumstances. 
In addition to this particularly positive development in the U.S., there are other activities going on. For example, last month, Odyssey of the Seas, our newest quantum class ship, joined the Royal Caribbean International fleet. Along the Celebrity Apex and Silverseas Silver Moon, we now have 3 brand-new ships each with the most amazing technology to ensure safety, security and, of course, unbelievable guest experiences. 
And there has been such demand for our current sailings. For example, from Singapore and Quantum of Seas that we've extended our season there now through the end of October. And, of course, we've also taken additional steps to strengthen our financial position even further, and you're going to hear more about that from Jason. 
Before I describe all the energy we see within the group, I want to acknowledge once again the dedication and hard work of our people. It's always been our people who have made us successful, and it's been our people that have gotten us through these past 13 months of moving with COVID-19. Everyone has suffered during the pandemic, but working for cruise lines is the real test of endurance and trust and agility. Over and over, our people have passed that test. 
I'd like to also thank our investors and our travel partners who have been the strongest advocates with our guests over these months of uncertainty. We are also grateful of their commitment to work -- we are always grateful for their commitment to work with us. 
While a lot of what we're doing right now is directed to a healthy return to service, we're also focusing on how we can strengthen our position in other areas, included on ESG, environmental, social and governmental responsibility. Of course, this focus isn't new for us. From our partnership with the World World Life fund, to support for sustainable destinations, to active engagement on diversity and inclusion, to aggressive emission reduction, our commitment to progress on the ESG agenda is long standing. But we believe strongly, and it's not enough to reflect on what we have been doing, we need to get ready for what's next and plan for how we will meet the challenges in the future. You'll hear more about this initiative in future calls, but I want to take this opportunity to make you aware of this intensified focus. 
And with that, I'll turn the microphone back to Jason. Jason?"
325643,712340089,2262540,"Royal Caribbean Group, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Executives","Thank you, Richard. Before I start, like Richard, I want to again thank our teams across the whole enterprise for their dedication and tireless efforts during these unprecedented times. I will now start to discuss our first quarter performance. This mor",1363,"Thank you, Richard. Before I start, like Richard, I want to again thank our teams across the whole enterprise for their dedication and tireless efforts during these unprecedented times. 
I will now start to discuss our first quarter performance. This morning, we reported an adjusted net loss of $1.1 billion or $4.44 per share for the first quarter of 2021. While reporting these type of results continues to be painful, we are excited about the fact that little by little, the flywheel is starting to spin. Furthermore, the latest news by the CDC, as it relates to our resumption of service in the U.S., is quite encouraging. 
During the first quarter of 2021, we delivered memorable vacations to over 55,000 guests through our Royal Caribbean International, TUI cruises and Hapag-Lloyd brands. Moreover, our teams are diligently working on the health protocols and start-up activities needed to begin operations on an additional 11 ships this summer. 
While these activities are extremely encouraging, they also put some additional pressure on our cash burn in the short term. Having said this, we are also very encouraged by our customer deposit balance, which as of today, is approximately $2 billion compared to the $1.8 billion that was shared this morning related to the end of the first quarter. 
Moreover, the latest balance reflects the reduction in deposits that related to the Azamara brand which was sold just a few months ago, demonstrating an even larger improvement versus our December '20 customer deposit balance. This improved balance has been disproportionately driven by new bookings versus the issuance of more FCCs. At this point, approximately 45% of our customer deposit balance is associated with FCCs versus about 50% at the time of our last call. 
Now I will shift my remarks to our liquidity actions during the quarter. As you all know, we pride ourselves on having industry-leading brands, with a world-class and highly innovative fleet and a history of strong financial discipline. These assets and attributes have been instrumental in helping us raise more than $12.3 billion in new capital since March of last year. 
During the first quarter of 2021, we continued our efforts to enhance our liquidity position and manage our maturity profile. To this end, we successfully executed 2 capital raises with cumulative gross proceeds of $2 billion. Connected to this, we amended 2 debt facilities totaling approximately $2.5 billion, which were due in 2022 and extended the maturities for consenting lenders by 18 months. 
I will highlight that since we are refinancing guaranteed debt with unsecured and unguaranteed debt, we are starting our journey back to an unencumbered investment-grade balance sheet. Altogether, during this quarter, we paid down approximately $800 million of debt related to principal on the amended facilities and the U.K. commercial paper programs that was due in March. 
Now as it pertains to the cash burn during the quarter, the average monthly cash burn was approximately $300 million, which was slightly higher than previously announced range. This was mainly driven by restart expenses, which were related to the new health protocols and some crew movements. 
It is important to note that previously announced range did not include any expenses that related to the restarting of operations as it assumed a status of prolonged suspension of operations. When excluding the return to service expenses, our cash burn was in line with our previously announced range. 
Overall, we closed the first quarter with $5.8 billion in available liquidity. As I previously mentioned, we are very encouraged with the latest news, current momentum and the restart of operations around the globe, but the environment remains extremely fluid. And for this reason, we are not providing a cash burn estimate or the related offsets generated by revenue and new customer deposits that come from returning ships. 
I will highlight that the burn rate for the ships that are kept in lay-up is expected to be consistent with our previous expectations on a relative basis. Now as it pertains to our debt maturities and in addition to the extensions of the 22 facilities that I previously mentioned, we also completed the amendments to our export credit facilities differing $1.15 billion of principal amortization and waiving financial covenants through at least the end of the third quarter of 2022. 
After all these negotiations, our scheduled debt maturities for the remainder of '21 and 2022 are $200 million and $2.2 billion, respectively. 
I will now update you on our business outlook, as I know this is top of mind for many, and I'll start by providing an update on our summer capacity. Over the last 2 months, we have announced that returned to service for 9 ships across 3 -- our 3 global brands and have extended the Singapore season for Quantum of the Seas through the fall. These are 176 sailings in the Caribbean, Europe and Asia now represent 19% of our fleet capacity for the summer season. 6 of these ships will sale in Europe, offering Greek dials and U.K. itineraries to guests from the U.S., the U.K., Israel and Europe. These guests will have the opportunity to experience our 3 newest ships, Odyssey of the Seas, Celebrity Apex and the Silver Moon for the first time ever. 
In addition, 3 ships will cater to the U.S. market offering Caribbean itineraries departing from Masa, St. Marin and Bermuda. Many of these sailings will call on our amazing Private Island Perfect Day at Cococay. On top of these, Quantum on the Seas will continue to offer cruises from the Singapore -- from Singapore for the local market. 
Now regarding TUI Cruises, our JV, they have announced 2 additional ships sailing this summer in addition to 3 vessels that have been operating out of the Canary Island since this past November. We look forward to announcing the return of additional ship and remain committed to a safe, thoughtful and financially sensible resumption of cruising across the entire fleet. 
Now I will provide an update on the bookings. When we opened the first set of sailings for Quantum of the Seas in October of 2020, we immediately saw the pent-up demand for cruising in Singapore. Because of this, we hoped and expected that the same would be true in other markets, and these expectations were confirmed when we launched our new deployment. 
We have been very pleased with booking levels and pricing for sailings in both Europe and the Caribbean. And as a result, our load factors and revenues are building up nicely. After less than 3 weeks of sales from most ships, we already have about 30% of our expected revenue booked for June through September sales. We expect to start our initial operations with lower load factors and ramp up gradually over time. 
On our last earnings call, I shared that we received 30% more bookings in January when compared to November and December. Despite anemic sales and marketing activities, demand continued to accelerate, and new bookings in March exceeded January and February levels by approximately 80%. In addition to new bookings, guests continue to utilize FCCs and take advantage of the Lift & Shift program. 
Now overall, the booking activity for the second half of 2021 is in line with our anticipated resumption of cruising. And pricing on these bookings is higher than 2019, both including and excluding the dilutive impact of future cruise credits. 
Regarding 2022 sailings, it is still early in the booking window to provide too much detail. But I will share that our book load factors for the first half of 2022 remains within historical ranges. And pricing on booked business is up nicely versus 2019 when including the dilutionary impact of FCCs as well. 
While a portion of this improvement is related to our new ships, pricing is also up for the existing fleet. 
I will close by saying that we are prepared and eager for the flywheel start turning again. We feel very optimistic about our future and are thrilled to see more and more guests around the globe enjoying incredible vacations on-board our ships. 
With that, I will ask Shelby to open up the call for a question-and-answer session."

I'll just comment real quick as it relates to -- on the cost side, and then you can be asked the first part of your question. 
Yes. we really have tuned in our way up costs. And of course, we've kept our ships generally in a warm state. So that as we restarted our ships, we would be able to do that expeditiously and at a reasonable cost. But as it relates to the return to service as we ramp the ships back up, those costs are still kind of very fluid, which is why we're not guiding on them as we need to take into consideration testing and crude movement and vaccinations and maybe other things that might be part of that equation. That might be different itinerary by itinerary. 
So we're not yet ready to kind of guide on that. What I would tell you is we are being very -- we're very focused to make sure that, that as we're spending, we're being very thoughtful about it. And of course, at the same time, as we're launching these ships, we're also getting the revenues and customer deposits that are associated with that.

But it's a 3-part question, so prepare yourself for some fun here. 
When you look at the mandates that have been laid out. I mean, calling for 98% of crew and 95% of passengers to be vaccinated, do you -- I mean, the first question is, do you think getting to those thresholds will be easy to achieve?  The second part of that is going to be the kid component. How are kids accounted for under those percentages?  And if I'm reading that right, it seems like getting kids on board might be difficult during the CSO time frame. 
And then the third part of this is, do you think the CDC's cautionary travel outlook for the Bahamas could cause some panic with your potential customer base?"

So there's -- you can meet that threshold, and you don't have to meet that threshold, and there's different pathway. We know from surveys of our customers who've been booking since January, that over 80% of our customers have already told us, they're either vaccinated or will be vaccinated when they cruise. So that's since January. So there's an overwhelming, certainly for our customer base, people are just saying, I'm getting vaccinated. And as you skew older, the percentage increases quite significantly. Mainly because, of course, when the vacation started, it started with the older age group first, et cetera, et cetera. 
For the crew, interestingly, every year, we offer -- we don't mandate flu vaccines for our crew members, and we've been doing that for many, many years. And the crew, typically, the vaccination rates of our crew members for flu is around the mid-90%. They just voluntarily take the vaccine. We surveyed our crew some months ago, and we stay in touch with the crew through surveys and various forms of communication. 
And in the survey that we sent out, I'm going to say it was at the end of last year or the beginning of this year. We asked our crew members. First of all, have you been vaccinated? Are you getting vaccinated? And will you get vaccinated? And we had over 98% positive response from our crew saying, yes, we're going to get vaccinated. So I think there's just -- I think it's somewhat a natural event. Crew used to getting vaccinated for flu, and they're certainly willing to get vaccinated for COVID. We do understand for health or religious reasons or belief reasons that some people won't want to, and that's been in place for many years in terms of how we vaccinated for flu. 
On the kids, I think we obviously take a look at our kid count, kid population and what have you. We think this is the next phase. And we know that the vaccination now for eligible for children, 16 and over. We've been told that in the coming weeks and months, that age limit will likely drop to 12, and we're encouraged by that.

The beauty, of course, of our crewing model is that almost from the very beginning, we've crewed from literally over 100 countries around the world. Obviously, some countries like India have significant volume with employees who come from India. But we have large populations that come from many other countries around the world. So we're obviously super sympathetic about what's happening in India because we do have many loyal employees who've been with us for many, many years.

What we saw last night was very encouraging because it wasn't 1 or 2 things. It was multiple additions and corrections to many of the elements of the existing CSO that really challenging and very, very difficult, particularly as it relates to what's occurring with vaccines.

Again, it's really early days, I think, to try to kind of pace that, those type of stats will result in some type of sales and marketing savings. Time will tell. What's clear to us is there's  really strong demand and really some activity on the marketing side is able to generate that demand, which is, I think, very encouraging for us overall. 
And then I think on the cost side, as it relates to turning in different ports around the world, there's always different port fees. Vaccinations, testing and so forth can all kind of play in the mix of it. But I think for the most part, it's not really a cost differential. I think it's more about our ability to get our passengers to those locations and turn at those locations and then deliver world classification experiences."

We're always internally facing what was going to happen with wave in '21, understanding we wouldn't really obviously have a wave as we historically used to having a wave. And normally, wave starts sometime into the second or so week of January and then runs through February peaking and then dropping off in March. And we certainly didn't get a wave this year. But then in March of this year, we had a really strong March. And so we looked at the volume of bookings that came in, in March of this year and we compared it with wave in '19, which was our last real wave period. And our bookings in March of this year equaled peak wave months in '19. 
So that was -- I mean, that was quite an amazing number. So we kind of -- we started to see wave coming in March instead of January. And certainly, the volume was impressive. But the point of this is that ironically, our marketing and sales investment during that month was way, way below what we invested in '19. 
So I mean, it's an interesting fact that we had so much demand with very little investment, which I think speaks to what we're seeing and believe is occurring in the market with pent-up demand. I mean we know that we've been told savings rate in the U.S. with U.S. consumers increased by $2.5 trillion. The credit card debt is down by $100 billion. And our surveys tell us that the consumer is increasingly optimistic about the future that the worst is behind them that they are going to go on a vacation. And so I think that one statistic for March, we interpret as incredibly positive and speaks about what we think is going to be one amazing pent-up demand that's going to be -- is going to be unleashed, particularly for '22."

And so in order to restart the Alaskan season, we would either need a waiver from the passenger vessel services at or Canada would have to allow at least technical stops. And we're working on both and others are working on both, but we can't be certain where that will end up. 
But I think given the momentum, there's reason for some hope, but I think we're -- that's a sufficiently complex and confusing situation, but I don't think we're going to put odds on it one way or the other. I also think we need to be just a little bit careful when we're talking about reading into these bookings. There are still a lot of issues that have yet to be resolved with respect to the CDC and this order. 
The bookings that have taken place and have been in a period of high uncertainty. Are these cruises going to be sailing? Will they go where they want?  What will be the protocol?  So there's a lot of uncertainty. And while we try and read a lot into it, and the one thing that I think we are feeling comfortable about is that there is a lot of pent-up demand. There's too many fluid factors, I think, to read too much into some of the specifics of what is this particular meaning for, particularly '22. I think it's all terribly encouraging for '23 and it's very encouraging for '22. But the specifics of each of these is going to be difficult to read into until things calm down, and there's much more certainty about where it's leading to it. 
But as to Alaska, specifically, while we're optimistic and we're working to make that happen, there are these other factors, we do think that we'll be in time for the Alaskan season. And we're obviously hopeful that we'll be able to solve the issue with Canada in either in 1 of these 2 ways."

And so highly vaccinated crews can literally -- as soon as you have your port plan ready and everything lined up, you can submit your request to cruise, and they will try to best to get you a response within 5 days. So you can see that the time line and the process has improved quite significantly. So I think there's the process of crewing the ship, obviously, and then the vaccination process. So I think the target that's been stated and that we've all been working towards is in mid-July. And I think that after what we received last night is looking very realistic. 
But again, to Richard's, we still got a lot to clarify. But I think this commitment to mid-July is looking very realistic based upon what we saw last night."

And thank you, Carola, for your help and consistent support over many years with Royal Caribbean. You all know it's been painful to pass the 1-year mark since we suspended sailings in March of 2020 and to keep seeing most of our beautiful ship still sitting in anchor. However, I'd like to comment on some of the dramatic positive elements that we've just mentioned. 
The big change has been a significant improvement in the extent and the quality of our dialogue with the CDC. As I have said elsewhere, scientific knowledge does not advance well in the vacuum. More and better exchange of information and more and better understanding of other perspectives always leads to a better and healthier outcome. The CDC has recently significantly increased its efforts in this regard. And we really appreciate, and we would like to -- for undertaking this important effort. 
Last night, the CDC issued multiple very constructive clarifications and amplifications of its conditional sail order. They've addressed many of the items that concerned us in the order, in a manner that takes into account the recent advances in vaccines and medical science. We believe that this communication really helps us to see a clear and achievable pathway forward to a safe and healthy cruising in the near future. But an important caveat is that this is a very complex area, and we only received the letter last night. Furthermore, there are still a great many details to be provided in the future and others that need to be resolved. 
We need to be cautious about all of those. Nevertheless, we now have high hopes that if these details can be resolved quickly, it could be possible to restart cruising by mid-July. I would also emphasize that the restart does not mean that we will immediately go into full operation. While we are hopeful about restarting, that restart will be gradual and deliberate. Furthermore, our business looks long in advance. So it will take some time for the machinery to get back into full swing.  But the letter is a very constructive part of this process. And it indicates both the value of good communications and indicates the CDC's desire to see cruising reopen in a safe and healthy manner. 
As I said before, we share a common goal in both the CDC and the cruise industry, are determined to do this right. One of our strongest discussion points in these meetings with the CDC has been the data that we've collected from our cruises in Asia and Europe. As mentioned earlier, we have successfully carried over 125,000 passengers with only 21 COVID-19 cases, 21. That's a positivity rate of 0.01%. And as we've emphasized, all of this has been experienced without having the availability of vaccines. 
Our goal throughout this pandemic is then to make a cruise ship where we can control the environment safer than Main Street USA. We've already demonstrated our ability to do that, and we are now eager to resume life as so many other businesses are doing. And we are pleased that the CDC letter really does reflect an intention to treat us similarly to other industries in similar circumstances. 
In addition to this particularly positive development in the U.S., there are other activities going on. For example, last month, Odyssey of the Seas, our newest quantum class ship, joined the Royal Caribbean International fleet. Along the Celebrity Apex and Silversea Silver Moon, we now have 3 brand-new ships each with the most amazing technology to ensure safety, security and, of course, unbelievable guest experiences. 
And there has been such demand for our current sailings. For example, from Singapore and Quantum of the Seas that we've extended our season there now through the end of October. And, of course, we've also taken additional steps to strengthen our financial position even further, and you're going to hear more about that from Jason. 
Before I describe all the energy we see and feel it in the group, I want to acknowledge once again the dedication and hard work of our people. It's always been our people who have made us successful, and it's been our people that have gotten us through these past 13 months of living with COVID-19. Everyone has suffered during the pandemic, but working for cruise lines is the real test of endurance and trust and agility. Over and over, our people have passed that test. 
I'd like to also thank our investors and our travel partners who have been the strongest advocates with our guests over these months of uncertainty. We are also grateful of their commitment to work -- we are always grateful for their commitment to work with us. 
While a lot of what we're doing right now is directed to a healthy return to service, we're also focusing on how we can strengthen our position in other areas, including on ESG, environmental, social and governmental responsibility. Of course, this focus isn't new for us. From our partnership with the World Wildlife fund, to support for sustainable destinations, to active engagement on diversity and inclusion, to aggressive emission reduction, our commitment to progress on the ESG agenda is long standing. But we believe strongly, and it's not enough to reflect on what we have been doing, we need to get ready for what's next and plan for how we will meet the challenges in the future. You'll hear more about this initiative in future calls, but I want to take this opportunity to make you aware of this intensified focus. 
And with that, I'll turn the microphone back to Jason. Jason?"
325643,712340089,2262872,"Royal Caribbean Group, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Executives","Thank you, Richard. Before I start, like Richard, I want to again thank our teams across the whole enterprise for their dedication and tireless efforts during these unprecedented times. I will now start to discuss our first quarter performance. This mor",1371,"Thank you, Richard. Before I start, like Richard, I want to again thank our teams across the whole enterprise for their dedication and tireless efforts during these unprecedented times. 
I will now start to discuss our first quarter performance. This morning, we reported an adjusted net loss of $1.1 billion or $4.44 (sic) [ S4.66 ] per share for the first quarter of 2021. While reporting these type of results continues to be painful, we are excited about the fact that little by little, the flywheel is starting to spin. Furthermore, the latest news by the CDC, as it relates to our resumption of service in the U.S., is quite encouraging. 
During the first quarter of 2021, we delivered memorable vacations to over 55,000 guests through our Royal Caribbean International, TUI cruises and Hapag-Lloyd brands. Moreover, our teams are diligently working on the health protocols and start-up activities needed to begin operations on an additional 11 ships this summer. 
While these activities are extremely encouraging, they also put some additional pressure on our cash burn in the short term. Having said this, we are also very encouraged by our customer deposit balance, which as of today, is approximately $2 billion compared to the $1.8 billion that was shared this morning related to the end of the first quarter. 
Moreover, the latest balance reflects the reduction in deposits that related to the Azamara brand which was sold just a few months ago, demonstrating an even larger improvement versus our December '20 customer deposit balance. This improved balance has been disproportionately driven by new bookings versus the issuance of more FCCs. At this point, approximately 45% of our customer deposit balance is associated with FCCs versus about 50% at the time of our last call. 
Now I will shift my remarks to our liquidity actions during the quarter. As you all know, we pride ourselves on having industry-leading brands, with a world-class and highly innovative fleet and a history of strong financial discipline. These assets and attributes have been instrumental in helping us raise more than $12.3 billion in new capital since March of last year. 
During the first quarter of 2021, we continued our efforts to enhance our liquidity position and manage our maturity profile. To this end, we successfully executed 2 capital raises with cumulative gross proceeds of $2 billion. Connected to this, we amended 2 debt facilities totaling approximately $2.5 billion, which were due in 2022 and extended the maturities for consenting lenders by 18 months. 
I will highlight that since we are refinancing guaranteed debt with unsecured and unguaranteed debt, we are starting our journey back to an unencumbered investment-grade balance sheet. Altogether, during this quarter, we paid down approximately $800 million of debt related to principal on the amended facilities and the U.K. commercial paper programs that was due in March. 
Now as it pertains to the cash burn during the quarter, the average monthly cash burn was approximately $300 million, which was slightly higher than previously announced range. This was mainly driven by restart expenses, which were related to the new health protocols and some crew movements. 
It is important to note that previously announced range did not include any expenses that related to the restarting of operations as it assumed a status of prolonged suspension of operations. When excluding the return to service expenses, our cash burn was in line with our previously announced range. 
Overall, we closed the first quarter with $5.8 billion in available liquidity. As I previously mentioned, we are very encouraged with the latest news, current momentum and the restart of operations around the globe, but the environment remains extremely fluid. And for this reason, we are not providing a cash burn estimate or the related offsets generated by revenue and new customer deposits that come from returning ships. 
I will highlight that the burn rate for the ships that are kept in lay-up is expected to be consistent with our previous expectations on a relative basis. Now as it pertains to our debt maturities and in addition to the extensions of the 22 facilities that I previously mentioned, we also completed the amendments to our export credit facilities differing $1.15 billion of principal amortization and waiving financial covenants through at least the end of the third quarter of 2022. 
After all these negotiations, our scheduled debt maturities for the remainder of '21 and 2022 are $200 million and $2.2 billion, respectively. 
I will now update you on our business outlook, as I know this is top of mind for many, and I'll start by providing an update on our summer capacity. Over the last 2 months, we have announced the returned to service for 9 ships across 3 -- our 3 global brands and have extended the Singapore season for Quantum of the Seas through the fall. These are 176 sailings in the Caribbean, Europe and Asia now represent 19% of our fleet capacity for the summer season. 6 of these ships will sail in Europe, offering Greek Isles and U.K. and our easter guests from the U.S., the U.K., Israel and Europe. These guests will have the opportunity to experience our 3 newest ships, Odyssey of the Seas, Celebrity Apex and the Silver Moon for the first time ever. 
In addition, 3 ships will cater to the U.S. market offering Caribbean itineraries departing from Nassau, St. Maarten and Bermuda. Many of these sailings will call on our amazing private island Perfect Day at Cococay. On top of these, Quantum on the Seas will continue to offer cruises from the Singapore -- from Singapore for the local market. 
Now regarding TUI Cruises, our JV, they have announced 2 additional ships sailing this summer in addition to 3 vessels that have been operating out of the Canary Island since this past November. We look forward to announcing the return of additional ships and remain committed to a safe, thoughtful and financially sensible resumption of cruising across the entire fleet. 
Now I will provide an update on the [ odd ] bookings. When we opened the first set of sailings for Quantum of the Seas in October of 2020, we immediately saw the pent-up demand for cruising in Singapore. Because of this, we hoped and expected that the same would be true in other markets, and these expectations were confirmed when we launched our new deployment. 
We have been very pleased with booking levels and pricing for sailings in both Europe and the Caribbean. And as a result, our load factors and revenues are building up nicely. After less than 3 weeks of sales from most ships, we already have about 30% of our expected revenue booked for June through September sails. We expect to start our initial operations with lower load factors and ramp up gradually over time. 
On our last earnings call, I shared that we received 30% more bookings in January when compared to November and December. Despite anemic sales and marketing activities, demand continued to accelerate, and new bookings in March exceeded January and February levels by approximately 80%. In addition to new bookings, guests continue to utilize FCCs and take advantage of the Lift & Shift program. 
Now overall, the booking activity for the second half of 2021 is in line with our anticipated resumption of cruising. And pricing on these bookings is higher than 2019, both including and excluding the dilutive impact of future cruise credits. 
Regarding 2022 sailings, it is still early in the booking window to provide too much detail. But I will share that our book load factors for the first half of 2022 remains within historical ranges. And pricing on booked business is up nicely versus 2019 when including the dilutionary impact of FCCs as well.  While a portion of this improvement is related to our new ships, pricing is also up for the existing fleet. 
I will close by saying that we are prepared and eager for the flywheel start turning again. We feel very optimistic about our future and are thrilled to see more and more guests around the globe enjoying incredible vacations on-board our ships. 
With that, I will ask Shelby to open up the call for a question-and-answer session."

I'll just comment real quick as it relates to -- on the cost side, and then you can reask the first part of your question. 
Yes. we really have tuned in our way up costs. And of course, we've kept our ships generally in a warm state. So that as we restarted our ships, we would be able to do that expeditiously and at a reasonable cost. But as it relates to the return to service as we ramp the ships back up, those costs are still kind of very fluid, which is why we're not guiding on them as we need to take into consideration testing and crude movement and vaccinations and maybe other things that might be part of that equation. That might be different itinerary by itinerary. 
So we're not yet ready to kind of guide on that. What I would tell you is we are being very -- we're very focused to make sure that, that as we're spending, that we're being very thoughtful about it.

When you look at the mandates that have been laid out. I mean, calling for 98% of crew and 95% of passengers to be vaccinated, do you -- I mean, the first question is, do you think getting to those thresholds will be easy to achieve?  The second part of that is going to be the kid component. How are kids accounted for under those percentages?  And if I'm reading that right, it seems like getting kids on board might be difficult during the CSO time frame.  And then the third part of this is, do you think the CDC's cautionary travel outlook for the Bahamas could cause some panic with your potential customer base?"

So there's -- you can meet that threshold, and you don't have to meet that threshold, and there's different pathway. We know from surveys of our customers who've been booking since January, that over 80% of our customers have already told us, they're either vaccinated or will be vaccinated when they cruise. So that's since January. So there's an overwhelming, certainly for our customer base, people are just saying, I'm getting vaccinated. And as you skew older, the percentage increases quite significantly. Mainly because, of course, when the vaccination started, it started with the older age group first, et cetera, et cetera. 
For the crew, interestingly, every year, we offer -- we don't mandate flu vaccines for our crew members, and we've been doing that for many, many years. And the crew, typically, the vaccination rates of our crew members for flu is around the mid-90%. They just voluntarily take the vaccine. We surveyed our crew some months ago, and we stay in touch with the crew through surveys and various forms of communication. 
And in the survey that we sent out, I'm going to say it was at the end of last year or the beginning of this year, we asked our crew members, first of all, have you been vaccinated? Are you getting vaccinated? And will you get vaccinated? And we had over 98% positive response from our crew saying, yes, we're going to get vaccinated. So I think there's just -- I think it's somewhat a natural event. Crew used to getting vaccinated for flu, and they're certainly willing to get vaccinated for COVID. We do understand for health or religious reasons or belief reasons that some people won't want to, and that's been in place for many years in terms of how we vaccinate for flu. 
On the kids, I think we obviously take a look at our kid count, kid population and what have you. We think this is the next phase. And we know that the vaccination now for eligible for children, 16 and over. We've been told that in the coming weeks and months, that age limit will likely drop to 12, and we're encouraged by that. And then for kids 11 and under, obviously, we carry a lot of kids 11 and under. But relatively speaking, as a percentage of our total guest count, it's quite a small number. 
So we're not overly concerned with that. And again, as Richard pointed out, we received these modifications late last night. We really do have to sit, study and discuss with the CDC and understand all of these different nuances. But we're not discouraged by this in anyway."

And then I think on the cost side, as it relates to turning in different ports around the world, there's always different port fees. Vaccinations, testing and so forth can all kind of play in the mix of it. But I think for the most part, it's not really a cost differential.

We're always internally facing what was going to happen with wave in '21, understanding we wouldn't really obviously have a wave as we historically used to having a wave. And normally, wave starts sometime into the second or so week of January and then runs through February peaking and then dropping off in March. And we certainly didn't get a wave this year. But then in March of this year, we had a really strong March. And so we looked at the volume of bookings that came in, in March of this year and we compared it with wave in '19, which was our last real wave period. And our bookings in March of this year equaled peak wave months in '19. 
So that was -- I mean, that was quite an amazing number. So we kind of -- we started to see wave coming in March instead of January. And certainly, the volume was impressive.

So I mean, it's an interesting fact that we had so much demand with very little investment, which I think speaks to what we're seeing and believe is occurring in the market with pent-up demand. I mean we know that we've been told savings rate in the U.S. with U.S. consumers increased by $2.5 trillion. The credit card debt is down by $100 billion. And our surveys tell us that the consumer is increasingly optimistic about the future that the worst is behind them that they are going to go on a vacation. And so I think that one statistic for March, we interpret as incredibly positive and speaks about what we think is going to be one amazing pent-up demand that's going to be -- is going to be unleashed, particularly for '22."

But 2022, especially out of the North American markets, the U.K. markets and so forth, look actually pretty similar to what you would see in a typical year. While the 2021 bookings, obviously, more recently have gravitated to the sailings that we have announced out of the Bahamas and Israel and so forth. 
So it's -- I think it's very clear, as Michael said, people are thinking that the worst is behind. There's a lot of these different statistics as it relates to credit card debt and savings and people's propensity to get back out there and vacation. And I think 2022 so far, looks like it's behaving like we saw pre-COVID."

Specifically with respect to Alaska, because, of course, Canada has put in place a stop until throughout the season. And so in order to restart the Alaskan season, we would either need a waiver from the passenger vessel services at or Canada would have to allow at least technical stops. And we're working on both and others are working on both, but we can't be certain where that will end up. 
But I think given the momentum, there's reason for some hope, but I think we're -- that's a sufficiently complex and confusing situation, but I don't think we're going to put odds on it one way or the other. I also think we need to be just a little bit careful when we're talking about reading into these bookings. There are still a lot of issues that have yet to be resolved with respect to the CDC and this order. 
The bookings that have taken place and have been in a period of high uncertainty. Are these cruises going to be sailing? Will they go where they want?  What will be the protocol?  So there's a lot of uncertainty. And while we try and read a lot into it, and the one thing that I think we are feeling comfortable about is that there is a lot of pent-up demand. There's too many fluid factors, I think, to read too much into some of the specifics of what is this particular meaning for, particularly '22. I think it's all terribly encouraging for '23 and it's very encouraging for '22. But the specifics of each of these is going to be difficult to read into until things calm down, and there's much more certainty about where it's leading to. 
But as to Alaska, I feel, specifically, while we're optimistic and we're working to make that happen, there are these other factors. We do think that we'll be in time for the Alaskan season. And we're obviously hopeful that we'll be able to solve the issue with Canada in either in 1 of these 2 ways."

Even though it's late February, I still want to say Happy New Year because I expect that this year will be so much better in so many ways than the last year. At the same time, it's hard to believe that we're only 7 weeks into 2021 because so much has already happened. It's been very intense in the last 1.5 months. And because things are happening so quickly, I think it's a good time to take a moment to review what we, at the Royal Caribbean Group, have been doing over the past year to adjust to the realities of the pandemic in the United States and wherever we sail and wherever we operate around the world.
As we've summarized on Slide 2, 2020 was an unprecedented year in which our teams took on and accomplished actions that were unthinkable just 12 months ago. I think that there was not one job that stayed the same. In a few months, our teams moved our whole fleet into layup. We patriated more than 45,000 crew members to their hundreds of home countries, restructured our workforce, implemented new credit programs for our guests, took care of our travel agents and raised billions of dollars in new capital, all while working from home. It's been incredibly challenging, but everybody seems to rise to the occasion. 
Now the most important point to keep in mind is that while most of our ships are still sitting idle, and while we suspended most of our global operations through April -- at least through April, our company has also been moving ahead to create the conditions and to prepare for a healthy return to sailing. As we continue to navigate this crisis, we've made continued progress on many fronts, as noted on Slide 3. I want to especially speak about how we're engaging with various stakeholders, particularly governments and other actors in the travel industry to ensure that we can ramp up and restart quickly. I'll let Jason talk about the initiatives that we've taken on the finance side.
First, let me recall what we've accomplished with our Healthy Sail Panel, of medical, public health, maritime, biosecurity and other experts. We've taken their 74 recommendations for a healthy return to service as the basis for over 2,000 separate protocols, from passenger testing before sailing, to physical distancing on board, to disembarkation of COVID-symptomatic persons. All of these things will give our guests, our crew and the destinations the confidence that the environment on the Royal Caribbean, Celebrity, Silversea or TUI Ship, is safer than a walk down Main Street.
We know that we not only need to provide an environment that protects our guests from COVID but also works to protect all of our people from having their vacations disrupted due to an isolated case. At the same time, we have to recognize that the panel's recommendations were intended to address a prevaccine environment. A lot has occurred over the last 4 months since their report was submitted. Not the least of which is that we're regularly vaccinating over 1.5 million people a day here in the United States and many elsewhere as well. 
And so we continue to work with the panel, led by Governor Mike Leavitt and Dr. Scott Gottlieb to identify the safest pathway forward in the new post-vaccine environment when we can protect our guests and crew as never before. And these conversations and the conclusions we draw from them will inform and advance our dialogue with governments around the world, including the CDC under its new leadership. 
At the same time, I believe strongly in the power of positive example. And in Singapore, we have a good one on how we can safely resume cruising while giving our guests the fun-filled experience they expect. We've been operating there since early December. And even before that, we've had successful operations which continue now in Germany and Canary Islands, Greece and the Middle East. 
These early returns to service not only provide vacations, but they provide an opportunity to demonstrate proof-of-concept as well. These early cruises provide valuable information about the best way to design and implement our health and safety protocols. They provide important learnings on how we can coordinate most effectively with governments, port authorities, travel partners and others to protect our guest, crew and the destinations we visit. These early cruises have also given us the opportunity to design new attractive itineraries where we can better control the experience.
Now after 11 months of pandemic, I think we all know that COVID fatigue is real. People are clamoring for the opportunity to have experience outside their homes. Every day, we see signs of people want to get out and get away. And once we're able to reopen and restart more broadly, we'll be ready to respond with our best-in-class hardware, including our new buildings, Odyssey of the Seas, Celebrity Apex and Silver Moon and our exclusive private destinations like Perfect Day at CocoCay.
Before I hand off to Jason, I do want to brag on our team just a little bit. Again, the dedication, commitment, and the integrity of our employees throughout this very difficult period has been exceptional. And their individual and combined contributions have been extraordinary. I am impressed every day by what they do. I also want to give a shout out to our loyal and committed travel partners for their ongoing support and to our investors for their trust. So thank you all. And now I'd like to turn it back over to Jason. Jason?"

This morning, we reported an adjusted net loss of $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020 and a $3.9 billion for the full year. Due to the suspension of our global operations, we were able to operate only 20% of the revenue",1414,"Great. Thank you, Richard. This morning, we reported an adjusted net loss of $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020 and a $3.9 billion for the full year. Due to the suspension of our global operations, we were able to operate only 20% of the revenue cruises initially expected in our February 2020 guidance. This simple stat reflects the staggering impact that the pandemic brought to our company and the whole industry during 2020.
In the fourth quarter, we were able to reduce our quarterly cruise operating expenses by more than 80% from $1.5 billion in Q4 of 2019 to $265 million in Q4 of 2020. We achieved this by expeditiously laying up our fleet and becoming extremely diligent, disciplined and agile in controlling our costs. Something similar can be said about our general CapEx, which were reduced by approximately 55% between 2020 and 2021. I am incredibly grateful of the efforts from the entire corporation in managing through the toughest year in our history.
From a financial standpoint, our top priority remains ensuring that we are in a strong liquidity position. While reducing our cash burn was and still is critical, another crucial liquidity action is accessing capital prudently and opportunistically while also managing our liabilities and our banking partners with our banking partners and export credit agencies.
Since we suspended our global cruise operations, we have raised about $9.3 billion in new capital and have secured agreements to defer almost $2 billion of ship-related debt through the spring of 2022. These later efforts are reducing our expected debt maturities for 2021 to approximately $400 million. These successful transactions and negotiations were possible due to the strength of our brands, the relevancy of our product, and the great relationships that were built during decades of collaborative work with banks, shipyards and vendors. I also want to highlight that this superb outcome was a huge undertaking executed by our amazing finance, legal and accounting teams.
Now regarding our current liquidity position, we closed 2020 fiscal year with $4.4 billion in available liquidity. We remain focused on further improving this position while also managing our operating and capital expenditures to ensure that our family of brands are well positioned for the return to service. I will stress that as we return to service and stabilize our operations, our cash flow will be primarily driven -- our cash will be the primary driver to delever our balance sheet, return to investment-grade and create great shareholder value.
As it pertains to our cash spend for the fourth quarter -- or during the fourth quarter, we spent approximately $1.3 billion, which includes the payment of approximately $300 million of bond that matured in November and approximately $180 million from collateral postings, commissions, and financing fees. When excluding these, our average cash burn rate was on the lower end of our previously announced range, driven by the phenomenal diligence of our teams and some timing. Furthermore, this morning, we reaffirmed that the cash burn will be on average in the range of approximately $250 million to $290 million per month during a prolonged suspension of operations.
Over the last year, we have executed several measures to structurally reduce our cost base, realign our capital allocation and improve our scale and margins. Besides reducing our G&A expenses and streamlining procurement efforts, we successfully divested 3 of our oldest ships and entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Azamara brand. Reshaping our fleets efficiency and the corporation cost structure will help accelerate our margins by improving our operating leverage as we return to service.
I will highlight that when we return to service and start to rev up our sales, we expect that customer deposits and cash flows from operations will further improve our cash position. At the same time, ramping up our business will also include start-up costs that relate to crewing our ships, health and safety protocols, and increased sales and marketing activities. Because the environment is still very fluid, we are not able to provide further guidance or commentary on these figures.
I will now provide an update on the booking environment and our capacity. While bookings remain below historical levels, we have been constantly impressed and humbled with a number of cruises booked throughout this extended out-of-service period. It's clear that a lot of people want to cruise. And we can't wait to welcome them back on board our amazing brands and ships.
Clearly, 2021 is not going to be a traditional year. And to this end, we did not plan for a traditional wave season. And therefore, our sales and marketing activities still remain anemic and extremely strategic. 
Currently, we don't expect to broadly ramp up our marketing until more ships come back into operation. Despite the lack of marketing spend, we have seen a 30% increase in new bookings since the beginning of the year when compared to November and December.
Our Lift & Shift and future cruise credit programs have been very successful in both preserving cash and driving demand for future periods. Having said this, I will highlight that from a cumulative standpoint, almost 75% of our book business is new and not related to rebooking activities. The cumulative book position for sailings in the second half of 2021 is aligned with our expectations in terms of resumption of cruising with pricing higher than 2019, both including and excluding the dilutive impact of future cruise credits. 
It is probably too early in the booking window to talk too much about 2022, but behavior to date is quite similar to booking activities in previous years. Our book position for the first half of 2022 is within historical ranges at higher average prices. As I noted, we are not expecting a traditional wave season. However, we did see a similar increase in 2022 bookings over the past 6 weeks to increases seen in prior years. We think that this is a very encouraging stat giving our muted sales and marketing efforts.
Regarding our deployment, we are not ready to announce any specific surrounding the cadence with which we will be bringing our fleet back into service. Currently, we have canceled sailings on most of our ships through the end of April. Our brands operate in multiple markets around the globe. Therefore, the timing and pace of the ramp-up in capacity will likely vary by region based on local conditions. We are already operating Quantum of the Seas in Singapore, and our second ship in the water could also be outside of the U.S. We're also using the learnings from Singapore as well as from our TUI Cruises joint venture who has had ship sailing in Europe and the Canary Islands since August and November, which is helping us inform on how the ships will return to service.
Our customer deposit balance at the end of December 2020 was $1.8 billion. This is relatively equal to the balances reported both at the end of September and at the end of June. We were able to maintain a similar customer deposit balance for 6 months despite the suspension of approximately 1,100 sailings because of the deposits collected on new bookings and the success of our future cruise certificates and Lift & Shift options. Just over half the guests who booked -- who were booked on canceled sailings have requested a cash refund, with the other half either holding an FCC or lifting and shifting their booking to a future cruise. Also, approximately half of our customer deposit balance is associated with FCCs, and moreover, about 30% of the overall balance is nonrefundable.
As it pertains to our expectations for 2021, I will note that the timing and trajectory of the recovery remains uncertain, and we are therefore unable to provide further guidance for the year. We do expect, however, to incur a net loss on both the U.S. GAAP and an adjusted basis for the first quarter and the full year of 2021. The magnitude of the loss will depend on many factors, including the timing and extent of our return to service. 
I will close my remarks by saying that we are clearly focused on what we can control. But as the vaccine distribution continues to accelerate, travel restrictions and advisories begin to ease and customer confidence begins to grow, we feel very optimistic about the future. With that, I will ask our operator to open up the call for a question-and-answer session. Shelby?"

Obviously, that's no longer the world in which we live in. So I'm just trying to figure out how the cruise experience is, what it's going to look like in 2021 and maybe beyond. So I guess for starters, the whole notion of a vaccine requirement on board -- some ships on board, all ships, maybe speak to that and maybe the CDC's willingness to let some ships sail earlier if you have a critical mass of people that have already been vaccinated."

We're really in an interim period where the vaccines are still relatively new. They're coming out amazingly quickly, but it still is going to take months to get huge numbers of people vaccinated. And so we and the CDC and then governments around the world are looking at how that would change it. And we don't have answers yet. 
I think one of the things everybody is looking to see is just how effective the vaccines are, and people actually want to see that happening. And one of the nice things we have is we can look at the example of Israel, where the vaccination level is one of the highest in the world. And therefore, they're able to make some very significant statistical correlations. And one of the things that you've seen coming out of there, for example, is that the number of people who get the disease or who have been vaccinated is the efficacy is as high or higher than the trials that were done, and this is now on larger numbers of people. So that makes it even more reliable.
But more significantly, they're also saying the ability to prevent the disease being serious in people is even better than that. So these are -- in the history of vaccines in the world, these are really exciting kinds of levels that give us all a lot of hope. But we really need to see it in practice, and it's really hard to say while we're not yet at a point where enough people have been vaccinated that you could say, okay, everybody on board will have been vaccinated, that sort of thing. But it is something we think that the vaccine is, of course, the ultimate weapon. And the fact that it is coming out and beginning to come out so quickly and that the pace of that is growing will be a basis for a new set of approaches. But we haven't -- we nor the governments around the world or the Healthy Sail Panel has yet have been able to define exactly what that will look like."

This opportunity came our way here with Sycamore. It gives Azamara an opportunity to grow. And I think that it's a great brand that we think will do quite well under this other venture.
I think moving into other ship sales and so forth, we remain opportunistic. I think we need to remember that prepandemic, all of these ships generated quite a bit of cash flow. And so it needs to -- for us, typically, the test on a ship is a little bit less -- it's a little bit less about the cash that we would receive. It's more strategic on whether we think this ship with -- whether it's in its current state or through some moderate investment is something that fits our brands -- or fit another brand within our organization or even with our JVs.

Yes, I mean, technically, the -- our operations in Europe are not subject to the CDC jurisdiction. But I think it's fair to say there's an awful lot of Americans who do fly out to Europe to join our European products, particularly for Royal and Celebrity. So nevertheless, we'll be guided by the protocols either through the Healthy Sail Panel or as they come from the European Union or the U.K. 
So we know that the operations in some of the European countries, particularly Germany, Italy have been ongoing for the past couple of months and the Canary Isles. And those protocols that have governed operations have basically been based on the Healthy Sail Panel or the clear member policies and then overlaid with specific instructions by the National Health Authority. I think what we're going to see is very similar to what we're going to see in the United States, which is as we continue to see infections decline and vaccines increase, then we're going to move to protocols that probably have some kind of high breadth between vaccines and testing. 
We are fortunate in a way that we're coming through the winter season. So it's incredibly low in terms of volume and revenue during the winter, but we're entering into the spring. And for the Royal Caribbean Group, we have multiple ships that are currently deployed into European operations. So it's going to be subject to the guidance from the European Union or U.K. authorities, and we imagine that they'll be very similar to the guidelines that we'll get from the CDC. Does that help?

As Richard commented in his opening comments, we're really pleased with the performance of Quantum in Singapore. It's been an incredible learning experience for our company, and it's been a remarkable example of great collaboration between cruise company and the Health Ministry and the government of Singapore. So we've been operating now for close to 3 months. We've carried probably around 35,000 Singaporeans on ocean cruises. The customer satisfaction ironically is higher with our protocols than it was before our protocols, which is quite funny in a way. And our revenue has exceeded our expectations, both from a ticket and an onboard revenue perspective. 
So the overall performance of our products has been really quite strong. It's subject to a series of protocols that as you question, probably very similar to a framework that we may be operating with in the future out of the U.S. or Europe. But it's a changing landscape. So what we've started with in Singapore in terms of protocols are already being reviewed. And there's -- in the coming weeks, we expect some of those protocols to be changed. For example, load factor constraint in the beginning of our Singapore operations was capped at 50%. We're now in discussions about increasing that cap to 65% in the coming weeks. And some of the testing regime has changed.
So one of the things that come from Quantum -- well, 2 things. One is that operationally, we've really begun to understand how we can work together with the Health Ministry to safely operate a large cruise ship during the COVID times. And we've also gained from our investment in technology. So there are 2 technologies that have come from Quantum that really are game changing. One is the e-mastering, which completely transforms the whole process of lifeboat mastering. And it's all done digitally through your iPhone or and an app. 
And the second is we've really developed technology for contact tracing using a combination of technologies. One of them is a Tracelet, which basically each guest wears and can tell exactly how long and they've been in contact with everybody else who's wearing a Tracelet. And then we have artificial intelligence connected into basically CTV cameras that use facial and body recognition to then double check and verify contact tracing in the event that somebody did have COVID onboard to ship. We've been fortunate that, that hasn't happened. But that technology development is really, we think, groundbreaking and very sophisticated.
And in our conversations that we had the week before last with the CDC, they specifically asked us to share that technology and what we've been doing in Singapore with them, which we've subsequently done. So there's a lot of lessons being learned. And I think, ultimately, it will create a foundation for how we'll operate. But again, the landscape is changing quite significantly as well with the vaccines and the interaction rate."

One of the things that we've seen after -- really after we came out of the holidays early in January is a proportional increase in the number of guests booking who were 65 plus. And that has continued to increase. So as the weeks have passed, our belief, we don't know if this is a fact, but our belief is, is that a 65-plus are getting vaccinated, then they're obviously becoming more comfortable with booking, and we're seeing that very much in our bookings from about January forward. 
So I think that's something that we think is a major positive. And obviously, as the vaccine spread down into the population by age group, we'll see that probably accelerate. And that's also true of Silversea which I think even before the holidays started to see an uplift in bookings coming in based upon age demographics. So that's -- we see that as a positive. And obviously, as this continues, we expect to see more bookings coming in by every age category."

What we have seen more recently that were brought back to where it was pre-COVID, there has been an increase in the first to cruise coming back into the space. 
The other point that I would just add is, and some of this I think is because people are being vaccinated, and to Michael's point of 65 plus. But as the distribution or [ shot in the arm ] of the vaccines are being rolled out, we're seeing that there's a pretty strong relationship to booking volumes and vaccines. And so that is I think something to point out that, one, there -- obviously, there are people 65 in order who are getting the vaccine, who are now becoming confident to travel. On the other side of it, it's also building confidence that we're getting closer to the other side of this, and people are beginning to realize that travel should be here sooner rather than later. And so I just want to make that point as well, is there seems to be a tight relationship to that."

We've been -- I mean, as you can imagine, we've been working on return to service for many, many months, and we have multiple teams who've been working on all of the logistics and operations of this. And of course, all of the lessons that we've been learning from Quantum have been applied to the whole corporation in terms of planning and logistics. So I think there's a lot of variables and then lot of dynamics in returning a fleet to operation, but we've obviously been doing it for many, many decades in terms of bringing new ships to life. And we put a lot of energy now behind ensuring that we understand how and what we need to do to bring our ships back.
One comment I'd like to make, which I think, is kind of interesting, and it's related to bringing our ships back and that is our crew members. We recently sent a survey to our entire crew database of around 70,000 employees. And we had 32,000 responses within 12 hours. And subsequently, within a couple of days, we've had 98% of all of our crew respond. And we asked them a couple of questions. 
We asked them, are they planning on returning to work with us? And the unanimous response was yes. We can't wait to come back. We spoke to them about vaccines and the probability that they will be required to be vaccinated to work on the ships and what did they think about that. 98% of the crew were completely in favor of that. And we also learned that over 4,000 of our crew have already been vaccinated at home. 
So that's another important element of return to service is the crew. And I think we are very encouraged by the results of the survey. And it literally was late last week. So I just wanted to give you that extra nugget of information."

It was the very first question we all went and double checked. And we're okay. So we do have ships that will fit into Cuba if that should come back. So we're okay there.
With regards to ships starting in Australia or China or Europe or elsewhere, for example, we literally are in discussions globally around the world with different governments and looking at where they are with COVID and vaccines, et cetera, et cetera. So I think the point is that there's a lot of opportunity that's starting to open up globally in terms of what's occurring with COVID. And so we are in discussions around the world. 
One of the products that we opened -- this is not a product that would be the next product for Royal Caribbean to open up, but we opened Grandeur of the Seas, home-porting in Barbados, sailing out of Barbados in November of '21 on a mix of 7 and 14 night cruises into the Southern Caribbean and really focused into the North American, American-Canadian and the U.K. market. And it has exceeded our expectations quite significantly. I mean we literally sold 25% of our load factor within a couple of weeks. So back to Jason's point, there's a lot of demand, we think, is building up globally for vacations and crews and for Royal Caribbean. So we're quite kind of optimistic about where this is heading."

Even though it's late February, I still want to say Happy New Year because I expect that this year will be so much better in so many ways than the last year. At the same time, it's hard to believe that we're only",935,"Thanks, Jason, and good morning, everyone. Even though it's late February, I still want to say Happy New Year because I expect that this year will be so much better in so many ways than the last year. At the same time, it's hard to believe that we're only 7 weeks into 2021 because so much has already happened. It's been very intense in the last 1.5 months. And because things are happening so quickly, I think it's a good time to take a moment to review what we, at the Royal Caribbean Group, have been doing over the past year to adjust to the realities of the pandemic in the United States and wherever we sail and wherever we operate around the world.
As we've summarized on Slide 2, 2020 was an unprecedented year in which our teams took on and accomplished actions that were unthinkable just 12 months ago. I think that there was not one job that stayed the same. In a few months, our teams moved our whole fleet into layup. We patriated more than 45,000 crew members to their hundreds of home countries, restructured our workforce, implemented new credit programs for our guests, took care of our travel agents and raised billions of dollars in new capital, all while working from home. It's been incredibly challenging, but everybody seems to rise to the occasion. 
Now the most important point to keep in mind is that while most of our ships are still sitting idle, and while we suspended most of our global operations through April -- at least through April, our company has also been moving ahead to create the conditions and to prepare for a healthy return to sailing. As we continue to navigate this crisis, we've made continued progress on many fronts, as noted on Slide 3. I want to especially speak about how we're engaging with various stakeholders, particularly governments and other actors in the travel industry to ensure that we can ramp up and restart quickly. I'll let Jason talk about the initiatives that we've taken on the finance side.
First, let me recall what we've accomplished with our Healthy Sail Panel, of medical, public health, maritime, biosecurity and other experts. We've taken their 74 recommendations for a healthy return to service as the basis for over 2,000 separate protocols, from passenger testing before sailing, to physical distancing on board, to disembarkation of COVID-symptomatic persons. All of these things will give our guests, our crew and the destinations the confidence that the environment on the Royal Caribbean, Celebrity, Silversea or TUI Ship, is safer than a walk down Main Street.
We know that we not only need to provide an environment that protects our guests from COVID but also works to protect all of our people from having their vacations disrupted due to an isolated case. At the same time, we have to recognize that the panel's recommendations were intended to address a prevaccine environment. A lot has occurred over the last 4 months since their report was submitted. Not the least of which is that we're regularly vaccinating over 1.5 million people a day here in the United States and many elsewhere as well. 
And so we continue to work with the panel, led by Governor Mike Leavitt and Dr. Scott Gottlieb to identify the safest pathway forward in the new post-vaccine environment when we can protect our guests and crew as never before. And these conversations and the conclusions we draw from them will inform and advance our dialogue with governments around the world, including the CDC under its new leadership. 
At the same time, I believe strongly in the power of positive example. And in Singapore, we have a good one on how we can safely resume cruising while giving our guests the fun-filled experience they expect. We've been operating there since early December. And even before that, we've had successful operations which continue now in Germany and Canary Islands, Greece and the Middle East. 
These early returns to service not only provide vacations, but they provide an opportunity to demonstrate proof-of-concept as well. These early cruises provide valuable information about the best way to design and implement our health and safety protocols. They provide important learnings on how we can coordinate most effectively with governments, port authorities, travel partners and others to protect our guest, crew and the destinations we visit. These early cruises have also given us the opportunity to design new attractive itineraries where we can better control the experience.
Now after 11 months of pandemic, I think we all know that COVID fatigue is real. People are clamoring for the opportunity to have experience outside their homes. Every day, we see signs of people want to get out and get away. And once we're able to reopen and restart more broadly, we'll be ready to respond with our best-in-class hardware, including our new buildings, Odyssey of the Seas, Celebrity Apex and Silver Moon and our exclusive private destinations like Perfect Day at CocoCay.
Before I hand off to Jason, I do want to brag on our team just a little bit. Again, the dedication, commitment, and the integrity of our employees throughout this very difficult period has been exceptional. And their individual and combined contributions have been extraordinary. I am impressed every day by what they do. I also want to give a shout out to our loyal and committed travel partners for their ongoing support and to our investors for their trust. So thank you all. And now I'd like to turn it back over to Jason. Jason?"

This morning, we reported an adjusted net loss of $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020 and a $3.9 billion for the full year. Due to the suspension of our global operations, we were able to operate only 20% of the revenue",1414,"Great. Thank you, Richard. This morning, we reported an adjusted net loss of $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020 and a $3.9 billion for the full year. Due to the suspension of our global operations, we were able to operate only 20% of the revenue cruises initially expected in our February 2020 guidance. This simple stat reflects the staggering impact that the pandemic brought to our company and the whole industry during 2020.
In the fourth quarter, we were able to reduce our quarterly cruise operating expenses by more than 80% from $1.5 billion in Q4 of 2019 to $265 million in Q4 of 2020. We achieved this by expeditiously laying up our fleet and becoming extremely diligent, disciplined and agile in controlling our costs. Something similar can be said about our general CapEx, which were reduced by approximately 55% between 2020 and 2021. I am incredibly grateful of the efforts from the entire corporation in managing through the toughest year in our history.
From a financial standpoint, our top priority remains ensuring that we are in a strong liquidity position. While reducing our cash burn was and still is critical, another crucial liquidity action is accessing capital prudently and opportunistically while also managing our liabilities and our banking partners with our banking partners and export credit agencies.
Since we suspended our global cruise operations, we have raised about $9.3 billion in new capital and have secured agreements to defer almost $2 billion of ship-related debt through the spring of 2022. These later efforts are reducing our expected debt maturities for 2021 to approximately $400 million. These successful transactions and negotiations were possible due to the strength of our brands, the relevancy of our product, and the great relationships that were built during decades of collaborative work with banks, shipyards and vendors. I also want to highlight that this superb outcome was a huge undertaking executed by our amazing finance, legal and accounting teams.
Now regarding our current liquidity position, we closed 2020 fiscal year with $4.4 billion in available liquidity. We remain focused on further improving this position while also managing our operating and capital expenditures to ensure that our family of brands are well positioned for the return to service. I will stress that as we return to service and stabilize our operations, our cash flow will be primarily driven -- our cash will be the primary driver to delever our balance sheet, return to investment-grade and create great shareholder value.
As it pertains to our cash spend for the fourth quarter -- or during the fourth quarter, we spent approximately $1.3 billion, which includes the payment of approximately $300 million of bond that matured in November and approximately $180 million from collateral postings, commissions, and financing fees. When excluding these, our average cash burn rate was on the lower end of our previously announced range, driven by the phenomenal diligence of our teams and some timing. Furthermore, this morning, we reaffirmed that the cash burn will be on average in the range of approximately $250 million to $290 million per month during a prolonged suspension of operations.
Over the last year, we have executed several measures to structurally reduce our cost base, realign our capital allocation and improve our scale and margins. Besides reducing our G&A expenses and streamlining procurement efforts, we successfully divested 3 of our oldest ships and entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Azamara brand. Reshaping our fleets efficiency and the corporation cost structure will help accelerate our margins by improving our operating leverage as we return to service.
I will highlight that when we return to service and start to rev up our sales, we expect that customer deposits and cash flows from operations will further improve our cash position. At the same time, ramping up our business will also include start-up costs that relate to crewing our ships, health and safety protocols, and increased sales and marketing activities. Because the environment is still very fluid, we are not able to provide further guidance or commentary on these figures.
I will now provide an update on the booking environment and our capacity. While bookings remain below historical levels, we have been constantly impressed and humbled with a number of cruises booked throughout this extended out-of-service period. It's clear that a lot of people want to cruise. And we can't wait to welcome them back on board our amazing brands and ships.
Clearly, 2021 is not going to be a traditional year. And to this end, we did not plan for a traditional wave season. And therefore, our sales and marketing activities still remain anemic and extremely strategic. 
Currently, we don't expect to broadly ramp up our marketing until more ships come back into operation. Despite the lack of marketing spend, we have seen a 30% increase in new bookings since the beginning of the year when compared to November and December.
Our Lift & Shift and future cruise credit programs have been very successful in both preserving cash and driving demand for future periods. Having said this, I will highlight that from a cumulative standpoint, almost 75% of our book business is new and not related to rebooking activities. The cumulative book position for sailings in the second half of 2021 is aligned with our expectations in terms of resumption of cruising with pricing higher than 2019, both including and excluding the dilutive impact of future cruise credits. 
It is probably too early in the booking window to talk too much about 2022, but behavior to date is quite similar to booking activities in previous years. Our book position for the first half of 2022 is within historical ranges at higher average prices. As I noted, we are not expecting a traditional wave season. However, we did see a similar increase in 2022 bookings over the past 6 weeks to increases seen in prior years. We think that this is a very encouraging stat giving our muted sales and marketing efforts.
Regarding our deployment, we are not ready to announce any specific surrounding the cadence with which we will be bringing our fleet back into service. Currently, we have canceled sailings on most of our ships through the end of April. Our brands operate in multiple markets around the globe. Therefore, the timing and pace of the ramp-up in capacity will likely vary by region based on local conditions. We are already operating Quantum of the Seas in Singapore, and our second ship in the water could also be outside of the U.S. We're also using the learnings from Singapore as well as from our TUI Cruises joint venture who has had ship sailing in Europe and the Canary Islands since August and November, which is helping us inform on how the ships will return to service.
Our customer deposit balance at the end of December 2020 was $1.8 billion. This is relatively equal to the balances reported both at the end of September and at the end of June. We were able to maintain a similar customer deposit balance for 6 months despite the suspension of approximately 1,100 sailings because of the deposits collected on new bookings and the success of our future cruise certificates and Lift & Shift options. Just over half the guests who booked -- who were booked on canceled sailings have requested a cash refund, with the other half either holding an FCC or lifting and shifting their booking to a future cruise. Also, approximately half of our customer deposit balance is associated with FCCs, and moreover, about 30% of the overall balance is nonrefundable.
As it pertains to our expectations for 2021, I will note that the timing and trajectory of the recovery remains uncertain, and we are therefore unable to provide further guidance for the year. We do expect, however, to incur a net loss on both the U.S. GAAP and an adjusted basis for the first quarter and the full year of 2021. The magnitude of the loss will depend on many factors, including the timing and extent of our return to service. 
I will close my remarks by saying that we are clearly focused on what we can control. But as the vaccine distribution continues to accelerate, travel restrictions and advisories begin to ease and customer confidence begins to grow, we feel very optimistic about the future. With that, I will ask our operator to open up the call for a question-and-answer session. Shelby?"

And so I think when you look at the first half of 2022, again, it's very, very early, the pricing that we're seeing relative to like-for-like for '19 shows that our APDs are up with or without any application of future cruise certificates."

Obviously, that's no longer the world in which we live in. So I'm just trying to figure out how the cruise experience is, what it's going to look like in 2021 and maybe beyond. So I guess for starters, the whole notion of a vaccine requirement on board -- some ships on board, all ships, maybe speak to that and maybe the CDC's willingness to let some ships sail earlier if you have a critical mass of people that have already been vaccinated."

We're really in an interim period where the vaccines are still relatively new. They're coming out amazingly quickly, but it still is going to take months to get huge numbers of people vaccinated. And so we and the CDC and then governments around the world are looking at how that would change it. And we don't have answers yet. 
I think one of the things everybody is looking to see is just how effective the vaccines are, and people actually want to see that happening. And one of the nice things we have is we can look at the example of Israel, where the vaccination level is one of the highest in the world. And therefore, they're able to make some very significant statistical correlations. And one of the things that you've seen coming out of there, for example, is that the number of people who get the disease or who have been vaccinated is the efficacy is as high or higher than the trials that were done, and this is now on larger numbers of people. So that makes it even more reliable.
But more significantly, they're also saying the ability to prevent the disease being serious in people is even better than that. So these are -- in the history of vaccines in the world, these are really exciting kinds of levels that give us all a lot of hope. But we really need to see it in practice, and it's really hard to say while we're not yet at a point where enough people have been vaccinated that you could say, okay, everybody on board will have been vaccinated, that sort of thing. But it is something we think that the vaccine is, of course, the ultimate weapon. And the fact that it is coming out and beginning to come out so quickly and that the pace of that is growing will be a basis for a new set of approaches. But we haven't -- we nor the governments around the world or the Healthy Sail Panel has yet have been able to define exactly what that will look like."

This opportunity came our way here with Sycamore. It gives Azamara an opportunity to grow. And I think that it's a great brand that we think will do quite well under this other venture.
I think moving into other ship sales and so forth, we remain opportunistic. I think we need to remember that prepandemic, all of these ships generated quite a bit of cash flow. And so it needs to -- for us, typically, the test on a ship is a little bit less -- it's a little bit less about the cash that we would receive. It's more strategic on whether we think this ship with -- whether it's in its current state or through some moderate investment is something that fits our brands -- or fit another brand within our organization or even with our JVs. And that's kind of how we look at it, and I think we'll remain opportunistic."

Yes, I mean, technically, the -- our operations in Europe are not subject to the CDC jurisdiction. But I think it's fair to say there's an awful lot of Americans who do fly out to Europe to join our European products, particularly for Royal and Celebrity. So nevertheless, we'll be guided by the protocols either through the Healthy Sail Panel or as they come from the European Union or the U.K. 
So we know that the operations in some of the European countries, particularly Germany, Italy have been ongoing for the past couple of months and the Canary Isles. And those protocols that have governed operations have basically been based on the Healthy Sail Panel or the clear member policies and then overlaid with specific instructions by the National Health Authority. I think what we're going to see is very similar to what we're going to see in the United States, which is as we continue to see infections decline and vaccines increase, then we're going to move to protocols that probably have some kind of high breadth between vaccines and testing. 
We are fortunate in a way that we're coming through the winter season. So it's incredibly low in terms of volume and revenue during the winter, but we're entering into the spring. And for the Royal Caribbean Group, we have multiple ships that are currently deployed into European operations. So it's going to be subject to the guidance from the European Union or U.K. authorities, and we imagine that they'll be very similar to the guidelines that we'll get from the CDC. Does that help?

As Richard commented in his opening comments, we're really pleased with the performance of Quantum in Singapore. It's been an incredible learning experience for our company, and it's been a remarkable example of great collaboration between cruise company and the Health Ministry and the government of Singapore. So we've been operating now for close to 3 months. We've carried probably around 35,000 Singaporeans on ocean cruises. The customer satisfaction ironically is higher with our protocols than it was before our protocols, which is quite funny in a way. And our revenue has exceeded our expectations, both from a ticket and an onboard revenue perspective. 
So the overall performance of our products has been really quite strong. It's subject to a series of protocols that as you question, probably very similar to a framework that we may be operating with in the future out of the U.S. or Europe. But it's a changing landscape. So what we've started with in Singapore in terms of protocols are already being reviewed. And there's -- in the coming weeks, we expect some of those protocols to be changed. For example, load factor constraint in the beginning of our Singapore operations was capped at 50%. We're now in discussions about increasing that cap to 65% in the coming weeks. And some of the testing regime has changed.
So one of the things that come from Quantum -- well, 2 things. One is that operationally, we've really begun to understand how we can work together with the Health Ministry to safely operate a large cruise ship during the COVID times. And we've also gained from our investment in technology. So there are 2 technologies that have come from Quantum that really are game changing. One is the e-mastering, which completely transforms the whole process of lifeboat mastering. And it's all done digitally through your iPhone or and an app. 
And the second is we've really developed technology for contact tracing using a combination of technologies. One of them is a Tracelet, which basically each guest wears and can tell exactly how long and they've been in contact with everybody else who's wearing a Tracelet. And then we have artificial intelligence connected into basically CTV cameras that use facial and body recognition to then double check and verify contact tracing in the event that somebody did have COVID onboard to ship. We've been fortunate that, that hasn't happened. But that technology development is really, we think, groundbreaking and very sophisticated.
And in our conversations that we had the week before last with the CDC, they specifically asked us to share that technology and what we've been doing in Singapore with them, which we've subsequently done. So there's a lot of lessons being learned. And I think, ultimately, it will create a foundation for how we'll operate. But again, the landscape is changing quite significantly as well with the vaccines and the interaction rate."

So I think that's something that we think is a major positive. And obviously, as the vaccine spread down into the population by age group, we'll see that probably accelerate. And that's also true of Silversea which I think even before the holidays started to see an uplift in bookings coming in based upon age demographics. So that's -- we see that as a positive.

The other point that I would just add is, and some of this I think is because people are being vaccinated, and to Michael's point of 65 plus. But as the distribution or [ shot in the arm ] of the vaccines are being rolled out, we're seeing that there's a pretty strong relationship to booking volumes and vaccines. And so that is I think something to point out that, one, there -- obviously, there are people 65 in order who are getting the vaccine, who are now becoming confident to travel. On the other side of it, it's also building confidence that we're getting closer to the other side of this, and people are beginning to realize that travel should be here sooner rather than later. And so I just want to make that point as well, is there seems to be a tight relationship to that."

We've been -- I mean, as you can imagine, we've been working on return to service for many, many months, and we have multiple teams who've been working on all of the logistics and operations of this. And of course, all of the lessons that we've been learning from Quantum have been applied to the whole corporation in terms of planning and logistics. So I think there's a lot of variables and then lot of dynamics in returning a fleet to operation, but we've obviously been doing it for many, many decades in terms of bringing new ships to life. And we put a lot of energy now behind ensuring that we understand how and what we need to do to bring our ships back.
One comment I'd like to make, which I think, is kind of interesting, and it's related to bringing our ships back and that is our crew members. We recently sent a survey to our entire crew database of around 70,000 employees. And we had 32,000 responses within 12 hours. And subsequently, within a couple of days, we've had 98% of all of our crew respond. And we asked them a couple of questions. 
We asked them, are they planning on returning to work with us? And the unanimous response was yes. We can't wait to come back. We spoke to them about vaccines and the probability that they will be required to be vaccinated to work on the ships and what did they think about that. 98% of the crew were completely in favor of that. And we also learned that over 4,000 of our crew have already been vaccinated at home. 
So that's another important element of return to service is the crew. And I think we are very encouraged by the results of the survey. And it literally was late last week. So I just wanted to give you that extra nugget of information."

One of the products that we opened -- this is not a product that would be the next product for Royal Caribbean to open up, but we opened Grandeur of the Seas, home-porting in Barbados, sailing out of Barbados in November of '21 on a mix of 7 and 14 night cruises into the Southern Caribbean and really focused into the North American, American-Canadian and the U.K. market. And it has exceeded our expectations quite significantly. I mean we literally sold 25% of our load factor within a couple of weeks.

You all know it's been almost 1.5 years since the onset of the pandemic and it's certainly been a difficult [indiscernible] virtual standstill in this long period. And there's no business school that has a course in how to succeed in business with 0 revenue. Fortunately, our people are responding well to these unprecedented challenges, and I'm very proud of the progress that they have produced. 
Today, we are reporting another painful set of financial results, but we're also reporting on the dramatic progress on the restarting of our operations and the continued strength in the demand environment for our leading brands. Most importantly, we have already restarted almost half of our capacity, and we're bringing more online as we speak. Our protocols appear to be working very well, which gives us and our guests comfort about the safety on board. Lastly, bookings are remarkably strong, especially for 2022. 
I would like to address these 3 issues in order. First, I want to talk about the process of restarting; second, our operational protocols and their impact; and then lastly, come back to our booking outlook. 
Now starting with the process of resuming operations. It seems like only yesterday that people were asking me, [indiscernible] cruising would we start by December? Suddenly, we have half of our ship sailing on revenue cruises. We know that it's going to take us a while to return to full normalcy. But while people are emerging from isolation, it's clearly going to take them a while, I feel totally comfortable. We believe that the best way to get them comfortable is to demonstrate just how well the process works. We call that the flywheel effect. Once we get the vast majority of our fleet back online and thousands of people sailing safely, it will make even more people feel comfortable doing the same thing. Once the flywheel starts spinning, it keeps spinning and the machinery keeps getting more powerful. 
Now some of you have asked why we were the first to restart in the states and how we've gotten our ships operating so quickly. The answer is simply that we started earlier, and we have the very best people in the business who have been very aggressive in implementing the new protocols. We started preparing before we have official word that we would be allowed to sail but at the point where we thought the approval was inevitable. And our people have worked hard in diligently to make sure that our ships could be back in the water quickly. Also, thanks to the large part to the vaccine rollout, society has been progressing faster towards normalcy, which has maximized the pace of our recovery. 
In this accelerated return to service, the health and safety of our passengers and crew remain a top priority. For every ship that we restart, we have committed to 3 pillars: first, our ship experiences are as safe or safer the shoreside equivalents; second, meeting and exceeding our [ exacting ] prepandemic expectations, especially in regard to guest experience; and three, doing so in a financially prudent manner. 
Now turning to the second item on my risk. I think it's important to talk about the safety protocols related to COVID. As you all know, our goal from the beginning of the pandemic has been to make cruising not just as safe as comparable to land vacations but safer. We believe that the unique avenue of the cruise ship could allow us to control the environment to an unusual extent. We can ensure a level of vaccinations and testing that would be impossible for most other places to even contemplate. 
Specifically, we require 100% of the crew to be fully vaccinated. And we require the bulk of our guests to be fully vaccinated as well. The only exceptions are children under 12, and in Florida, a minor number of people who choose not to get vaccinated. 
Excluding Singapore, which is a special case, an average of 92% of the people on board our ships in July were fully vaccinated. And this number is likely to rise going forward. The idea is to limit the spread of COVID-19 aboard our ships. We all know it's impossible to eliminate cases on board a ship totally, just as it's impossible to eliminate cases on land. But the steps that we are taking are designed to prevent the isolated cases from becoming an outbreak and it seems to be working. We have had people test positive, but because almost everyone around them is vaccinated, they've remained isolated cases. That's the goal, [ where ] individual cases and no significant spread. Repeat this with a few hundred thousand of [indiscernible] cruises, and that creates the trust that will drive our [indiscernible]. 
Now the Delta variant is problematic for everyone, but even this looks manageable by our extensive protocols. It's too early to draw definitive conclusions, but the vaccines are the ultimate weapon, and they work. Our experience shows that while there are breakthrough cases aboard, the vaccines help keep them contained. In fact, and I thought this was quite unusual, in most of our positive cases, even the cabin mate of the infected individual has tested negative. 
But in light of the Delta variant and other variants, we have recently strengthened our protocols further, even more testing and even more people required to be vaccinated than we had in June and July. We have gone from [indiscernible] cruises being a source of concern to cruises being an exemplar for how to deal with COVID-19. I'm thrilled that we're making this dream a reality.  
That brings us to how our customers are responding. And fortunately, that outlook is good. Our guests are eager to cruise again. We had hoped that there would be pent-up demand for cruises, but even we were surprised by the level that we're seeing. We are also encouraged by the improvements we're seeing more broadly across the travel industry. Cruise consideration remains high among active cruisers and is steadily increasing among non-cruisers. It is clear people are eager to travel to take a vacation and we are ready to make their vacation dreams come true. Jason is going to speak more about our booking trends in a moment. 
Now we all know it's going to take some time for the situation to settle. There's still a lot of confusion in the marketplace, and that definitely hurts the next few months or so. In addition, people usually book their cruise vacations well in advance. It will take some time for us to catch up with the bookings that we didn't arrange or we didn't up until now. 
But if we only obsess about the present, we will fail to prepare for the future. We must keep our eye firmly on the future that we can see is coming. We need to prepare ourselves forward, so we are focusing our thoughts, our efforts and our plans on that future. 
While the third and fourth quarter of this year will continue to be painful, this booking is generally in line with our return to service and occupancy ramp-up expectations. Due mainly to the timing of the ramp-up in service and we have normal booking window, we don't expect 2022 to be a normal year. However, we are seeing rapid and steady progress towards normalcy starting in the spring and summer of next year. 
One important additional point is that we are not only in the business of delivering the best vacations possible but also doing it sustainably. The company's commitment to corporate stewardship remains a priority even during our return to service. Despite pandemic headwinds, the company has made tremendous progress across environmental, social and governmental governance focus areas. Some of the key achievements include a 35% reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions from our 2005 baseline. We removed 60% of single-use plastics from our supply chain. 60% of our ships are equipped with emissions purification systems that remove 98% of sulfur oxide. And our newer ships are equipped with Selective Catalytic Reduction, which reduces NOx emissions. We've reduced waste to an infill by 85% from our 2007 baseline. And we've also completed the introduction of over 2,000 certified tutors and assessments by the global sustainability tourism Counselor. 
One interesting point is that our wind farm that spans 20,000 acres in Northern Kansas has 62 turbines with a total power generation capability of 200 megawatts. It's now been operational for more than a year. It will annually generate 760,000 megawatt hours of carbon-free energy. That's saving some 500,000 tons in carbon. And to put it in perspective, it's the equivalent to the energy use of about 60,000 homes.

Our press release covered other initiatives in accordance with our -- and in accordance with our mantra of continuous improvement, we will continue to elevate and we will introduce new initiatives to improve all of our ESG efforts across the board. 
The last [indiscernible] months have caused much pain of suffering, but the tide is clearly [indiscernible] I'd like to thank our Board of Directors for their support and dedication. I also want to thank our partner organizations and communities for staying the course and preparing for the future. But most of all, I want to thank the men and women of the Royal Caribbean group for their tireless efforts under the most challenging circumstances. Their dedication to seeing us see this Black Swan event in the best way possible is [indiscernible] short of extraordinary. So I look forward to some of your days ahead. And with that, I'll turn it back to you, Jason."

This has been",1379,"Thank you, Richard. Before I start, like Richard, I also want to thank our teams across the whole enterprise for their tireless dedication to rapidly bringing our fleet back into service in a safe, healthy and financially responsible manner. This has been accomplished through impressive interdepartmental collaboration, many, many sleepless nights. And for that, we are really forever grateful. 
I will now turn to discuss our performance for the second quarter. This morning, we reported an adjusted net loss of $1.3 billion or a loss of $5.06 per share for the second quarter of 2021. While these losses are incredibly painful, the second quarter was a turning point for the company on multiple fronts. First, we welcomed an additional 10 ships back into service after 15 months of minimal cruise activity. Second, we took financing actions to reduce our negative carry and began our journey back to an unencumbered and pre-COVID balance sheet. And third, we saw a significant increase in booking activities that resulted in a large increase in our customer deposits. 
As we shared this morning, our customer deposit balance as of June 30 was $2.4 billion, which is about 30% higher than the balance at the end of the first quarter. And as of today, our customer deposit balance is $2.5 billion. At this point, a little over 35% of our customer deposit balance is associated with FCCs compared to about 45% at the time of our last call, signaling continued strong demand. 
On the liquidity front, we closed the second quarter with $5 billion in liquidity. As you all know, we pride ourselves on having industry-leading brands with a world-class and highly innovative fleet and a history of strong financial discipline and performance. These assets and attributes have been instrumental in helping us raise more than $13 billion of new capital since March of last year. 
During the second quarter, we continued our efforts to manage and improve our balance sheet. And to that end, we successfully issued $650 million of senior unsecured notes at 4.25% and used those proceeds to redeem [indiscernible] senior secured notes in full. This will generate approximately $17 million of cash savings annually beginning in 2022. 
We are delighted with the current momentum and the restart of our operations in the United States and around the globe. The environment remains fluid, and for this reason, we are not providing a cash burn estimate or the related offsets generated by revenue and new customer deposits. I will highlight that the burn rate for the ships that are kept at layoff is expected to be consistent with our previous expectations. 
Now as it pertains to our debt maturities, our scheduled debt maturities for the remainder of this year and 2022 are $21 million and $2.2 billion. 
I will now update you on capacity and the booking environment. After more than a full year of painful financial losses, a never ending roller coaster of ups and downs regarding the timing of our return to service, multiple liquidity actions and very little cruise capacity, we are now finally bringing our fleet back into service and are already welcoming thousands of guests back on board each week. In fact, we are thrilled to have welcomed more than 136,000 guests on board our 5 brands during the first half of the year. 
The pace with which our teams have been able to bring ships out of layup and ready them for guest is nothing short of incredible. It is amazing to think that at the end of April we only had 4 ships delivering incredible vacations across our 5 brands. And as we sit today, there are guests sailing on 29 of our 60 ships in the Caribbean, Europe, Asia, Alaska, Iceland and the Galapagos. 
We are also in the process of ramping up 7 more ships to be welcoming guests this month. As a result, we anticipate having about 65% of our fleet in service at the end of the third quarter and approximately 80% of the fleet back in operation by the end of the year. 
When considering our plans to ramp up capacity, the 1 area we continue to watch is the Asia Pacific region. And for purposes of our return to service planning, we have been cautious. 
Now I'll give you an update on bookings. Bookings are still below 2019 levels due in part to our reduced capacity for 2021 and the fact that many sailings were announced very close in with little time to build business. However, the gap narrowed further during the second quarter and we received about 50% more bookings in Q2 than during the previous 3 months, with trends improving 1 month to the next. By June, we were receiving about 90% more bookings each week when compared to Q1, with bookings for 2022 practically back to 2019 levels. 
As it relates to Delta variant, we have mainly seen small variations with closer-in bookings in markets with high case counts. However, July was our second highest booking month [indiscernible] and bookings for 2022 are strong. We are particularly encouraged by the continued strong demand for the important spring and summer months. 
The health and safety of our guests and crew is our #1 priority. And as such, our start-up strategy incorporates low initial occupancies to give the crew the opportunity to seamlessly implement the new protocols and facilitate amazing vacations in this new and constantly changing environment. 
After each ship gets a few voyages under their belt, our plan is for our load factors to steadily increase from 1 month to the next. This is evident in our fleet where several of our ships are now sailing with more than 50% load factors. 
Overall, the booking activity for 2021 sailings is consistent with our expected capacity and occupancy ramp-up at prices that are higher than 2019. We are also seeing record Net Promoter Scores as well as record onboard revenue for the ships that have resumed service. This is very encouraging as we are not only seeing pent-up demand for cruises, but we are also seeing pent-up demand for our onboard revenue experiences. Guests are really enjoying our [indiscernible] casinos, bars and restaurants after spending a year in isolation. We are also seeing an increased demand for our WiFi services as more and more consumers have flexibility to take vacations [indiscernible]. 
Looking further forward, we continue to be impressed by the demand and pricing we've seen for 2022 sales. It is still a bit early in the booking window to provide too much color for next year, but I will share that our book load factors continue to be well within historical ranges at prices that are up nicely versus 2019, including the dilutive impact of FCCs. While we were still in the early stages of the planning cycle for 2022, we do expect lower-than-average load factors for the first quarter as several ships will still be in ramp-up mode after having recently returned to service. That being said, the first quarter is booked within historical ranges. In addition, load factors are at the higher end of historical ranges for the back half of the year, with Q3 currently in a particularly strong position. 
Underpinning this is a strong customer deposit profile for 2022. Customer deposits for 2022 are significantly higher than the same time in 2019. This demand and booking profile is quite encouraging, considering that we have only been spending about 1/4 of our typical sales and marketing spend. 
We are also optimistic that a number of larger macro indicators will provide further tailwinds to our future demand, increased vaccination rates around the globe, sharp increases in consumer confidence and significant increases in [indiscernible] rate versus the same time 2 years ago. 
I will close by saying that we are thrilled for the flywheel to be spinning at such an accelerating pace. We have been dreaming at this moment for more than 16 months, and it's finally here. We feel very optimistic about our future and are thrilled to see more and more guests than in the United States and around the globe enjoy incredible vacations on board our ships. 
And with that, I will ask Shelby to open up the call for a question-and-answer session."

And then my other question, and I hate to be so short-term focused, but I just know that investors are very focused on the comment in the release about the near term being impacted by Delta. And I know you quantified that July was the second highest month of the year. So I guess that means sort of down sequentially a little bit from June, which June was 90% better than Q1. I guess I don't know do you feel that, that -- the impact of that has sort of stabilized at that level, that as you're moving into August here, that August would be similar to July?

Robin, in terms of Delta from the perspective of the customer and the booking environment, I think I would say in the last 2 weeks, we've seen very positive growth in demand. As we moved through the spring with vaccination, as we announced return to service and as customers saw our ships return, we really did enter into a very positive booking environment. And I think over the last 2 weeks, the positive environment continues, but it hasn't been at such a trajectory as it was. But it's really short term. When you look into '22, we see no material impact at all on the increases in bookings for '22. So I think -- I think customers, consumers now see this for what it is. It's a blip and a bump. I think we feel encouraged by the protocols that we've got in place, as Richard mentioned in his opening comments. We've been very encouraged to see that when we do have a positive COVID case onboard our ships, we very quickly contact trace, test. And what we find is that very often, you may have a COVID positive either from a vaccinated or unvaccinated guest, and they'll be in the very same room with somebody who's vaccinated and they test negative. So the vaccines are really working. I think vaccination population, so to speak, as Richard mentioned, I think in the month of July, we -- our ship sails were at around 92% of the entire community vaccinated. And in the month of July, we were [indiscernible] kids from the 12 to 16 were vaccinated. Starting on August 1, that number has dropped down because our policy requires you to be back vaccinated [ 12 and up ]. 
So I think the good news is, if there is good news with the Delta variant, is that people are becoming far more accustomed to this. If you've got a highly vaccinated population, there's minimal impact. And I think, increasingly, as our ships sail, as we encounter this, we communicate, we're very transparent. The feedback we get from our customers is recognition and relief that this is very contained and something that's going to pass."

Clearly, today's countries are doing more local. So you see a tremendous growth, actually surprising, in domestic travel and domestic -- particularly domestic air and other domestic travel as opposed to international travel. But the other thing that we've seen in this is how quickly it all changes. And we've -- I mean if you just look at this, we've gone from people wondering whether we're going to be back in service at all this year to half our fleet back in a matter of weeks. I mean it's kind of happening so quickly. And I think we see the same sort of thing. There's tremendous restrictions on international travel today. But at the same time that the U.S. decided to extend [indiscernible], you saw the U.K. the easing restrictions and you're seeing in Europe. So I think the vaccine is the game changer here. And it is working. And as it becomes -- more and more people are getting it. And you've seen a bit of already in the unvaccinated getting vaccinated. 
But you're also seeing it working in Europe. So just a few weeks ago, Europe was way behind the curve on vaccinations. And they've ramped up to now they're equal or, in many cases, ahead of the U.S. 
Australia and New Zealand, which initially focused -- and in fact, much of Asia, it's initially focused not on vaccines, but in isolation and having domestic travel being the key, have shifted. And while they are low on vaccinations compared to the U.S. and Europe, they're rapidly fixing that. 
So I think it's an uncertain period. But I think what we would expect is for months now, we will see restrictions and people staying closer to home. I think there is a yearning to get out there. And once the vaccines get out there, once they areeven more widely distributed, you'll see more international travel. 
So that takes a while, and international travel also tends to book farther in advance. So you would expect international travel for the first quarter to be -- a lot of that to be arranged already. 
So the fact that we haven't been booking, it means that the first quarter is going to be weak on that count. And I think as we're looking forward in the year, we're seeing people really expect things to move back to normal. And we're seeing international travel back to normal. And so once we get into the spring and summer, we are really very encouraged by what we're envisioning."

What we are seeing, as you can see here, is demand for the future periods is exceptionally strong. And so our teams are always very kind of thoughtful about that. But we are generating, not just for 2022, we're also generating demand for 2023 and even a little bit for '24 for brands that you're seeing."

I think we're feeling pretty optimistic about the opportunity that's in front of us. When we think about our marketing investment, marketing activity and spend over the past several months all the way through this year, it has been -- we've reduced it incredibly. And yet the demand that we've seen coming through the door is being really strong. So we've seen demand almost at the same level as '19 and it continues. And yet ironically, our investment has been remarkably low. So we are thinking that as we move through into September, and of course, we're mindful of the Delta variant, but when we really do go to market, we think that there's going to be significant opportunity for us. So we're quite thoughtful about this. 
So one of the things that we were very thoughtful about, of course, is pricing. And we're already seeing that not only are people spending up, but we're seeing that in our onboard spend. So I think Jason commented earlier that we've been incredibly encouraged by the spending onboard our ships that we've already started operating. In fact, the numbers have been very impressive. 
So we think that there's an opportunity. And I think when we really go to market in a positive way as we move into the fourth quarter, we're encouraged by what we think is going to happen in terms of demand."

I think, actually, the booking curve has shortened because we don't have -- we didn't have the wave period this year that would have given us a base for 2022 and even in 2023. And so I think, if anything, it's actually gotten shorter because of the uncertainty and because of the fact that this is only ramping up very quickly. 
Our objective is to get it back, the longer booking curve is helpful to us. It's also helpful in our yield management models. And so we want that to happen. And yes, we will be investing in marketing. It's one of the things market investors does do. So even the demand has been pretty good, we're never satisfied with demand. And if we can ramp up more demand and particularly on short notice, so we will have a period where we have to sell in the short term as well as generate the long term. 
The other thing that is you asked about first-time cruises or it's kind of people who haven't cruised before, there's no question that, that is a real opportunity for us that we want to be exploring going forward."

And ther",1647,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us on the call today. You all know it's been almost 1.5 years since the onset of the pandemic and it's certainly been a difficult time.  We've been in a virtual standstill in this long period. And there's no business school that has a course in how to succeed in business with 0 revenue.  
Fortunately, our people are responding well to these unprecedented challenges, and I'm very proud of the progress that they have produced.  
Today, we are reporting another painful set of financial results, but we're also reporting on the dramatic progress on the restarting of our operations and the continued strength in the demand environment for our leading brands. Most importantly, we have already restarted almost half of our capacity, and we're bringing more online as we speak. Our protocols appear to be working very well, which gives us and our guests comfort about their safety on board. Lastly, bookings are remarkably strong, especially for 2022.  
I would like to address these 3 issues in order. First, I want to talk about the process of restarting; second, our operational protocols and their impact; and then lastly, come back to our booking outlook.  
Now starting with the process of resuming operations. It seems like only yesterday that people were asking me if I thought cruising would restart by December. Suddenly, we have half of our ship sailing on revenue cruises. We know that it's going to take us a while to return to full normalcy. But while people are emerging from isolation, it's clearly going to take them a while to feel totally comfortable. We believe that the best way to get them comfortable is to demonstrate just how well the process works. We call that the flywheel effect. Once we get the vast majority of our fleet back online and thousands of people sailing safely, it will make even more people feel comfortable doing the same thing. Once the flywheel starts spinning, it keeps spinning and the machinery keeps getting more powerful.  
Now some of you have asked why we were the first to restart in the States and how we've gotten our ships operating so quickly. The answer is simply that we started earlier, and we have the very best people in the business who have been very aggressive in implementing the new protocols. We started preparing before we had official word that we would be allowed to sail but at the point where we thought the approval was inevitable. And our people have worked hard and diligently to make sure that our ships could be back in the water quickly.  
Also, thanks in large part to the vaccine rollout, society has been progressing faster towards normalcy, which has maximized the pace of our recovery.  
In this accelerated return to service, the health and safety of our passengers and crew remain a top priority. For every ship that we restart, we have committed to 3 pillars: first, ensuring our ship experiences are as safe or safer than their shoreside equivalents; second, meeting and exceeding our exacting pre-pandemic expectations, especially in regard to guest experience; and three, doing so in a financially prudent manner.  
Now turning to the second item on my list. I think it's important to talk about the safety protocols related to COVID. As you all know, our goal from the beginning of the pandemic has been to make cruising not just as safe as comparable to land vacations but safer. We believe that the unique attributes of a cruise ship could allow us to control the environment to an unusual extent. We can ensure a level of vaccinations and testing that would be impossible for most other places to even contemplate.  
Specifically, we require 100% of the crew to be fully vaccinated. And we require the bulk of our guests to be fully vaccinated as well. The only exceptions are children under 12, and in Florida, a minor number of people who choose not to get vaccinated.  
Excluding Singapore, which is a special case, an average of 92% of the people on board our ships in July were fully vaccinated. And this number is likely to rise going forward. The idea is to limit the spread of COVID-19 aboard our ships. We all know it's impossible to eliminate cases on board a ship totally, just as it's impossible to eliminate cases on land. But the steps that we are taking are designed to prevent the isolated cases from becoming an outbreak and it seems to be working. We have had people test positive. But because almost everyone around them is vaccinated, they've remained isolated cases. That's the goal, rare individual cases and no significant spread. Repeat this with a few hundred thousand or million cruisers, and that creates the trust that will drive our resurgence.
Now the Delta variant is problematic for everyone, but even this looks manageable by our extensive protocols. It's too early to draw definitive conclusions, but the vaccines are the ultimate weapon, and they work. Our experience shows that while there are breakthrough cases aboard, the vaccines help keep them contained. In fact, and I thought this was quite unusual, in most of our positive cases, even the cabin mate of the infected individual has tested negative.  
But in light of the Delta variant and other variants, we have recently strengthened our protocols further, even more testing and even more people required to be vaccinated than we had in June and July. We have gone from cruises being a source of concern to cruises being an exemplar for how to deal with COVID-19. I'm thrilled that we're making this dream a reality.   
And that brings us to how our customers are responding. And fortunately, that outlook is good. Our guests are eager to cruise again. We had hoped that there would be pent-up demand for cruises, but even we were surprised by the level that we're seeing. We are also encouraged by the improvements we're seeing more broadly across the travel industry. Cruise consideration remains high among active cruisers and is steadily increasing among non-cruisers. It is clear people are eager to travel to take a vacation, and we are ready to make their vacation dreams come true. Jason is going to speak more about our booking trends in a moment.  
Now we all know it's going to take some time for the situation to settle. There's still a lot of confusion in the marketplace, and that definitely hurts the next few months or so. In addition, people usually book their cruise vacations well in advance. It will take some time for us to catch up with the bookings that we didn't arrange or we didn't get up until now.  
But if we only obsess about the present, we will fail to prepare for the future. We must keep our eye firmly on that future that we can see is coming. We need to prepare ourselves for it, so we are focusing our thoughts, our efforts and our plans on that future.  
While the third and fourth quarter of this year will continue to be painful, it's booking generally in line with our return to service and occupancy ramp-up expectations. Due mainly to the timing of the ramp-up in service and the abnormal booking window, we don't expect 2022 to be a normal year. However, we are seeing rapid and steady progress towards normalcy starting in the spring and summer of next year.  
One important additional point is that we are not only in the business of delivering the best vacations possible but also doing it sustainably. The company's commitment to corporate stewardship remains a priority even during our return to service. Despite pandemic headwinds, the company has made tremendous progress across environmental, social and governmental governance focus areas. Some of the key achievements include a 35% reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions from our 2005 baseline. We removed 60% of single-use plastics from our supply chain. 60% of our ships are equipped with emissions purification systems that remove 98% of sulfur oxides. And our newer ships are equipped with Selective Catalytic Reduction, which reduces NOx emissions. We've reduced waste to landfill by 85% from our 2007 baseline. And we've also completed the introduction of over 2,000 certified tours in 3 assessments by the Global Sustainability Tourism Council.  
One interesting point is that our wind farm that spans 20,000 acres in Northern Kansas has 62 turbines with a total power generation capability of 200 megawatts. It's now been operational for more than a year. It will annually generate 760,000 megawatt hours of carbon-free energy. That's saving some 500,000 tons in carbon. And to put it in perspective, it's the equivalent to the energy use of about 60,000 homes.  
These are just a few of the many initiatives underway at the company, and I've only focused here on the area of the environment. Our press release covered other initiatives in accordance with our -- and in accordance with our mantra of continuous improvement, we will continue to elevate and we will introduce new initiatives to improve all of our ESG efforts across the board.  
The last 16 months have caused much pain and much suffering, but the tide is clearly turning. I'd like to thank our Board of Directors for their support and dedication. I also want to thank our partner organizations and communities for staying the course and preparing for the future. But most of all, I want to thank the men and women of the Royal Caribbean Group for their tireless efforts under the most challenging of circumstances. Their dedication to seeing us see through this black swan event in the best way possible is nothing short of extraordinary. So I look forward to sunnier days ahead. And with that, I'll turn it back to you, Jason."

This has been",1382,"Thank you, Richard. Before I start, like Richard, I also want to thank our teams across the whole enterprise for their tireless dedication to rapidly bringing our fleet back into service in a safe, healthy and financially responsible manner. This has been accomplished through impressive interdepartmental collaboration and many, many sleepless nights. And for that, we are really forever grateful.  
I will now turn to discuss our performance for the second quarter. This morning, we reported an adjusted net loss of $1.3 billion or a loss of $5.06 per share for the second quarter of 2021. While these losses are incredibly painful, the second quarter was a turning point for the company on multiple fronts. First, we welcomed an additional 10 ships back into service after 15 months of minimal cruise activity. Second, we took financing actions to reduce our negative carry and began our journey back to an unencumbered and pre-COVID balance sheet. And third, we saw a significant increase in booking activities that resulted in a large increase in our customer deposits. 
As we shared this morning, our customer deposit balance as of June 30 was $2.4 billion, which is about 30% higher than the balance at the end of the first quarter. And as of today, our customer deposit balance is $2.5 billion. At this point, a little over 35% of our customer deposit balance is associated with FCCs compared to about 45% at the time of our last call, signaling continued strong demand. 
On the liquidity front, we closed the second quarter with $5 billion in liquidity. As you all know, we pride ourselves on having industry-leading brands with a world-class and highly innovative fleet and a history of strong financial discipline and performance. These assets and attributes have been instrumental in helping us raise more than $13 billion of new capital since March of last year. 
During the second quarter, we continued our efforts to manage and improve our balance sheet. And to that end, we successfully issued $650 million of senior unsecured notes at 4.25% and used those proceeds to redeem 7.25% senior secured notes in full. This will generate approximately $17 million of cash savings annually beginning in 2022. 
We are delighted with the current momentum and the restart of our operations in the United States and around the globe. The environment remains fluid, and for this reason, we are not providing a cash burn estimate or the related offsets generated by revenue and new customer deposits. I will highlight that the burn rate for the ships that are kept at layoff is expected to be consistent with our previous expectations. 
Now as it pertains to our debt maturities, our scheduled debt maturities for the remainder of this year and 2022 are $21 million and $2.2 billion. 
I will now update you on capacity and the booking environment. After more than a full year of painful financial losses, a never-ending roller coaster of ups and downs regarding the timing of our return to service, multiple liquidity actions and very little cruise capacity, we are now finally bringing our fleet back into service and are already welcoming thousands of guests back on board each week. In fact, we are thrilled to have welcomed more than 136,000 guests on board our 5 brands during the first half of the year. 
The pace with which our teams have been able to bring ships out of layup and ready them for guests is nothing short of incredible. It is amazing to think that at the end of April, we only had 4 ships delivering incredible vacations across our 5 brands. But as we sit today, there are guests sailing on 29 of our 60 ships in the Caribbean, Europe, Asia, Alaska, Iceland and the Galapagos. 
We are also in the process of ramping up 7 more ships to be welcoming guests this month. As a result, we anticipate having about 65% of our fleet in service at the end of the third quarter and approximately 80% of the fleet back in operation by the end of the year. 
When considering our plans to ramp up capacity, the one area we continue to watch is the Asia Pacific region. And for purposes of our return-to-service planning, we have been cautious. 
Now I'll give you an update on bookings. Bookings are still below 2019 levels due in part to our reduced capacity for 2021 and the fact that many sailings were announced very close in with little time to build business. However, the gap narrowed further during the second quarter. And we received about 50% more bookings in Q2 than during the previous 3 months, with trends improving 1 month to the next. By June, we were receiving about 90% more bookings each week when compared to Q1, with bookings for 2022 practically back to 2019 levels. 
As it relates to Delta variant, we have mainly seen small variations with closer-in bookings in markets with high case counts. However, July was our second highest booking month of the year and bookings for 2022 are strong. We are particularly encouraged by the continued strong demand for the important spring and summer months. 
The health and safety of our guests and crew is our #1 priority. And as such, our start-up strategy incorporates low initial occupancies to give the crew the opportunity to seamlessly implement the new protocols and facilitate amazing vacations in this new and constantly changing environment. 
After each ship gets a few voyages under their belt, our plan is for our load factors to steadily increase from 1 month to the next. This is evident in our fleet where several of our ships are now sailing with more than 50% load factors. 
Overall, the booking activity for 2021 sailings is consistent with our expected capacity and occupancy ramp-up at prices that are higher than 2019. We are also seeing record Net Promoter Scores as well as record onboard revenue for the ships that have resumed service. This is very encouraging as we are not only seeing pent-up demand for cruises, but we are also seeing pent-up demand for our onboard revenue experiences. Guests are really enjoying our shore excursions, casinos, spas and restaurants after spending a year in isolation. We are also seeing an increased demand for our WiFi services as more and more consumers have flexibility to take vacations and work remotely.
Looking further forward, we continue to be impressed by the demand and pricing we are seeing for 2022 sales. It is still a bit early in the booking window to provide too much color for next year, but I will share that our booked load factors continue to be well within historical ranges at prices that are up nicely versus 2019, including the dilutive impact of FCCs. While we were still in the early stages of the planning cycle for 2022, we do expect lower-than-average load factors for the first quarter as several ships will still be in ramp-up mode after having recently returned to service. That being said, the first quarter is booked within historical ranges. In addition, load factors are at the higher end of historical ranges for the back half of the year, with Q3 currently in a particularly strong position. 
Underpinning this is a strong customer deposit profile for 2022. Customer deposits for 2022 are significantly higher than the same time in 2019. This demand and booking profile is quite encouraging, considering that we have only been spending about 1/4 of our typical sales and marketing spend. 
We are also optimistic that a number of larger macro indicators will provide further tailwinds to our future demand, increased vaccination rates around the globe, sharp increases in consumer confidence and significant increases in personal saving rate versus the same time 2 years ago. 
I will close by saying that we are thrilled for the flywheel to be spinning at such an accelerating pace. We have been dreaming of this moment for more than 16 months, and it's finally here. We feel very optimistic about our future and are thrilled to see more and more guests in the United States and around the globe enjoy incredible vacations onboard our ships. 
And with that, I will ask Shelby to open up the call for a question-and-answer session."

And then my other question, and I hate to be so short-term focused, but I just know that investors are very focused on the comment in the release about the near term being impacted by Delta. And I know you quantified that July was still the second highest month of the year. So I guess that means sort of down sequentially a little bit from June, which June was 90% better than Q1. I guess I don't know if you -- do you feel that, that -- the impact of that has sort of stabilized at that level, that as you're moving into August here, that August would be similar to July?

Robin, in terms of Delta from the perspective of the customer and the booking environment, I think I would say in the last 2 weeks, we've seen very positive growth in demand. As we moved through the spring with vaccinations and as we announced return to service and as customers saw our ships return, we really did enter into a very positive booking environment. And I think over the last 2 weeks, the positive environment continues, but it hasn't been at such a trajectory as it was. But it's really short term. When you look into '22, we see no material impact at all on the increases in bookings for '22. 
So I think customers, consumers now see this for what it is. It's a blip and a bump. I think we feel encouraged by the protocols that we've got in place, as Richard mentioned in his opening comments. We've been very encouraged to see that when we do have a positive COVID case onboard our ships, we very quickly contact trace, test. And what we find is that very often, you may have a COVID positive either from a vaccinated or unvaccinated guest, and they'll be in the very same room with somebody who's vaccinated and they test negative. 
So the vaccines are really working. I think our vaccination population, so to speak, as Richard mentioned, I think in the month of July, we -- our ship sailed with around 92% of the entire community vaccinated. And in the month of July, we were still accepting kids from the age of 12 to 16 who were vaccinated. And starting on August 1, that number has dropped down because our policy requires you to be vaccinated 12 and up.
So I think the good news is, if there is good news with the Delta variant, is that people are becoming far more accustomed to this. If you've got a highly vaccinated population, there's minimal impact. And I think, increasingly, as our ships sail, as we encounter this, we communicate, we're very transparent. The feedback we get from our customers is recognition and relief that this is very contained and something that's going to pass."

There is inflation in there. Typically also, just so you know, when we order ships, typically, the yards also lock in their purchase of steel and fix those prices. So there's not really an impact there. 
And quite frankly, we're excited about the new capacity that's coming on. When you look at the cabin configuration, the opportunity for onboard revenue, the fuel efficiencies, the positive impact on the environment that these ships are able to bring to us, we're looking forward to get those ships -- to get these ships online. The reality of it is, as the investor community knows, they're going to be 8 to 10 months delayed when we had originally expected to take them on."

Clearly, today's countries are doing more local. So you see a tremendous growth, actually surprising, in domestic travel and domestic -- particularly domestic air and other domestic travel as opposed to international travel. But the other thing that we've seen in this is how quickly it all changes. And we've -- I mean if you just look at this, we've gone from people wondering whether we're going to be back in service at all this year to half our fleet back in a matter of weeks. I mean it's kind of happening so quickly. And I think we see the same sort of thing. There's tremendous restrictions on international travel today. But at the same time that the U.S. decided to extend its -- you saw the U.K. releasing restrictions and you're seeing in Europe. So I think the vaccine is the game changer here. And it is working. And as it becomes -- more and more people are getting it, and you've seen a bit of an upturn already in the unvaccinated getting vaccinated. 
But you're also seeing it working in Europe. So just a few weeks ago, Europe was way behind the curve on vaccinations. And they've ramped up to now they're equal or, in many cases, ahead of the U.S. 
Australia and New Zealand, which initially focused -- and in fact, much of Asia, it's initially focused, not on vaccines but in isolation and having domestic travel being the key, have shifted. And while they are low on vaccinations compared to the U.S. and Europe, they're rapidly fixing that. 
So I think it's an uncertain period. But I think what we would expect is for months now, we will see restrictions and people staying closer to home. But I think there is a yearning to get out there. And once the vaccines get out there, once this -- they become more widely distributed, you'll see more international travel. 
So that takes a while, and international travel also tends to book further in advance. So you would expect international travel for the first quarter to be -- a lot of that to be arranged already. 
So the fact that we haven't been booking, it means that the first quarter is going to be weak on that count. And I think as we're looking forward in the year, we're seeing people really expect things to move back to normal. And we're seeing international travel back to normal. And so once we get into the spring and summer, we are really very encouraged by what we're envisioning."

What you see, which is very logical, is as the pandemic has raged and as vaccines have become prevalent, you see consumer confidence increase, you see travel hesitancy decrease, you see cruise hesitancy decrease. And we've seen improvements across all of these different segments and particularly for new-to-cruise. 
So if you look at new-to-cruise view of cruising today versus when we were in the depth of the pandemic, it's remarkably improved. And it continues its upward journey. So we do think, and to Richard's point and Jason's point about the flywheel, the more we have our ships in operations, the more customers that sail with us and have an amazing vacation and the more that we operate, then we believe that we'll see new-to-cruise come back fairly quickly."

Our expectation is that we will ramp up our sales and marketing engine to harvest as much quality demand as we possibly can because we think that there's opportunity for it to be even stronger. And so what I would say is, overall, you should expect that we're going to spend closer back to the levels that we were before on the sales and marketing side when the timing is right. 
What we are seeing, as you can see here, is demand for the future periods is exceptionally strong. And so our teams are always very kind of thoughtful about that. But we are generating demand not just for 2022, we're also generating demand for 2023 and even a little bit for '24 for brands like Silversea."

I think we're feeling pretty optimistic about the opportunity that's in front of us. When we think about our marketing investment, marketing activity and spend over the past several months all the way through this year, it has been -- we've reduced it incredibly. And yet the demand that we've seen coming through the door has been really strong. So we've seen demand almost at the same level as '19 and it continues. And yet ironically, our investment has been remarkably low. So we are thinking that as we move through into September, and of course, we're mindful of the Delta variant, but when we really do go to market, we think that there's going to be significant opportunity for us. So we're quite thoughtful about this. 
And one of the things that we -- we're very thoughtful about, of course, is pricing. And we're already seeing that not only are people spending up, but we're seeing that in our onboard spend. So I think Jason commented earlier that we've been incredibly encouraged by the spending onboard our ships that we've already started operating. In fact, the numbers have been very impressive. 
So we think that there's an opportunity coming. And I think when we really go to market in a positive way as we move into the fourth quarter, we're encouraged by what we think is going to happen in terms of demand."

I think, actually, the booking curve has shortened because we don't have -- we didn't have the wave period this year that would have given us a base for 2022 and even in 2023. And so I think, if anything, it's actually gotten shorter because of the uncertainty and because of the fact that this is only ramping up very quickly. 
Our objective is to get it back. The longer booking curve is helpful to us. It's also helpful in our yield management models. And so we want that to happen. And yes, we will be investing in marketing. It's one of the things marketing does do. So even though demand has been pretty good, we're never satisfied with demand. And if we can ramp up more demand and particularly on short notice, so we will have a period where we have to fill in the short term as well as generate the long term. 
The other thing that is relevant, you asked about first-time cruisers or it's rather people who haven't cruised before, there's no question that, that is a real opportunity for us that we want to be exploring going forward."

And so again, I think it just kind of shows overall the encouragement that -- what you see in terms of the guests that are sailing, with the number of guests that are sailing with us, it is very in line with how we're looking to ramp up the ships, albeit at higher prices than we had anticipated."

What we've seen in terms of demand is really reflected in the commentary that we've already provided, which is with significantly less marketing investment, the demand has been surprisingly strong. There's puts and takes throughout all of that landscape. But at a higher level, demand is strong. I think for products for the closer to home, demand is even stronger. 
Different countries within Europe have gone through their own journey with COVID. So it's a more complicated environment in Europe ironically than it is in the United States, even though in the United States, we have to deal with the various issues associated with legislation, et cetera.

And I think your question is very focused on the same sort of thing we've begun to focus on as we come back. 
So there are a series of things. The most important is to reestablish the credibility of cruising in the consumer's mind. And I think that you are seeing this happening nicely, and we're very optimistic about the direction that, that will go both for experienced cruisers and for new cruisers, and we need to develop both of those markets. 
We're also seeing, as we normally do, a tremendous interest in the new ships that we have coming and the revitalization of ships that we've had. And we're seeing that in our forward bookings. We're seeing that in our ramping up.  And many of the changes that we've made have enhanced our onboard revenue capabilities, et cetera. 
And lastly, there's the operating efficiency. We spent a lot of time during this period focusing on ways that we can operate more efficiently, better use of technology, better cost control capabilities, better ability to generate onboard revenue and efficiencies from new technology. So all of those things are very much working in our favor. And we think, as we're looking forward, those will put us back on the trajectory that we were prior to the pandemic."

As always, it's a pleasure to give an update on what's happening within the Royal Caribbean Group. It's certainly been a horrible 1.5 years, looking at our financial statements and seeing that sea [indiscernible] is painful, but we are pleased to be looking at such a positive forward path. The reason we've gotten through this awful period of COVID as well as we have is because we've had our eye firmly on where we needed to go rather than on where we were at any given moment. The same approach is serving us well as we look to the coming months. 
Before I comment on our position going forward, I have to express my admiration for and appreciation of the men and women of the Royal Caribbean Group, who have worked so hard, so diligently throughout this difficult time. The pandemic has cost us all dearly, but our people stepped up to the plate and work so hard to get us through this period. They invented amazing protocols to protect our crew members and our guests. They put in place financing arrangements with the [indiscernible], and they have taken care of themselves, their coworkers and their families under some of the most trying circumstances any of us have ever experienced. To them, I say thank you. You are all true heroes. Now the pandemic is not yet fully behind us. It's still very present, but scientists have given us a good answer to this diemer with effective vaccines and remarkable treatments. The Delta variant caused a temporary slowdown in our bookings, especially close in, but our trajectory for recovery remains very much intact. In this call, I intend to focus on where we're going rather than where we've been. We are all tired of talking about COVID-19. Every conversation doesn't need to start with a description of the trauma we've experienced. Every discussion doesn't need to dwell on how awful it's been. Fortunately, the path forward appears clear and very positive for our company and for our industry. 
For some time now, we have said that we hope to take advantage of the special features of cruising and make cruising one of the safest places on earth to spend your vacation. The numbers are now coming in and our objective appears to be validated. Our strategy has been to get the flywheel spinning. For over 18 months, our guests have had to deal with cancellations, interruptions, confusing rules and changing protocols. These constant changes have added uncertainty. Thankfully, today, we're operating almost normally. Our published itineraries are being delivered on a consistent basis. 2/3 of our ships are already operating, and virtually, everything will be back to normal in our core markets before the end of this year. Our goal is to start the new year with smooth, steady, consistent operations that will give our guests comfort and give travel advisers the confidence to book future cruises. Like the pilot of a plane during takeoff, prioritizing speed over altitude, we have prioritized spreading the wealth. We have prioritized starting up more ships even with lower loads per vessel rather than trying for higher load factors on fewer ships. We have been executing this in a financially and medically prudent manner. January is the start of wave period, and our goal is to have our core markets operating normally as quickly as possible. That will put us in an excellent position to have a good wave period. Our bookings are already showing that the public has a great deal of pent-up demand and is eager to travel again. We have a long period of poor bookings to make up for, but current booking trends give us a high level of confidence for 2022, especially from the summer on. We're not back to normal. However, predictions of a dramatic different new normal do not appear to be bearing out. Once the border ship, cruises today are remarkably similar to cruises before the pandemic. There are some changes, but most of these are not visible to the public, and the remaining ones are likely to be temporary. Satisfaction level amongst those who are cruising today is the highest in our company's history and their onboard spending is also unparalleled. 
The recent announcement by the CDC that they intend to eliminate the prescriptive conditional sale order in January is very welcome. Our own requirements and protocols are stricter than the CSO anyhow. So the confidence though that they are demonstrating by the CDC's actions will help give confidence to the market. Now while we are very encouraged about the strong bookings that we've been seeing, we do appreciate that we are still not in a normal travel environment. We are emerging from a period of lower-than-usual bookings and our international sourcing, which has historically been the strength of the group, has been confusing due to the constantly changing travel restrictions and is just now starting to build back. The image of the cruise industry from the early days of the pandemic is also weighing on the minds of consumers, albeit much, much less than previously. There's also a special story about what's happening in Asia and how that affects the Royal Caribbean Group. China was one of the fastest-growing markets, and we believe will continue to be an important part of our strategy going forward. However, as you know, China is essentially closed to international travel today and that includes cruise travel. We do not expect China to reopen until at least the Olympics in Beijing are over. Another important market for us is Australia. Australia's approach to containing the pandemic has been based on isolation. They are now rapidly switching to the vaccines as a way of controlling the disease. We do not expect Australia to open the cruise travel until the spring. But since this summer season doesn't start until our next winter anyhow, we're not counting on much from Australia until the end of next year. 
Against this background, our ability to predict a profitable 2022 is strong evidence of how quickly our future can get better. We are encouraged to see the return to profitability and strong cash flows as a rapid turnaround rather than a slow, steady progression. It is unusual actually for us to provide any indication of next year's results this early, but we understand the need to have a frame of reference going forward, and we wanted to be constructive in that regard. Obviously, there are a large number of factors that could shift us off this trajectory, including worsening spread of the disease, a new variant, inflation, et cetera. But on the current trajectory that we are seeing, we believe we can prudently predict at least this level of profitability and cash flow. 
I'd also like to touch on 2 other subjects that are of interest to any company, human capital and supply chain issues. Our people have been the strongest driver of our performance throughout our history. So we watch this area very carefully, and we are concerned by reports of labor shortages, especially in the hospitality arena. Fortunately, our shipboard jobs are seen as very attractive by crew members around the world. So that has not been a serious problem as we restart, and we do not expect that it will become one. Similarly, onshore. We have long been seen as a desirable place to work, and while the current situation is something every business person should watch closely, we do not expect it to interfere with our ability to operate successfully. Supply chain issues are impacting everyone and we're no exception. Fortunately, we have traditionally hedged our bets by buying key supplies forward, and this is cushioning us from the current volatility. Looking forward, we expect these contracts plus our purchasing power plus our ingenuity to give us protection. Now while the pandemic has been all consuming, we have not been idle on other fronts either. The need to be a good corporate citizen to behave in a way that we can all be proud of has remained an important part of our thought process even during this timeframe. Over the last few months, we've announced a significant number of highly significant steps forward on the environmental side of our ESG aspirations. 
A few weeks ago, we announced that the new Silversea ship, called Project Evolution, will contain some of the most advanced environmental features of any cruise ship on the water or in the construction docks. It will be a multi-fuel vessel capable of burning initially lower carbon producing LNG and later as they develop the noncarbon-based fuels, we'll work off of those. In addition, it will have fuel cell technology, not as a demonstration project, but it's a significant part of the energy capability of the vessel. As a result, it will be able to operate 100% of its hotel load purely on these emission-free fuel cells. That means not only will the ship need to use its engines in port, but it can do so without even having to plug into shore power. This requires an amazing concentrated effort to develop the technology in conjunction with Mayor Vert and others. In addition, it will use waste to energy technology to convert rubbish to energy and use advanced supply chain techniques to reduce the carbon generated during the construction process. An even bigger announcement this week was our disclosure of our new project called Destination Net Zero. This is an ambitious project to eliminate our carbon footprint by 2050. By signing up for the science-based target initiative, we are not only setting a goal for the distant future, but also establishing the interim milestones that will allow us to get there with confidence. It's also interesting to look at the last 19 months and take note that during this period, we've taken delivery of 5 spectacular new vessels. And during the next 9 months, we will accept delivery of 3 more. In fact, over the next fortnight, we will be naming 2 of these ships here in South Florida. We have not remained idle. 
Before I turn it back to Jason, I'd like to reiterate my appreciation for an admiration of the people of the Royal Caribbean Group who have gone above and beyond, not only to get us through the pandemic in far better shape than anyone would have expected, but have also prepared us to look forward to the future with confidence and yes, even excitement. With that, I turn it back to Jason. Jason?"

Before I begin my remarks, I also want to echo Richard's comments regarding our incredible teams. The people at the Royal Caribbean Group are our strongest competitive advantage, powering our resurgence and delivering, again, the world's best vacations. I want to thank every member of the Royal Caribbean family for their ongoing and exceptional efforts in the incredible service and memorable experiences you provide to our guests every single day. 
I will now turn to discuss our performance for the third quarter. This morning, we reported an adjusted net loss of $1.2 billion or a loss of $4.91 per share for the third quarter of 2021.  It's important to note that while these results may be below some of the street estimates, our third quarter results and related cash burn were better than our internal expectations, driven by better costs and better onboard revenue performance. Onboard revenue strength contributed to a 12% increase in total revenue per passenger cruise day compared to the third quarter of 2019. In line with our expectations, our occupancy for the quarter was 36%, with sequential improvements from one month to the next. From the very beginning of our restart, we talked about several tenants that would be the basis of our ramp-up. The first was ensuring the health and safety of our guests and crew, the second was that we wanted to ensure that the vacation experience matched or exceeded our guest expectations and the third was bringing the fleet up in a financially prudent way. So far, we have delivered on all 3 of these tenants. We've carried over 500,000 guests since the restart and have only had 150 COVID positive cases amongst these 500,000 people. In addition to providing safe vacations, we are also clearly exceeding our guest expectations with Net Promoter Scores well above all-time highs. And once beyond the initial start-up period, load factors on our core itineraries averaged 44%, and all of those ships were cash flow accretive. 
The last point I would like to make is that while we now have more than 65% of our capacity up and running, leading the industry by far on a relative basis, we are continuing to manage our load factors to ensure that we stay true to our healthy return to service tenants as well as retaining price integrity. 
Now I'd like to discuss capacity and load factor expectations over the upcoming period. For the fourth quarter, a little over 2/3 of our capacity will be failing core itineraries beyond the initial start-up period. As such, our overall load factors will continue to trend of increasing from one month to the next and are expected to be in the range of 60% and 65% in the fourth quarter. In addition, we do expect our fleet on our core itineraries to generate direct profit. Given our healthy return to service tenants and our focus on price integrity, we expect our load factors in 2022 to continue to steadily increase month by month and return to historic levels in the summer. From a capacity standpoint, we expect that 50 of our 61 ships who have returned to service by the end of this year. By the end of Q1 2022, we expect about 85% of our capacity to be operating with 100% back in service in the spring in time for the lucrative summer season. 
While we are offering cruises in the vast majority of our key destinations, we continue to closely monitor both China and Australia and anticipate those markets will start opening in the spring. This timing could influence the return dates of a few of our ships. As to our balance sheet, we ended the third quarter of 2021 with $4 billion in liquidity. During the third quarter, we continued our efforts to manage and improve our balance sheet. To that end, we successfully issued $1 billion in senior unsecured notes at 5.5% due in 2026. These proceeds were used to replenish capital as a result of the redemption of 40% of the 11.5% senior secured notes that were due in 2025. This redemption will result in a full year interest savings of $51 million. As we discussed on other calls during the pandemic, we have taken and continue to take numerous actions to reshape our cost structure with a focus on further improving our leading pre-COVID margins. These actions include getting rid of older tonnage and adding more leading, high-yielding and cost-efficient hardware to our fleet. While these actions will improve our cost structure and margin profile, we do anticipate the recent inflationary pressures and some transitory cost related to healthy return to service will weigh on next year's earnings. 
Now I'll give you an update on our 2022 sailings. At a macro level, we've seen a sequential improvement and new bookings from one quarter to the next. Bookings during Q2 were higher than Q1 and bookings during Q3 were higher than Q2. This Q3 improvement took place despite the loan demand in August that corresponded with the rise in the delta variant. September was a great booking month overall with new bookings for 2022, more than 60% higher than Q2 average. The momentum has continued for all 3 of our brands and bookings so far in October have been significantly better than September. Bookings from our 2 biggest markets, the U.S. and the U.K., have been improving from one week to the next and are now exceeding 2019 levels. We have now restarted our brands marketing programs, which are generating strong results and preparing us nicely for 2022 and 2023. From a cumulative standpoint, our book load factors remain within historical ranges, driven by strong booking levels for the second quarter of 2022 forward. Load factors in the first quarter are lower than historical levels, but are aligned with our anticipated load factor ramp-up. Our booked APDs are up significantly, both including and excluding the negative impact of FCCs for the full year and for each quarter of 2022. As always, trends do differ a little by itinerary with our core summer products and a stronger volume position than other itineraries. Our customer deposit balance is now $2.8 billion, an improvement of about $400 million over the past quarter, despite the significant quarter-over-quarter increase in revenue recognition, which reduces the customer deposit balance. Our customer deposit balance is less than 15% lower than it was at the end of September 2019, for the 3 brands with almost the entire difference driven by Q4 2021 sailings. Our customer deposit balance related to bookings in Q2 forward sailings for all 3 brands is higher than at the same time in 2019. Approximately, 35% of our customer deposit balance is related to FCCs. Of the FCCs, approximately 45% of them have been redeemed thus far. 
Now considering everything I just said about the booking environment and costs, I would like to discuss our very early view of 2022. The Royal Caribbean Group possesses the best brands in their segments, the most innovative fleet in the industry, wholly owned destination experiences like Perfect Day at CocoCay that are second to none, a nimble and effective global sourcing footprint and most of all, the very best team both at sea and on land. This incredible and unique set of assets have helped us effectively manage through the pandemic and is now helping us accelerate out of it. As such, while it's still too early to provide guidance for next year, we currently anticipate the group generating positive EBITDA starting in the spring of 2022 and positive earnings for the full year 2022. 
With that, I will ask our operator to open up the call for a question-and-answer session."

And I guess what I'm wondering is, how you're thinking about making that bridge from where you are today versus getting back to those levels? And I guess really the question is, would you have been able to make that assumption, if the CSO order was extended versus you guys being able to operate more independently? And I guess even asked another way is, how much higher load factors does the removal of the CSL contribute? And how are you guys now thinking about vaccine mandates across different age demographics into next year?"

So one, we didn't point specifically to the third quarter, I think we pointed specifically to the summer. So we are kind of preparing our business to be to kind of maximize our revenues and profitability in this -- and obviously, a very kind of lucrative peak summer season. Our load factor ramp-up is somewhere about 5 to 7 load factor points per month. Again, we're doing this in a measured way. I'll have Michael in a second here talk about the CSO, but that's not governing our load factor build. I think it's more of us just thoughtfully ramping up our business based off of those 3 tenets of health and safety, guest experience and doing things like financially prudent way. 
So with that, I'll pass it over to Michael to talk a little bit about the things on the CSO side."

I think with the CSO, we've been through quite a journey with collaboration and the work with the CDC. And if you think what we've been through in terms of determining the protocols and then executing them, I think it's fair to say that the industry, and the CDC and the intergovernmental agency representatives, who have been part of this return to service team, feel like we've been very successful in implementing these protocols. And they're proving, as we commented earlier, to be very successful. While the CSO comes to -- it's kind of a technical end on January 15, we will continue our ongoing collaboration with the CDC in terms of the protocols that will voluntarily operate after the CSO expires. And I think what's happened over this past several months is that we've really got a focused, collaborative effort, and we found the relationship with the CDC has been very constructive. They certainly -- and we want to make sure that we're operating safely. And they're also well aware that some of the protocols that we have in place will naturally fall away as the pandemic moves further and further in the rearview mirror. So I think as we move into '22, hopefully, what we'll see is the protocols become easier and less cumbersome for our customers. 
Having said that and kind of jumping on Jason's comments about load factor, while we've been extremely prudent and thoughtful about bringing back our fleet and managing the load factors, it's worth pointing out that -- and I'll use Royal Caribbean International as a proxy for the company, we've brought back significantly more capacity ships, beds and births than any of our competitors by a significant demand. And what that means is that operationally and logistically, we've already climbed over that mountain, and we've now got a large number of our assets available for booking. And more importantly, we've now gone through and absorbed all of those expenses. We vaccinated all of our crew. We've managed to get all of our crew to these ships, and we're operating them. One of the things that we were very cognizant of is the need to be very consistent with the distribution and the customer because as Richard pointed out, we've had so many cancellations of ships over the past 1.5 years, and now we have this stability. So as we look into '22, we feel pretty optimistic about what we've achieved with the CDC and the CSO, and I think we're feeling very optimistic about the fact that we've got so many of our ships already up and operating. And while we've talked about the load factors, it's worth pointing out that it's a story that's for the purposes of this conversation is averaged out. Last weekend, Freedom of the Seas sailed from Miami with an occupancy of 85%. And that's one of the products that's particularly attractive to new-to-cruise, and it's one of the products that we've been very focused on and making sure that we're learning and understanding exactly how our protocols can adapt to more capacity. So we feel pretty good about what's happening."

I mean, I think our commentary around pricing and how we're seeing the business build back up are certainly -- or what's supporting our current expectations around profitability for 2022 as well as the timing of cash flow. We have done a lot. And of course, that consideration is, we do expect there to be some additional costs that relate to inflation. We've hedged, I think, 53% of our fuel for next year. And I think one of the things that we'll toggle here is, as Michael was referring to, our healthy return to service protocols, there will be a series of transitory costs. A lot of those transitory costs we've absorbed this year, as Michael talked about and the ramping up of our fleet, but there will still be more ramp-up that happens next year. And depending on on how some of these protocols, which are very much kind of self-induced here around testing as that -- based off of that could impact our cost profile. But even kind of considering all that, that's why I think we feel at this point, you're comfortable talking about pointing the business towards profitability in 2022. As we -- as our plans start to kind of firm up, and I think as we get into next year, we'll consider giving some more thought in terms of how 2022 is going to look through the course of the year."

To your point, we have -- well, as Richard mentioned in his remarks, we have taken on new capacity. We will be taking on additional new capacity into next year. We have gotten rid of older tonnage. And so we do expect that our fleet will become more and more fuel efficient also as we focus on our path here to net neutrality on the carbon side that, that will continue to help us focus on burning less fuel also here in the future. But in saying all of that, the mix of that is that our fuel consumption on a per birth basis should get lighter and lighter as time passes year and that's what we would expect. At this point, it's too soon to guide on what our fuel consumption will be as our deployment for next year is still not fully out."

And quite literally last week, there was a conference down in Panama with many of the Caribbean countries. And it was quite interesting to see the level of activity that we experienced in terms of reengaging and talking about destination developments throughout the Caribbean South Central region. So we did obviously have a plan in place pre-pandemic. We press pause. We are now reengaging on all of those plans. In the immediate future, we have an expansion taking place in Perfect Day with the addition of [indiscernible] Beach, which is a new experience that will open in late '22 for Perfect Day. The beauty of Hide Away Beach is that it is an adult-only area as part of Perfect Day. It will allow us to increase our capacity by approximately 3,000 people a day in late '22, which is obviously going to help improve our overall profitability and drive more more revenue, both ticket and onboard. So that's coming. And then we're close to finalizing the design and construction plans and the approvals for Beach Club in Nassau, which we're hoping to start work on that very soon, and we have other projects that we've now started to reengage with. So I think our aspirations never really moved away. We just had to press pause for a while. 
Also, of course, we've got our Galveston terminal that's opening in '22, and that will accommodate our Oasis class ships and then future Icon. And of course, that gives us remarkable access into the Texas, Oklahoma, and that whole region as a market for driving drive into.

When you talk about load factor in Q1 being kind of below historic range or lower than average, how much of that -- you talked about expecting occupancy levels to end up around 85% for Q1. So can you quantify -- are you actually sort of not selling? Is 15% of your capacity not available for sale in Q1 on the ships that would be in service? So just to kind of help quantify how much of the lower load factor in Q1 is actually what's not available for sale? And then also, probably the other big factor is the fact that you've had to rejigger a bunch of itineraries in the last few months. And so what percent -- I don't know if you would know this ballpark of your Q1 itineraries are things that were kind of rejiggered in the last year as opposed to you normally have 12 months to sell an itinerary. Now some of these itineraries, you'd be selling in less than 6 months. So I don't know if you can quantify that. As opposed to, right, investors sort of trying to get a handle on how much is that versus like, oh, load is below in Q1 because people don't want to travel yet versus these other 2 factors that I think are probably part of it."

And so we are certainly moderating load factor and ramping that up. And so that's going to weigh in on Q1 load factors and even a little bit really Q2 load factors as there's a few more ships that come into play. That's probably the biggest driver of why in Q1 our load factor would be lower than what you would see Q2 going forward. Certainly, my guess is, there's probably 15% to 20% of our capacity in which there's, I would say, more than moderate itinerary changes and that -- because I mean, most of our itineraries there might be a port here or port there that has changed out of this, but it's -- that's not really the driver of it. Maintaining price integrity, slowly ramping up our fleet or ramping up our fleet or the ships that come on in a manageable way is really what's driving the difference here on the load factor in Q1."

It's just been -- there have been cancellations, there are itineraries that are changed, et cetera. And I think people want to look forward to a period of stability and so that's really been our focus. And it's a little hard to measure that on an itinerary by itinerary or vessel by vessel, but I think overall, it's a factor and that's why we've been so anxious to get everything up and running and without changes."

As always, it's a pleasure to give an update on what's happening within the Royal Caribbean Group. It's certainly been a horrible 1.5 years, looking at our financial statements and seeing that sea of red ink is painful, but we are pleased to be looking at such a positive forward path. The reason we've gotten through this awful period of COVID as well as we have is because we've had our eye firmly on where we needed to go rather than on where we were at any given moment. The same approach is serving us well as we look to the coming months. 
Before I comment on our position going forward, I have to express my admiration for and appreciation of the men and women of the Royal Caribbean Group, who have worked so hard, so diligently throughout this difficult time. The pandemic has cost us all dearly, but our people stepped up to the plate and work so hard to get us through this period. They invented amazing protocols to protect our crew members and our guests. They put in place financing arrangements with a deft hand, and they have taken care of themselves, their coworkers and their families under some of the most trying circumstances any of us have ever experienced. To them, I say thank you. You are all true heroes. 
Now the pandemic is not yet fully behind us. It's still very present, but scientists have given us a good answer to this nightmare with effective vaccines and remarkable treatments. The Delta variant caused a temporary slowdown in our bookings, especially close in, but our trajectory for recovery remains very much intact. In this call, I intend to focus on where we're going rather than where we've been. We are all tired of talking about COVID-19. Every conversation doesn't need to start with a description of the trauma we've experienced. Every discussion doesn't need to dwell on how awful it's been. Fortunately, the path forward appears clear and very positive for our company and for our industry. 
For some time now, we have said that we hope to take advantage of the special features of cruising and make cruising one of the safest places on earth to spend your vacation. The numbers are now coming in and our objective appears to be validated. Our strategy has been to get the flywheel spinning. For over 18 months, our guests have had to deal with cancellations, interruptions, confusing rules and changing protocols. These constant changes have added uncertainty. Thankfully, today, we're operating almost normally. Our published itineraries are being delivered on a consistent basis. 2/3 of our ships are already operating, and virtually, everything will be back to normal in our core markets before the end of this year. 
Our goal is to start the new year with smooth, steady, consistent operations that will give our guests comfort and give travel advisers the confidence to book future cruises. Like the pilot of a plane during takeoff, prioritizing speed over altitude, we have prioritized spreading the wealth. We have prioritized starting up more ships even with lower loads per vessel rather than trying for higher load factors on fewer ships. We have been executing this in a financially and medically prudent manner. 
January is the start of wave period, and our goal is to have our core markets operating normally as quickly as possible. That will put us in an excellent position to have a good wave period. Our bookings are already showing that the public has a great deal of pent-up demand and is eager to travel again. We have a long period of poor bookings to make up for, but current booking trends give us a high level of confidence for 2022, especially from the summer on. We're not back to normal. However, predictions of a dramatic different new normal do not appear to be bearing out. 
Once we board a ship, cruises today are remarkably similar to cruises before the pandemic. There are some changes, but most of these are not visible to the public, and the remaining ones are likely to be temporary. Satisfaction level amongst those who are cruising today is the highest in our company's history and their onboard spending is also unparalleled. 
The recent announcement by the CDC that they intend to eliminate the prescriptive conditional sale order in January is very welcome. Our own requirements and protocols are stricter than the CSO anyhow. So the confidence though that they are demonstrating by the CDC's actions will help give confidence to the market. Now while we are very encouraged about the strong bookings that we've been seeing, we do appreciate that we are still not in a normal travel environment. We are emerging from a period of lower-than-usual bookings and our international sourcing, which has historically been the strength of the group, has been confusing due to the constantly changing travel restrictions and is just now starting to build back. 
The image of the cruise industry from the early days of the pandemic is also weighing on the minds of consumers, albeit much, much less than previously. There's also a special story about what's happening in Asia and how that affects the Royal Caribbean Group. China was one of the fastest-growing markets, and we believe will continue to be an important part of our strategy going forward. However, as you know, China is essentially closed to international travel today and that includes cruise travel. We do not expect China to reopen until at least the Olympics in Beijing are over. 
Another important market for us is Australia. Australia's approach to containing the pandemic has been based on isolation. They are now rapidly switching to the vaccines as a way of controlling the disease. We do not expect Australia to open the cruise travel until the spring. But since this summer season doesn't start until our next winter anyhow, we're not counting on much from Australia until the end of next year. 
Against this background, our ability to predict a profitable 2022 is strong evidence of how quickly our future can get better. We are encouraged to see the return to profitability and strong cash flows as a rapid turnaround, rather than a slow, steady progression. It is unusual actually for us to provide any indication of next year's results this early, but we understand the need to have a frame of reference going forward, and we wanted to be constructive in that regard. Obviously, there are a large number of factors that could shift us off this trajectory, including worsening spread of the disease, a new variant, inflation, et cetera. But on the current trajectory that we are seeing, we believe we can prudently predict at least this level of profitability and cash flow. 
I'd also like to touch on 2 other subjects that are of interest to any company, human capital and supply chain issues. Our people have been the strongest driver of our performance throughout our history. So we watch this area very carefully, and we are concerned by reports of labor shortages, especially in the hospitality arena. Fortunately, our shipboard jobs are seen as very attractive by crew members around the world. So that has not been a serious problem as we restart, and we do not expect that it will become one. Similarly, onshore, we have long been seen as a desirable place to work, and while the current situation is something every businessperson should watch closely, we do not expect it to interfere with our ability to operate successfully. 
Supply chain issues are impacting everyone and we're no exception. Fortunately, we have traditionally hedged our bets by buying key supplies forward, and this is cushioning us from the current volatility. Looking forward, we expect these contracts plus our purchasing power, plus our ingenuity to give us protection. Now while this pandemic has been all consuming, we have not been idle on other fronts either. The need to be a good corporate citizen, to behave in a way that we can all be proud of has remained an important part of our thought process even during this timeframe. Over the last few months, we've announced a significant number of highly significant steps forward on the environmental side of our ESG aspirations. 
A few weeks ago, we announced that the new Silversea ship, called Project Evolution, will contain some of the most advanced environmental features of any cruise ship on the water or in the construction docks. It will be a multi-fuel vessel capable of burning initially lower carbon producing LNG and later as they develop the noncarbon-based fuels, we'll work off of those. In addition, it will have fuel cell technology, not as a demonstration project, but it's a significant part of the energy capability of the vessel. As a result, it will be able to operate 100% of its hotel load purely on these emission-free fuel cells. That means not only will the ship need to use its engines in port, but it can do so without even having to plug into shore power. 
This requires an amazing concentrated effort to develop the technology in conjunction with Meyer Werft and others. In addition, it will use waste-to-energy technology to convert rubbish to energy and use advanced supply chain techniques to reduce the carbon generated during the construction process. An even bigger announcement this week was our disclosure of our new project called Destination Net Zero. This is an ambitious project to eliminate our carbon footprint by 2050. By signing up for the science-based target initiative, we are not only setting a goal for the distant future, but also establishing the interim milestones that will allow us to get there with confidence. 
It's also interesting to look at the last 19 months and take note that during this period, we've taken delivery of 5 spectacular new vessels. And during the next 9 months, we will accept delivery of 3 more. In fact, over the next fortnight, we will be naming 2 of these ships here in South Florida. We have not remained idle. 
Before I turn it back to Jason, I'd like to reiterate my appreciation for in admiration of the people of the Royal Caribbean Group who have gone above and beyond, not only to get us through the pandemic in far better shape than anyone would have expected but have also prepared us to look forward to the future with confidence and yes, even excitement. With that, I turn it back to Jason. Jason?"

Before I begin my remarks, I also want to echo Richard's comments regarding our incredible teams. The people at the Royal Caribbean Group are at strongest competitive advantage, powering our resurgence and delivering, again, the world'",1288,"Thank you, Richard. Before I begin my remarks, I also want to echo Richard's comments regarding our incredible teams. The people at the Royal Caribbean Group are at strongest competitive advantage, powering our resurgence and delivering, again, the world's best vacations. I want to thank every member of the Royal Caribbean family for their ongoing and exceptional efforts in the incredible service and memorable experiences you provide to our guests every single day. 
I will now turn to discuss our performance for the third quarter. This morning, we reported an adjusted net loss of $1.2 billion or a loss of $4.91 per share for the third quarter of 2021.  It's important to note that while these results may be below some of the Street estimates, our third quarter results and related cash burn were better than our internal expectations, driven by better costs and better onboard revenue performance. Onboard revenue strength contributed to a 12% increase in total revenue per passenger cruise day, compared to the third quarter of 2019. In line with our expectations, our occupancy for the quarter was 36%, with sequential improvements from one month to the next. 
From the very beginning of our restart, we talked about several tenets that would be the basis of our ramp-up. The first was ensuring the health and safety of our guests and crew, the second was that we wanted to ensure that the vacation experience matched or exceeded our guest's expectations and the third was bringing the fleet up in a financially prudent way. So far, we have delivered on all 3 of these tenets. We've carried over 500,000 guests since the restart and have only had 150 COVID positive cases amongst these 500,000 people. In addition to providing safe vacations, we are also clearly exceeding our guest expectations with Net Promoter Scores well above all-time highs. And once beyond the initial start-up period, load factors on our core itineraries averaged 44%, and all of those ships were cash flow accretive. 
The last point I would like to make is that while we now have more than 65% of our capacity up and running, leading the industry by far on a relative basis, we are continuing to manage our load factors to ensure that we stay true to our healthy return to service tenets, as well as retaining price integrity. 
Now I'd like to discuss capacity and load factor expectations over the upcoming period. For the fourth quarter, a little over 2/3 of our capacity will be sailing core itineraries beyond the initial start-up period. As such, our overall load factors will continue to trend of increasing from one month to the next and are expected to be in the range of 60% and 65% in the fourth quarter. In addition, we do expect our fleet on our core itineraries to generate direct profit. 
Given our healthy return to service tenets and our focus on price integrity, we expect our load factors in 2022 to continue to steadily increase month-by-month and return to historic levels in the summer. From a capacity standpoint, we expect that 50 of our 61 ships who have returned to service by the end of this year. By the end of Q1 2022, we expect about 85% of our capacity to be operating with 100% back in service in the spring in time for the lucrative summer season. 
While we are offering cruises in the vast majority of our key destinations, we continue to closely monitor both China and Australia and anticipate those markets will start opening in the spring. This timing could influence the return dates of a few of our ships. 
As to our balance sheet, we ended the third quarter of 2021 with $4 billion in liquidity. During the third quarter, we continued our efforts to manage and improve our balance sheet. To that end, we successfully issued $1 billion in senior unsecured notes at 5.5% due in 2026. These proceeds were used to replenish capital as a result of the redemption of 40% of the 11.5% senior secured notes that were due in 2025. This redemption will result in a full year interest savings of $51 million. 
As we discussed on other calls during the pandemic, we have taken and continue to take numerous actions to reshape our cost structure with a focus on further improving our leading pre-COVID margins. These actions include getting rid of older tonnage and adding more leading, high-yielding and cost-efficient hardware to our fleet. While these actions will improve our cost structure and margin profile, we do anticipate the recent inflationary pressures and some transitory cost related to healthy return to service will weigh on next year's earnings. 
Now I'll give you an update on our 2022 sailings. At a macro level, we've seen a sequential improvement and new bookings from one quarter to the next. Bookings during Q2 were higher than Q1 and bookings during Q3 were higher than Q2. This Q3 improvement took place despite the long demand in August that corresponded with the rise in the Delta variant. September was a great booking month overall with new bookings for 2022, more than 60% higher than Q2 average. The momentum has continued for all 3 of our brands and bookings so far in October have been significantly better than September. 
Bookings from our 2 biggest markets, the U.S. and the U.K., have been improving from one week to the next and are now exceeding 2019 levels. We have now restarted our brands marketing programs, which are generating strong results and preparing us nicely for 2022 and 2023. From a cumulative standpoint, our book load factors remain within historical ranges, driven by strong booking levels for the second quarter of 2022 forward. Load factors in the first quarter are lower than historical levels but are aligned with our anticipated load factor ramp-up. Our booked APDs are up significantly, both including and excluding the negative impact of FCCs for the full year and for each quarter of 2022. 
As always, trends do differ a little by itinerary with our core summer products and a stronger volume position than other itineraries. Our customer deposit balance is now $2.8 billion, an improvement of about $400 million over the past quarter, despite the significant quarter-over-quarter increase in revenue recognition, which reduces the customer deposit balance. Our customer deposit balance is less than 15% lower than it was at the end of September 2019, for the 3 brands with almost the entire difference driven by Q4 2021 sailings. Our customer deposit balance related to bookings in Q2 forward sailings for all 3 brands is higher than at the same time in 2019. Approximately, 35% of our customer deposit balance is related to FCCs. Of the FCCs, approximately 45% of them have been redeemed thus far. 
Now considering everything I just said about the booking environment and costs, I would like to discuss our very early view of 2022. The Royal Caribbean Group possesses the best brands in their segments, the most innovative fleet in the industry, wholly owned destination experiences like Perfect Day at CocoCay that are second to none, a nimble and effective global sourcing footprint and most of all, the very best team both at sea and on land. This incredible and unique set of assets have helped us effectively manage through the pandemic and is now helping us accelerate out of it. As such, while it's still too early to provide guidance for the next year, we currently anticipate the group generating positive EBITDA starting in the spring of 2022 and positive earnings for the full year of 2022. 
With that, I will ask our operator to open up the call for a question-and-answer session."

I'll have Mike on in a second here to talk about the CSO, but that's not governing our load factor build.

I think with the CSO, we've been through quite a journey with collaboration and the work with the CDC. And I think if you think what we've been through in terms of determining the protocols and then executing them, I think it's fair to say that the industry, and the CDC and the intergovernmental agency representatives, who have been part of this return to service team, feel like we've been very successful in implementing these protocols. And they're proving, as we commented earlier, to be very successful. 
While the CSO comes to its kind of a technical end on January 15, we will continue our ongoing collaboration with the CDC in terms of the protocols that will voluntarily operate after the CSO expires. And I think what's happened over this past several months is that we've really got a focused, collaborative effort, and we found the relationship with the CDC has been very constructive. They certainly -- and we want to make sure that we're operating safely. And they're also well aware that some of the protocols that we have in place will naturally fall away as the pandemic moves further and further in the rearview mirror. So I think as we move into '22, hopefully, what we'll see is the protocols become easier and less cumbersome for our customers. 
Having said that and kind of jumping on Jason's comments about load factor, while we've been extremely prudent and thoughtful about bringing back our fleet and managing the load factors, it's worth pointing out that -- and I'll use Royal Caribbean International as a proxy for the company, we've brought back significantly more capacity ships, beds and berths than any of our competitors by a significant demand. And what that means is that operationally and logistically, we've already climbed over that mountain, and we've now got a large number of assets available for booking. 
And more importantly, we've now gone through and absorbed all of those expenses. We vaccinated all of our crew. We've managed to get all of our crew to these ships, and we're operating them. One of the things that we were very cognizant of is the need to be very consistent with the distribution and the customer because as Richard pointed out, we've had so many cancellations of ships over the past 1.5 years, and now we have this stability. 
So as we look into '22, we feel pretty optimistic about what we've achieved with the CDC and the CSO, and I think we're feeling very optimistic about the fact that we've got so many of our ships already up and operating. And while we've talked about the load factors, it's worth pointing out that it's a story that's, for the purposes of this conversation, is averaged out. Last weekend, Freedom of the Seas sailed from Miami with an occupancy of 85%. And that's one of the products that's particularly attractive to new-to-cruise, and it's one of the products that we've been very focused on and making sure that we're learning and understanding exactly how our protocols can adapt to more capacity. So we feel pretty good about what's happening."

We have done a lot. And of course, and that consideration is, we do expect there to be some additional costs that relate to inflation. We've hedged, I think, 53% of our fuel for the next year. And I think one of the things that we'll toggle here is, as Michael was referring to, our healthy return to service protocols, there will be a series of transitory costs. 
A lot of those transitory costs we've absorbed this year, as Michael talked about and the ramping up of our fleet, but there will still be more ramp-up that happens next year. And depending on how some of these protocols, which are very much kind of self-induced here around testing as that -- based off of that could impact our cost profile. But even kind of considering all that, that's why I think we feel at this point, you're comfortable talking about pointing the business towards profitability in 2022.

We do -- we did press pause during the pandemic on these projects, but we've started to reengage. And quite literally last week, there was a conference down in Panama with many of the Caribbean countries. And it was quite interesting to see the level of activity that we experienced in terms of reengaging and talking about destination developments throughout the Caribbean South Central region. 
So we did obviously have a plan in place prepandemic. We press pause. We are now reengaging on all of those plans. In the immediate future, we have an expansion taking place in Perfect Day with the addition of Hideaway Beach, which is a new experience that will open in late '22 for Perfect Day. The beauty of Hideaway Beach is that it is an adult-only area as part of Perfect Day. It will allow us to increase our capacity by approximately 3,000 people a day in late '22, which is obviously going to help improve our overall profitability and drive more revenue, both ticket and onboard. So that's coming. And then we're close to finalizing the design and construction plans and the approvals for Beach Club in Nassau, which we're hoping to start work on that very soon, and we have other projects that we've now started to reengage with. 
So I think our aspirations never really moved away. We just had to press pause for a while. Also, of course, we've got our Galveston terminal that's opening in '22, and that will accommodate our Oasis class ships and then future Icon. And of course, that gives us remarkable access into the Texas, Oklahoma, and that whole region as a market for driving -- drive into. So we're continuing our journey, but certainly, Perfect Day is leading the charge on current bookings."

I think that's a combination of us coming out of Delta and that pent-up demand. I also think it's a combination of our marketing efforts that have come into play here, that are accelerating and getting into the minds of the consumer, especially our new-to-cruise consumer that we've seen that acceleration. 
I'd also comment that we're seeing now very similar trends for all of our brands. So if you remember, in the early part of this year, we talked about strong trends, especially in the ultra-luxury side, as we're coming out of this. We're now seeing strong trends across all of our brands which helps us provide further confidence there. And we've also seen booking, especially over the past 30 to 40 days really pick up for Q1 as well as Q4 of next year. There's always very strong demand for Q2 and Q3 with the summer, but seeing those shoulder seasons begin to rise, I think it's also been very encouraging. And again, that's consistent with all of our brands."

The other thing that we've seen, which we commented on was the onboard revenue environment, which is truly impressive. A couple of things that are happening there. I mean we know that there's just more consumer spend occurring, and it seems to be really happening on our ships. We've also really increased the volume of special groups such as gaming groups that are coming on our ships and that's proving to be very profitable. And the other thing is that we continued the investment in Hybris, which is a new software, which really allows us to have far more capability in our pre-cruise revenue marketing, and that is really beginning to shine through for us. So as we look into '22, for example, just in Q1 '22, our pre-cruise revenue bookings are already way ahead of 2019, even though there's less volume on gas. So it's -- there's a lot of positive things that are coming through to help us."

When you talk about load factor in Q1 being kind of below historic range or lower than average, how much of that -- you talked about expecting occupancy levels to end up around 85% for Q1. So can you quantify -- are you actually sort of not selling? Is 15% of your capacity not available for sale in Q1 on the ships that would be in service? So just to kind of help quantify how much of the lower load factor in Q1 is actually what's not available for sale? 
And then also, probably the other big factor is the fact that you've had to rejigger a bunch of itineraries in the last few months. And so what percent -- I don't know if you would know this ballpark of your Q1 itineraries are things that were kind of rejiggered in the last year as opposed to you normally have 12 months to sell an itinerary. Now some of these itineraries, you'd be selling in less than 6 months. So I don't know if you can quantify that. As opposed to -- right, so investors sort of trying to get a handle on how much is that versus like, oh, load is below in Q1 because people don't want to travel yet versus these other 2 factors that I think are probably part of it."

One, I think we need to remember that about 80% of our capacity is expected to be up in sailing by the end of the year. So as we move into Q1, which is where the majority of that -- the rest of that 20% comes into play, similar to what we have been doing here and from June on, as we slowly bring in these ships to make sure that the crew and everyone is very used to the protocols that need to be executed on, making sure the guest experience is exceptional. And so we are certainly moderating load factor and ramping that up. And so that's going to weigh in on Q1 load factors and leave in a little of early Q2 load factors as there's a few more ships that come into play. 
That's probably the biggest driver of why in Q1 our load factor would be lower than what you would see Q2, going forward. Certainly, my guess is, there's probably 15% to 20% of our capacity in which there's, I would say, more than moderate itinerary changes and that -- because I mean, most of our itineraries there might be a port here or port there that has changed out of this, but it's -- that's not really the driver of it. Maintaining price integrity, slowly ramping up our fleet or ramping up our fleet or the ships that come on in a manageable way is really what's driving the difference here on the load factor in Q1."

And what that might mean for onboard and pricing comparability of what you're sailing now versus 2019? And then as you think about ramping to full load into the second half of next year, is that reliant on selling out all the interiors like you did pre-COVID."

We are -- and this, by the way, is how we are typically booked this far out as we're weighted more towards our suites and our balconies. People when they tend to plan their vacations further out and you look at the booking window, it's typically weighted more that way. And so between now and time of sailing is when you begin to see inside cabins and so forth start to move in. But when we look at the pricing of it, it's again relative to '19, it's coming in as we would expect it to and at rates that are very similar to those records of 2019. 
But certainly, it's weighted heavier at this point towards those balconies as well as those suites. Now in saying all of that, our inventory of our ships is getting richer and richer. And so we have more and more of that inventory coming into play, which again just further supports and bolsters our yield profile and growth here in the future."

We have time for one more question."

We -- obviously, in the early days, new-to-cruise had basically kind of turned itself off for the most part, and today, what we see is that they have certainly returned. I think our marketing efforts have really helped that in just reminding those customers about the incredible experiences you can have on our leading fleet as well as amazing places like Perfect Day at CocoCay. 
So I think those things in kind of combination -- and of course, just kind of thawing out here over the pandemic has led to the new-to-cruise customer coming back and certainly accelerating. So we're really happy to see that now taking place, and again, all the surveying that we're doing really shows that they're quite open to coming back and that's being supported by their booking activity."
