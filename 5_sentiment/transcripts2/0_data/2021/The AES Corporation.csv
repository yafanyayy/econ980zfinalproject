Some of yo",574,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial review call. This morning, I will provide an update on our major financial and strategic accomplishments, which position us well for the future. 
Some of you may recall that last year, I set out 3 short-term catalysts for our stock: hitting our numbers, getting a second investment-grade rating and becoming Norges Bank cold generation compliant. In 2020, we delivered on all 3 metrics and set ourselves up for continued progress. First, let me talk about hitting our numbers. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.44, which was above our guidance range of $1.32 to $1.42. Our parent free cash flow came in at $777 million, which also exceeded the top end of our range of $725 million to $775 million. 
Second, in November, S&P upgraded us to an investment-grade rating of BBB-, joining Fitch, which had upgraded us in 2019. Third, by selling and retiring coal plants and building new renewables, we reduced the percentage of megawatt hours being produced by coal plants to 25% on a pro forma basis, which is comfortably below Noges' Bank threshold of 30%. All of these results reflect the resilience of our business model, which is anchored on long-term, dollar-denominated contracts with investment-grade off-takers and U.S.-regulated utilities. 
In addition to these achievements, in 2020, we continue to advance our leadership in innovation and new Green technologies. We signed 3 gigawatts of long-term contracts for renewables, which is also at the top end of our range of guidance of 2 to 3 gigawatts. 
As you can see on Slide 4, these 3 gigawatts of new renewable PPAs are mostly in the U.S. and South America. In the U.S., we have merged our 2 development companies, AES Distributed Energy and sPower into 1 entity, AES Clean Energy, to better take advantage of synergies and economies of scale. 
In South America, our renewables growth was fueled in part by the continued success of our Green Blend and Extend negotiations, which combined new renewables with existing long-term conventional capacity contracts. With the addition of these 3 gigawatts of new PPAs, our current backlog of projects reaches 6.9 gigawatts, as shown on Slide 5. About half of the total solar and most of the remainder is wind in energy storage. 100% of our backlog is renewable. We expect to bring almost 4 gigawatts of this backlog online in 2021, one of the largest capacity additions in AES' history. 
Finally, turning to Slide 6. Fluence. Our joint venture with Siemens to provide energy storage systems maintained its global leadership position and signed 785 megawatts of new capacity. Its revenues grew 400% versus the prior year, and they acquired AMS' leading AI-enabled bidding software business. A capital raise was also announced with the Qatar Investment Authority, which will provide funds to further accelerate the development of its digital product offerings and the deployment of its systems around the world. 
As you can see, we are very well positioned to continue our solid renewables growth, aggressive decarbonization and deployment of leading technology innovations. The electricity sector is changing rapidly, and we will be providing a comprehensive view of AES' long-term plans and opportunities in this new environment, next Wednesday, March 3 at our Investor Day. 
Now let me turn the call over to Gustavo, who will provide more color on our financial results for 2020 and guidance for 2021."

Today, I'll cover the following key topics: our financial performance during the fourth quarter and full year 2020, our capital allocation initiatives in 2020 and our 2021 guidance. As Andrés mentioned, o",1013,"Thank you, Andrés, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover the following key topics: our financial performance during the fourth quarter and full year 2020, our capital allocation initiatives in 2020 and our 2021 guidance. 
As Andrés mentioned, our results for 2020 highlighted the resilience of our business model. We delivered a strong financial performance while navigating challenging macro conditions, including the impacts of lower demand due to COVID-19 and a record dry hydrology in Colombia. We finished the year on a strong note, setting a solid foundation for continued growth. 
Turning to Slide 8. Full year adjusted EPS of $1.44 exceeded the top end of our guidance range and was at the midpoint of our regional pre-COVID guidance range. As I noted, the key negative impacts on our results were from lower demand and adverse hydrology. Our generation business, which accounts for more than 80% of our earnings is largely insulated from demand fluctuations. However, as we have discussed in the past, our U.S. utilities did experience a reduction in demand due to the economic impact of the pandemic. Although there has been a gradual recovery in demand in the second half of 2020, the impact on a full year basis was approximately $0.04. 
Regarding hydrology, we experienced average hydrology in most of our markets, except in Colombia, where it was one of the worst hydrological years on record. The total impact of hydrology on our full year results was approximately $0.05 in South America, primarily in Colombia. We expected the hydrological conditions to be normal in Colombia in 2021, in line with the long-term historical average and have already observed this trend in the year-to-date. Despite the headwinds from these 2 areas, we are able to deliver on our full year guidance as a result of higher contributions from new businesses and improved operating performance in South America. 
We also benefited from our cost savings initiatives, interest expense savings, resulting from $7 billion of refinancings across the portfolio and a lower adjusted tax rate. 
Turning to Slide 9. Adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, was $1.2 billion for the year, an increase of $7 million versus 2019. I will cover our results in more detail over the next 4 slides, beginning with the U.S. and Utilities SBU on Slide 10. 
As you may have seen yesterday, we have rebranded our U.S. Utilities, the P&L and IPL, to align with the new AES brand. For now on, these businesses will be known as AES Ohio and as Indiana, respectively. In 2020, lower PTC at our U.S. and Utilities SBU reflects the impact of the reversion to ESP on rates at AES Ohio in 2019 and lower demand at our utilities due to the impact of COVID-19 and milder weather. These impacts were partially offset by the benefit from the commencement of PPAs at the Southland Energy CCGTs as well as the contributions from new renewable projects. 
Higher PTC at our South America SBU was largely driven by higher contributions from AES and Air and a favorable revision of regulatory charge at AES Tietê in Brazil. These impacts were partially offset by dryer hydrology and a planned major outage at the Chivor hydro plant in Colombia and the regulatory changes in Argentina in 2019. Lower PTC at our MCAC SBU primarily reflects the impact from insurance recovery in prior year as well as outages incurred in 22 in Domenica Republic, partially offset by improved availability and hydrology in Panama. 
Finally, in Eurasia, higher results reflect lower interest expense due to the debt repayment in 2020 in Bulgaria, partially offset by the impact of businesses sold in the United Kingdom in 2019. 
Now turning to our credit profile on Slide 14. Our significantly reduced parent debt and growing free cash flow enabled us to improve our credit metrics by 400 basis points since 2018. At the end of 2020, our parent free cash flow to net debt ratio was 23%, well above the 20% threshold required for an investment-grade rating. Strong credit metrics remain one of our top priorities, and we continue to take steps to maintain and further improve upon current levels. Furthermore, we took advantage last year of a low interest rate environment and refinanced approximately $7 billion of debt across our portfolio, extending maturities and capturing annualized interest savings of $90 million. 
Now to our 2020 parent capital allocation on Slide 15. Beginning on the left-hand side, sources reflect $1.3 billion of total discretionary cash. Asset sales of $530 million reflect the net proceeds from the sale of OPGC and the sell-down of 35% of our interest in the Southland repowering projects. Parent free cash flow of $777 million exceeded the top end of our expectation. 
Moving to uses on the right-hand side. Roughly 1/3 of our discretionary cash was allocated to shareholder dividend and debt repayment. We invested $812 million in our subsidiaries, primarily in our renewables backlog, Southland repowering and AES Ohio. Approximately 90% of the total investments in subsidiaries were in the U.S., contributing to our goal of increasing the proportion of earnings from the U.S. to about half. 
Turning to our guidance on Slide 16. Today, we are initiating guidance for 2021 adjusted EPS of $1.50 to $1.58, in line with our average annual growth target of 7% to 9%. Parent free cash flow for 2021 is expected to be $775 million to $825 million, which is based on 7% growth from the midpoint of our [ '22 ] [indiscernible] expectation of $750 million. Key drivers of our expected growth in adjusted EPS in 2021 include: a full year of operations of our 1.3 gigawatt Southland repowering project, which came online in mid-2020; continued growth in renewables, including 4 gigawatts expected to reach commercial operation this year; efficiency gains from cost savings in our digital initiatives; and an interest savings due to refinancing benefits and completed that reduction. We look forward to discussing our long-term growth rates and drivers with you all at our Investor Day next week. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andrés."

Let me start it, and then I'll pass it over to Gustavo. So look, next year is very interesting just from a cutting ribbon point of view. We have 4 gigawatts is coming online. So that represents PPAs, which were signed in the past. And this is one of",381,"Yes. Let me start it, and then I'll pass it over to Gustavo. So look, next year is very interesting just from a cutting ribbon point of view. We have 4 gigawatts is coming online. So that represents PPAs, which were signed in the past. And this is one of the highest additions to our fleet in our history in a single year. So that, we feel very good about. 
So the second thing is, as you correctly pointed out, our renewables come in different flavors. So about half is outside the U.S. So that in -- what we're -- and about half is solar, and about half is -- there is some hydro coming online, but there is mostly win some energy storage. 
Regarding Fluence, I would say that Fluence will not be a contributor to earnings next year because it's in a very rapid growth phase. What we see is a big increase and acceleration in demand for energy storage as more uses are seen. And there were some questions about prior on this call about grid stability. And then yes, it can play an important role in that. 
So we see growth accelerating in Fluence. And basically, as a result of that, it's harder to hit that breakeven. But I would say that in terms of it just a little bit postponed in time because you're gearing up. Now we came out with the new cube stack. We also bought the AI-enabled bidding platform from AMS, and that's a very interesting addition. And we've had sales of AMS bidding engine, actually not using Fluence's hardware. So generally, I would say that this kind of software platforms have so less capital-intensive than building the cube stack itself. So that will help us turn profitability sooner. 
But there's this trade-off between very rapid growth and starting to breakeven. But we feel very good about the company. 
So I'll pass it now to Gusta to talk a little bit about the breakdown of our earnings. Now I realize a lot of these things are somewhat tied together because you have like green blend and extend. So you basically have a capacity contract with a fossil plant, plus renewables being added on to that. 
So with that, I'll pass on to Gustavo."

And then you have some items that offset each other. So there is a drag on tax. Tax was particularly lower. But we have recovered, for example, in the demand side from the Utilities, you're expecting some recovery there. We have the cost cuttings also that we offset some of the drag from tax. 
So if you clean all of that, I would say, mostly of the growth or primarily the growth is coming from the new additions, being Southland full year and $0.05 from renewables."

So we have 2 years where we've basically been about a 3 gigawatt. Now when we talk about that, that's PPA signed. So those will be brought online. Normally in the period, within 24 months, probably the average is about 18 months. So it's a lag there. So we have had 2 very strong years. So 4 gigawatts are going to come online, that means they're actually coming online. So the goal is sign PPAs. The second is which are actually going to start contributing to your earnings. So we see continued acceleration, let's say, in the renewables business. So we feel very comfortable. It's no longer sort of 2 to 3, it's more a 3-plus going forward. And this could -- we have to see -- we'll be talking about this on Wednesday, I don't want to get to it or ahead of us. 
Now regarding Fluence, and really, we do have a number of unicorns that we've done. It started with Atimos in Brazil, which was the telecom fiber optic rings that we had distributed energy, Fluence is one. And we have another -- some more potential ones that we're developing. So I would say that we're creating a lot of value with Fluence in 2 different ways. First, half of our renewable PPAs that we're signing have an energy storage component. So right there, it makes us competitive, really understanding how to use energy storage and how to be very creative. I mean what we did in Hawaii, as you know, we want a price for that. We have other projects coming on in Hawaii. We have the first -- world's first virtual reservoir. We have a number of new uses. So as is part of that engine of growth, affluence because we are creating many new applications, and that is helping fluence. And then we're getting it through the valuation Fluence itself. 
So if you look at the valuation of Fluence, expected it to do very well. We started with the Qatari Investment Authority. Qatar is a particularly excellent partner at this stage for its investments in other technologies, from batteries to potential clients like Nebros in the Middle East. So this is kind of somewhere between the financial and a strategic investor here. 
So no, I don't think the time is now to get rid of Fluence in any way. I think we're in there for the long term. I think there are opportunities in the future that we will evaluate. But no, we're very pleased with it. And I think we're just starting to see the real inflection point here for energy storage."

This morning, I will provide an update on our major financial and strategic accomplishments, which position us well for the future. 
Some of you may recall that last year, I set out 3 short-term catalysts for our stock: hitting our numbers, getting a second investment-grade rating and becoming Norges Bank coal generation compliant. In 2020, we delivered on all 3 metrics and set ourselves up for continued progress. First, let me talk about hitting our numbers. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.44, which was above our guidance range of $1.32 to $1.42. Our parent free cash flow came in at $777 million, which also exceeded the top end of our range of $725 million to $775 million. 
Second, in November, S&P upgraded us to an investment-grade rating of BBB-, joining Fitch, which had upgraded us in 2019. Third, by selling and retiring coal plants and building new renewables, we reduced the percentage of megawatt hours being produced by coal plants to 25% on a pro forma basis, which is comfortably below Norges' Bank threshold of 30%. All of these results reflect the resilience of our business model, which is anchored on long-term, dollar-denominated contracts with investment-grade off-takers and U.S.-regulated utilities. 
In addition to these achievements, in 2020, we continue to advance our leadership in innovation and new green technologies. We signed 3 gigawatts of long-term contracts for renewables, which is also at the top end of our range of guidance of 2 to 3 gigawatts. 
As you can see on Slide 4, these 3 gigawatts of new renewable PPAs are mostly in the U.S. and South America. In the U.S., we have merged our 2 development companies, AES Distributed Energy and sPower into 1 entity, AES Clean Energy, to better take advantage of synergies and economies of scale. 
In South America, our renewables growth was fueled in part by the continued success of our Green Blend and Extend negotiations, which combined new renewables with existing long-term conventional capacity contracts. With the addition of these 3 gigawatts of new PPAs, our current backlog of projects reaches 6.9 gigawatts, as shown on Slide 5. About half of the total solar and most of the remainder is wind in energy storage. 100% of our backlog is renewable. We expect to bring almost 4 gigawatts of this backlog online in 2021, one of the largest capacity additions in AES' history. 
Finally, turning to Slide 6. Fluence, our joint venture with Siemens to provide energy storage systems maintained its global leadership position and signed 785 megawatts of new capacity. Its revenues grew 400% versus the prior year, and they acquired AMS' leading AI-enabled bidding software business. A capital raise was also announced with the Qatar Investment Authority, which will provide funds to further accelerate the development of its digital product offerings and the deployment of its systems around the world. 
As you can see, we are very well positioned to continue our solid renewables growth, aggressive decarbonization and deployment of leading technology innovations. The electricity sector is changing rapidly, and we will be providing a comprehensive view of AES' long-term plans and opportunities in this new environment, next Wednesday, March 3 at our Investor Day. 
Now let me turn the call over to Gustavo, who will provide more color on our financial results for 2020 and guidance for 2021."

Today, I'll cover the following key topics: our financial performance during the fourth quarter and full year 2020; our capital allocation initiatives in 2020; and our 2021 guidance. As Andrés mentioned,",1009,"Thank you, Andrés, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover the following key topics: our financial performance during the fourth quarter and full year 2020; our capital allocation initiatives in 2020; and our 2021 guidance. 
As Andrés mentioned, our results for 2020 highlighted the resilience of our business model. We delivered a strong financial performance while navigating challenging macro conditions, including the impacts of lower demand due to COVID-19 and a record dry hydrology in Colombia. We finished the year on a strong note, setting a solid foundation for continued growth. 
Turning to Slide 8. Full year adjusted EPS of $1.44 exceeded the top end of our guidance range and was at the midpoint of our regional pre-COVID guidance range. As I noted, the key negative impacts on our results were from lower demand and adverse hydrology. Our generation business, which accounts for more than 80% of our earnings is largely insulated from demand fluctuations. However, as we have discussed in the past, our U.S. utilities did experience a reduction in demand due to the economic impact of the pandemic. Although there has been a gradual recovery in demand in the second half of 2020, the impact on a full year basis was approximately $0.04. 
Regarding hydrology, we experienced average hydrology in most of our markets, except in Colombia, where it was one of the worst hydrological years on record. The total impact of hydrology on our full year results was approximately $0.05 in South America, primarily in Colombia. We expected the hydrological conditions to be normal in Colombia in 2021, in line with the long-term historical average and have already observed this trend in the year-to-date. Despite the headwinds from these 2 areas, we are able to deliver on our full year guidance as a result of higher contributions from new businesses and improved operating performance in South America. 
We also benefited from our cost savings initiatives, interest expense savings, resulting from $7 billion of refinancings across the portfolio and a lower adjusted tax rate. 
Turning to Slide 9. Adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, was $1.2 billion for the year, an increase of $7 million versus 2019. I will cover our results in more detail over the next 4 slides, beginning with the U.S. and Utilities SBU on Slide 10. 
As you may have seen yesterday, we have rebranded our U.S. Utilities, the P&L and IPL, to align with the new AES brand. From now on, these businesses will be known as AES Ohio and AES Indiana, respectively. In 2020, lower PTC at our U.S. and Utilities SBU reflects the impact of the reversion to ESP on rates at AES Ohio in 2019 and lower demand at our utilities due to the impact of COVID-19 and milder weather. These impacts were partially offset by the benefit from the commencement of PPAs at the Southland Energy CCGTs as well as the contributions from new renewable projects. 
Higher PTC at our South America SBU was largely driven by higher contributions from AES Gener and a favorable revision of regulatory charge at AES Tietê in Brazil. These impacts were partially offset by dryer hydrology and a planned major outage at the Chivor hydro plant in Colombia and the regulatory changes in Argentina in 2019. Lower PTC at our MCAC SBU primarily reflects the impact from insurance recovery in prior year as well as outages incurred in 22 in Dominican Republic, partially offset by improved availability and hydrology in Panama. 
Finally, in Eurasia, higher results reflect lower interest expense due to the debt repayment in 2020 in Bulgaria, partially offset by the impact of businesses sold in the United Kingdom in 2019. 
Now turning to our credit profile on Slide 14. Our significantly reduced parent debt and growing free cash flow enabled us to improve our credit metrics by 400 basis points since 2018. At the end of 2020, our parent free cash flow to net debt ratio was 23%, well above the 20% threshold required for an investment-grade rating. Strong credit metrics remain one of our top priorities, and we continue to take steps to maintain and further improve upon current levels. Furthermore, we took advantage last year of a low interest rate environment and refinanced approximately $7 billion of debt across our portfolio, extending maturities and capturing annualized interest savings of $90 million. 
Now to our 2020 parent capital allocation on Slide 15. Beginning on the left-hand side, sources reflect $1.3 billion of total discretionary cash. Asset sales of $530 million reflect the net proceeds from the sale of OPGC and the sell-down of 35% of our interest in the Southland repowering projects. Parent free cash flow of $777 million exceeded the top end of our expectation. 
Moving to uses on the right-hand side. Roughly 1/3 of our discretionary cash was allocated to shareholder dividend and debt repayment. We invested $812 million in our subsidiaries, primarily in our renewables backlog, Southland repowering and AES Ohio. Approximately 90% of the total investments in subsidiaries were in the U.S., contributing to our goal of increasing the proportion of earnings from the U.S. to about half. 
Turning to our guidance on Slide 16. Today, we are initiating guidance for 2021 adjusted EPS of $1.50 to $1.58, in line with our average annual growth target of 7% to 9%. Parent free cash flow for 2021 is expected to be $775 million to $825 million, which is based on 7% growth from the midpoint of our 2022 expectation of $750 million. Key drivers of our expected growth in adjusted EPS in 2021 include: a full year of operations of our 1.3 gigawatt Southland repowering project, which came online in mid-2020; continued growth in renewables, including 4 gigawatts expected to reach commercial operation this year; efficiency gains from cost savings in our digital initiatives; and an interest savings due to refinancing benefits and completed debt reduction. We look forward to discussing our long-term growth rates and drivers with you all at our Investor Day next week. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andrés."

Let me start it, and then I'll pass it over to Gustavo. So look, next year is very interesting just from a cutting ribbon point of view. We have -- 4 gigawatts is coming online. So that represents PPAs, which were signed in the past. And this is one",382,"Yes. Let me start it, and then I'll pass it over to Gustavo. So look, next year is very interesting just from a cutting ribbon point of view. We have -- 4 gigawatts is coming online. So that represents PPAs, which were signed in the past. And this is one of the highest additions to our fleet in our history in a single year. So that, we feel very good about. 
So the second thing is, as you correctly pointed out, our renewables come in different flavors. So about half is outside the U.S. So that in -- what we're -- and about half is solar, and about half is -- there is some hydro coming online, but there is mostly wind, some energy storage. 
Regarding Fluence, I would say that Fluence will not be a contributor to earnings next year because it's in a very rapid growth phase. What we see is a big increase and acceleration in demand for energy storage as more uses are seen. And there were some questions about prior on this call about grid stability. And then yes, it can play an important role in that. 
So we see growth accelerating in Fluence. And basically, as a result of that, it's harder to hit that breakeven. But I would say that in terms of it just a little bit postponed in time because you're gearing up. Now we came out with the new cube stack. We also bought the AI-enabled bidding platform from AMS, and that's a very interesting addition. And we've had sales of AMS bidding engine, actually not using Fluence's hardware. So generally, I would say that this kind of software platforms have less capital-intensive than building the cube stack itself. So that will help us turn profitability sooner. But there's this trade-off between very rapid growth and starting to breakeven. But we feel very good about the company. 
So I'll pass it now to Gustavo to talk a little bit about the breakdown of our earnings. Now I realize a lot of these things are somewhat tied together because you have like Green Blend and Extend. So you basically have a capacity contract with a fossil plant, plus renewables being added on to that. 
So with that, I'll pass it on to Gustavo."

And then renewables altogether, we are bringing 4 gigawatts online, as Andrés said. Renewables altogether is about $0.05. So the delta 2021 is mostly driven by those additions. 
And then you have some items that offset each other. So there is a drag on tax. Tax was particularly lower. But we have recovered, for example, in the demand side from the Utilities, you're expecting some recovery there. We have the cost cuttings also that will offset some of the drag from tax. 
So if you clean all of that, I would say, mostly of the growth or primarily the growth is coming from the new additions, being Southland full year and $0.05 from renewables."

So we have 2 years where we've basically been about at 3 gigawatt. Now when we talk about that, that's PPA signed. So those will be brought online. Normally in a period, within 24 months, probably the average is about 18 months. So it's a lag there. So we have had 2 very strong years. So 4 gigawatts are going to come online, that means they're actually coming online. So the goal is sign PPAs. The second is which are actually going to start contributing to your earnings. So we see continued acceleration, let's say, in the renewables business. So we feel very comfortable. It's no longer sort of 2 to 3, it's more a 3-plus going forward. And this could -- we have to see -- we'll be talking about this on Wednesday, I don't want to get too ahead of us. 
Now regarding Fluence, and really, we do have a number of unicorns that we've done. It started with Atimus in Brazil, which was the telecom fiber optic rings that we had distributed energy, Fluence is one. And we have another -- some more potential ones that we're developing. So I would say that we're creating a lot of value with Fluence in 2 different ways. First, half of our renewable PPAs that we're signing have an energy storage component. 
So right there, it makes us competitive, really understanding how to use energy storage and how to be very creative. I mean what we did in Hawaii, as you know, we want a price for that. We have other projects coming on in Hawaii. We have the first -- world's first virtual reservoir. We have a number of new uses. So AES is part of that engine of growth of Fluence because we are creating many new applications, and that is helping Fluence. And then we're getting it through the valuation of Fluence itself. 
So if you look at the valuation of Fluence, I expect it to do very well. We started with the Qatari Investment Authority. Qatar is a particularly excellent partner at this stage for its investments in other technologies, from batteries to potential clients like Nabors in the Middle East. So this is kind of somewhere between the financial and a strategic investor here. 
So no, I don't think the time is now to get rid of Fluence in any way. I think we're in there for the long term. I think there are opportunities in the future that we will evaluate. But no, we're very pleased with it. And I think we're just starting to see the real inflection point here for energy storage."

Our first quarter results put us on track to achieve our 2021 guidance and 7% to 9% average annual growth through 2025. Gustavo will provide more color on our financial results later in the call. As we spoke about on our Investor Day in early March, we see a great opportunity for growth given the momentous changes in our sector, and we are very well positioned to capitalize on the shift to low-carbon sources of energy. Over the past 5 years, we have transformed our company to be a leader in renewables, and we have invested in innovative technologies that will give us a competitive advantage for many years to come. Although it has been less than 2 months since our Investor Day, we had a number of significant achievements to announce, including a landmark deal with Google, which I will describe in more detail later, a strategic collaboration to develop new battery technologies between Fluence and Northvolt, the leading European supplier of sustainable battery systems and a significant increase in LNG sales in Central America and the Caribbean to support those economies in their transition away from heavy fuels. First, let me lay out our strategic priorities for 2021 and the substantial progress that we have made year-to-date towards achieving those objectives. 
Turning to Slide 4. Our 5 key goals for the year are: one, signed contracts for 4 gigawatts of renewables; two, launched the for 24/7 product for carbon-free energy on an hourly basis; three, further unlock the value of our technology platforms; four, continue to improve our ESG positioning through the transformation of our portfolio; and five, monetize excess LNG capacity in Central America and Caribbean. 
Turning to Slide 5. Last year, we set and exceeded a goal of signing 2 to 3 gigawatts of PPAs for renewables and energy storage. This year, we are increasing that goal by 60% to a target of 4 gigawatts. Today, I am pleased to report that year-to-date, we've already signed 1.1 gigawatts including a landmark deal with Google. 
As you can see on Slide 6, we have a backlog of 6.9 gigawatts of renewables, consisting of projects already under construction or under signed power purchase agreements or PPAs. This equates to 20% growth in our total installed capacity and a 60% increase in our renewables capacity. 
Turning to Slide 7. We continue to increase our pipeline of projects to support our growth and now have a global pipeline of more than 30 gigawatts of renewable projects, roughly half of which is the United States. With increasing demand from corporate customers and a much more favorable policy environment, we expect the need for renewables to grow dramatically, and we're taking steps to ensure a continued competitive advantage. 
Moving to Slide 8. Our second key goal for this year is to launch the first 24/7 energy product that matches a customer's load with carbon-free energy on an hourly basis. To that end, earlier this week, we announced a landmark, first of its kind agreement to supply Google's Virginia based data centers with 24/7 carbon-free energy sourced from a portfolio of 500 megawatts of renewables. Under this innovative structure, AES will become the sole supplier of the data center's energy needs, ensuring that the energy supplied will meet carbon-free targets when measured on an hourly basis for the next 10 years. The carbon-free energy will come from an optimized portfolio of wind, solar, hydro and battery storage resources. This agreement sets a new standard in carbon-free energy for commercial and industrial customers who signed 23 gigawatts of PPAs in 2020. As we discussed at our Investor Day, the almost 300 companies that make up the RE100 will need more than 100 gigawatts of new renewables by 2030. This transaction with Google demonstrates that a higher sustainability standard is possible, and we expect a substantial portion of customers to pursue 24/7 carbon-free objectives. Based on our leadership position, we are well placed to serve this growing market. And in fact, we've already seen significant interest from a number of large clients. 
Turning to Slide 9. Our third key goal is to further unlock the value of our technology platforms. One of these platforms is uplight and energy efficiency software company that works directly with the utility and has access to more than 100 million households and businesses in the U.S. Uplight is at the forefront of the shift to low-carbon and digital solutions on the cloud. In March, we announced a capital raise with a consortium led by Schneider Electric, valuing Uplight at $1.5 billion. 
Now to Slide 10. We're seeing increasing value in many of our other technology platforms as well. Fluence, our joint venture with Siemens, remains a global leader in energy storage, which is a key component of the energy transition. This dynamic industry is expected to grow 40% annually, and Fluence is well positioned to capitalize on the cement opportunity through its distinctive competitive advantages, including its AI-enabled bidding engine. 
Turning to Slide 11. As you may have seen, last month, Fluence announced a multiyear agreement with Northvolt, the leading European battery developer and manufacturer for assured supply and to co develop next-generation battery technology. This is an example of Fluence's continued innovation, which has been validated by their consistent rank as the #1 utility-scale energy storage technology company according to Guide house insights. Similarly, we see the rapid progress of our prefab solar solution, 5B, as you can see on Slide 12. This technology doubled the energy density and cuts construction time by 2/3. We now have 5B projects in Australia, Panama and Chile. We will be including 5B technology in our bids in Puerto Rico, where it's proven resilience to Category 4 hurricane winds will provide greater energy security. Proving out the unique value proposition of 5B could significantly speed up the adoption of solar in cyclone prone areas. Lastly, we continue to work towards the approval of the first large-scale green hydrogen based ammonia plant in the Western Hemisphere. In Chile. 
Moving to Slide 13. We have undergone one of the most dramatic transformations in our sector. Over the past 5 years, we have announced the retirement or sale of 10.7 gigawatts of coal or 70% of our coal capacity, one of the largest reductions in our spectrum. We recognize that we have more work to do and have set a goal of reducing our generation from coal to less than 10% of total generation by 2025. Furthermore, we expect to achieve net 0 emissions from electricity by 2040, one of the most ambitious goals of any power company. As we achieve these decarbonization targets and continuing our near-term growth in renewables, we anticipate being included in additional ESG oriented indices. 
Finally, turning to Slide 14. We see natural gas as the transition fuel that can lower emissions and reduce overall energy costs as markets work towards a future with more renewable power. Last month, we reached an agreement to provide terminal services for an additional 34 tera BTUs of LNG throughput under a 20-year take-or-pay contract. This will bring our total contracted terminal capacity in Panama and the Dominican Republic to almost 80%. There are 45 tera BTUs of available capacity remaining, which we expect to sign in the next couple of years. Our LNG business is focused on providing environmentally responsible LNG or green LNG as soon as feasible, which ensures the lowest levels of emissions throughout the entire supply chain. Now I would like to turn the call over to Gustavo Pimenta, our CFO."

As Andres mentioned, we are off to a good start this year, having already achieved significant milestones towards the strategic and financial objectives that we discussed on our Investor Day. We are also encouraged by the continued economic recovery across our markets, with key and demand in line with pre COVID levels. 
Turning to our financial results for the quarter. As you can see on Slide 16, adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, was $247 million for the quarter, which was very much in line with our expectations and similar to last year's performance. I'll discuss the key drivers of our first quarter results and outlook for the year in the following slides. 
Turning to Slide 17. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.28 versus $0.29 last year. With adjusted PTC essentially flat, the $0.01 decrease in adjusted EPS was the result of a slightly higher effective tax rate this quarter. In the U.S., in utilities, strategic business unit, or SBU, PTC was down $27 million, driven primarily by a lower contribution from our legacy units at Southland and higher spend in our clean energy business as we accelerate our development pipeline given the growing market opportunities. These impacts were partially offset by the benefit from the commencement of PPAs at the Southland Energy combined cycle gas turbines or CCGTS. At our South America SBU, PTC was down $31 million, mostly driven by lower contributions from AES and is formerly known as AES Gener, due to higher interest expense and lower equity earnings from the Guacolda plant in Chile. These impacts were partially offset by higher generation at the chivor hydro plant in Colombia. Lower PTC at our Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, or MCAC SBU, primarily reflects outages at 2 facilities in Dominica Republic and Mexico, with both already back online since April. Results also reflect the expiration of the 72-megawatt barge PPA in Panama. Finally, in Eurasia, higher PTC reflects improved operational performance and lower interest expense in our Bulgaria businesses. 
Now to Slide 22. With our first quarter results, we are on track to achieve our full year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range of $1.50 to $1.58. Our expected 2021 quarterly earnings profile is consistent with the average of the last 5 years. Our typical quarterly earnings is more back-end weighted with roughly 40% of the earnings occurring in the first half of the year and the remaining in the second half. Growth in the year to go will be primarily driven by contributions from new businesses, including a full year of operations of the Southland repowering project, 2.3 gigawatts of projects in our backlog coming online during the next 9 months, reduced interest expense, the benefit from cost savings and demand normalization to pre COVID levels. We are also reaffirming our expected 7% to 9% average annual growth target through 2025. 
Now turning to our credit profile on Slide 23. As discussed at our Investor Day, strong credit metrics remain one of our top priorities. In the last 4 years, we attained 2 to 3 notches of upgrades from the 3 credit rating agencies, including investment-grade ratings from Fitch and S&P. These actions validate the strength of our business model and our commitment to improving our credit metrics. We expect the positive momentum in these metrics to continue, enabling us to achieve BBB flat credit metrics by 2025. 
Now to our 2021 parent capital allocation plan on Slide 24. Consistent with the discussion at our Investor Day, sources reflect approximately $2 billion of total discretionary cash, including $800 million of parent free cash flow and $100 million of proceeds from the sale of Itabo in the Dominican Republic, which just closed in April. Sources also include the successful issuance of the $1 billion of equity units in March, eliminating the need for any additional equity raise to fund our current growth plan through 2025. 
Now to uses on the right-hand side. We'll be returning for $150 million to shareholders this year. This consists of our common share dividend, including the 5% increase we announced in December and the coupon of the equity units. And we plan to invest approximately $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion in our subsidiaries as we capitalize on attractive growth opportunities. Approximately 60% of the investments are in global renewals, reflecting our success in renewables origination during 2020 and our expectations for 2021. About 25% of these investments are in our U.S. utilities to fund rate base growth with a continued focus on grid and fleet modernization. In the first quarter, we invested approximately $450 million in renewables, which is roughly 1/3 of our expected investment for the year. 
In summary, 85% of our investments are going to the U.S. utilities and global renewables, helping us to achieve our goal of increasing the proportion of earnings from the U.S. to more than half and from carbon-free businesses to about 2/3 by 2025. The remaining 15% of our investment will go towards green LNG and other innovative opportunities that support and accelerate the energy transition. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andrés."

As we move to essentially have strategic relationships with battery manufacturers. So Northvolt is building a new plant in Sweden and in Poland, and we will have one train of the plant in Poland producing batteries for us. So as this market expands and as you have a real growth in demand, this assures battery supply for one of our markets, so I would say, Europe, Middle East, Africa. And in addition, we will not only have supply of batteries, and again, a dedicated train to us, but we will also be working with Northvolt to have new developments in battery. So in terms as battery technology develops, as you have better chemistry, as we, say, fine-tune our cube stacked design, we will have joint development of additional improved batteries on multiple fronts. So this is, I think, a very interesting development of getting a little bit more involved, let's say, one step prior to just being the integrator and providing the control software."

So let me take the second part first, to explain a little bit what the product is. So the product, really, the key point is that we're netting on an hourly basis a carbon free energy.

So the product, really, the key point is that we're netting on an hourly basis a carbon free energy. So this is -- most contracts prior to this, virtually all, are really netting, it could be on a yearly basis, could be, et cetera. So you have an excess purchases of renewables during certain hours, but you're actually using nonrenewables during other hours. Obviously, when you don't have peak production of the renewables. This is actually saying, on an hourly basis, the energy that I'm getting is carbon free. So you asked the right question. It's not just a question of having overbuilt solar or overbuilt win. It's really how do you manage these different sources of energy. Not only to ensure that it's carbon free, but to minimize the cost. So when are you buying -- when are you using wind? When are you using solar? And the real key to make this happen is adding hydro, small hydros and adding, of course, battery storage. So it's really how do you optimize multiple uses of multiple sources of renewable energy to provide the lowest cost guaranteed carbon-free energy netted on an hourly basis. So behind this offer, there's a lot of math, a lot of algorithms, a lot of risk management. And we think that this is a deal that with Google itself, we had a 1 billion -- sorry, 1 gigawatt agreement, and this is the first 500, and we expect it to grow as demand in these data center grows. But of course, there are other corporate clients that are interested in this. And we've seen interest from them. So as people, I would say, up their environmental goals. From saying, well, we're going to be net 0 carbon emissions on a global scale and really having an hourly netting this is really the only product on the market. So of course, those companies that have the highest environmental standards are interested in this product. So it's -- we think, a very interesting development and one that we expect to replicate with multiple clients."

Our strategy has been to offer more value to our clients. So we don't want to just compete for commoditized busbar renewable PPAs. So we have several competitive advantages. And of course",541,"Well, look, we do see a lot of competition out there in the market. Our strategy has been to offer more value to our clients. So we don't want to just compete for commoditized busbar renewable PPAs. So we have several competitive advantages. And of course, with our knowledge of energy storage. We have been really a leader in the new applications for energy storage, not only through Fluence in terms of the new design, but AI bidding enabled bidding engines and how do we combine them? So the Google deal is a perfect example of how we brought together multiple energy sources, renewable energy sources and provided a unique product to a very demanding client. So that's our angle. Our angle is really how we bring these things together, how we create more value for the client. And I think very importantly is that we co-create with our clients. So this was a joint project with Google that reflects more than a year's work. It's just like what we did in Kauai. What was really sort of the first sort of 24/7 solar energy storage product offering, we codeveloped it with the Kauai Island utility cooperative. So that's our unique angle. So again, we see more deals like this Google deal. And more ways of working with clients to provide more value in just not a commoditized product. So the other advantage we have is, look, we started working on our pipeline. So we have a pipeline of 30 gigawatts globally. We have a pipeline of more than 15 gigawatts in the U.S. and pipeline is not equally defined term across all players. What we mean in pipeline, these are projects that we can execute on. So we have a land bank. We've been buying land. We've been buying land rights. We've been getting interconnection rights looking really at the overlay of like best solar irradiation, best interconnections with the grid. And in addition, best wind sites so we feel very good. I mean, putting something together like we did for Google in Virginia, it's something that we can replicate in other markets, where we have big presence, whether it be New York, whether it be California, that we don't think other people can at present. So I think we're very well situated. And we also have some other angles that people don't have that are very new. What I would mention is 5B. 5B allows us to double the energy density. So think about that. If you need to locate 100 megawatts of energy, we can do it in the space, other people can do it in 50. We can build it in 1/3 of the time. Now 5B, the Maverick product is still early in its stage of development. We still have to massify it to drive down costs and prove it out. But it has unique characteristics, not only the ones I've mentioned, but in Australia, it has been tested in actual life a situation by category for hurricane winds. And that's something that conventional solar cannot do. So we feel very optimistic of offering this suite of technologies. And also a unique way of bringing them together and also a unique way of working with clients."

When we talked the beginning of last year about COVID at the time. And we said, look, we were concerned about supply made and the possible effects of COVID on the supply chain even here in the states. So we've been on top of this. Right now, we're not seeing any real supply constraints, whether it be on batteries, whether it be on solar panels, whether we see on wind turbines. However, if you look at the growth plans that are reflected in, for example, the Biden's renewable energy agenda and you see what utilities are talking about, you're seeing a dramatic increase in demand. And we think that, that could be a problem in the future. So we're getting out ahead of this. And I think it's not only the physical supplies that we're talking about, but it could be things like land, for example, how many megawatts of readily available land is there to meet this great need. So right now, we're not seeing it, Steve, but we're on top of it, and that's where we're making the kind of strategic agreements like Northvolt expect more, I would say, because that, we think, is a key element. I mean, we expect this market to grow very rapidly, and we think you have to be thinking about that now at all angles, whether it be people, land, interconnections. I do see -- and I think we've spoken about it in the past, energy storage playing a role in eliminating transmission constraints. So that's an exciting new area that needs to be developed, and it really isn't tapped. So getting to your answer, we're not seeing it today. We're on top of it. I do expect there to be a pinch at sometime in the future. When I don't know. It could be 12 months, it could be 18 months, but we're preparing for that possibility."

So we've had my counting 4 unicorns, small companies that can do more than $1 billion valuation. I think our secret sauce has been to buy small companies. I mean, some of them we bought for a $20 million, $30 million initial investment and now are worth more than $1 billion. And what's the secret sauce? The secret sauce really is, one, we give them a platform for massive expansion. Two, we work with them to create new applications. So we're not just a client. And it's like we are co-developing and creating new uses for this technology. So we allow it to grow fast, we'll allow it to grow new areas. But equally important, we're able to keep the entrepreneurial spirit of these businesses. So in other words, even though we're a big company, we make a real effort not to smother them and let them run as much as possible on their own. Now we made a philosophical decision years ago that just to use it on our own platform, while that gives us a temporary advantage limits the growth of this new technology. And quite frankly, a lot of this has to do with massifying them to really drive down costs. Energy storage is a lot cheaper today because we massified it. We're in 29 countries. We have 5.6 gigawatts in 29 countries that we either built or we're providing control systems, bidding platforms. So that's quite large and allows us to learn from that. So with 5 bps the same. We will have certain time of exclusivity in certain markets. But now this will be available to the broader market over time. So what we're doing with 5B is, again, massifying it, putting it out. And then eventually, it will be available to other players as well. So for example, today in Australia, other people are using 5B technology. And I see it very similar to our prior ventures, whether it be fluent, whether it be distributed energy, that we have, whether it be uplight, that our philosophy is not to keep it to ourselves, just keep it to our own platform, but expand it more broadly. So it's interesting. We make money. I was thinking about, we make money for our shareholders in 2 ways. One is our platforms, which we are shifting from fossil fuels to renewables. And there, you can value us on cash flow, earnings per share, et cetera. But at the same time, we're creating value in these new technological technology companies. And those have a different valuation and a different value creation. And that's why selling to third parties is so important to maximize the value of them. Now the fact is that having the link between as and these start-ups is key because, as I said, we're mutually beneficial to create value. We help them grow. They help us to really be a leading-edge technology provider. If we didn't have the knowledge of batteries that we have, we wouldn't have done the Google deal. So there are 2 ways that we're creating value here with these new companies."

So more than double what we have between Panama and the Dominican Republic. And there's an associated 2.2 gigawatts of combined cycle gas plants. So note that progress continues on that. We're part of the government's plan, realize that this facility will avoid the construction of many, many co plants. And I also mentioned that we will be as soon as feasible moving towards providing green hydrogen.

So what we've announced is take-or-pay. So we're not so directly effective. But all things being equal, a bigger spread between natural gas and oil is favorable. We'll do at the margin some more. In Vietnam, this is a project which is very to much needed because they had been relying on offshore gas, and that's running out. So this will -- it has an immediate demand. Unlike say, Dominican Republic or Panama, where we had to develop the demand. This is a situation where you have a pent-up demand. And you will be relieving a bottleneck because they just aren't -- those fields are basically exhausted. So you have to bring in gas to feed the existing combined cycles. So I really don't see it as much as directly as a oil price gas play. Again, at the margin, you could have more industries convert or more transportation compared to compressed natural gas or other forms. But not really these are tolling agreements. And in Vietnam, the demand is there, it doesn't have to be created. But again, as is expense, for example, the new combined cycles, yes, those will definitely be displacing coal plants."

Our first quarter results put us on track to achieve our 2021 guidance and 7% to 9% average annual growth through 2025. Gustavo will provide more color on our financial results later in the call.
As we spoke about on our Investor Day in early March, we see a great opportunity for growth given the momentous changes in our sector, and we are very well positioned to capitalize on the shift to low-carbon sources of energy. Over the past 5 years, we have transformed our company to be a leader in renewables, and we have invested in innovative technologies that will give us a competitive advantage for many years to come.
Although it has been less than 2 months since our Investor Day, we had a number of significant achievements to announce, including a landmark deal with Google, which I will describe in more detail later, a strategic collaboration to develop new battery technologies between Fluence and Northvolt, the leading European supplier of sustainable battery systems, and a significant increase in LNG sales in Central America and the Caribbean to support those economies in their transition away from heavy fuels.
First, let me lay out our strategic priorities for 2021 and the substantial progress that we have made year-to-date towards achieving those objectives.
Turning to Slide 4. Our 5 key goals for the year are: one, signed contracts for 4 gigawatts of renewables. Two, launched the first 24/7 product for carbon-free energy on an hourly basis; three, further unlock the value of our technology platforms; four, continue to improve our ESG positioning through the transformation of our portfolio; and five, monetize excess LNG capacity in Central America and Caribbean.
Turning to Slide 5. Last year, we set and exceeded a goal of signing 2 to 3 gigawatts of PPAs for renewables and energy storage. This year, we are increasing that goal by 60% to a target of 4 gigawatts. Today, I am pleased to report that year-to-date, we've already signed 1.1 gigawatts including a landmark deal with Google.
As you can see on Slide 6, we have a backlog of 6.9 gigawatts of renewables, consisting of projects already under construction or under signed power purchase agreements, or PPAs. This equates to 20% growth in our total installed capacity and a 60% increase in our renewables capacity.
Turning to Slide 7. We continue to increase our pipeline of projects to support our growth and now have a global pipeline of more than 30 gigawatts of renewable projects, roughly half of which is in the United States. With increasing demand from corporate customers and a much more favorable policy environment, we expect the need for renewables to grow dramatically, and we're taking steps to ensure a continued competitive advantage.
Moving to Slide 8. Our second key goal for this year is to launch the first 24/7 energy product that matches a customer's load with carbon-free energy on an hourly basis. To that end, earlier this week, we announced a landmark, first of its kind agreement to supply Google's Virginia-based data centers with 24/7 carbon-free energy sourced from a portfolio of 500 megawatts of renewables. Under this innovative structure, AES will become the sole supplier of the data center's energy needs, ensuring that the energy supplied will meet carbon-free targets when measured on an hourly basis for the next 10 years. The carbon-free energy will come from an optimized portfolio of wind, solar, hydro and battery storage resources.
This agreement sets a new standard in carbon-free energy for commercial and industrial customers who signed 23 gigawatts of PPAs in 2020. As we discussed at our Investor Day, the almost 300 companies that make up the RE100 will need more than 100 gigawatts of new renewables by 2030. This transaction with Google demonstrates that a higher sustainability standard is possible, and we expect a substantial portion of customers to pursue 24/7 carbon-free objectives. Based on our leadership position, we are well placed to serve this growing market. And in fact, we've already seen significant interest from a number of large clients.
Turning to Slide 9. Our third key goal is to further unlock the value of our technology platforms. One of these platforms is Uplight, an energy efficiency software company that works directly with the utility and has access to more than 100 million households and businesses in the U.S. Uplight is at the forefront of the shift to low-carbon and digital solutions on the cloud. In March, we announced a capital raise with a consortium led by Schneider Electric, valuing Uplight at $1.5 billion.
Now to Slide 10. We're seeing increasing value in many of our other technology platforms as well. Fluence, our joint venture with Siemens, remains a global leader in energy storage, which is a key component of the energy transition. This dynamic industry is expected to grow 40% annually, and Fluence is well positioned to capitalize on this immense opportunity through its distinctive competitive advantages, including its AI-enabled bidding engine.
Turning to Slide 11. As you may have seen, last month Fluence announced a multiyear agreement with Northvolt, the leading European battery developer and manufacturer, for assured supply and to co-develop next-generation battery technology. This is an example of Fluence's continued innovation, which has been validated by their consistent rank as the #1 utility-scale energy storage technology company according to Guidehouse insights.
Similarly, we see the rapid progress of our prefab solar solution, 5B, as you can see on Slide 12. This technology doubled the energy density and cuts construction time by 2/3. We now have 5B projects in Australia, Panama and Chile. We will be including 5B technology in our bids in Puerto Rico, where it's proven resilience to category 4 hurricane winds will provide greater energy security, proving out the unique value proposition of 5B could significantly speed up the adoption of solar in cyclone prone areas. Lastly, we continue to work towards the approval of the first large-scale green hydrogen based ammonia plant in the Western Hemisphere, in Chile.
Moving to Slide 13. We have undergone one of the most dramatic transformations in our sector. Over the past 5 years, we have announced the retirement or sale of 10.7 gigawatts of coal, or 70% of our coal capacity, one of the largest reductions in our spectrum. We recognize that we have more work to do and have set a goal of reducing our generation from coal to less than 10% of total generation by 2025. Furthermore, we expect to achieve net-zero emissions from electricity by 2040, one of the most ambitious goals of any power company. As we achieve these decarbonization targets and continuing our near-term growth in renewables, we anticipate being included in additional ESG-oriented indices.
Finally, turning to Slide 14. We see natural gas as the transition fuel that can lower emissions and reduce overall energy costs as markets work towards a future with more renewable power. Last month, we reached an agreement to provide terminal services for an additional 34 tera BTUs of LNG throughput under a 20-year take-or-pay contract. This will bring our total contracted terminal capacity in Panama and the Dominican Republic to almost 80%. There are 45 tera BTUs of available capacity remaining, which we expect to sign in the next couple of years. Our LNG business is focused on providing environmentally responsible LNG or green LNG as soon as feasible, which ensures the lowest levels of emissions throughout the entire supply chain.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Gustavo Pimenta, our CFO."

As Andres mentioned, we are off to a good start this year, having already achieved significant milestones towards the strategic and financial objectives that we discussed on our Investor Day. We are also encouraged by the continued economic recovery across our markets, with Q1 demand in line with pre-COVID levels.
Turning to our financial results for the quarter. As you can see on Slide 16, adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, was $247 million for the quarter, which was very much in line with our expectations and similar to last year's performance. I'll discuss the key drivers of our first quarter results and outlook for the year in the following slides.
Turning to Slide 17. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.28 versus $0.29 last year. With adjusted PTC essentially flat, the $0.01 decrease in adjusted EPS was the result of a slightly higher effective tax rate this quarter. In the U.S., in utilities, strategic business unit, or SBU, PTC was down $27 million, driven primarily by a lower contribution from our legacy units at Southland and higher spend in our clean energy business as we accelerate our development pipeline given the growing market opportunities. These impacts were partially offset by the benefit from the commencement of PPAs at the Southland Energy combined cycle gas turbines, or CCGTS. 
At our South America SBU, PTC was down $31 million, mostly driven by lower contributions from AES and is formerly known as AES Gener, due to higher interest expense and lower equity earnings from the Guacolda plant in Chile. These impacts were partially offset by higher generation at the Chivor hydro plant in Colombia. Lower PTC at our Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, or MCAC SBU, primarily reflects outages at 2 facilities in Dominica Republic and Mexico, with both already back online since April. Results also reflect the expiration of the 72-megawatt barge PPA in Panama. Finally, in Eurasia, higher PTC reflects improved operational performance and lower interest expense in our Bulgaria businesses.
Now to Slide 22. With our first quarter results, we are on track to achieve our full year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range of $1.50 to $1.58. Our expected 2021 quarterly earnings profile is consistent with the average of the last 5 years. Our typical quarterly earnings is more back-end weighted with roughly 40% of the earnings occurring in the first half of the year and the remaining in the second half. Growth in the year to go will be primarily driven by contributions from new businesses, including a full year of operations of the Southland repowering project, 2.3 gigawatts of projects in our backlog coming online during the next 9 months, reduced interest expense, the benefit from cost savings and demand normalization to pre-COVID levels. We are also reaffirming our expected 7% to 9% average annual growth target through 2025.
Now turning to our credit profile on Slide 23. As discussed at our Investor Day, strong credit metrics remain one of our top priorities. In the last 4 years, we attained 2 to 3 notches of upgrades from the 3 credit rating agencies, including investment-grade ratings from Fitch and S&P. These actions validate the strength of our business model and our commitment to improving our credit metrics. We expect the positive momentum in these metrics to continue, enabling us to achieve BBB flat credit metrics by 2025.
Now to our 2021 parent capital allocation plan on Slide 24. Consistent with the discussion at our Investor Day, sources reflect approximately $2 billion of total discretionary cash, including $800 million of parent free cash flow and $100 million of proceeds from the sale of Itabo in the Dominican Republic, which just closed in April. Sources also include the successful issuance of the $1 billion of equity units in March, eliminating the need for any additional equity raise to fund our current growth plan through 2025.
Now to uses on the right-hand side. We'll be returning $450 million to shareholders this year. This consists of our common share dividend, including the 5% increase we announced in December and the coupon of the equity units. And we plan to invest approximately $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion in our subsidiaries as we capitalize on attractive growth opportunities. Approximately 60% of the investments are in global renewals, reflecting our success in renewables origination during 2020 and our expectations for 2021. About 25% of these investments are in our U.S. utilities to fund rate base growth with a continued focus on grid and fleet modernization. In the first quarter, we invested approximately $450 million in renewables, which is roughly 1/3 of our expected investment for the year.
In summary, 85% of our investments are going to the U.S. utilities and global renewables, helping us to achieve our goal of increasing the proportion of earnings from the U.S. to more than half and from carbon-free businesses to about 2/3 by 2025. The remaining 15% of our investment will go towards green LNG and other innovative opportunities that support and accelerate the energy transition.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andres."

As we move to essentially have strategic relationships with battery manufacturers. So Northvolt is building a new plant in Sweden and in Poland, and we will have one train of the plant in Poland producing batteries for us. So as this market expands and as you have a real growth in demand, this assures battery supply for one of our markets, so I would say, Europe, Middle East, Africa.
And in addition, we will not only have supply of batteries, and again, a dedicated train to us, but we will also be working with Northvolt to have new developments in battery. So in terms -- as battery technology develops, as you have better chemistry, as we, say, fine-tune our cube-stacked design, we will have joint development of additional improved batteries on multiple fronts. So this is, I think, a very interesting development of getting a little bit more involved, let's say, one step prior to just being the integrator and providing the control software."

So let me take the second part first, to explain a little bit what the product is. So the product, really, the key point is that we're netting on an hourly basis a carbon free energy. So this is -- most contracts prior to this",370,"Well, it's both, in a sense. So let me take the second part first, to explain a little bit what the product is. So the product, really, the key point is that we're netting on an hourly basis a carbon free energy. So this is -- most contracts prior to this, virtually all, are really netting, it could be on a yearly basis, could be, et cetera. So you have an excess purchases of renewables during certain hours, but you're actually using nonrenewables during other hours. Obviously, when you don't have peak production of the renewables.
This is actually saying, on an hourly basis, the energy that I'm getting is carbon free. So you asked the right question. It's not just a question of having overbuilt solar or overbuilt wind, it's really how do you manage these different sources of energy. Not only to ensure that it's carbon free, but to minimize the cost. So when are you buying -- when are you using wind? When are you using solar? And the real key to make this happen is adding hydro, small hydros and adding, of course, battery storage. So it's really how do you optimize multiple uses of -- multiple sources of renewable energy to provide the lowest cost guaranteed carbon-free energy netted on an hourly basis.
So behind this offer, there's a lot of math, a lot of algorithms, a lot of risk management. And we think that this is a deal that with Google itself, we had a 1 billion -- sorry, 1 gigawatt agreement, and this is the first 500, and we expect it to grow as demand in these data center grows. But of course, there are other corporate clients that are interested in this. And we've seen interest from them.
So as people, I would say, up their environmental goals. From saying, well, we're going to be net-zero carbon emissions on a global scale and really having an hourly netting, this is really the only product on the market. So of course, those companies that have the highest environmental standards are interested in this product. So it's -- we think, a very interesting development and one that we expect to replicate with multiple clients."

So we don't want to just compete for commoditized busbar renewable PPAs. So we have several competitive advantages. And of course, with our knowledge of energy storage, we have been really a leader in the new applications for energy storage, not only through Fluence in terms of the new design, but AI bidding-enabled bidding engines and how do we combine them?
So the Google deal is a perfect example of how we brought together multiple energy sources, renewable energy sources and provided a unique product to a very demanding client. So that's our angle. Our angle is really how we bring these things together, how we create more value for the client. And I think very importantly is that we co-create with our clients. So this was a joint project with Google that reflects more than a year's work. It's just like what we did in Kauai. What was really sort of the first sort of 24/7 solar energy storage product offering, we codeveloped it with the Kauai Island Utility Cooperative. So that's our unique angle.
So again, we see more deals like this Google deal. And more ways of working with clients to provide more value in just not a commoditized product. So the other advantage we have is, look, we started working on our pipeline. So we have a pipeline of 30 gigawatts globally. We have a pipeline of more than 15 gigawatts in the U.S.
And pipeline is not equally defined term across all players. What we mean in pipeline, these are projects that we can execute on. So we have a land bank. We've been buying land. We've been buying land rights. We've been getting interconnection rights, looking really at the overlay of like best solar irradiation, best interconnections with the grid. And in addition, best wind sites. So we feel very good. I mean, putting something together like we did for Google in Virginia, something that we can replicate in other markets, where we have big presence, whether it be New York, whether it be California, that we don't think other people can at present. So I think we're very well situated.
And we also have some other angles that people don't have that are very new. One I would mention is 5B. 5B allows us to double the energy density. So think about that. If you need to locate 100 megawatts of energy, we can do it in the space, other people can do it in 50. We can build it in 1/3 of the time. Now 5B, the maverick product is still early in its stage of development. We still have to massify it to drive down costs and prove it out. But it has unique characteristics, not only the ones I've mentioned, but in Australia, it has been tested in actual life a situation by category for hurricane winds. And that's something that conventional solar cannot do. So we feel very optimistic of offering this suite of technologies. And also a unique way of bringing them together and also a unique way of working with clients."

And as you know, we've been, I think, always very concerned about this. When we talked beginning of last year about COVID at the time, and we said, look, we were concerned about supply and the possible effects of COVID on the supply chain even here in the states. So we've been on top of this.
Right now, we're not seeing any real supply constraints, whether it be on batteries, whether it be on solar panels, whether we see on wind turbines. However, if you look at the growth plans that are reflected in, for example, the Biden's renewable energy agenda and you see what utilities are talking about, you're seeing dramatic increases in demand. And we think that, that could be a problem in the future. So we're getting out ahead of this. And I think it's not only the physical supplies that we're talking about, but it could be things like land, for example, how many megawatts of readily available land is there to meet this great need.
So right now, we're not seeing it, Steve, but we're on top of it, and that's where we're making the kind of strategic agreements like Northvolt. Expect more, I would say, because that, we think, is a key element. I mean, we expect this market to grow very rapidly, and we think you have to be thinking about that now at all angles, whether it be people, land, interconnections. I do see -- and I think we've spoken about it in the past, energy storage playing a role in eliminating transmission constraints. So that's an exciting new area that needs to be developed, and it really isn't tapped.
So getting to your answer, we're not seeing it today. We're on top of it. I do expect there to be a pinch at sometime in the future. When? I don't know, it could be 12 months, it could be 18 months, but we're preparing for that possibility."

Or is this something more for your own purposes over time? How broad could this be? And is this another candidate that could be monetized over time?"

So we've had, my counting 4 unicorns, small companies that can do more than $1 billion valuation. I think our secret sauce has been to buy small companies. I mean, some of them we bought for $20 million, $30 million initial investment and now are worth more than $1 billion. And what's the secret sauce?
Secret sauce really is, one, we give them a platform for massive expansion. Two, we work with them to create new applications. So we're not just a client. It's like we are co-developing and creating new uses for this technology. So we allow it to grow fast, we allow it to grow new areas. But equally important, we're able to keep the entrepreneurial spirit of these businesses.
So in other words, even though we're a big company, we make a real effort not to smother them and let them run as much as possible on their own. Now we made a philosophical decision years ago that just to use it on our own platform, while that gives us a temporary advantage limits the growth of this new technology. And quite frankly, a lot of this has to do with massifying them to really drive down costs. Energy storage is a lot cheaper today because we massified it. We're in 29 countries. We have 5.6 gigawatts in 29 countries that we either built or we're providing control systems, bidding platforms. So that's quite large and allows us to learn from that.
So with 5B, it's the same. We will have certain time of exclusivity in certain markets. But now this will be available to the broader market over time. So what we're doing with 5B is, again, massifying it, putting it out. And then eventually, it will be available to other players as well. So for example, today in Australia, other people are using 5B technology. And I see it very similar to our prior ventures, whether it be Fluence, whether it be Distributed Energy, that we have, whether it be Uplight, that our philosophy is not to keep it to ourselves, just keep it to our own platform, but expand it more broadly.
So it's interesting. We make money. I was thinking about, we make money for our shareholders in 2 ways. One is our platforms, which we are shifting from fossil fuels to renewables. And there, you can value us on cash flow, earnings per share, et cetera. But at the same time, we're creating value in these new technological -- technology companies. And those have a different valuation and a different value creation. And that's why selling to third parties is so important to maximize the value of them.
Now the fact is that having the link between AES and these start-ups is key because, as I said, we're mutually beneficial to create value. We help them grow. They help us to really be a leading-edge technology provider. If we didn't have the knowledge of batteries that we have, we wouldn't have done the Google deal. So there are 2 ways that we're creating value here with these new companies."

Regarding Vietnam, it's the same thing. We continue to work towards a new LNG terminal, which would be 450 or so tera BTUs. So more than double what we have between Panama and the Dominican Republic. And there's an associated 2.2 gigawatts of combined cycle gas plants. So note that progress continues on that. We're part of the government's plan, realize that this facility will avoid the construction of many, many co-plants.

A lot of these are take-or-pay agreements. So what we've announced is take-or-pay. So we're not so directly effective. But all things being equal, a bigger spread between natural gas and oil is favorable. We'll do at the margin some more.
In Vietnam, this is a project which is very much needed because they had been relying on offshore gas, and that's running out. So this will -- it has an immediate demand. Unlike say, Dominican Republic or Panama, where we had to develop the demand. This is a situation where you have a pent-up demand. And you will be relieving a bottleneck because there just aren't -- those fields are basically exhausted. So you have to bring in gas to feed the existing combined cycles. So I really don't see it as much as a -- direct as a oil price gas play.
Again, at the margin, you could have more industries convert or more transportation convert to compressed natural gas or other forms. But not really, these are tolling agreements.

Today, I will discuss our progress to date on a number of key strategic objectives before turning the call over to our CFO, Gustavo Pimenta, to discuss our financi",1598,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter financial review call. Today, I will discuss our progress to date on a number of key strategic objectives before turning the call over to our CFO, Gustavo Pimenta, to discuss our financial results in more detail. We had an excellent second quarter, with a 24% increase in adjusted EPS from the second quarter of 2020, and a record 1.8 gigawatts of renewables under long-term contracts added to our backlog, bringing our total to 8.5 gigawatts. We remain on track to achieve 7% to 9% average annual growth in adjusted EPS and  parent free cash flow through 2025. I will give more color on our accomplishments while covering the following 3 themes shown on Slide 4. 
One, the growth and transformation of our U.S. utilities; two, our rapidly growing renewables business; and three, our strategic advantage from innovation. As you may recall, during our Investor Day in March, we outlined our plan to invest $2.3 billion to transform our 2 U.S. utilities, AES, Ohio, and AES Indiana. During the second quarter, we concluded key outstanding regulatory proceedings at both of our U.S. utilities, clearing the path for investment in the latest technologies, which will enable us to deliver a higher level of service and reduce carbon emissions. 
At the core of our efforts is a focus and deep understanding of the digital tools that vastly improve customer experience and enable the integration and orchestration of diverse and distributed renewable resources. Starting with AES Ohio on Slide 5, where we expect to nearly double the rate base by growing 12% annually through 2025. Recently, we made a substantial headway on outstanding regulatory filings. First, the commission approved AES Ohio stipulation, allowing predictable cash flows and investment in smart grid initiative over the next 4 years. And second, AES Ohio also received approval for the FERC regulated formulary, allowing recovery of transmission investments. 
Now moving on to AES Indiana on Slide 6, where we're investing $1.5 billion over the next 5 years as part of our grid modernization program, and our transition to more renewables-based generation. We recently received regulatory approval for our 195-megawatt Hardy Hill solar project, and we announced an agreement to acquire the Petersburg Solar project, which includes 250 megawatts of solar and 180-megawatt hours of energy storage. We expect to grow the rate base at AES Indiana by more than 7% annually. With many of the key regulatory approvals behind us, we are now positioned to execute on our utility modernization and decarbonization programs, which have been years in the making. 
Now turning to the second theme of renewables growth on Slide 7. Last year was a record-breaking year of renewable contracts for us, with over 3 gigawatts signed. So far this year, we have already signed almost 3 gigawatts of contracts for wind, solar and energy storage, nearly double the amount at the same time last year. More than 90% of the new contracts are in the U.S., and we are well on our way towards achieving or exceeding our target of 4 gigawatts for 2021. At the same time, more than 80% are with C&I customers, negotiated on a bilateral basis. Our new projects will yield after-tax returns at the project level in line with our low teens average for the U.S. and mid- to high teens internationally. 
Our progress so far this year includes our recent agreement to acquire 612 megawatts of operating wind assets in New York, as shown on Slide 8. New York state's supportive renewables policies, combined with the scarcity of wind projects in the Northeast, provides us with several pathways for long-term attractive cash flows to support repowering by 2025. This wind acquisition complements our solar and energy storage pipeline, providing us with another resource to offer diversified and differentiated products to our consumers. 
Turning to Slide 9. We're particularly pleased with our ability to advance new and energy products. This year, we announced the world's first ever large-scale 24/7 carbon-free energy netted on an hourly basis, supplying Google's Virginia data centers. We see this concept of real-time renewable generation as opposed to the purchase of offsetting renewable credits as the new highest standard in clean energy. We have since replicated similar structures with other large-scale customers, helping them to achieve their sustainability targets, while supporting our renewables growth goals for a total of 1.5 gigawatts of these clean energy products signed or awarded thus far this year. We see these innovative carbon-free energy products as examples of our unique advantages, both in our technical and commercial abilities as well as our culture of working together with customers to understand their specific needs. 
Turning to Slide 10. With nearly 3 gigawatts of renewables and energy storage project added this year, we now have a backlog of 8.5 gigawatts, including 2.5 gigawatts currently under construction. We expect to bring 1.4 gigawatts online during the remainder of 2021. The strength of our U.S. renewables growth in a rapidly expanding market will support achieving our goal of having 50% of our earnings from renewables and utilities, and 50% of our earnings from the U.S. by 2025.  
We also continue to aggressively grow our pipeline of early, mid- and late-stage development projects to support future growth. As you can see on Slide 11, we now have a pipeline of 37 gigawatts, among the largest in the world. More than 60% of this pipeline is in the U.S., including 8 gigawatts in the hottest market in the country, California. 
Now to decarbonization on Slide 12. Last month, AES [indiscernible] on the cooperation, we voluntarily retired as soon as January 2025 and will be replaced with 2.3 gigawatts of newly contracted renewables. Since 2017, we have announced the sale of retirement of almost 12 gigawatts of coal-fired generation, which is among the largest programs of any American company. I'm  pleased to report, along with our substantial renewable additions, reduce our generation from coal to approximately 20% of total generation on a pro forma basis, an additional reduction of 5 percentage points since last quarter. I would like to address 2 key concerns that we're hearing from investors related to growth in renewables, inflationary pressures and supply chain bottlenecks. As one of the largest global renewable developers, with a strong reputation, we have a long history of successfully negotiating strategic supply agreements, resulting in preferential access and pricing. 
Furthermore, we lock in the hardware prices when we signed the PPA, sheltering us from future price fluctuations. With 90% of the equipment needed for our 8.5 gigawatt backlog already secured, we feel very comfortable in our ability to execute on our strong pipeline over the short and medium term. 
Now turning to Slide 13 and our third theme of innovation. As our entire sector continues to rapidly evolve, we increasingly find that there is a competitive advantage for those who are able to effectively incorporate new technologies and business models. For example, we have benefited significantly from our energy storage business, which we started over 10 years ago and which now is one of the largest in the industry. There are important synergies between our core businesses and technology ventures. For example, this year, about half of our renewables energy PPAs include an energy storage component. Last month, once again, we were awarded the highest honor in the power and utility sector, the Edison Award from the Edison Electric Institute for our work developing energy storage as a cost-effective alternative to new gas peaking plants. Specifically, the award was for the AES Alamitos battery energy storage system, consisting of 400-megawatt hours of energy storage that can supply power to tens of thousands of homes in milliseconds. This is our seventh Edison Award overall, and third, U.S. Edison Award over the last decade. I would like to note that we have won many more Edison Awards than any other company in recent years. 
Turning to Slide 14. We also continue to build on our prior success in creating technology unicorns. For example, we have previously mentioned our strategic investment in 5B, a prefabricated solar solution company that has patented technology, allowing solar projects to be built in 1/3 of the time and on half as much land, while being resistant to hurricane force winds. We continue to grow 5B's footprint across several markets, including the U.S., Puerto Rico, Chile and Panama and are now expanding into India, where we are working with domestic partners to establish local manufacturing. 
We hope India will enable 5B to reach much greater scale, much more quickly, which combined with our leading work in robotics construction will help us lower all-in solar cost as we advance on the learning curve. 
Turning to Slide 15. Similarly, we continue to benefit from our investment in Uplight, which provides cloud-based energy efficiency solutions to more than 110 million households and businesses through its numerous utility customers, including AES Ohio and AES Indiana. In July, we closed the previously announced transaction with Schneider Electric and a group of investors that valued Uplight at $1.5 billion. 
In conclusion, we're very pleased with our progress to date across all of our key strategic initiatives. Not only are we well positioned to achieve all of our financial goals, but we are on track to hit our transformational targets of more than 50% of our earnings from renewables and utilities and more than 50% from the U.S. while having less than 10% of our generation from coal by 2025. 
I will now turn the call over to Gustavo Pimenta, our CFO."
35312,1673159829,2364406,"The AES Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Andreas, and good morning, everyone. As Andres mentioned, we are making excellent progress this year, having already achieved significant milestones on our strategic and financial objectives. We are pleased to see the continued economic recover",954,"Thank you, Andreas, and good morning, everyone. As Andres mentioned, we are making excellent progress this year, having already achieved significant milestones on our strategic and financial objectives. We are pleased to see the continued economic recovery across our markets driven by the reopening of local economies. In Latin America, many of our clients continue to benefit from record steel, copper and soybean prices, resulting in a significant improvement in electricity demand across our businesses. This also reflects in our days sales outstanding, which remain at historically low levels. 
Turning to our financial results for the second quarter on Slide 17. Adjusted EPS was up 24% to $0.31, primarily reflecting execution on our growth plan, demand recovery at our U.S. utilities, and parent interest savings. These positive drivers were partially offset by lower contributions from Chile and Brazil, and a slightly higher adjusted tax rate. 
Turning to Slide 18. Adjusted pretax contribution or PTC was $303 million for the quarter, an increase of $65 million versus the second quarter of 2020. I will discuss the key drivers of our second quarter results in more detail beginning on Slide 19. In the U.S. and Utilities Strategic Business unit, or SBU, PTC was up $71 million, driven primarily by the demand recovery at our utilities, higher contributions from about 1 gigawatt of new renewable assets and the commencement of power purchase agreements, or PPAs, at Southland Energy in California. 
Turning to Slide 20. We are very encouraged to see material recovery from system demand at our U.S. utilities. For Q2, on a weather-normalized basis, demand at AES Ohio is up 9%, and demand at AES Indiana is up 4%. The net combined volume in Ohio and Indiana is largely back to 2019 pre-COVID levels. This recovery is mainly driven by higher load from commercial and industrial customers this year as a result of the reopening of local businesses. 
Separately, in California, our 2.3 gigawatt Southland legacy units are well positioned to contribute to the state's pressing energy needs and its transition to a more sustainable carbon-free future. In fact, the State Water Board is considering the California Energy Agency's recommendation for our 876 megawatts Redondo Beach facility to be extended for 2 years through 2023 to align with our remaining legacy units. This proposed extension would be an upside to expectations through 2025. 
Now turning back to our quarterly results on Slide 21. At our South America SBU, lower PTC was mostly driven by recovery of expenses from customers in Chile in 2020, lower equity earnings from Guacolda also in Chile and [indiscernible] in Brazil. These impacts were partially offset by higher generation at the Xevo hydro plant in Colombia. 
Higher PTC at our Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, or MCC SBU primarily reflects better hydrology in Panama, which was partially offset by the sale of Itabo in the Dominican Republic. Finally, in Eurasia, PTC remained relatively flat. The impact from the sale of OPGC in India was largely offset by lower interest expense in Bulgaria. 
Turning to Slide 24. With our first half results, we are on track to achieve our full year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance of $1.50 to $1.58. As we have discussed in the past, our typical quarterly earnings profile was more back-end weighted, with roughly 40% of earnings occurring in the first half of the year. Growth in the year to go will be primarily driven by 1.4 gigawatt of new renewables assets coming online in the remainder of the year, continued demand recovery across our markets, reduced interest expense and cost savings benefits. We are also reaffirming our expected 7% to 9% average annual growth target through 2025. 
Now turning to our credit profile on Slide 25. Strong credit metrics remain 1 of our top priorities. In the last 4 years, we obtained 2 to 3 notches of upgrades from the 3 credit rating agencies, including investment-grade ratings from Fitch and S&P. We are also very encouraged by the recent change in outlook to positive on our BA1 rating at Moody's. These actions validate the strength of our business model and our commitment to improving our credit metrics. We expect the positive momentum in these metrics to continue, enabling us to reach BBB ratios by 2025. 
Now to our 2021 parent capital allocation plan on Slide 26. Consistent with our prior disclosures, sources shown on the left-hand side of this slide reflect approximately $2 billion of total discretionary cash. This includes $800 million of parent free cash flow, $100 million of proceeds received from the sale of the table with the Dominican Republic, and the successful issuance of the $1 billion of equity units in March. Now to uses on the right-hand side. We'll be returning $450 million to shareholders this year, consisting of our common share dividend and the coupon of the equity units. And we plan to invest approximately $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion in our subsidiaries as we capitalize on attractive opportunities for growth. Approximately 60% of these investments are in global renewals, reflecting our success in originations during 2020 and our expectations for 2021. And about 25% of these investments are in our U.S. utilities to fund rate base growth, with a continued focus on grid and fleet modernization. 
In the first half of the year, we invested approximately $700 million, primarily in renewables, which is roughly 50% of our expected investments for the year. 
In summary, we are making significant progress on executing on the strategic and financial objectives we laid out in our Investor Day in March, positioning AES as a leader in the energy transition while delivering superior returns to our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andres."

In summary, the world has decided to seriously tackle climate change, and this is driving unprecedented and accelerating growth in demand for renewables and energy efficiency applications and services. In relative terms, I don't believe anyone is better positioned than AES to capitalize on this once-in-a-lifetime transformation of our sector. We have a proven track record of success. We have the most innovative new products and an 8.5 gigawatt backlog and the 37 gigawatt pipeline of projects. All in all, we're enthusiastic about our future, and we feel confident about delivering on our 7% to 9% average annual growth rate. 
Our core contracted generation and utility businesses have shown great resilience in the face of global and regional effects of COVID. Beyond our robust growth rates in earnings and cash flow from our core businesses, we are creating very significant value for our shareholders through our technology joint ventures. There has never been a better time for AES. With that, I would like to open up the call for questions."

So we're building most of them, but we know there's no problem with acquiring somebody else's project to get the optimal mix from a risk and also, I'd say, production capability. So first, that's something that's inherent in our product offerings. So we're really trying to solve the clients' need. It's much less about sort of RFPs and busbar PPIs. That's what we're going after. 
In the case of New York, look, we don't have a lot of wind assets of ourselves. Other people have done a lot of wind assets repowering. We think this is an idea that the time has come with the technology. So we're doing some repowering on our old wind farms, but we saw this as a great opportunity in New York to repower. And again, this comes back to the idea that we want a mix of assets, wind, solar, energy storage, in some cases, even small hydros to be able to deliver those sort of round-the-clock renewables. So think of it that way. We are solving for what the customer wants, and we'll put the package of sources, whether we build them or we buy somebody else's project, to satisfy that."

So this really gave us an in was the ability to modify those contracts so that a large proportion, if not the majority of the energy would come from new contracted renewables, and you keep the coal for capacity. So this is, again, quite a remarkable transformation. So the last thing I would say is regarding the potential legislation that's been talked about, I think it's really -- Chile is a serious country and they're really looking at how the grid can maintain its reliability with the retirement of these coal plants. So what we said is, look, we are willing to retire these plants as soon as 2025 is really to give the grid operator, the opportunity to have -- to ensure a reliable grid.

Look, for some of you who follow us for a while, we're always very paranoid about our supply chain. That's why I think it was January of February actually of 2020, we were talking about supply chain issues with COVID and how we're going to get ahead of it. So here, we've also been on top of this. They're, obviously -- in the past year, there were supply chain issues with imports. What was going to be the tariff on panels from China? And then what was going to be the tariff, for example, on aluminum? So could you manufacture it locally? So we've been on top of this issue. 
So today, I would say all of our solar panels coming into the states are not coming in from China. They're coming in from Malaysia. We do buy some U.S. panels as well, which are non-polysilicon. We're also working with top notch -- only top-notch panel manufacturers, first tier, and getting certificates that none of the polysilicon comes from Hoshin. That could be associated in any way with forced labor. So that's where we are. This is a developing story. In the past, what we've been able to do with the tariffs, for example, is to move panels that were coming to the state, for example, to Chile and vice versa to optimize the supply chain. So -- which, quite frankly, worked out very well. So if you look at what we're doing, we are certainly in solar, one of the top 5, I would say, in the country in terms of new solar development. So we're very well positioned. We're on top of that. We have long-standing agreements, and our suppliers are doing everything possible. I think I could add that, in the future, we're going to -- we're making sure that the polysilicon would come from alternative sources like Germany or Korea. So that's in the works. 
But this does take a transition. So we're on top of that. And stay tuned because, while we feel very good about our certification and all the rest, it's a question of where does that polysilicon arrive? And can you prove it? So again, we are having, I'd say, as extensive affidavits from our suppliers as anybody on this matter."

Today, I will discuss our progress to date on a number of key strategic objectives before turning the call over to our CFO, Gustavo Pimenta, to discuss our financial results in more detail. 
We had an excellent second quarter, with a 24% increase in adjusted EPS from the second quarter of 2020, and a record 1.8 gigawatts of renewables under long-term contracts added to our backlog, bringing our total to 8.5 gigawatts. We remain on track to achieve 7% to 9% average annual growth in adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow through 2025. I will give more color on our accomplishments while covering the following 3 themes shown on Slide 4. 
One, the growth and transformation of our U.S. utilities; two, our rapidly growing renewables business; and three, our strategic advantage from innovation. As you may recall, during our Investor Day in March, we outlined our plan to invest $2.3 billion to transform our 2 US Utilities, AES, Ohio, and AES Indiana. 
During the second quarter, we concluded key outstanding regulatory proceedings at both of our U.S. utilities, clearing the path for investment in the latest technologies, which will enable us to deliver a higher level of service and reduce carbon emissions.
At the core of our efforts is a focus and deep understanding of the digital tools that vastly improve customer experience and enable the integration and orchestration of diverse and distributed renewable resources. 
Starting with AES Ohio on Slide 5, where we expect to nearly double the rate base by growing 12% annually through 2025. Recently, we made a substantial headway on outstanding regulatory filings. First, the commission approved AES Ohio stipulation, allowing predictable cash flows and investment in smart grid initiative over the next 4 years. And second, AES Ohio also received approval for the FERC regulated formulary, allowing recovery of transmission investments. 
Now moving on to AES Indiana on Slide 6, where we're investing $1.5 billion over the next 5 years as part of our grid modernization program, and our transition to more renewables-based generation. We recently received regulatory approval for our 195-megawatt Hardy Hills solar project, and we announced an agreement to acquire the Petersburg Solar project, which includes 250 megawatts of solar and 180-megawatt hours of energy storage. We expect to grow the rate base at AES Indiana by more than 7% annually. With many of the key regulatory approvals behind us, we are now positioned to execute on our utility modernization and decarbonization programs, which have been years in the making.  
Now turning to the second theme of renewables growth on Slide 7. Last year was a record-breaking year of renewable contracts for us, with over 3 gigawatts signed. So far this year, we have already signed almost 3 gigawatts of contracts for wind, solar and energy storage, nearly double the amount at the same time last year. More than 90% of the new contracts are in the U.S., and we are well on our way towards achieving or exceeding our target of 4 gigawatts for 2021. At the same time, more than 80% are with C&I customers, negotiated on a bilateral basis. Our new projects will yield after-tax returns at the project level in line with our low teens average for the U.S. and mid- to high teens internationally.
Our progress so far this year includes our recent agreement to acquire 612 megawatts of operating wind assets in New York, as shown on Slide 8. New York state's supportive renewables policies, combined with the scarcity of wind projects in the Northeast, provides us with several pathways for long-term attractive cash flows to support repowering by 2025. This wind acquisition complements our solar and energy storage pipeline, providing us with another resource to offer diversified and differentiated products to our consumers.
Turning to Slide 9. We're particularly pleased with our ability to advance new [ planned ] energy products. This year, we announced the world's first ever large-scale 24/7 carbon-free energy netted on an hourly basis, supplying Google's Virginia data centers. We see this concept of real-time renewable generation as opposed to the purchase of offsetting renewable credits as the new highest standard in clean energy. We have since replicated similar structures with other large-scale customers, helping them to achieve their sustainability targets, while supporting our renewables growth goals for a total of 1.5 gigawatts of these clean energy products signed or awarded thus far this year. We see these innovative carbon-free energy products as examples of our unique advantages, both in our technical and commercial abilities as well as our culture of working together with customers to understand their specific needs.
Turning to Slide 10. With nearly 3 gigawatts of renewables and energy storage project added this year, we now have a backlog of 8.5 gigawatts, including 2.5 gigawatts currently under construction. We expect to bring 1.4 gigawatts online during the remainder of 2021. The strength of our U.S. renewables growth in a rapidly expanding market will support achieving our goal of having 50% of our earnings from renewables and utilities, and 50% of our earnings from the U.S. by 2025. 
We also continue to aggressively grow our pipeline of early, mid- and late-stage development projects to support future growth. As you can see on Slide 11, we now have a pipeline of 37 gigawatts, among the largest in the world. More than 60% of this pipeline is in the U.S., including 8 gigawatts in the hottest market in the country, California.  
Now to decarbonization on Slide 12. Last month, AES Andes announced their 1.1 gigawatts of coal-fired generation would be voluntarily retired as soon as January 2025 and will be replaced with 2.3 gigawatts of newly contracted renewables. Since 2017, we have announced the sale or retirement of almost 12 gigawatts of coal-fired generation, which is among the largest programs of any American company. I'm  pleased to report, along with our substantial renewable additions, reduce our generation from coal to approximately 20% of total generation on a pro forma basis, an additional reduction of 5 percentage points since last quarter. I would like to address 2 key concerns that we're hearing from investors related to growth in renewables: inflationary pressures and supply chain bottlenecks. 
As one of the largest global renewable developers, with a strong reputation, we have a long history of successfully negotiating strategic supply agreements, resulting in preferential access and pricing. Furthermore, we lock in the hardware prices when we signed the PPA, sheltering us from future price fluctuations. With 90% of the equipment needed for our 8.5 gigawatt backlog already secured, we feel very comfortable in our ability to execute on our strong pipeline over the short and medium term.  
Now turning to Slide 13 and our third theme of innovation. As our entire sector continues to rapidly evolve, we increasingly find that there is a competitive advantage for those who are able to effectively incorporate new technologies and business models. For example, we have benefited significantly from our energy storage business, which we started over 10 years ago and which now is one of the largest in the industry. There are important synergies between our core businesses and technology ventures. For example, this year, about half of our renewables energy PPAs include an energy storage component. 
Last month, once again, we were awarded the highest honor in the power and utility sector, the Edison Award from the Edison Electric Institute. For our work developing energy storage as a cost-effective alternative to new gas peaking plants. Specifically, the award was for the AES Alamitos battery energy storage system, consisting of 400-megawatt hours of energy storage that can supply power to tens of thousands of homes in milliseconds. This is our seventh Edison Award overall, and third, U.S. Edison Award over the last decade. 
I would like to note that we have won many more Edison Awards than any other company in recent years.  
Turning to Slide 14. We also continue to build on our prior success in creating technology unicorns. For example, we have previously mentioned our strategic investment in 5B, a prefabricated solar solution company that has patented technology, allowing solar projects to be built in 1/3 of the time and on half as much land, while being resistant to hurricane force winds. We continue to grow 5B's footprint across several markets, including the U.S., Puerto Rico, Chile and Panama and are now expanding into India, where we are working with domestic partners to establish local manufacturing.  
We hope India will enable 5B to reach much greater scale, much more quickly, which combined with our leading work in robotics construction will help us lower all-in solar cost as we advance on the learning curve.  
Turning to Slide 15. Similarly, we continue to benefit from our investment in Uplight, which provides cloud-based energy efficiency solutions to more than 110 million households and businesses through its numerous utility customers, including AES Ohio and AES Indiana. In July, we closed the previously announced transaction with Schneider Electric and a group of investors that valued Uplight at $1.5 billion.  
In conclusion, we're very pleased with our progress to date across all of our key strategic initiatives. Not only are we well positioned to achieve all of our financial goals, but we are on track to hit our transformational targets of more than 50% of our earnings from renewables and utilities and more than 50% from the U.S. while having less than 10% of our generation from coal by 2025.  
I will now turn the call over to Gustavo Pimenta, our CFO."
35312,1673159829,2364770,"The AES Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Andres, and good morning, everyone. As Andres mentioned, we are making excellent progress this year, having already achieved significant milestones on our strategic and financial objectives. We are pleased to see the continued economic recovery",957,"Thank you, Andres, and good morning, everyone. As Andres mentioned, we are making excellent progress this year, having already achieved significant milestones on our strategic and financial objectives. We are pleased to see the continued economic recovery across our markets driven by the reopening of local economies. In Latin America, many of our clients continue to benefit from record steel, copper and soybean prices, resulting in a significant improvement in electricity demand across our businesses. This also reflects in our days sales outstanding, which remain at historically low levels. 
Turning to our financial results for the second quarter on Slide 17. Adjusted EPS was up 24% to $0.31, primarily reflecting execution on our growth plan, demand recovery at our U.S. utilities, and parent interest savings. These positive drivers were partially offset by lower contributions from Chile and Brazil, and a slightly higher adjusted tax rate. 
Turning to Slide 18. Adjusted pretax contribution or PTC was $303 million for the quarter, an increase of $65 million versus the second quarter of 2020. I will discuss the key drivers of our second quarter results in more detail beginning on Slide 19. In the US and Utilities Strategic Business unit, or SBU, PTC was up $71 million, driven primarily by the demand recovery at our utilities, higher contributions from about 1 gigawatt of new renewable assets and the commencement of power purchase agreements, or PPAs, at Southland Energy in California. 
Turning to Slide 20. We are very encouraged to see material recovery from system demand at our U.S. utilities. For Q2, on a weather-normalized basis, demand at AES Ohio is up 9%, and demand at AES Indiana is up 4%. The net combined volume in Ohio and Indiana is largely back to 2019 pre-COVID levels. This recovery is mainly driven by higher load from commercial and industrial customers this year as a result of the reopening of local businesses.
Separately, in California, our 2.3 gigawatt Southland legacy units are well positioned to contribute to the state's pressing energy needs and its transition to a more sustainable carbon-free future. In fact, the State Water Board is considering the California Energy Agency's recommendation for our 876 megawatts Redondo Beach facility to be extended for 2 years through 2023 to align with our remaining legacy units. This proposed extension would be an upside to expectations through 2025. 
Now turning back to our quarterly results on Slide 21. At our South America SBU, lower PTC was mostly driven by recovery of expenses from customers in Chile in 2020, lower equity earnings from Guacolda also in Chile and [ drier hydrology ] in Brazil. These impacts were partially offset by higher generation at the Chivor hydro plant in Colombia. 
Higher PTC at our Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, or MCAC SBU primarily reflects better hydrology in Panama, which was partially offset by the sale of Itabo in the Dominican Republic. Finally, in Eurasia, PTC remained relatively flat. The impact from the sale of OPGC in India was largely offset by lower interest expense in Bulgaria. 
Turning to Slide 24. With our first half results, we are on track to achieve our full year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance of $1.50 to $1.58. As we have discussed in the past, our typical quarterly earnings profile was more back-end weighted, with roughly 40% of earnings occurring in the first half of the year. Growth in the year to go will be primarily driven by 1.4 gigawatt of new renewables assets coming online in the remainder of the year, continued demand recovery across our markets, reduced interest expense and cost savings benefits. We are also reaffirming our expected 7% to 9% average annual growth target through 2025. 
Now turning to our credit profile on Slide 25. Strong credit metrics remain 1 of our top priorities. In the last 4 years, we obtained 2 to 3 notches of upgrades from the 3 credit rating agencies, including investment-grade ratings from Fitch and S&P. We are also very encouraged by the recent change in outlook to positive on our Ba1 rating at Moody's. These actions validate the strength of our business model and our commitment to improving our credit metrics. We expect the positive momentum in these metrics to continue, enabling us to reach BBB ratios by 2025. 
Now to our 2021 parent capital allocation plan on Slide 26. Consistent with our prior disclosures, sources shown on the left-hand side of this slide reflect approximately $2 billion of total discretionary cash. This includes $800 million of parent free cash flow, $100 million of proceeds received from the sale of the Itabo in the Dominican Republic, and the successful issuance of the $1 billion of equity units in March. 
Now to uses on the right-hand side. We'll be returning $450 million to shareholders this year, consisting of our common share dividend and the coupon of the equity units. And we plan to invest approximately $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion in our subsidiaries as we capitalize on attractive opportunities for growth. Approximately 60% of these investments are in global renewals, reflecting our success in originations during 2020 and our expectations for 2021. And about 25% of these investments are in our U.S. utilities to fund rate base growth, with a continued focus on grid and fleet modernization. 
In the first half of the year, we invested approximately $700 million, primarily in renewables, which is roughly 50% of our expected investments for the year. 
In summary, we are making significant progress on executing on the strategic and financial objectives we laid out in our Investor Day in March, positioning AES as a leader in the energy transition while delivering superior returns to our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andres."

The other thing, of course, is we have a good pipeline of potential projects. So we're just finding that we're working very well with our clients. We have many repeat clients in terms of signing on new deals. So this second quarter was particularly strong in the U.S. And we see that as the most -- the most rapidly growing market.

That's what we're going after. 
In the case of New York, look, we don't have a lot of wind assets of ourselves. Other people have done a lot of wind assets repowering. We think this is an idea that the time has come with the technology. So we're doing some repowering on our old wind farms, but we saw this as a great opportunity in New York to repower. And again, this comes back to the idea that we want a mix of assets, wind, solar, energy storage, in some cases, even small hydros to be able to deliver those sort of round-the-clock renewables. So think of it that way. We are solving for what the customer wants, and we'll put the package of sources, whether we build them or we buy somebody else's project, to satisfy that."

Look, for some of you who follow us for a while, we're always very paranoid about our supply chain. That's why I think it was January of -- February actually of 2020, we were talking about supply chain issues with COVID and how we're going to get ahead of it. So here, we've also been on top of this. They're, obviously -- in the past year, there were supply chain issues with imports. What was going to be the tariff on panels from China? And then what was going to be the tariff, for example, on aluminum? So could you manufacture it locally? So we've been on top of this issue.
So today, I would say all of our solar panels coming into the states are not coming in from China. They're coming in from Malaysia. We do buy some U.S. panels as well, which are non-polysilicon. We're also working with top notch -- only top-notch panel manufacturers, first tier, and getting certificates that none of the polysilicon comes from Hoshine. That could be associated in any way with forced labor. So that's where we are. This is a developing story. In the past, what we've been able to do with the tariffs, for example, is to move panels that were coming to the state, for example, to Chile and vice versa to optimize the supply chain. So -- which, quite frankly, worked out very well. 
So if you look at what we're doing, we are certainly in solar, one of the top 5, I would say, in the country in terms of new solar development. So we're very well positioned. We're on top of that. We have long-standing agreements, and our suppliers are doing everything possible. I think I could add that, in the future, we're going to -- we're making sure that the polysilicon would come from alternative sources like Germany or Korea. So that's in the works. 
But this does take a transition. So we're on top of that. And stay tuned because, while we feel very good about our certification and all the rest, it's a question of where does that polysilicon arrive? And can you prove it? So again, we are having, I'd say, as extensive affidavits from our suppliers as anybody on this matter."

Before discussing our progress since our last call, I want to introduce our new Chief Financial Officer, Steve Coughlin. Steve has been with AES for 14 years and has served in a variety of roles, including as CEO of Fluence and most recently as Head of both Strategy and Financial Planning. 
I am happy to report that we are making excellent progress on our strategic and financial goals and remain on track to deliver on our 7% to 9% annualized growth in adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow through 2025. We had a strong third quarter with adjusted EPS of $0.50, a 19% increase versus the same quarter last year. We expect to deliver on our full year guidance, even with a $0.07 noncash impact from an updated accounting interpretation related to the equity units of a convert we issued earlier this year. Steve will provide more details shortly. 
Today, I will discuss both the growth in our core business as well as the strategy and evolution of our innovation business called AES Next. We see ourselves as the leading integrator of new technologies. The 2 parts of our portfolio are mutually beneficial to one another and enable us to deliver greater total returns to our shareholders. More specifically, and as we have proven, our core business platforms provide the optimal environment for exponentially growing technology start-ups. At the same time, our AES Next businesses provide us with unique capabilities that enable us to offer customers the differentiated product they seek to achieve their sustainability goals. 
Turning to Slide 4. I will provide you with an update on our core business, including our growth in renewables and an update on the overall macroeconomic environment. 
Beginning with renewables. We continue to see great momentum in demand overall. As we speak, we have senior members of our team, attending the COP26 Climate Conference in Glasgow, meeting with governments, organizations and potential customers. Since our last call in August, we have signed an additional 1.1 gigawatts of renewable PPAs, bringing our year-to-date total to 4 gigawatts. Additionally, we are in very advanced discussions for another 850 megawatts of wind, solar and energy storage. Based on our current progress, we now expect to sign at least 5 gigawatts this year versus our prior expectations of 4 gigawatts. This represents the largest addition in our history and 66% more than in 2020. 
With our pipeline of 38 gigawatts of potential projects, including 10 gigawatts that are ready to bid in the U.S., we are well positioned to capitalize on this substantial opportunity. Our success is a result of our strategy of working with our clients on long-term contracts that provides customized solutions for their specific energy and sustainability goals. As such, almost 90% of our new business has been from bilateral negotiated contracts with corporate customers. This allows us to compete on what we do best: providing differentiated, innovative solutions. 
One example of our work with major technology companies to provide competitively priced renewable energy netted on an hour-by-hour basis. As we announced earlier this week, we signed a 15-year agreement to provide around-the-clock renewable energy to power Microsoft's data centers in Virginia. Year-to-date, we have signed almost 2 gigawatts of similarly structured contracts with a number of tech companies, integrating a mix of renewable sources and energy storage. 
Outside the U.S., we have a similar strategy of focusing on bilateral sales with corporate customers, which has enabled us to sign long-term U.S. dollar-denominated contracts with investment-grade customers. 
For example, in Brazil, we see demand for more than 25 gigawatts of renewables, providing a significant opportunity to earn mid- to high-teen returns in U.S. dollars, while at the same time, diversifying our Brazilian portfolio of mostly hydro generation. To that end, for the first time ever in Brazil, we are in very advanced negotiations to design a 300-megawatt U.S. dollar-denominated contract with a large multinational corporation for 15 years. 
Turning to Slide 5. Our backlog of 9.2 gigawatts is the largest ever with 60% in the U.S. These projects represent one of the main drivers for our growth through 2025 and beyond. With this pace of growth, we are laser-focused on ensuring that we have adequate and reliable supply chain. For several years, we have anticipated a boom in renewable development that could potentially lead to inadequate panel supply. And as such, we took preemptive measures to ensure supply chain flexibility. Despite current challenges in the market, we have non-Chinese panels secured for the majority of our backlog, which is expected to come online through 2024. We have benefited from a number of strategic relationships with various suppliers and a clear advantage stemming from our scale and visibility of our pipeline. 
More generally, we continue to proactively manage potential macroeconomic headwinds, including inflation and commodity prices. As part of our efforts to derisk our portfolio over the past decade, we have taken a systematic approach to risk management. In fact, in places where we use fuel, it is mostly a pass-through and, therefore, we have limited exposure to changes in commodity prices. Furthermore, more than 80% of our adjusted pretax contribution is in U.S. dollars, insulating us from fluctuations in foreign currencies. 
We not only remain committed to achieving our long-term adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow targets, but we also continue to improve our credit metrics and are on track to achieve BBB ratings from all agencies by 2025. 
Now to Slide 6. We continue to benefit from a virtuous cycle with our corporate customers, in which our ability to provide innovative solutions leads to more opportunities for collaboration and more projects. For example, this quarter, we announced a partnership with Google to provide our utility customers cost savings and energy efficiency features  as well as opportunities to accelerate their own clean energy goals through Nest thermostats. 
Moving to Slide 7. Through AES Next, we integrate new technologies to bring innovation to the industry and work with existing and new customers. AES Next operates as a separate unit within AES where we develop and incubate new businesses, including a combination of strategic investments and internally developed businesses, representing approximately $50 million of gross capital annually. 
As I mentioned, the combination of AES Next and our core business creates the optimal environment for growth, whereby we can better create solutions for customers by utilizing our industry insights and operating platforms. One example of this mutually beneficial arrangement is in the combination of renewables plus storage. We first combined solar and storage in 2018 in Hawaii. And today, nearly half of our renewable PPAs have an energy storage component. 
Another example is 5B, a prefabricated solar solution company that has patented technology, allowing projects to be built in 1/3 of the time and on half as much land while being resistant to hurricane force winds. We see 5B's technology as a source of current and future competitive advantage for AES, allowing us to build more projects in places where there is land scarcity, constraints around height or soil disruption or hurricane risk. Likewise, 5B benefits greatly from the ability to grow rapidly on our platform, and we are currently developing projects in the U.S., Puerto Rico, Chile, Panama and India. 
I am highlighting the AES Next portion of our business because it is increasingly clear that AES essentially has 2 distinct business models that add value to our shareholders in very different ways. With our core business, we continue to measure our success through growth in adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow as well as PPAs signed. With AES Next, these businesses contribute value creation through their extremely rapid growth in valuation with the potential for future monetization. Nonetheless,they are a drag on AES' earnings during their ramp-up phase. In 2021, this drag on earnings is expected to be approximately $0.06 per share. We assume these losses from AES Next in our 2021 guidance and our 7% to 9% annualized growth rate through 2025. 
Turning to Slide 8. As you know,  last week, Fluence, our energy storage joint venture with Siemens, which began as a small business within AES, became a publicly listed company with a current valuation of around $6 billion. Similarly, early this year, another AES Next business, Uplight, received evaluation in a private transaction of $1.5 billion. The value of our interest in these 2 businesses is now at least $2.5 billion or $3 per share compared to the book value of our investments of approximately $150 million. In my view, this massive shareholder value creation more than justifies the temporary negative impact to earnings. 
In summary, our strategy of being the leading integrator of new technologies on our platform has yielded great results, and we have several other innovations in development under AES Next. As they mature, we will continue to take actions to accelerate their growth and show their value. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Steve Coughlin."
35312,1684281081,2424923,"The AES Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Andres, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to participate in my first earnings call as CFO of AES.

It's my pleasure to participate in my first earnings call as CFO of AES. I have been at AES for 14 years and feel very fortunate to work at a company that is transforming the electric sector so profoundly along so many talented people in finance and throughout the company. With our strategic and financial progress to date, AES is well positioned to continue leading this transformation. 
In my previous role, I led corporate strategy and financial planning where we developed our plan to get to greater than 50% renewables at least 50% of our business in the U.S. and to reduce our coal share to less than 10% by 2025, all while growing the company 7% to 9%. We are committed to those goals, and I look forward to continue executing toward them. 
Before I dive into our financial performance, I want to discuss the adjustment to our accounting that we made this quarter relating to the treatment of the $1 billion in equity units we issued in the first quarter this year. Our prior guidance assume that the underlying shares would not be included in our fully diluted share count until 2024 upon settlement of the equity units. This approach was in line with industry practice and supported by our interpretation of the accounting literature and our external auditors. 
However, we are now subject to an updated interpretation of these instruments, and we are adjusting to include these shares in our fully diluted EPS calculations. This adjustment results in an annual impact of roughly $0.07 this year and $0.09 in 2022 and 2023 using a full year of an additional 40 million shares. It's important to keep in mind that this adjustment has no cash impact and has absolutely no impact on our business or longer-term growth rates as we had included the underlying shares in our projections for 2024 and beyond. 
Prior to this adjustment, we had expected to be in the upper half of our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range, but we now expect to be at the low end of the range. 
Now I'd like to cover 2 important topics: our performance during the third quarter and our capital allocation plan. 
Turning to Slide 11. You can see the strong performance of our portfolio in this quarter. Adjusted EPS was $0.50 for the quarter versus $0.42 for the comparable quarter last year. This 19% increase was primarily driven by improvements in our operating businesses, new renewables and parent interest savings. These positive drivers were partially offset by lower contributions from South America, largely due to unscheduled outages in Chile. 
Third quarter results also reflect an approximate $0.03 quarter-to-date impact from the higher share count due to the inclusion of 40 million additional weighted average shares relating to the equity units that I just mentioned. 
Turning to Slide 12. Adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, was $428 million for the quarter, an increase of $97 million versus third quarter of 2020. 
I'll cover our results by strategic business unit over the next 4 slides, beginning on Slide 13. 
In the US and Utilities SBU, PTC increased $69 million as a result of our continued progress in growing our U.S. footprint. The improvement was largely driven by higher contributions from Southland, which benefited from higher contracted prices, new renewables coming online at AES Clean Energy and higher availability at AES Puerto Rico. 
In California, our 2.3 gigawatt Southland legacy portfolio demonstrated its critical importance by continuing to meet the state's pressing energy needs and its transition to a more sustainable carbon-free future. In fact, as you may have heard, last month, the State Water Resource Control Board unanimously approved an extension of our 876-megawatt Redondo Beach facility for 2 years through 2023 to align with our remaining legacy units. If the demand/supply situation remains tight, some of our legacy portfolio could be available to meet California's energy needs beyond 2023 if state energy officials determine a need, although we have not assumed this in our guidance. 
As you can see on Slide 14, at our South America SBU, lower PTC was primarily driven by unscheduled outages in Chile due to a blade defect impacting 6 turbines across our fleet that has now largely been resolved. Our third quarter results were also driven by lower hydrology in Brazil. 
Before moving to MCAC, I would like to provide an update on 531-megawatt Alto Maipo hydro project owned by a subsidiary of AES Andes in Chile. Construction continues to go well, and generation is expected to begin in December of this year. with full commercial operation of the plant expected in the first half of 2022, in line with our expectations. Alto Maipo is in discussions with its nonrecourse lenders to restructure its debt to achieve a more sustainable and flexible capital structure for the long term. AES Andes has honored its equity commitment to Alto Maipo and will not be assuming any additional equity obligations. We expect the restructuring to be completed in 2022. And AES Andes already assumed 0 cash flow from Alto Maipo, so we don't see the restructuring impacting our guidance. 
Now turning back to our third quarter results on Slide 15. The higher PTC at our MCAC SBU primarily reflects higher LNG sales in Dominican Republic and demand recovery in Panama. 
And finally, in Eurasia, as shown on Slide 16, higher results reflect improved operating performance in Bulgaria. 
Now to Slide 17. To summarize our performance in the first 3 quarters of the year, we earned adjusted EPS of $1.07 versus $0.96 last year. As I mentioned earlier, in terms of our full year guidance, we are incorporating the $0.07 per share noncash impact from the adjustment for the equity units issued earlier this year. Prior to this adjustment, we had expected to be in the upper half of our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range, but we now expect to come in at the lower end of the range of $1.50 to $1.58. It's important to note that this adjustment does not affect our longer-term growth expectations and has no impact on our cash flow. 
With 3 quarters of the year behind us, our year-to-go results will benefit from contributions from new renewables, continued demand recovery across our markets, reduced interest expense and our cost savings programs. These positive drivers are offset by the impact of the higher share count and the dilution from AES Next, as Andres discussed earlier. 
Now turning to our 2021 parent capital allocation on Slide 18. Beginning on the left hand of the slide and consistent with our prior disclosure, we expect approximately $2 billion of discretionary cash this year. We remain confident in our parent free cash flow target midpoint of $800 million and the $100 million from the sale of Itabo, and we received the $1 billion of proceeds from the equity units issued in March. 
Moving over to the right-hand side. The uses are largely unchanged from the last quarter with $450 million in returns to our shareholders this year, consisting of our common share dividend and the coupon on the equity units. 
We also continue to expect almost $1.5 billion of investment in our subsidiaries, with about 60% going towards renewables globally. Our investment program continues to be heavily weighted to the U.S. with approximately 70% targeted for our U.S. businesses. The increased focus on U.S. investments will contribute to our goal of growing the proportion of earnings from the U.S. to at least half of our base. 
Finally, as I ramp up in my new role, I've had the chance to speak with many of our internal and external stakeholders. It's clear that AES continues to successfully execute on our strategy, and we remain resilient in the face of volatile macroeconomic conditions. Continuing to drive the successful execution and delivering on our financial goals is my top priority. I look forward to getting input from more of our investors and analysts and providing the information you need to understand the great future ahead for AES. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andres."

One of the things I'd like to highlight is that we had a design malfunction in our steam turbines in Chile. And this required them to undergo maintenance at 50,000 hours instead of 100,000 hours. And this happened during the worst drought in Chile's history. So we were short energy when energy prices were high. But nonetheless, if it weren't for the accounting, we would have been well within the mid or upper region of our earnings. So this is the way that our portfolio works.

And then looking ahead, we have a number of value-accretive opportunities in the portfolio. So we're in the midst of our planning process at this point, and we'll give 2022 guidance in February.

So there's a number of companies that have used similar instruments. And in consultation with our auditors, SEC have done a review of the treatment of these types of instruments and has informed our auditors that they see a different interpretation.

So these have created a lot and a lot of value for our shareholders. 
And it's very interesting because there are 2 sides of the business. The AES Next is really a value play, especially during this rapid growth phase because you have to expense a lot of your investments really. But at the same time, they're helping us grow. So when you talk about the structured products that we're selling to corporations, having AES Next and the know-how from there has been extremely helpful. 
So as I said, stay tuned, we have others in the works. The most mature probably is 5B. We think 5B has a lot of potential because of what it offers. It offers speed of build. It offers less use of land, and hurricane resistance is very important. Hurricane wind resistance is very important.

Regarding AES Next, the one that's producing the largest drag is Fluence. Quite frankly, Fluence as it matures and had -- it's made all these investments in new designs and gearing up to be able to meet that supply in terms of guaranteeing supply of batteries around the world.

And look, the opportunity for Fluence just gotten massive, more massive than we predicted when I started there. So going out and raising this capital was clearly targeted to go big and go much bigger. And so this -- in some ways, what it does is it increases the near-term dilution deliberately because we're investing to accelerate the scale of the company, and we know that it can be successful if we accelerate. So -- but it's also been significantly increasing the upside when we get out into '24, '25 period. 
So putting this capital to work is going to be near-term dilutive, but it's tremendously value accretive.

Before discussing our progress since our last call, I want to introduce our new Chief Financial Officer, Steve Coughlin. Steve has been with AES for 14 years and has served in a variety of roles, including as CEO of Fluence and most recently as Head of both Strategy and Financial Planning.
I am happy to report that we are making excellent progress on our strategic and financial goals, and remain on track to deliver on our 7% to 9% annualized growth in adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow through 2025. We had a strong third quarter with adjusted EPS of $0.50, a 19% increase versus the same quarter last year. We expect to deliver on our full year guidance, even with a $0.07 noncash impact from an updated accounting interpretation related to the equity units of a convert we issued earlier this year. Steve will provide more details shortly. 
Today, I will discuss both the growth in our core business as well as the strategy and evolution of our innovation business called AES Next. We see ourselves as the leading integrator of new technologies. The 2 parts of our portfolio are mutually beneficial to one another and enable us to deliver greater total returns to our shareholders. More specifically, and as we have proven, our core business platforms provide the optimal environment for exponentially growing technology start-ups. At the same time, our AES Next businesses provide us with unique capabilities that enable us to offer customers the differentiated product they seek to achieve their sustainability goals.
Turning to Slide 4. I will provide you with an update on our core business, including our growth in renewables and an update on the overall macroeconomic environment. 
Beginning with renewables. We continue to see great momentum in demand overall. As we speak, we have senior members of our team, attending the COP26 Climate Conference in Glasgow, meeting with governments, organizations and potential customers. Since our last call in August, we have signed an additional 1.1 gigawatts of renewable PPAs, bringing our year-to-date total to 4 gigawatts. Additionally, we are in very advanced discussions for another 850 megawatts of wind, solar and energy storage. Based on our current progress, we now expect to sign at least 5 gigawatts this year versus our prior expectations of 4 gigawatts. This represents the largest addition in our history and 66% more than in 2020.
With our pipeline of 38 gigawatts of potential projects, including 10 gigawatts that are ready to bid in the U.S., we are well positioned to capitalize on this substantial opportunity. Our success is a result of our strategy of working with our clients on long-term contracts that provides customized solutions for their specific energy and sustainability goals. As such, almost 90% of our new business has been from bilateral negotiated contracts with corporate customers. This allows us to compete on what we do best: providing differentiated, innovative solutions.
One example of our work with major technology companies to provide competitively priced renewable energy netted on an hour-by-hour basis. As we announced earlier this week, we signed a 15-year agreement to provide around-the-clock renewable energy to power Microsoft's data centers in Virginia. Year-to-date, we have signed almost 2 gigawatts of similarly structured contracts with a number of tech companies, integrating a mix of renewable sources and energy storage.
Outside the U.S., we have a similar strategy of focusing on bilateral sales with corporate customers, which has enabled us to sign long-term U.S. dollar-denominated contracts with investment-grade customers. For example, in Brazil, we see demand for more than 25 gigawatts of renewables, providing a significant opportunity to earn mid- to high-teen returns in U.S. dollars, while at the same time, diversifying our Brazilian portfolio of mostly hydro generation. To that end, for the first time ever in Brazil, we are in very advanced negotiations to design a 300-megawatt U.S. dollar-denominated contract with a large multinational corporation for 15 years.
Turning to Slide 5. Our backlog of 9.2 gigawatts is the largest ever with 60% in the U.S. These projects represent one of the main drivers for our growth through 2025 and beyond. With this pace of growth, we are laser-focused on ensuring that we have adequate and reliable supply chain. For several years, we have anticipated a boom in renewable development that could potentially lead to inadequate panel supply. And as such, we took preemptive measures to ensure supply chain flexibility. Despite current challenges in the market, we have non-Chinese panels secured for the majority of our backlog, which is expected to come online through 2024. We have benefited from a number of strategic relationships with various suppliers and a clear advantage stemming from our scale and visibility of our pipeline.
More generally, we continue to proactively manage potential macroeconomic headwinds, including inflation and commodity prices. As part of our efforts to derisk our portfolio over the past decade, we have taken a systematic approach to risk management. In fact, in places where we use fuel, it is mostly a pass-through and, therefore, we have limited exposure to changes in commodity prices. Furthermore, more than 80% of our adjusted pretax contribution is in U.S. dollars, insulating us from fluctuations in foreign currencies.
We not only remain committed to achieving our long-term adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow targets, but we also continue to improve our credit metrics and are on track to achieve BBB ratings from all agencies by 2025.
Now to Slide 6. We continue to benefit from a virtuous cycle with our corporate customers, in which our ability to provide innovative solutions leads to more opportunities for collaboration and more projects. For example, this quarter, we announced a partnership with Google to provide our utility customers cost savings and energy efficiency features  as well as opportunities to accelerate their own clean energy goals through Nest thermostats.
Moving to Slide 7. Through AES Next, we integrate new technologies to bring innovation to the industry and work with existing and new customers. AES Next operates as a separate unit within AES where we develop and incubate new businesses, including a combination of strategic investments and internally developed businesses, representing approximately $50 million of gross capital annually.
As I mentioned, the combination of AES Next and our core business creates the optimal environment for growth, whereby we can better create solutions for customers by utilizing our industry insights and operating platforms. One example of this mutually beneficial arrangement is in the combination of renewables plus storage. We first combined solar and storage in 2018 in Hawaii. And today, nearly half of our renewable PPAs have an energy storage component.
Another example is 5B, a prefabricated solar solution company that has patented technology, allowing projects to be built in 1/3 of the time and on half as much land while being resistant to hurricane force winds. We see 5B's technology as a source of current and future competitive advantage for AES, allowing us to build more projects in places where there is a land scarcity, constraints around height or soil disruption or hurricane risk. Likewise, 5B benefits greatly from the ability to grow rapidly on our platform, and we are currently developing projects in the U.S., Puerto Rico, Chile, Panama and India.
I am highlighting the AES Next portion of our business because it is increasingly clear that AES essentially has 2 distinct business models that add value to our shareholders in very different ways. With our core business, we continue to measure our success through growth in adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow as well as PPAs signed. With AES Next, these businesses contribute value creation through their extremely rapid growth in valuation with the potential for future monetization. Nonetheless,they are a drag on AES' earnings during their ramp-up phase.
In 2021, this drag on earnings is expected to be approximately $0.06 per share. We assume these losses from AES Next in our 2021 guidance and our 7% to 9% annualized growth rate through 2025.
Turning to Slide 8. As you know,  last week, Fluence, our energy storage joint venture with Siemens, which began as a small business within AES, became a publicly listed company with a current valuation of around $6 billion.
Similarly, early this year, another AES Next business, Uplight, received evaluation in a private transaction of $1.5 billion. The value of our interest in these 2 businesses is now at least $2.5 billion or $3 per share compared to the book value of our investments of approximately $150 million. In my view, this massive shareholder value creation more than justifies the temporary negative impact to earnings.
In summary, our strategy of being the leading integrator of new technologies on our platform has yielded great results, and we have several other innovations in development under AES Next. As they mature, we will continue to take actions to accelerate their growth and show their value.
With that, I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Steve Coughlin."
35312,1684281081,2425114,"The AES Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Andres, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to participate in my first earnings call as CFO of AES.

It's my pleasure to participate in my first earnings call as CFO of AES. I have been at AES for 14 years and feel very fortunate to work at a company that is transforming the electric sector so profoundly along so many talented people in finance and throughout the company. With our strategic and financial progress to date, AES is well positioned to continue leading this transformation.
In my previous role, I led corporate strategy and financial planning where we developed our plan to get to greater than 50% renewables at least 50% of our business in the U.S. and to reduce our coal share to less than 10% by 2025, all while growing the company 7% to 9%. We are committed to those goals, and I look forward to continue executing toward them.
Before I dive into our financial performance, I want to discuss the adjustment to our accounting that we made this quarter relating to the treatment of the $1 billion in equity units we issued in the first quarter this year.
Our prior guidance assume that the underlying shares would not be included in our fully diluted share count until 2024 upon settlement of the equity units. This approach was in line with industry practice and supported by our interpretation of the accounting literature and our external auditors. However, we are now subject to an updated interpretation of these instruments, and we are adjusting to include these shares in our fully diluted EPS calculations. This adjustment results in an annual impact of roughly $0.07 this year and $0.09 in 2022 and 2023 using a full year of an additional 40 million shares.
It's important to keep in mind that this adjustment has no cash impact and has absolutely no impact on our business or longer-term growth rates as we had included the underlying shares in our projections for 2024 and beyond.
Prior to this adjustment, we had expected to be in the upper half of our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range, but we now expect to be at the low end of the range. 
Now I'd like to cover 2 important topics: our performance during the third quarter and our capital allocation plan.
Turning to Slide 11. You can see the strong performance of our portfolio in this quarter. Adjusted EPS was $0.50 for the quarter versus $0.42 for the comparable quarter last year. This 19% increase was primarily driven by improvements in our operating businesses, new renewables and parent interest savings. These positive drivers were partially offset by lower contributions from South America, largely due to unscheduled outages in Chile.
Third quarter results also reflect an approximate $0.03 quarter-to-date impact from the higher share count due to the inclusion of 40 million additional weighted average shares relating to the equity units that I just mentioned.
Turning to Slide 12. Adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, was $428 million for the quarter, an increase of $97 million versus third quarter of 2020.
I'll cover our results by strategic business unit over the next 4 slides, beginning on Slide 13.
In the US and Utilities SBU, PTC increased $69 million as a result of our continued progress in growing our U.S. footprint. The improvement was largely driven by higher contributions from Southland, which benefited from higher contracted prices, new renewables coming online at AES Clean Energy and higher availability at AES Puerto Rico.
In California, our 2.3 gigawatt Southland legacy portfolio demonstrated its critical importance by continuing to meet the state's pressing energy needs and its transition to a more sustainable carbon-free future. In fact, as you may have heard, last month, the State Water Resource Control Board unanimously approved an extension of our 876-megawatt Redondo Beach facility for 2 years through 2023 to align with our remaining legacy units. If the demand/supply situation remains tight, some of our legacy portfolio could be available to meet California's energy needs beyond 2023 if state energy officials determine a need, although we have not assumed this in our guidance.
As you can see on Slide 14, at our South America SBU, lower PTC was primarily driven by unscheduled outages in Chile due to a blade defect impacting 6 turbines across our fleet that has now largely been resolved. Our third quarter results were also driven by lower hydrology in Brazil.
Before moving to MCAC, I would like to provide an update on 531-megawatt Alto Maipo hydro project, owned by a subsidiary of AES Andes in Chile. Construction continues to go well, and generation is expected to begin in December of this year, with full commercial operation of the plant expected in the first half of 2022, in line with our expectations. Alto Maipo is in discussions with its nonrecourse lenders to restructure its debt to achieve a more sustainable and flexible capital structure for the long term. AES Andes has honored its equity commitment to Alto Maipo and will not be assuming any additional equity obligations. We expect the restructuring to be completed in 2022. And AES Andes already assumed 0 cash flow from Alto Maipo, so we don't see the restructuring impacting our guidance.
Now turning back to our third quarter results on Slide 15. The higher PTC at our MCAC SBU primarily reflects higher LNG sales in Dominican Republic and demand recovery in Panama.
And finally, in Eurasia, as shown on Slide 16, higher results reflect improved operating performance in Bulgaria.
Now to Slide 17. To summarize our performance in the first 3 quarters of the year, we earned adjusted EPS of $1.07 versus $0.96 last year. As I mentioned earlier, in terms of our full year guidance, we are incorporating the $0.07 per share noncash impact from the adjustment for the equity units issued earlier this year. Prior to this adjustment, we had expected to be in the upper half of our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range, but we now expect to come in at the lower end of the range of $1.50 to $1.58. It's important to note that this adjustment does not affect our longer-term growth expectations and has no impact on our cash flow.
With 3 quarters of the year behind us, our year-to-go results will benefit from contributions from new renewables, continued demand recovery across our markets, reduced interest expense and our cost savings programs. These positive drivers are offset by the impact of the higher share count and the dilution from AES Next, as Andres discussed earlier. 
Now turning to our 2021 parent capital allocation on Slide 18. Beginning on the left hand of the slide and consistent with our prior disclosure, we expect approximately $2 billion of discretionary cash this year. We remain confident in our parent free cash flow target midpoint of $800 million and the $100 million from the sale of Itabo, and we received the $1 billion of proceeds from the equity units issued in March.
Moving over to the right-hand side. The uses are largely unchanged from the last quarter with $450 million in returns to our shareholders this year, consisting of our common share dividend and the coupon on the equity units. 
We also continue to expect almost $1.5 billion of investment in our subsidiaries, with about 60% going towards renewables globally. Our investment program continues to be heavily weighted to the U.S. with approximately 70% targeted for our U.S. businesses. The increased focus on U.S. investments will contribute to our goal of growing the proportion of earnings from the U.S. to at least half of our base.
Finally, as I ramp up in my new role, I've had the chance to speak with many of our internal and external stakeholders. It's clear that AES continues to successfully execute on our strategy, and we remain resilient in the face of volatile macroeconomic conditions. Continuing to drive the successful execution and delivering on our financial goals is my top priority. I look forward to getting input from more of our investors and analysts and providing the information you need to understand the great future ahead for AES. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andres."

But as you correctly point out, they are positives, and then we have the drag of the additional shares, and we will be working with that. I'd say overall, we feel we're in an excellent position. We had a very strong quarter and year-to-date.
One of the things I'd like to highlight is that we had a design malfunction in our steam turbines in Chile. And this required them to undergo maintenance at 50,000 hours instead of 100,000 hours. And this happened during the worst drought in Chile's history. So we were short energy when energy prices were high. But nonetheless, if it weren't for the accounting, we would have been well within the mid or upper region of our earnings. So this is the way that our portfolio works.

And then looking ahead, we have a number of value-accretive opportunities in the portfolio. So we're in the midst of our planning process at this point, and we'll give 2022 guidance in February.

So there's a number of companies that have used similar instruments. And in consultation with our auditors, SEC have done a review of the treatment of these types of instruments and has informed our auditors that they see a different interpretation. So although we haven't had direct communications with the SEC, we felt it was most prudent that we go ahead and update the interpretation.

So these have created a lot and a lot of value for our shareholders.
And it's very interesting because there are 2 sides of the business. The AES Next is really a value play, especially during this rapid growth phase because you have to expense a lot of your investments really. But at the same time, they're helping us grow. So when you talk about the structured products that we're selling to corporations, having AES Next and the know-how from there has been extremely helpful.
So as I said, stay tuned, we have others in the works. The most mature probably is 5B. We think 5B has a lot of potential because of what it offers. It offers speed of build. It offers less use of land, and hurricane resistant is very important. Hurricane wind resistant is very important.

Regarding AES Next, the one that's producing the largest drag is Fluence. Quite frankly, Fluence as it matures and had -- it's made all these investments in new designs and gearing up to be able to meet that supply in terms of guaranteeing supply of batteries around the world.

And look, the opportunity for Fluence just gotten massive, more massive than even we predicted when I started there. So going out and raising this capital was clearly targeted to go big and go much bigger. And so this -- in some ways, what it does is it increases the near-term dilution deliberately because we're investing to accelerate the scale of the company, and we know that it can be successful if we accelerate. So -- but it's also been significantly increasing the upside when we get out into '24, '25 period.
So putting this capital to work is going to be near-term dilutive, but it's tremendously value accretive.

So to the extent there's an opportunity beyond that, that would be upside to our guidance.
And in addition, this year, in the third quarter, we've seen in the numbers, we had the margin favorability from the hedges there, those assets of legacy assets are quite valuable, and we see the potential for further Q3 value recognition in our assets, which would also be upside into the guidance going forward?"

We have basically been contracting much more in terms of the Dominican Republic, filling up the second tank and in Panama filling up the first tank. So we see LNG as a necessary transition fuel. And I think what we're seeing a little bit in Europe and a little bit in China is that it's very important to manage this transition.
So while we're coming up with new technologies, making it possible to put more renewables on the grid, make renewables cheaper, make them more efficient and satisfy more what customers want, we see that in some -- many places, LNG, natural gas is the necessary transition fuel. So it will work together. And as we said, we are on our way to filling up our full capacity of the 2 locations of the 3 tanks."

Before discussing our progress since our last call, I want to introduce our new Chief Financial Officer, Steve Coughlin. Steve has been with AES for 14 years and has served in a variety of roles, including as CEO of Fluence and most recently as Head of both Strategy and Financial Planning.
I am happy to report that we are making excellent progress on our strategic and financial goals and remain on track to deliver on our 7% to 9% annualized growth in adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow through 2025. We had a strong third quarter with adjusted EPS of $0.50, a 19% increase versus the same quarter last year. We expect to deliver on our full year guidance, even with a $0.07 noncash impact from an updated accounting interpretation related to the equity units of a convert we issued earlier this year. Steve will provide more details shortly. 
Today, I will discuss both the growth in our core business as well as the strategy and evolution of our innovation business called AES Next. We see ourselves as the leading integrator of new technologies. The 2 parts of our portfolio are mutually beneficial to one another and enable us to deliver greater total returns to our shareholders. More specifically, and as we have proven, our core business platforms provide the optimal environment for exponentially growing technology start-ups. At the same time, our AES Next businesses provide us with unique capabilities that enable us to offer customers the differentiated product they seek to achieve their sustainability goals.
Turning to Slide 4. I will provide you with an update on our core business, including our growth in renewables and an update on the overall macroeconomic environment. 
Beginning with renewables. We continue to see great momentum in demand overall. As we speak, we have senior members of our team, attending the COP26 Climate Conference in Glasgow, meeting with governments, organizations and potential customers. Since our last call in August, we have signed an additional 1.1 gigawatts of renewable PPAs, bringing our year-to-date total to 4 gigawatts. Additionally, we are in very advanced discussions for another 850 megawatts of wind, solar and energy storage. Based on our current progress, we now expect to sign at least 5 gigawatts this year versus our prior expectations of 4 gigawatts. This represents the largest addition in our history and 66% more than in 2020.
With our pipeline of 38 gigawatts of potential projects, including 10 gigawatts that are ready to bid in the U.S., we are well positioned to capitalize on this substantial opportunity. Our success is a result of our strategy of working with our clients on long-term contracts that provides customized solutions for their specific energy and sustainability goals. As such, almost 90% of our new business has been from bilateral negotiated contracts with corporate customers. This allows us to compete on what we do best: providing differentiated, innovative solutions.
One example of our work with major technology companies to provide competitively priced renewable energy netted on an hour-by-hour basis. As we announced earlier this week, we signed a 15-year agreement to provide around-the-clock renewable energy to power Microsoft's data centers in Virginia. Year-to-date, we have signed almost 2 gigawatts of similarly structured contracts with a number of tech companies, integrating a mix of renewable sources and energy storage.
Outside the U.S., we have a similar strategy of focusing on bilateral sales with corporate customers, which has enabled us to sign long-term U.S. dollar-denominated contracts with investment-grade customers. For example, in Brazil, we see demand for more than 25 gigawatts of renewables, providing a significant opportunity to earn mid- to high-teen returns in U.S. dollars, while at the same time, diversifying our Brazilian portfolio of mostly hydro generation. To that end, for the first time ever in Brazil, we are in very advanced negotiations to design a 300-megawatt U.S. dollar-denominated contract with a large multinational corporation for 15 years.
Turning to Slide 5. Our backlog of 9.2 gigawatts is the largest ever with 60% in the U.S. These projects represent one of the main drivers for our growth through 2025 and beyond. With this pace of growth, we are laser-focused on ensuring that we have adequate and reliable supply chain. For several years, we have anticipated a boom in renewable development that could potentially lead to inadequate panel supply. And as such, we took preemptive measures to ensure supply chain flexibility. Despite current challenges in the market, we have non-Chinese panels secured for the majority of our backlog, which is expected to come online through 2024. We have benefited from a number of strategic relationships with various suppliers and a clear advantage stemming from our scale and visibility of our pipeline.
More generally, we continue to proactively manage potential macroeconomic headwinds, including inflation and commodity prices. As part of our efforts to derisk our portfolio over the past decade, we have taken a systematic approach to risk management. In fact, in places where we use fuel, it is mostly a pass-through and, therefore, we have limited exposure to changes in commodity prices. Furthermore, more than 80% of our adjusted pretax contribution is in U.S. dollars, insulating us from fluctuations in foreign currencies.
We not only remain committed to achieving our long-term adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow targets, but we also continue to improve our credit metrics and are on track to achieve BBB ratings from all agencies by 2025.
Now to Slide 6. We continue to benefit from a virtuous cycle with our corporate customers, in which our ability to provide innovative solutions leads to more opportunities for collaboration and more projects. For example, this quarter, we announced a partnership with Google to provide our utility customers cost savings and energy efficiency features as well as opportunities to accelerate their own clean energy goals through Nest thermostats.
Moving to Slide 7. Through AES Next, we integrate new technologies to bring innovation to the industry and work with existing and new customers. AES Next operates as a separate unit within AES where we develop and incubate new businesses, including a combination of strategic investments and internally developed businesses, representing approximately $50 million of gross capital annually.
As I mentioned, the combination of AES Next and our core business creates the optimal environment for growth, whereby we can better create solutions for customers by utilizing our industry insights and operating platforms. One example of this mutually beneficial arrangement is in the combination of renewables plus storage. We first combined solar and storage in 2018 in Hawaii. And today, nearly half of our renewable PPAs have an energy storage component.
Another example is 5B, a prefabricated solar solution company that has patented technology, allowing projects to be built in 1/3 of the time and on half as much land while being resistant to hurricane force winds. We see 5B's technology as a source of current and future competitive advantage for AES, allowing us to build more projects in places where there is a land scarcity, constraints around height or soil disruption or hurricane risk. Likewise, 5B benefits greatly from the ability to grow rapidly on our platform, and we are currently developing projects in the U.S., Puerto Rico, Chile, Panama and India.
I am highlighting the AES Next portion of our business because it is increasingly clear that AES essentially has 2 distinct business models that add value to our shareholders in very different ways. With our core business, we continue to measure our success through growth in adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow as well as PPAs signed. With AES Next, these businesses contribute value creation through their extremely rapid growth in valuation with the potential for future monetization. Nonetheless, they are a drag on AES' earnings during their ramp-up phase.
In 2021, this drag on earnings is expected to be approximately $0.06 per share. We assume these losses from AES Next in our 2021 guidance and our 7% to 9% annualized growth rate through 2025.
Turning to Slide 8. As you know,  last week, Fluence, our energy storage joint venture with Siemens, which began as a small business within AES, became a publicly listed company with a current valuation of around $6 billion.
Similarly, early this year, another AES Next business, Uplight, received evaluation in a private transaction of $1.5 billion. The value of our interest in these 2 businesses is now at least $2.5 billion or $3 per share compared to the book value of our investments of approximately $150 million. In my view, this massive shareholder value creation more than justifies the temporary negative impact to earnings.
In summary, our strategy of being the leading integrator of new technologies on our platform has yielded great results, and we have several other innovations in development under AES Next. As they mature, we will continue to take actions to accelerate their growth and show their value.
With that, I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Steve Coughlin."
35312,1684281081,2455856,"The AES Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Andres, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to participate in my first earnings call as CFO of AES.

It's my pleasure to participate in my first earnings call as CFO of AES. I have been at AES for 14 years and feel very fortunate to work at a company that is transforming the electric sector so profoundly along so many talented people in finance and throughout the company. With our strategic and financial progress to date, AES is well positioned to continue leading this transformation.
In my previous role, I led corporate strategy and financial planning where we developed our plan to get to greater than 50% renewables at least 50% of our business in the U.S. and to reduce our coal share to less than 10% by 2025, all while growing the company 7% to 9%. We are committed to those goals, and I look forward to continue executing toward them.
Before I dive into our financial performance, I want to discuss the adjustment to our accounting that we made this quarter relating to the treatment of the $1 billion in equity units we issued in the first quarter this year.
Our prior guidance assume that the underlying shares would not be included in our fully diluted share count until 2024 upon settlement of the equity units. This approach was in line with industry practice and supported by our interpretation of the accounting literature and our external auditors. However, we are now subject to an updated interpretation of these instruments, and we are adjusting to include these shares in our fully diluted EPS calculations. This adjustment results in an annual impact of roughly $0.07 this year and $0.09 in 2022 and 2023 using a full year of an additional 40 million shares.
It's important to keep in mind that this adjustment has no cash impact and has absolutely no impact on our business or longer-term growth rates as we had included the underlying shares in our projections for 2024 and beyond.
Prior to this adjustment, we had expected to be in the upper half of our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range, but we now expect to be at the low end of the range. 
Now I'd like to cover 2 important topics: our performance during the third quarter and our capital allocation plan.
Turning to Slide 11. You can see the strong performance of our portfolio in this quarter. Adjusted EPS was $0.50 for the quarter versus $0.42 for the comparable quarter last year. This 19% increase was primarily driven by improvements in our operating businesses, new renewables and parent interest savings. These positive drivers were partially offset by lower contributions from South America, largely due to unscheduled outages in Chile.
Third quarter results also reflect an approximate $0.03 quarter-to-date impact from the higher share count due to the inclusion of 40 million additional weighted average shares relating to the equity units that I just mentioned.
Turning to Slide 12. Adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, was $428 million for the quarter, an increase of $97 million versus third quarter of 2020.
I'll cover our results by strategic business unit over the next 4 slides, beginning on Slide 13.
In the US and Utilities SBU, PTC increased $69 million as a result of our continued progress in growing our U.S. footprint. The improvement was largely driven by higher contributions from Southland, which benefited from higher contracted prices, new renewables coming online at AES Clean Energy and higher availability at AES Puerto Rico.
In California, our 2.3 gigawatt Southland legacy portfolio demonstrated its critical importance by continuing to meet the state's pressing energy needs and its transition to a more sustainable carbon-free future. In fact, as you may have heard, last month, the State Water Resource Control Board unanimously approved an extension of our 876-megawatt Redondo Beach facility for 2 years through 2023 to align with our remaining legacy units. If the demand/supply situation remains tight, some of our legacy portfolio could be available to meet California's energy needs beyond 2023 if state energy officials determine a need, although we have not assumed this in our guidance.
As you can see on Slide 14, at our South America SBU, lower PTC was primarily driven by unscheduled outages in Chile due to a blade defect impacting 6 turbines across our fleet that has now largely been resolved. Our third quarter results were also driven by lower hydrology in Brazil.
Before moving to MCAC, I would like to provide an update on 531-megawatt Alto Maipo hydro project, owned by a subsidiary of AES Andes in Chile. Construction continues to go well, and generation is expected to begin in December of this year, with full commercial operation of the plant expected in the first half of 2022, in line with our expectations. Alto Maipo is in discussions with its nonrecourse lenders to restructure its debt to achieve a more sustainable and flexible capital structure for the long term. AES Andes has honored its equity commitment to Alto Maipo and will not be assuming any additional equity obligations. We expect the restructuring to be completed in 2022. And AES Andes already assumed 0 cash flow from Alto Maipo, so we don't see the restructuring impacting our guidance.
Now turning back to our third quarter results on Slide 15. The higher PTC at our MCAC SBU primarily reflects higher LNG sales in Dominican Republic and demand recovery in Panama.
And finally, in Eurasia, as shown on Slide 16, higher results reflect improved operating performance in Bulgaria.
Now to Slide 17. To summarize our performance in the first 3 quarters of the year, we earned adjusted EPS of $1.07 versus $0.96 last year. As I mentioned earlier, in terms of our full year guidance, we are incorporating the $0.07 per share noncash impact from the adjustment for the equity units issued earlier this year. Prior to this adjustment, we had expected to be in the upper half of our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range, but we now expect to come in at the lower end of the range of $1.50 to $1.58. It's important to note that this adjustment does not affect our longer-term growth expectations and has no impact on our cash flow.
With 3 quarters of the year behind us, our year-to-go results will benefit from contributions from new renewables, continued demand recovery across our markets, reduced interest expense and our cost savings programs. These positive drivers are offset by the impact of the higher share count and the dilution from AES Next, as Andres discussed earlier. 
Now turning to our 2021 parent capital allocation on Slide 18. Beginning on the left hand of the slide and consistent with our prior disclosure, we expect approximately $2 billion of discretionary cash this year. We remain confident in our parent free cash flow target midpoint of $800 million and the $100 million from the sale of Itabo, and we received the $1 billion of proceeds from the equity units issued in March.
Moving over to the right-hand side. The uses are largely unchanged from the last quarter with $450 million in returns to our shareholders this year, consisting of our common share dividend and the coupon on the equity units. 
We also continue to expect almost $1.5 billion of investment in our subsidiaries, with about 60% going towards renewables globally. Our investment program continues to be heavily weighted to the U.S. with approximately 70% targeted for our U.S. businesses. The increased focus on U.S. investments will contribute to our goal of growing the proportion of earnings from the U.S. to at least half of our base.
Finally, as I ramp up in my new role, I've had the chance to speak with many of our internal and external stakeholders. It's clear that AES continues to successfully execute on our strategy, and we remain resilient in the face of volatile macroeconomic conditions. Continuing to drive the successful execution and delivering on our financial goals is my top priority. I look forward to getting input from more of our investors and analysts and providing the information you need to understand the great future ahead for AES. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andres."

But as you correctly point out, they are positives, and then we have the drag of the additional shares, and we will be working with that. I'd say overall, we feel we're in an excellent position. We had a very strong quarter and year-to-date.
One of the things I'd like to highlight is that we had a design malfunction in our steam turbines in Chile. And this required them to undergo maintenance at 50,000 hours instead of 100,000 hours. And this happened during the worst drought in Chile's history. So we were short energy when energy prices were high. But nonetheless, if it weren't for the accounting, we would have been well within the mid or upper region of our earnings. So this is the way that our portfolio works.

And looking ahead, we do see -- we have many levers, as Andres said, so we're fully committed to the 7% to 9%. These shares were already incorporated as of 2024. So it has no impact on that longer-term growth rate.
And then looking ahead, we have a number of value-accretive opportunities in the portfolio. So we're in the midst of our planning process at this point, and we'll give 2022 guidance in February.

Now to do that, you really need to be able to model all possible situations in a given area of service, integrating also batteries and different forms of renewable power. So we've been very flexible on that. We're very excited about that, and we see additional opportunities going forward.

So there's a number of companies that have used similar instruments. And in consultation with our auditors, SEC have done a review of the treatment of these types of instruments and has informed our auditors that they see a different interpretation. So although we haven't had direct communications with the SEC, we felt it was most prudent that we go ahead and update the interpretation.

So these have created a lot and a lot of value for our shareholders.
And it's very interesting because there are 2 sides of the business. The AES Next is really a value play, especially during this rapid growth phase because you have to expense a lot of your investments really. But at the same time, they're helping us grow. So when you talk about the structured products that we're selling to corporations, having AES Next and the know-how from there has been extremely helpful.
So as I said, stay tuned, we have others in the works. The most mature probably is 5B. We think 5B has a lot of potential because of what it offers. It offers speed of build. It offers less use of land, and hurricane resistant is very important. Hurricane wind resistant is very important.

Regarding AES Next, the one that's producing the largest drag is Fluence.

And look, the opportunity for Fluence just gotten massive, more massive than even we predicted when I started there. So going out and raising this capital was clearly targeted to go big and go much bigger. And so this -- in some ways, what it does is it increases the near-term dilution deliberately because we're investing to accelerate the scale of the company, and we know that it can be successful if we accelerate. So -- but it's also been significantly increasing the upside when we get out into '24, '25 period.
So putting this capital to work is going to be near-term dilutive, but it's tremendously value accretive.

Before discussing our progress since our last call, I want to introduce our new Chief Financial Officer, Steve Coughlin. Steve has been with AES for 14 years and has served in a variety of roles, including as CEO of Fluence and most recently as Head of both Strategy and Financial Planning.
I am happy to report that we are making excellent progress on our strategic and financial goals and remain on track to deliver on our 7% to 9% annualized growth in adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow through 2025. We had a strong third quarter with adjusted EPS of $0.50, a 19% increase versus the same quarter last year. We expect to deliver on our full year guidance, even with a $0.07 noncash impact from an updated accounting interpretation related to the equity units of a convert we issued earlier this year. Steve will provide more details shortly. 
Today, I will discuss both the growth in our core business as well as the strategy and evolution of our innovation business called AES Next. We see ourselves as the leading integrator of new technologies. The 2 parts of our portfolio are mutually beneficial to one another and enable us to deliver greater total returns to our shareholders. More specifically, and as we have proven, our core business platforms provide the optimal environment for exponentially growing technology start-ups. At the same time, our AES Next businesses provide us with unique capabilities that enable us to offer customers the differentiated product they seek to achieve their sustainability goals.
Turning to Slide 4. I will provide you with an update on our core business, including our growth in renewables and an update on the overall macroeconomic environment. 
Beginning with renewables. We continue to see great momentum in demand overall. As we speak, we have senior members of our team, attending the COP26 Climate Conference in Glasgow, meeting with governments, organizations and potential customers. Since our last call in August, we have signed an additional 1.1 gigawatts of renewable PPAs, bringing our year-to-date total to 4 gigawatts. Additionally, we are in very advanced discussions for another 850 megawatts of wind, solar and energy storage. Based on our current progress, we now expect to sign at least 5 gigawatts this year versus our prior expectations of 4 gigawatts. This represents the largest addition in our history and 66% more than in 2020.
With our pipeline of 38 gigawatts of potential projects, including 10 gigawatts that are ready to bid in the U.S., we are well positioned to capitalize on this substantial opportunity. Our success is a result of our strategy of working with our clients on long-term contracts that provides customized solutions for their specific energy and sustainability goals. As such, almost 90% of our new business has been from bilateral negotiated contracts with corporate customers. This allows us to compete on what we do best: providing differentiated, innovative solutions.
One example of our work with major technology companies to provide competitively priced renewable energy netted on an hour-by-hour basis. As we announced earlier this week, we signed a 15-year agreement to provide around-the-clock renewable energy to power Microsoft's data centers in Virginia. Year-to-date, we have signed almost 2 gigawatts of similarly structured contracts with a number of tech companies, integrating a mix of renewable sources and energy storage.
Outside the U.S., we have a similar strategy of focusing on bilateral sales with corporate customers, which has enabled us to sign long-term U.S. dollar-denominated contracts with investment-grade customers. For example, in Brazil, we see demand for more than 25 gigawatts of renewables, providing a significant opportunity to earn mid- to high-teen returns in U.S. dollars, while at the same time, diversifying our Brazilian portfolio of mostly hydro generation. To that end, for the first time ever in Brazil, we are in very advanced negotiations to design a 300-megawatt U.S. dollar-denominated contract with a large multinational corporation for 15 years.
Turning to Slide 5. Our backlog of 9.2 gigawatts is the largest ever with 60% in the U.S. These projects represent one of the main drivers for our growth through 2025 and beyond. With this pace of growth, we are laser-focused on ensuring that we have adequate and reliable supply chain. For several years, we have anticipated a boom in renewable development that could potentially lead to inadequate panel supply. And as such, we took preemptive measures to ensure supply chain flexibility. Despite current challenges in the market, we have non-Chinese panels secured for the majority of our backlog, which is expected to come online through 2024. We have benefited from a number of strategic relationships with various suppliers and a clear advantage stemming from our scale and visibility of our pipeline.
More generally, we continue to proactively manage potential macroeconomic headwinds, including inflation and commodity prices. As part of our efforts to derisk our portfolio over the past decade, we have taken a systematic approach to risk management. In fact, in places where we use fuel, it is mostly a pass-through and, therefore, we have limited exposure to changes in commodity prices. Furthermore, more than 80% of our adjusted pretax contribution is in U.S. dollars, insulating us from fluctuations in foreign currencies.
We not only remain committed to achieving our long-term adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow targets, but we also continue to improve our credit metrics and are on track to achieve BBB ratings from all agencies by 2025.
Now to Slide 6. We continue to benefit from a virtuous cycle with our corporate customers, in which our ability to provide innovative solutions leads to more opportunities for collaboration and more projects. For example, this quarter, we announced a partnership with Google to provide our utility customers cost savings and energy efficiency features as well as opportunities to accelerate their own clean energy goals through Nest thermostats.
Moving to Slide 7. Through AES Next, we integrate new technologies to bring innovation to the industry and work with existing and new customers. AES Next operates as a separate unit within AES where we develop and incubate new businesses, including a combination of strategic investments and internally developed businesses, representing approximately $50 million of gross capital annually.
As I mentioned, the combination of AES Next and our core business creates the optimal environment for growth, whereby we can better create solutions for customers by utilizing our industry insights and operating platforms. One example of this mutually beneficial arrangement is in the combination of renewables plus storage. We first combined solar and storage in 2018 in Hawaii. And today, nearly half of our renewable PPAs have an energy storage component.
Another example is 5B, a prefabricated solar solution company that has patented technology, allowing projects to be built in 1/3 of the time and on half as much land while being resistant to hurricane force winds. We see 5B's technology as a source of current and future competitive advantage for AES, allowing us to build more projects in places where there is a land scarcity, constraints around height or soil disruption or hurricane risk. Likewise, 5B benefits greatly from the ability to grow rapidly on our platform, and we are currently developing projects in the U.S., Puerto Rico, Chile, Panama and India.
I am highlighting the AES Next portion of our business because it is increasingly clear that AES essentially has 2 distinct business models that add value to our shareholders in very different ways. With our core business, we continue to measure our success through growth in adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow as well as PPAs signed. With AES Next, these businesses contribute value creation through their extremely rapid growth in valuation with the potential for future monetization. Nonetheless, they are a drag on AES' earnings during their ramp-up phase.
In 2021, this drag on earnings is expected to be approximately $0.06 per share. We assume these losses from AES Next in our 2021 guidance and our 7% to 9% annualized growth rate through 2025.
Turning to Slide 8. As you know,  last week, Fluence, our energy storage joint venture with Siemens, which began as a small business within AES, became a publicly listed company with a current valuation of around $6 billion.
Similarly, early this year, another AES Next business, Uplight, received evaluation in a private transaction of $1.5 billion. The value of our interest in these 2 businesses is now at least $2.5 billion or $3 per share compared to the book value of our investments of approximately $150 million. In my view, this massive shareholder value creation more than justifies the temporary negative impact to earnings.
In summary, our strategy of being the leading integrator of new technologies on our platform has yielded great results, and we have several other innovations in development under AES Next. As they mature, we will continue to take actions to accelerate their growth and show their value.
With that, I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Steve Coughlin."

It's my pleasure to participate in my first earnings call as CFO of AES.

It's my pleasure to participate in my first earnings call as CFO of AES. I have been at AES for 14 years and feel very fortunate to work at a company that is transforming the electric sector so profoundly along so many talented people in finance and throughout the company. With our strategic and financial progress to date, AES is well positioned to continue leading this transformation.
In my previous role, I led corporate strategy and financial planning where we developed our plan to get to greater than 50% renewables at least 50% of our business in the U.S. and to reduce our coal share to less than 10% by 2025, all while growing the company 7% to 9%. We are committed to those goals, and I look forward to continue executing toward them.
Before I dive into our financial performance, I want to discuss the adjustment to our accounting that we made this quarter relating to the treatment of the $1 billion in equity units we issued in the first quarter this year.
Our prior guidance assume that the underlying shares would not be included in our fully diluted share count until 2024 upon settlement of the equity units. This approach was in line with industry practice and supported by our interpretation of the accounting literature and our external auditors. However, we are now subject to an updated interpretation of these instruments, and we are adjusting to include these shares in our fully diluted EPS calculations. This adjustment results in an annual impact of roughly $0.07 this year and $0.09 in 2022 and 2023 using a full year of an additional 40 million shares.
It's important to keep in mind that this adjustment has no cash impact and has absolutely no impact on our business or longer-term growth rates as we had included the underlying shares in our projections for 2024 and beyond.
Prior to this adjustment, we had expected to be in the upper half of our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range, but we now expect to be at the low end of the range. 
Now I'd like to cover 2 important topics: our performance during the third quarter and our capital allocation plan.
Turning to Slide 11. You can see the strong performance of our portfolio in this quarter. Adjusted EPS was $0.50 for the quarter versus $0.42 for the comparable quarter last year. This 19% increase was primarily driven by improvements in our operating businesses, new renewables and parent interest savings. These positive drivers were partially offset by lower contributions from South America, largely due to unscheduled outages in Chile.
Third quarter results also reflect an approximate $0.03 quarter-to-date impact from the higher share count due to the inclusion of 40 million additional weighted average shares relating to the equity units that I just mentioned.
Turning to Slide 12. Adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, was $428 million for the quarter, an increase of $97 million versus third quarter of 2020.
I'll cover our results by strategic business unit over the next 4 slides, beginning on Slide 13.
In the US and Utilities SBU, PTC increased $69 million as a result of our continued progress in growing our U.S. footprint. The improvement was largely driven by higher contributions from Southland, which benefited from higher contracted prices, new renewables coming online at AES Clean Energy and higher availability at AES Puerto Rico.
In California, our 2.3 gigawatt Southland legacy portfolio demonstrated its critical importance by continuing to meet the state's pressing energy needs and its transition to a more sustainable carbon-free future. In fact, as you may have heard, last month, the State Water Resource Control Board unanimously approved an extension of our 876-megawatt Redondo Beach facility for 2 years through 2023 to align with our remaining legacy units. If the demand/supply situation remains tight, some of our legacy portfolio could be available to meet California's energy needs beyond 2023 if state energy officials determine a need, although we have not assumed this in our guidance.
As you can see on Slide 14, at our South America SBU, lower PTC was primarily driven by unscheduled outages in Chile due to a blade defect impacting 6 turbines across our fleet that has now largely been resolved. Our third quarter results were also driven by lower hydrology in Brazil.
Before moving to MCAC, I would like to provide an update on 531-megawatt Alto Maipo hydro project, owned by a subsidiary of AES Andes in Chile. Construction continues to go well, and generation is expected to begin in December of this year, with full commercial operation of the plant expected in the first half of 2022, in line with our expectations. Alto Maipo is in discussions with its nonrecourse lenders to restructure its debt to achieve a more sustainable and flexible capital structure for the long term. AES Andes has honored its equity commitment to Alto Maipo and will not be assuming any additional equity obligations. We expect the restructuring to be completed in 2022. And AES Andes already assumed 0 cash flow from Alto Maipo, so we don't see the restructuring impacting our guidance.
Now turning back to our third quarter results on Slide 15. The higher PTC at our MCAC SBU primarily reflects higher LNG sales in Dominican Republic and demand recovery in Panama.
And finally, in Eurasia, as shown on Slide 16, higher results reflect improved operating performance in Bulgaria.
Now to Slide 17. To summarize our performance in the first 3 quarters of the year, we earned adjusted EPS of $1.07 versus $0.96 last year. As I mentioned earlier, in terms of our full year guidance, we are incorporating the $0.07 per share noncash impact from the adjustment for the equity units issued earlier this year. Prior to this adjustment, we had expected to be in the upper half of our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range, but we now expect to come in at the lower end of the range of $1.50 to $1.58. It's important to note that this adjustment does not affect our longer-term growth expectations and has no impact on our cash flow.
With 3 quarters of the year behind us, our year-to-go results will benefit from contributions from new renewables, continued demand recovery across our markets, reduced interest expense and our cost savings programs. These positive drivers are offset by the impact of the higher share count and the dilution from AES Next, as Andres discussed earlier. 
Now turning to our 2021 parent capital allocation on Slide 18. Beginning on the left hand of the slide and consistent with our prior disclosure, we expect approximately $2 billion of discretionary cash this year. We remain confident in our parent free cash flow target midpoint of $800 million and the $100 million from the sale of Itabo, and we received the $1 billion of proceeds from the equity units issued in March.
Moving over to the right-hand side. The uses are largely unchanged from the last quarter with $450 million in returns to our shareholders this year, consisting of our common share dividend and the coupon on the equity units. 
We also continue to expect almost $1.5 billion of investment in our subsidiaries, with about 60% going towards renewables globally. Our investment program continues to be heavily weighted to the U.S. with approximately 70% targeted for our U.S. businesses. The increased focus on U.S. investments will contribute to our goal of growing the proportion of earnings from the U.S. to at least half of our base.
Finally, as I ramp up in my new role, I've had the chance to speak with many of our internal and external stakeholders. It's clear that AES continues to successfully execute on our strategy, and we remain resilient in the face of volatile macroeconomic conditions. Continuing to drive the successful execution and delivering on our financial goals is my top priority. I look forward to getting input from more of our investors and analysts and providing the information you need to understand the great future ahead for AES. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andres."

And this happened during the worst drought in Chile's history. So we were short energy when energy prices were high.

We have said from the beginning when we did the first Google one that this was a product that was -- there was a lot of interest from other large corporate customers.

So the product keeps getting more sophisticated.
Now to do that, you really need to be able to model all possible situations in a given area of service, integrating also batteries and different forms of renewable power. So we've been very flexible on that. We're very excited about that, and we see additional opportunities going forward.
I think as we mentioned, 90% of the deals we have signed in the last year-to-date have been with corporate customers.

So there's a number of companies that have used similar instruments. And in consultation with our auditors, SEC have done a review of the treatment of these types of instruments and has informed our auditors that they see a different interpretation. So although we haven't had direct communications with the SEC, we felt it was most prudent that we go ahead and update the interpretation.
So we're really just taking a prudent course of action here. This conversion was already assumed in the 2024 share count. So it's just an interim impact to the calculation.

So these have created a lot and a lot of value for our shareholders.
And it's very interesting because there are 2 sides of the business. The AES Next is really a value play, especially during this rapid growth phase because you have to expense a lot of your investments really. But at the same time, they're helping us grow. So when you talk about the structured products that we're selling to corporations, having AES Next and the know-how from there has been extremely helpful.
So as I said, stay tuned, we have others in the works. The most mature probably is 5B. We think 5B has a lot of potential because of what it offers. It offers speed of build. It offers less use of land, and hurricane resistant is very important. Hurricane wind resistant is very important.

Regarding AES Next, the one that's producing the largest drag is Fluence.

And look, the opportunity for Fluence just gotten massive, more massive than even we predicted when I started there. So going out and raising this capital was clearly targeted to go big and go much bigger. And so this -- in some ways, what it does is it increases the near-term dilution deliberately because we're investing to accelerate the scale of the company, and we know that it can be successful if we accelerate. So -- but it's also been significantly increasing the upside when we get out into '24, '25 period.
So putting this capital to work is going to be near-term dilutive, but it's tremendously value accretive.
