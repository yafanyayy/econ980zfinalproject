We are pleased with our fourth quarter results as we delivered revenue that was 10% higher than the fourth quarter 2019 and above our guidance range. In addition, book-to-bill was above 1 in the fourth quarter as we saw the in order to grow as expected in the third quarter continued during the fourth quarter and in 2021. We are continuing to benefit from the advantages of our leading-edge products, technology differentiation, and of course, production capabilities and the global footprint. 
We continue to see strong revenue in China, which was significantly higher on a year-over-year basis as volume growth more than offset lower prices in the region. We were also pleased to see a sequential improvement in the revenue in Europe and strong sequential revenue growth in North America in the fourth quarter. Our sales also improved modestly, but continue to be below last year, primarily due to the impact of the economy from COVID-19. We're demonstrating good progress in our core markets, thanks to our technology differentiation and low cost transaction capability. 
In high-power lasers, we delivered strong year-over-year growth in both our rack mounted 1 to 4 kilowatt lasers for the high-volume market and our ultra-high power lasers for leading-edge cutting systems as sales of lasers above 6-kilowatt increased 34% compared to the fourth quarter 2019 and with 56% of total high-power sales. At the high end of the market, we are benefiting from an order volumes for our 20 and 30 kilowatt ultra-high power laser optical heads. These lasers not only enable 50% to 100% faster cutting speeds than our 15 kilowatt devices, but are capable of processing materials with 20 to 50-millimeter or even greater. This improvement in productivity and flexibility, coupled with superior beam parameters -- superior beam parameters, record wall plug efficiency and reliability is driving the replacement of plasma cutting machine as an nonlaser solutions in lower power laser solutions. 
We booked the first order for the new unique ultra-compact rack mounted U series of lasers for low-cost cutting system, and we expect to start for the volume. Not only do these lasers provide extended optical performance, record power volume ratio and full protection against humidity. They are also significantly evaluating cost to manufacturing. 
As a result, we expected this new design to improve gross margin for these products. We continue to focus on growing sales in other applications  outside of our traditional cutting and welding market. But what we our in a way you can welding system and the initial customer response has been extremely positive. We believe this system has a great potential for IPG as it replaces traditional welding products used in metal fabrication like or
The product offers orders of magnitude higher quality and speed with much greater flexibility and ease of use to our customers around the world. In additional, for the first time, the product will simultaneously provide the highest quality pre cleaning and after cleaning of the itself 
We have already sold a number of units in the last few weeks only and believe there are many thousands of customers in the U.S. alone and many tens of thousand worldwide. That could be interesting in this unique products. During the fourth quarter, emerging products and application sales were 28% of total revenue, increasing 22%. We are pleased with the performance of a number of products that are the key to the diversification of our revenue. 
Examples include pulse laser used for cutting and in electric vehicle battery processing as well as for cleaning. Sales of medical lasers and consumable medical fibers, our growth standards solution for and green laser sales for solar cell processing. With we expect several green lasers to continue grow fast as our green pulse laser are enabling significant improvements in solar cell efficiencies. 
In additional, high-power lasers for defense application performed well year-over-year despite the impact of the pandemic ultraviolet and ultrafast pulse lasers into emerging microprocessing applications showed strong growth for 2020. 
Our Adjustable Mode Beam, AMB laser continue to gain traction in the welding industries, most notably in electric vehicle battery volume. And as a result, we received significant products for AMB laser was in Q4. 
Our AMB products offer superior speed and weld quality over competing solutions, thanks to broadest range of beam tunability, which enables spatterless welding. 
The multiple QCW laser for high speed spot welding application brings significant cost savings due to an increase in welding productivity and decrease in electrical consumption. Beyond material processing, we continue to develop new soft tissue medical treatment, mid-infrared lasers for molecular-level resolution online spectroscopy, inspection, sensing and biomedical research applications. 
In addition, we are continuing development of our new generation of [indiscernible] photonic devices for super high-speed and highest volume data processing for telecom many and many other advanced future applications. Furthermore, we're extremely pleased by the growth which we are in application and medical application. 
Research and development has been a driving force behind IPG's structure since company's inception. We spent our 10% of our total revenue on R&D in 2020 and have over 650 people in research and development, including many scientists and engineers, who continue to develop new leading edge solutions for our customers, helping drive efficiency and productivity in operations and making our fiber laser technology the choice in mass production, more than 20 years choice in mass production, nobody can compare cost of this absolutely in quality in other I would like to thank our employees for the strong execution during our fourth quarter despite the continued head in operating environment. 
As a result, the well being of our employees, their families, our customers, our partners and communities we operate and remains our highest priority. With that, I will turn the call over to Eugene Scherbakov."

The impact of COVID-19 on our production capability continues to be minimum and we are focused on ensuring the safety of our employee with social distances and enhanced cleaning and measures in place. Otherwise, we're operating normally. Despite the increase in COVID-19 cases in Northern Hemisphere, this fall and winter, production remained fully operational, and we manage COVID-related absences effectively. We are very pleased with performance of operations during the fourth quarter as production ramp to meet the increase in demand, enabling us to exceed the top end of the guidance range, and report first quarter of year-on-year growth in more than 2 years. 
We're proud of the improvement in underlying gross margin driven by an increase in revenue, product cost reduction and product mix improvement. Total SG&A and R&D expenses were $76 million in the first quarter, and continue to benefit from lower travel and trade show expenses given pandemic related restrictions. As the business activity starts to pick up and some restrictions are lifted and life normalized in the second half of 2021, we would expect our operating expenses to increase as well. We remain committed to supporting our R&D, while controlling the total operating expenses to drive operating leverage to the company. 
We continue to benefit from the reducing of the cost of devices, our vertical integrations and from expenses reduction initiative we undertook in the second half of 2019. Examining our performance by region, revenue in China increased 52% year-over-year, represented approximately 42% of total sales. Demand and order flow in China remained resilient during the quarter and order booked in 2021 prior Chinese New Year have been strong. While we face aggressive competition in the region, we believe that our products have superior performance and reliability and we are seeing the in demand for our ultra-high power lasers. 
And Europe, while revenue decreased 5% year-over-year due to the effect of COVID-19, it did grow sequentially. In addition, in Europe, order flow continued to get better despite the increase in restriction in Europe due to lockdowns. Similar revenue in North America decreased 11% year-over-year, but grew 37% of sequential basis, is a good improvement in material processing sales for lasers and systems and year-over-year growth in medical and advanced applications. North America booking continue to be strong even relative to expansion of order flow in Q3 2020. 
Sales in Japan decreased 29% year-over-year, while economy in the region continues to be negatively impacted by COVID-19. Some regional macroeconomic indicators have improved in the recent months. Sales to the rest of Asia increased 3% year-over-year, continue to recover from the second quarter and also benefit from shipment of green lasers to renewable energy. Sales in decreased 2% year-over-year and grew 21% sequentially. 
Economic indicators continue to show improvement from significant contraction early in the year. And this is one factor behind the [indiscernible] of our business. In addition, it seems that there is some optimism for improving investment cycle driven by equipment upgrades related to requirements to the flexible processing, automation and energy efficiency. Our leading-edge fiber laser technology offers significant productivity gains, electrical efficiency and lower cost of or the other lasers and non laser tools. An increasing focus on the environmental impact and commitment to the net 0 emissions for a large industrial manufacturer is creating additional opportunity for our lasers and bodes well for our long-term growth objective. 
We're already starting to see it with electrical vehicle and electrical vehicle battery production and are likely to see other industries. We believe that efficiency is likely to become a more meaningful driver in processes that energy intensive, such as plasma cutting or processes. Despite the challenge in operation environment that we faced in year 2020 due to the COVID-19, we believe that we are well positioned as we enter year 2021. In addition, we continue to believe that the breadth and depth of our product offering, our large and diverse advanced materials  and component and technology platform, our efficient R&D model, our strong balance sheet and free cash flow provide us sample flexibility and respond to business disruptions. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Tim to discuss financial highlights in the quarter."

Revenue in the fourth quarter was $337 million, and increased 10% year-over-year, driven by growth from most of our key product lines. Revenue from materials processing applications increased 10% year-over-year and revenue from other applications increased 12%. Sales of high-power CW lasers increased 17% and and represented approximately 55% of total revenue. Sales of ultra-high power lasers above 6 kilowatts represented 56% of total high-power CW laser sales. Pulse laser sales increased 55% year-over-year, with strong growth driven by our high-power nanosecond pulse lasers used in EV battery manufacturing, green pulse lasers used in solar cell manufacturing as well as higher sales of our new UV and ultrafast pulse lasers, which were partially offset by lower sales of low power pulse lasers for marking applications. 
Systems sales decreased 20% year-over-year due to COVID-19, but did improve sequentially. Medium power laser sales increased 25% as there was some recovery in additive manufacturing and other fine processing applications. QCW laser sales decreased 16% year-over-year due to lower sales for aerospace drilling applications. Other product sales decreased 11% year-over-year primarily due to lower telecom sales. Q4 gross margin was 44%, which increased 310 basis points year-over-year. The additional inventory charge reduced gross margin by 410 basis points. Excluding this impact, gross margin benefited from lower cost of products and the decrease in unabsorbed costs as a percentage of sales as compared to the year ago period. The additional inventory charge of $14 million was related to optical components that have been replaced by components with better performance. Fourth quarter GAAP operating income was $65 million and operating margin was 19%. 
During the quarter, we recognized a foreign exchange loss of $5 million, primarily related to the depreciation of the U.S. dollar versus the euro. Q4 net income was $49 million or $0.92 per diluted share. The additional inventory charge and foreign exchange loss reduced EPS by $0.27. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 24%. If exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar had been the same as 1 year ago, we would have expected revenue to be $12 million lower and gross profit to be $8 million lower. 
We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.4 billion and total debt of $38 million. Strong operational execution resulted in cash provided by operations of $85 million during the quarter. Capital expenditures were $26 million in the fourth quarter. We expect 2021 capital expenditures will be in the range of $150 million to $160 million for the full year. Total capital expenditures in 2020 was significantly below our initial budget as we delayed some projects and some of these projects are now rescheduled for 2021. 
2021 CapEx includes facilities and equipment expenditure for production, R&D, and sales activity to support our future growth. During the quarter, we did not repurchase any shares. In total, fourth quarter book-to-bill was above 1, and we were pleased with order flow across all of our main geographic regions. Geographically, most areas continue to show improvement with the only area that remains weak being Japan. For the first quarter of 2021, IPG expects revenue of $310 million to $340 million. Company expects the first quarter tax rate to be approximately 25%. 
IPG anticipates delivering earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.90 to $1.20, with 53.2 million basic common shares outstanding and 53.9 million diluted common shares outstanding. The improvement in macroeconomic indicators is now more broad-based, and if sustained, gives us optimism for 2021. However, we're a little cautious given the resurgence of COVID-19 in Europe and North America as well as the uncertainty surrounding vaccination rollout and return to normalcy is unclear at this time. These uncertainties continue to make forecasting our business challenging in the medium term, and our first quarter guidance remains subject to significant uncertainties, including the impact on the global business environment and expected recovery from COVID-19, economic trends, growth from emerging product revenue, competition and the lack of long-term binding order commitments. 
That said, we continue to benefit from near-term growth opportunities in ultra-high power cutting, electric vehicle battery processing, renewable energy, microprocessing, medical procedures and advanced applications. We believe the strides we are making in higher power products within our core materials processing business and new solutions are enhancing our competitive position. As discussed in the safe harbor passage of today's earnings press release, actual results may differ from our guidance due to factors, including, but not limited to, goodwill and other impairment charges, product demand, order cancellation and delays, competition, tariffs, trade policies, health epidemics, and general economic conditions. 
Our guidance is based upon current market conditions and expectations, assumes exchange rates referenced in our earnings press release and is subject to risks outlined in the company's reports with the SEC. With that, Valentin, Eugene and I will be happy to take your questions."

So except for your last comment, John, I think talking about puts and takes, there were a number of them articulated in the script. First of all, the continuing shift to higher power lasers for cutting applications, a lot of new product introductions. We're very optimistic about the handheld welder and growth in revenue from that. All of our emerging products in Q4 performed really exceptionally well across a pretty broad portfolio of items that are starting to drive incremental growth. So whether it's the green lasers, the high-power nanosecond pulse lasers for EV, some increasing traction for Ultrafast and UV. Medicals performed very well during the whole course of the year with the lithotripsy application. the newer product introductions, the multichannel QCW for displacing YAG lasers in spot welding. We had good orders for AMB. So we continue to see traction and momentum across what is now a pretty broad-based and diverse set of products and applications, and we continue to see improvement in -- we referenced again some of the key macroeconomic indicators that we follow. Certainly this year looks like it could be set up for being significantly better than the last 2 years we've been through. I mean, the key is we'll be to get out of some of the volatility that we've seen that sometimes impacted the second half of a year has happened in 2019 or has resulted in a slow start to the year as the pandemic did last year. So the main target is to get out of more of the volatility and get to sort of consistent year-over-year growth on a quarterly business, and we've got significant drivers for that."

And on  on gross margin, we've got other benefits coming through from some of the product mix as we continue to grow revenue, better absorption of fixed costs. And then, for example, the ultra compact laser starting to generate more meaningful revenue, there's a meaningful improvement in gross margin effect from that. And then even taking the design changes on the ultra compact and rolling them into higher power lasers up to, I think, 7 or 8-kilowatts up to 8-kilowatts not going to be used in.

The first is we're not going to make a comment on the transaction and the bidding war that's going on out there. I think the comment is really to focus on where IPG strengths are in not only the core industrial markets, but also in a lot of these emerging product offerings. So in our core industrial markets, none of the parties that are involved in the process that is ongoing at the moment, really have a core strength and capability where IPG's core strength and capability is. So we don't -- we view this as being separate from our core strategies and capabilities. In addition to that, we've got a lot of emerging product development in areas that we've talked about the -- driving our growth with inherent advantages around the products that we have. So whoever the competitor is, IPG's fiber laser technology is unique in very many different ways and we have this fundamental strength that comes from the vertical integration, the speed to development, the ability to get cost out. And as you can see from an increasingly diverse product portfolio. I think the main point that we make on this is that we get a significantly higher rate of return on our internal R&D and making limited very specific acquisitions that relate to our ability to leverage our own technology. So we don't view ourselves as being a consolidator in the industry. With regard to some of the other trends, I think, yes, they're perfectly apparent, right, the flexibility, the automation, the increasing acceptance of lasers across many different applications and technologies, flexibility, we call out, for example, energy is becoming perhaps more fundamentally a driver for IPG. We're the only company that has a electrical efficiency approaching 50%. Nobody else is close to us on that. So you really have to, I think, look into some of the very specific benefits that we have rather than an advantage we have, rather than look at what may or may not be a larger scale company that will have competitive advantages against us, we don't think that they will. Finally, I don't -- beyond this, there has already been quite a lot of consolidation within the industry. So there's a limited number of large targets that are left out there. The largest other competitor that's out there for us is actually a private German company. So consolidation has already taken place a bit more meaningfully to varying degrees of success, I'd say."

So sometimes, when you see an improving demand environment, some of the antics of the Chinese competitors are not so extreme. The other part of this that we've talked about is that we're being more disciplined around pricing. We believe that the value of the laser technology is still extremely high. And that is the current pricing in the market. We're already displacing many existing laser and non-laser technologies and more fundamental changes in pricing to drive that adoption are not required. So it's been good to see a bit more stability. You've obviously also had some benefit going to higher power levels for cutting applications, where we have a competitive advantage. And then outside of that, the emerging products, for example, even high-power nanosecond pulse lasers are very, almost exclusive to IPG, where we have a good ASP for some of those applications.

We are pleased with our fourth quarter results as we delivered revenue that was 10% higher than the fourth quarter 2019 and above our guidance range. In addition, book-to-bill was above 1 in the fourth quarter as we saw the traction in order flow that had started in the third quarter continue during the fourth quarter and into 2021. We're continuing to benefit from the advantages of our leading-edge products, technology differentiation, low-cost production capabilities and the global footprint.
We continue to see strong revenue in China, which was significantly higher on a year-over-year basis as volume growth more than offset lower selling prices in the region. We were also pleased to see a sequential improvement in revenue in Europe and strong sequential revenue growth in North America in the fourth quarter. Our systems sales also improved modestly, but continue to be below last year, primarily due to the impact on the economy from COVID-19.
We're demonstrating good progress in our core markets, thanks to our technology differentiation and low-cost production capabilities. In high-power lasers, we delivered strong year-over-year growth in both our rack mounted 1 to 4 kilowatt lasers for the high-volume market and our ultra-high power lasers for leading-edge cutting systems as sales of lasers above 6 kilowatt increased 34% compared to the fourth quarter 2019 and were 56% of total high-power sales.
At the high end of the market, we are benefiting from an increase in order volumes for our 20 and 30 kilowatt ultra-high power lasers and optical heads. These lasers not only enable 50% to 100% faster cutting speeds than our 15 kilowatt devices, but are capable of processing materials with 20 to 50 millimeters thickness or even greater. This improvement in productivity and flexibility, coupled with superior beam parameters, record wall plug efficiency and reliability is driving the replacement of plasma cutting machine, other nonlaser solutions and lower power laser solutions.
We booked the first orders for the new unique ultra-compact rack mounted U series of lasers for low-cost cutting systems, and we expect to start shipping them shortly in volume. Not only do these lasers provide extended optical performance, record power-to-volume ratio and full protection against humidity, they are also significantly evaluating cost to manufacture. As a result, we expect this new design to improve gross margin for these products. We continue to focus on growing sales in other applications that are outside of our traditional cutting and welding markets.
Last quarter, we launched our revolutionary and innovative handheld laser welding system and the initial customer response has been extremely positive. We believe this system has a great potential for IPG as it replaces traditional handheld welding products used in metal fabrication like TIG or MIG. The product offers orders of magnitude higher welding quality and speed with much greater precision, flexibility and ease of use to our customers around the world. In addition, for the first time, the product will simultaneously provide the highest quality precleaning and after-cleaning of the weld surface and weld itself, respectively. We have already sold a number of units in the last few weeks only and believe that there are many thousands of customers in the U.S. alone and many tens of thousand worldwide that could be interesting in this unique product.
During the fourth quarter, emerging products and application sales were 28% of total revenue, increasing 22%. We are pleased with the performance of a number of products that are the key to the diversification of our revenue. Examples include high-power nanosecond pulsed lasers used for foil cutting and cleaning in electric vehicle battery processing as well as for ablation and cleaning; sales of medical lasers and consumable medical fibers, our gold standard thulium laser solution for urology; and green laser sales for solar cell processing. With record backlog, we expect sales of green lasers to continue to grow fast as our green pulsed lasers are enabling significant improvements in solar cell efficiencies. In addition, high-power lasers for defense application performed well year-over-year. Despite the impact of the pandemic, ultraviolet and ultrafast pulsed lasers into emerging microprocessing applications showed strong growth for 2020.
Our Adjustable Mode Beam, AMB, lasers continue to gain traction in the welding industry, most notably in electric vehicle battery welding. And as a result, we received significant orders for AMB lasers in Q4. Our AMB products offer superior speed and weld quality over competing solutions, thanks to broadest range of beam tunability, which enables spatterless welding.
The multichannel QCW laser for high-speed spot welding application brings significant cost savings due to an increase in welding productivity and decrease in electrical consumption. Beyond material processing, we continue to develop new soft tissue medical treatment, mid-infrared lasers for molecular-level resolution online spectroscopy, inspection, sensing and biomedical research applications. In addition, we are continuing development of our new generation of analog and coherent digital silicon photonic devices for super high speed and highest volume data processing for telecom, data telecom, many -- and many other advanced future applications. Furthermore, we were extremely pleased by the growth we saw in advanced applications and medical applications.
Research and development has been a driving force behind IPG's structure since the company's inception. We spent over 10% of our total revenue on R&D in 2020 and have over 650 people in research and development, including many scientists and engineers who continue to develop new leading-edge solutions for our customers, helping drive efficiency and productivity in their operations and making our fiber laser technology the tool of choice in mass production -- more than 20 years tool of choice in mass production, nobody can compare cost of this absolutely in quality and others.
I would like to thank our employees for their strong execution during our fourth quarter despite the continuing challenging operating environment. As a result, the well-being of our employees, their families, our customers, our partners and communities we operate in remains our highest priority.
With that, I will turn the call over to Eugene Scherbakov."

The impact of COVID-19 on our production capability continues to be minimal and we are focused on ensuring the safety of our employees with social distancing and enhanced cleaning and filtration measures in place. Otherwise, we're operating normally.
Despite the increase in COVID-19 cases in Northern Hemisphere with this fall and winter, production remained fully operational and we managed COVID-related absences effectively.
We are very pleased with performance of operations during the fourth quarter as production ramped to meet the increase in demand, enabling us to exceed the top end of our guidance range, and report first quarter of year-on-year growth in more than 2 years.
We're proud of the improvement in underlying gross margin driven by an increase in revenue, product cost reduction and product mix improvement. Total SG&A and R&D expenses were $76 million in the fourth quarter and continue to benefit from lower travel and trade show expenses given pandemic-related restrictions. As the business activities start to pick up and some restrictions are lifted and life normalizes in the second half of 2021, we would expect our operating expenses to increase as well. We remain committed to supporting our R&D, while controlling the total operating expenses to drive operating leverage for the company. We continue to benefit from the reducing of the cost of devices, our vertical integrations and from expenses reduction initiative we undertook in the second half of 2019.
Examining our performance by region, revenue in China increased 52% year-over-year, represented approximately 42% of total sales. Demand and order flow in China remained resilient during the quarter and order booked in 2021 prior to Chinese New Year have been strong. While we face aggressive competition in the region, we believe that our products have superior performance and reliability and we are seeing the strong growth in demand for our ultra-high power lasers.
In Europe, while revenue decreased 5% year-over-year due to the effect of COVID-19, it did grow sequentially. In addition, in Europe, order flow continued to get better despite the increase in restriction in Europe due to lockdowns. Similarly, revenue in North America decreased 11% year-over-year, but grew 37% on a sequential basis with a good improvement in material processing sales for lasers and systems and year-over-year growth in medical and advanced applications. North American bookings continued to be strong even relative to expansion of order flow in Q3 2020.
Sales in Japan decreased 29% year-over-year. While economy in the region continues to be negatively impacted by COVID-19, some regional macroeconomic indicators have improved in the recent months. Sales to the rest of Asia increased 3% year-over-year, continuing to recover from the second quarter trough, and also benefited from shipment of green lasers for renewable energy. Sales in Turkey decreased 2% year-over-year and grew 21% sequentially.
Economic indicators continue to show improvement from significant contraction earlier in the year, and this is one factor behind the improving direction of our business. In addition, it seems that there is some optimism for an improving investment cycle driven by equipment upgrades related to requirements for the flexible processing, automation and energy efficiency.
Our leading-edge fiber laser technology offers significant productivity gains, electrical efficiency and lower cost of ownership over other lasers and nonlaser tools. An increasing focus on the environmental impact and commitment to the net-zero emissions for a large industrial manufacturers is creating additional opportunity for our lasers and bodes well for our long-term growth objective.
We're already starting to see it with electrical vehicle and electrical vehicle battery production and are likely to see it with other industries. We believe that efficiency is likely to become a more meaningful driver in displacing processes that are energy intensive, such as plasma cutting or legacy welding processes. Despite the challenging operating environment that we faced in year 2020 due to the COVID-19, we believe that we are well positioned as we enter year 2021. In addition, we continue to believe that the breadth and depth of our product offering, our vast and diversity of advanced materials and components technology platform, our efficient R&D model, our strong balance sheet and free cash flow provide us ample flexibility and respond to business disruptions.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tim to discuss financial highlights in the quarter."

Revenue in the fourth quarter was $337 million and increased 10% year-over-year, driven by growth from most of our key product lines. Revenue from materials processing applications increased 10% year-over-year and revenue from other applications increased 12%. Sales of high-power CW lasers increased 17% and represented approximately 55% of total revenue. Sales of ultra-high power lasers above 6 kilowatts represented 56% of total high-power CW laser sales. Pulsed laser sales increased 55% year-over-year, with strong growth driven by our high-power nanosecond pulsed lasers used in EV battery manufacturing, green pulsed lasers used in solar cell manufacturing as well as higher sales of our new UV and ultrafast pulsed lasers, which were partially offset by lower sales of low-power pulsed lasers for marking applications.
Systems sales decreased 20% year-over-year due to COVID-19, but did improve sequentially. Medium power laser sales increased 25% as there was some recovery in additive manufacturing and other fine processing applications. QCW laser sales decreased 16% year-over-year due to lower sales for aerospace drilling applications. Other product sales decreased 11% year-over-year primarily due to lower telecom sales.
Q4 gross margin was 44%, which increased 310 basis points year-over-year. The additional inventory charge reduced gross margin by 410 basis points. Excluding this impact, gross margin benefited from lower cost of products and a decrease in unabsorbed costs as a percentage of sales as compared to the year ago period. The additional inventory charge of $14 million was related to optical components that have been replaced by components with better performance.
Fourth quarter GAAP operating income was $65 million and operating margin was 19%. During the quarter, we recognized a foreign exchange loss of $5 million, primarily related to the depreciation of the U.S. dollar versus the euro. Q4 net income was $49 million or $0.92 per diluted share. The additional inventory charge and foreign exchange loss reduced EPS by $0.27. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 24%.
If exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar had been the same as 1 year ago, we would have expected revenue to be $12 million lower and gross profit to be $8 million lower.
We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.4 billion and total debt of $38 million. Strong operational execution resulted in cash provided by operations of $85 million during the quarter.
Capital expenditures were $26 million in the fourth quarter. We expect 2021 capital expenditures will be in the range of $150 million to $160 million for the full year. Total capital expenditures in 2020 were significantly below our initial budget as we delayed some projects and some of these projects are now rescheduled for 2021. 2021 CapEx includes facilities and equipment expenditure for production, R&D and sales activity to support our future growth.
During the quarter, we did not repurchase any shares. In total, fourth quarter book-to-bill was above 1, and we were pleased with order flow across all of our main geographic regions. Geographically, most areas continue to show improvement with the only area that remains weak being Japan.
For the first quarter of 2021, IPG expects revenue of $310 million to $340 million. Company expects the first quarter tax rate to be approximately 25%. IPG anticipates delivering earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.90 to $1.20, with 53.2 million basic common shares outstanding and 53.9 million diluted common shares outstanding.
The improvement in macroeconomic indicators is now more broad-based and, if sustained, gives us optimism for 2021. However, we're a little cautious given the resurgence of COVID-19 in Europe and North America as well as the uncertainty surrounding vaccination rollout and return to normalcy is unclear at this time. These uncertainties continue to make forecasting our business challenging in the medium term. And our first quarter guidance remains subject to significant uncertainties, including the impact on the global business environment and expected recovery from COVID-19, economic trends, growth from emerging product revenue, competition and the lack of long-term binding order commitments.
That said, we continue to benefit from near-term growth opportunities in ultra-high power cutting, electric vehicle battery processing, renewable energy, microprocessing, medical procedures and advanced applications. We believe the strides we are making in higher power products within our core materials processing business and new solutions are enhancing our competitive position.
As discussed in the safe harbor passage of today's earnings press release, actual results may differ from our guidance due to factors, including, but not limited to, goodwill and other impairment charges, product demand, order cancellation and delays, competition, tariffs, trade policies, health epidemics and general economic conditions. Our guidance is based upon current market conditions and expectations, assumes exchange rates referenced in our earnings press release and is subject to risks outlined in the company's reports with the SEC.

So except for your last comment, John, I think talking about puts and takes, there were a number of them articulated in the script. First of all, the continuing shift to higher power lasers for cutting applications, a lot of new product introductions. We're very optimistic about the handheld welder and growth in revenue from that.
All of our emerging products in Q4 performed really exceptionally well across a pretty broad portfolio of items that are starting to drive incremental growth. So whether it's the green lasers, the high-power nanosecond pulse lasers for EV, some increasing traction for ultrafast and UV. Medicals performed very well during the whole course of the year with the lithotripsy application. Other newer product introductions, the multichannel QCW for displacing YAG lasers in spot welding. We had good orders for AMB.
So we continue to see traction and momentum across what is now a pretty broad-based and diverse set of products and applications, and we continue to see improvement in -- we referenced again some of the key macroeconomic indicators that we follow. Certainly this year looks like it could be set up for being significantly better than the last 2 years we've been through. I mean the key issue will be to get out of some of the volatility that we've seen that sometimes impacted the second half of a year as happened in 2019 or as resulted in a slow start to the year as the pandemic did last year. So the main target is to get out of more of the volatility and get to sort of consistent year-over-year growth on a quarterly business, and we've got significant drivers for that."

We've -- during the course of the year, not just in Q4, given some of the volatility related to the pandemic, we have had significant inventory provisions and charges. And the last -- the final charge in the end of the quarter, I think, positions us well for a more normalized operating position going forward. So I think we've got a good start to the year in that context as well.
And on the other side on gross margin, we've got other benefits coming through from some of the product mix as we continue to grow revenue, better absorption of fixed costs and then, for example, the ultra compact laser starting to generate more meaningful revenue, there's a meaningful improvement in gross margin we expect from that. And then even taking the design changes on the ultra compact and rolling them into higher power lasers up to, I think, 7 or 8 kilowatts -- up to 8 kilowatts not going to be used in.

There's the growth in some of the emerging products as well that are not just strong in China, but are strong elsewhere.
So totally, we expect more of an even contribution and a rather less China-centric focus perhaps on revenue for the year.

Let's imagine only speed of welding. Speed of welding increased 6 to 7x -- 6 or 7x quality of welding, much, much higher than with regular, but also simultaneously clean -- immediately clean surface and pre-welding and after-welding. Now with TIG and MIG regular, they have to use chemicals then to clean this, in any case, quality of final surface, not were very sufficient. Now they don't need to make [indiscernible] and thus for one time put by laser beam in additional mode operation the same way the beam [indiscernible].

The first is we're not going to make a comment on the transaction and the bidding war that's going on out there. I think the comment is really to focus on where IPG strengths are in not only the core industrial markets, but also in a lot of these emerging product offerings. So in our core industrial markets, none of the parties that are involved in the process that is ongoing at the moment, really have any core strength and capability where IPG's core strength and capability is.
So we don't -- we view this as being separate from our core strategies and capabilities. In addition to that, we've got a lot of emerging product development in areas that we've talked about the -- driving our growth with inherent advantages around the products that we have. So whoever the competitor is, IPG's fiber laser technology is unique in very many different ways and we have this fundamental strength that comes from the vertical integration, the speed to development, the ability to get cost out. And as you can see from an increasingly diverse product portfolio.
I think the main point that we make on this is that we get a significantly higher rate of return on our internal R&D and making limited, very specific acquisitions that relate to our ability to leverage our own technology. So we don't view ourselves as being a consolidator in the industry.
With regard to some of the other trends, I think, yes, they're perfectly apparent, right, the flexibility, the automation, the increasing acceptance of lasers across many different applications and technologies, flexibility, we call out, for example, energy is becoming perhaps more fundamentally a driver for IPG. We're the only company that has an electrical efficiency approaching 50%. Nobody else is close to us on that. So you really have to, I think, look into some of the very specific benefits that we have rather than an advantage we have, rather than look at what may or may not be a larger scale company that will have competitive advantages against us, we don't think that they will.
Finally, I don't -- beyond this, there has already been quite a lot of consolidation within the industry. So there's a limited number of large targets that are left out there. The largest other competitor that's out there for us is actually a private German company. So consolidation has already taken place a bit more meaningfully to varying degrees of success, I'd say."

The other part of this that we've talked about is that we're being more disciplined around pricing. We believe that the value of the laser technology is still extremely high. And that is the current pricing in the market. We're already displacing many existing laser and nonlaser technologies. And more fundamental changes in pricing to drive that adoption are not required.
So it's been good to see a bit more stability. You've obviously also had some benefit going to higher power levels for cutting applications, where we have competitive advantage.

We are pleased with our fourth quarter results as we delivered revenue that was 10% higher than the fourth quarter 2019 and above our guidance range. In addition, book-to-bill was above 1 in the fourth quarter as we saw the traction in order flow that had started in the third quarter continue during the fourth quarter and into 2021. We're continuing to benefit from the advantages of our leading-edge products, technology differentiation, low-cost production capabilities and the global footprint.
We continue to see strong revenue in China, which was significantly higher on a year-over-year basis as volume growth more than offset lower selling prices in the region. We were also pleased to see a sequential improvement in revenue in Europe and strong sequential revenue growth in North America in the fourth quarter. Our systems sales also improved modestly, but continue to be below last year, primarily due to the impact on the economy from COVID-19.
We're demonstrating good progress in our core markets, thanks to our technology differentiation and low-cost production capabilities. In high-power lasers, we delivered strong year-over-year growth in both our rack mounted 1 to 4 kilowatt lasers for the high-volume market and our ultra-high power lasers for leading-edge cutting systems as sales of lasers above 6 kilowatt increased 34% compared to the fourth quarter 2019 and were 56% of total high-power sales.
At the high end of the market, we are benefiting from an increase in order volumes for our 20 and 30 kilowatt ultra-high power lasers and optical heads. These lasers not only enable 50% to 100% faster cutting speeds than our 15 kilowatt devices, but are capable of processing materials with 20 to 50 millimeters thickness or even greater. This improvement in productivity and flexibility, coupled with superior beam parameters, record wall plug efficiency and reliability is driving the replacement of plasma cutting machine, other nonlaser solutions and lower power laser solutions.
We booked the first orders for the new unique ultra-compact rack mounted U series of lasers for low-cost cutting systems, and we expect to start shipping them shortly in volume. Not only do these lasers provide extended optical performance, record power-to-volume ratio and full protection against humidity, they are also significantly evaluating cost to manufacture. As a result, we expect this new design to improve gross margin for these products. We continue to focus on growing sales in other applications that are outside of our traditional cutting and welding markets.
Last quarter, we launched our revolutionary and innovative handheld laser welding system and the initial customer response has been extremely positive. We believe this system has a great potential for IPG as it replaces traditional handheld welding products used in metal fabrication like TIG or MIG. The product offers orders of magnitude higher welding quality and speed with much greater precision, flexibility and ease of use to our customers around the world. In addition, for the first time, the product will simultaneously provide the highest quality precleaning and after-cleaning of the weld surface and weld itself, respectively. We have already sold a number of units in the last few weeks only and believe that there are many thousands of customers in the U.S. alone and many tens of thousand worldwide that could be interesting in this unique product.
During the fourth quarter, emerging products and application sales were 28% of total revenue, increasing 22%. We are pleased with the performance of a number of products that are the key to the diversification of our revenue. Examples include high-power nanosecond pulsed lasers used for foil cutting and cleaning in electric vehicle battery processing as well as for ablation and cleaning; sales of medical lasers and consumable medical fibers, our gold standard thulium laser solution for urology; and green laser sales for solar cell processing. With record backlog, we expect sales of green lasers to continue to grow fast as our green pulsed lasers are enabling significant improvements in solar cell efficiencies. In addition, high-power lasers for defense application performed well year-over-year. Despite the impact of the pandemic, ultraviolet and ultrafast pulsed lasers into emerging microprocessing applications showed strong growth for 2020.
Our Adjustable Mode Beam, AMB, lasers continue to gain traction in the welding industry, most notably in electric vehicle battery welding. And as a result, we received significant orders for AMB lasers in Q4. Our AMB products offer superior speed and weld quality over competing solutions, thanks to broadest range of beam tunability, which enables spatterless welding.
The multichannel QCW laser for high-speed spot welding application brings significant cost savings due to an increase in welding productivity and decrease in electrical consumption. Beyond material processing, we continue to develop new soft tissue medical treatment, mid-infrared lasers for molecular-level resolution online spectroscopy, inspection, sensing and biomedical research applications. In addition, we are continuing development of our new generation of analog and coherent digital silicon photonic devices for super high speed and highest volume data processing for telecom, data telecom, many -- and many other advanced future applications. Furthermore, we were extremely pleased by the growth we saw in advanced applications and medical applications.
Research and development has been a driving force behind IPG's structure since the company's inception. We spent over 10% of our total revenue on R&D in 2020 and have over 650 people in research and development, including many scientists and engineers who continue to develop new leading-edge solutions for our customers, helping drive efficiency and productivity in their operations and making our fiber laser technology the tool of choice in mass production -- more than 20 years tool of choice in mass production, nobody can compare cost of this absolutely in quality and others.
I would like to thank our employees for their strong execution during our fourth quarter despite the continuing challenging operating environment. As a result, the well-being of our employees, their families, our customers, our partners and communities we operate in remains our highest priority.
With that, I will turn the call over to Eugene Scherbakov."

We are very pleased with performance of operations during the fourth quarter as production ramped to meet the increase in demand, enabling us to exceed the top end of our guidance range, and report first quarter of year-on-year growth in more than 2 years.
We're proud of the improvement in underlying gross margin driven by an increase in revenue, product cost reduction and product mix improvement. Total SG&A and R&D expenses were $76 million in the fourth quarter and continue to benefit from lower travel and trade show expenses given pandemic-related restrictions. As the business activities start to pick up and some restrictions are lifted and life normalizes in the second half of 2021, we would expect our operating expenses to increase as well. We remain committed to supporting our R&D, while controlling the total operating expenses to drive operating leverage for the company. We continue to benefit from the reducing of the cost of devices, our vertical integrations and from expenses reduction initiative we undertook in the second half of 2019.
Examining our performance by region, revenue in China increased 52% year-over-year, represented approximately 42% of total sales. Demand and order flow in China remained resilient during the quarter and order booked in 2021 prior to Chinese New Year have been strong. While we face aggressive competition in the region, we believe that our products have superior performance and reliability and we are seeing the strong growth in demand for our ultra-high power lasers.
In Europe, while revenue decreased 5% year-over-year due to the effect of COVID-19, it did grow sequentially. In addition, in Europe, order flow continued to get better despite the increase in restriction in Europe due to lockdowns. Similarly, revenue in North America decreased 11% year-over-year, but grew 37% on a sequential basis with a good improvement in material processing sales for lasers and systems and year-over-year growth in medical and advanced applications. North American bookings continued to be strong even relative to expansion of order flow in Q3 2020.
Sales in Japan decreased 29% year-over-year. While economy in the region continues to be negatively impacted by COVID-19, some regional macroeconomic indicators have improved in the recent months. Sales to the rest of Asia increased 3% year-over-year, continuing to recover from the second quarter trough, and also benefited from shipment of green lasers for renewable energy. Sales in Turkey decreased 2% year-over-year and grew 21% sequentially.
Economic indicators continue to show improvement from significant contraction earlier in the year, and this is one factor behind the improving direction of our business. In addition, it seems that there is some optimism for an improving investment cycle driven by equipment upgrades related to requirements for the flexible processing, automation and energy efficiency.
Our leading-edge fiber laser technology offers significant productivity gains, electrical efficiency and lower cost of ownership over other lasers and nonlaser tools. An increasing focus on the environmental impact and commitment to the net-zero emissions for a large industrial manufacturers is creating additional opportunity for our lasers and bodes well for our long-term growth objective.
We're already starting to see it with electrical vehicle and electrical vehicle battery production and are likely to see it with other industries. We believe that efficiency is likely to become a more meaningful driver in displacing processes that are energy intensive, such as plasma cutting or legacy welding processes. Despite the challenging operating environment that we faced in year 2020 due to the COVID-19, we believe that we are well positioned as we enter year 2021. In addition, we continue to believe that the breadth and depth of our product offering, our vast and diversity of advanced materials and components technology platform, our efficient R&D model, our strong balance sheet and free cash flow provide us ample flexibility and respond to business disruptions.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tim to discuss financial highlights in the quarter."

Revenue in the fourth quarter was $337 million and increased 10% year-over-year, driven by growth from most of our key product lines. Revenue from materials processing applications increased 10% year-over-year and revenue from other applications increased 12%. Sales of high-power CW lasers increased 17% and represented approximately 55% of total revenue. Sales of ultra-high power lasers above 6 kilowatts represented 56% of total high-power CW laser sales. Pulsed laser sales increased 55% year-over-year, with strong growth driven by our high-power nanosecond pulsed lasers used in EV battery manufacturing, green pulsed lasers used in solar cell manufacturing as well as higher sales of our new UV and ultrafast pulsed lasers, which were partially offset by lower sales of low-power pulsed lasers for marking applications.
Systems sales decreased 20% year-over-year due to COVID-19, but did improve sequentially. Medium power laser sales increased 25% as there was some recovery in additive manufacturing and other fine processing applications. QCW laser sales decreased 16% year-over-year due to lower sales for aerospace drilling applications. Other product sales decreased 11% year-over-year primarily due to lower telecom sales.
Q4 gross margin was 44%, which increased 310 basis points year-over-year. The additional inventory charge reduced gross margin by 410 basis points. Excluding this impact, gross margin benefited from lower cost of products and a decrease in unabsorbed costs as a percentage of sales as compared to the year ago period. The additional inventory charge of $14 million was related to optical components that have been replaced by components with better performance.
Fourth quarter GAAP operating income was $65 million and operating margin was 19%. During the quarter, we recognized a foreign exchange loss of $5 million, primarily related to the depreciation of the U.S. dollar versus the euro. Q4 net income was $49 million or $0.92 per diluted share. The additional inventory charge and foreign exchange loss reduced EPS by $0.27. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 24%.
If exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar had been the same as 1 year ago, we would have expected revenue to be $12 million lower and gross profit to be $8 million lower.
We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.4 billion and total debt of $38 million. Strong operational execution resulted in cash provided by operations of $85 million during the quarter.
Capital expenditures were $26 million in the fourth quarter. We expect 2021 capital expenditures will be in the range of $150 million to $160 million for the full year. Total capital expenditures in 2020 were significantly below our initial budget as we delayed some projects and some of these projects are now rescheduled for 2021. 2021 CapEx includes facilities and equipment expenditure for production, R&D and sales activity to support our future growth.
During the quarter, we did not repurchase any shares. In total, fourth quarter book-to-bill was above 1, and we were pleased with order flow across all of our main geographic regions. Geographically, most areas continue to show improvement with the only area that remains weak being Japan.
For the first quarter of 2021, IPG expects revenue of $310 million to $340 million. Company expects the first quarter tax rate to be approximately 25%. IPG anticipates delivering earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.90 to $1.20, with 53.2 million basic common shares outstanding and 53.9 million diluted common shares outstanding.
The improvement in macroeconomic indicators is now more broad-based and, if sustained, gives us optimism for 2021. However, we're a little cautious given the resurgence of COVID-19 in Europe and North America as well as the uncertainty surrounding vaccination rollout and return to normalcy is unclear at this time. These uncertainties continue to make forecasting our business challenging in the medium term. And our first quarter guidance remains subject to significant uncertainties, including the impact on the global business environment and expected recovery from COVID-19, economic trends, growth from emerging product revenue, competition and the lack of long-term binding order commitments.
That said, we continue to benefit from near-term growth opportunities in ultra-high power cutting, electric vehicle battery processing, renewable energy, microprocessing, medical procedures and advanced applications. We believe the strides we are making in higher power products within our core materials processing business and new solutions are enhancing our competitive position.
As discussed in the safe harbor passage of today's earnings press release, actual results may differ from our guidance due to factors, including, but not limited to, goodwill and other impairment charges, product demand, order cancellation and delays, competition, tariffs, trade policies, health epidemics and general economic conditions. Our guidance is based upon current market conditions and expectations, assumes exchange rates referenced in our earnings press release and is subject to risks outlined in the company's reports with the SEC.
With that, Valentin, Eugene and I will be happy to take your questions."

So except for your last comment, John, I think talking about puts and takes, there were a number of them articulated in the script. First of all, the continuing shift to higher power lasers for cutting applications, a lot of new product introductions. We're very optimistic about the handheld welder and growth in revenue from that.
All of our emerging products in Q4 performed really exceptionally well across a pretty broad portfolio of items that are starting to drive incremental growth. So whether it's the green lasers, the high-power nanosecond pulse lasers for EV, some increasing traction for ultrafast and UV. Medicals performed very well during the whole course of the year with the lithotripsy application. Other newer product introductions, the multichannel QCW for displacing YAG lasers in spot welding. We had good orders for AMB.
So we continue to see traction and momentum across what is now a pretty broad-based and diverse set of products and applications, and we continue to see improvement in -- we referenced again some of the key macroeconomic indicators that we follow. Certainly this year looks like it could be set up for being significantly better than the last 2 years we've been through. I mean the key issue will be to get out of some of the volatility that we've seen that sometimes impacted the second half of a year as happened in 2019 or as resulted in a slow start to the year as the pandemic did last year. So the main target is to get out of more of the volatility and get to sort of consistent year-over-year growth on a quarterly business, and we've got significant drivers for that."

So I think we've got a good start to the year in that context as well.
And on the other side on gross margin, we've got other benefits coming through from some of the product mix as we continue to grow revenue, better absorption of fixed costs and then, for example, the ultra compact laser starting to generate more meaningful revenue, there's a meaningful improvement in gross margin we expect from that. And then even taking the design changes on the ultra compact and rolling them into higher power lasers up to, I think, 7 or 8 kilowatts -- up to 8 kilowatts not going to be used in.

There's the growth in some of the emerging products as well that are not just strong in China, but are strong elsewhere.
So totally, we expect more of an even contribution and a rather less China-centric focus perhaps on revenue for the year. But notwithstanding that, China order flow has really been very strong prior to Chinese New Year. For example, not just of shippable orders, but even the frame agreements has been very, very good.

Medical growth will continue to be -- it's not going to be quite as strong as it was last year because we came on such a small base, but the medical business is continuing to perform well. We've got increasing visibility into medical sales in the second half of the year.
The green lasers going to Southeast Asia, although they're made in the U.S. at the moment, the backlog for those I've mentioned is good.

I was just hoping to get a sense of the big picture here. Some investors fear that with this bidding war, it could create a bigger competitor that could be much more aggressive, attacking the industrial markets, being price aggressive with scale of R&D. Maybe you can help us understand the competitive landscape in laser technology, a little bit more. How IPG positions itself to maintain that leadership?
And this is type of bidding war, even if it's not direct to IPG, does it validate some of the megatrends that are accelerating with automation, EV, dual supply chains? Do you see more consolidation going forward around laser technology and automation markets? Just curious on your thoughts on that one."

The first is we're not going to make a comment on the transaction and the bidding war that's going on out there. I think the comment is really to focus on where IPG strengths are in not only the core industrial markets, but also in a lot of these emerging product offerings. So in our core industrial markets, none of the parties that are involved in the process that is ongoing at the moment, really have any core strength and capability where IPG's core strength and capability is.
So we don't -- we view this as being separate from our core strategies and capabilities. In addition to that, we've got a lot of emerging product development in areas that we've talked about the -- driving our growth with inherent advantages around the products that we have. So whoever the competitor is, IPG's fiber laser technology is unique in very many different ways and we have this fundamental strength that comes from the vertical integration, the speed to development, the ability to get cost out. And as you can see from an increasingly diverse product portfolio.
I think the main point that we make on this is that we get a significantly higher rate of return on our internal R&D and making limited, very specific acquisitions that relate to our ability to leverage our own technology. So we don't view ourselves as being a consolidator in the industry.
With regard to some of the other trends, I think, yes, they're perfectly apparent, right, the flexibility, the automation, the increasing acceptance of lasers across many different applications and technologies, flexibility, we call out, for example, energy is becoming perhaps more fundamentally a driver for IPG. We're the only company that has an electrical efficiency approaching 50%. Nobody else is close to us on that. So you really have to, I think, look into some of the very specific benefits that we have rather than an advantage we have, rather than look at what may or may not be a larger scale company that will have competitive advantages against us, we don't think that they will.
Finally, I don't -- beyond this, there has already been quite a lot of consolidation within the industry. So there's a limited number of large targets that are left out there. The largest other competitor that's out there for us is actually a private German company. So consolidation has already taken place a bit more meaningfully to varying degrees of success, I'd say."

So it's been good to see a bit more stability. You've obviously also had some benefit going to higher power levels for cutting applications, where we have competitive advantage. And then outside of that, the emerging products, for example, even high-power nanosecond pulse lasers are very, almost exclusive to IPG, where we have a good ASP for some of those applications. So mix has been a bit of a benefit, too."

I'm very pleased to report another quarter of solid performance and excellent execution with strong revenue and earnings. Our revenue increased significantly compared to the same period in the prior year which was impacted by these macroeconomic conditions and global lockdown related to COVID-19 pandemic. 
Revenue was also higher sequentially despite typical seasonality as a result of continued positive performance in North America and sequential improvements in sales in Europe. Our bookings remain at higher level, particularly in China and we expect growth will continue in the second quarter. And as we benefit from our technology leadership, lineage products and global footprint. 
During the quarter, we made excellent progress in our core markets with strong growth in cutting and even stronger growth in welding applications. Outer high-power lasers made up 55% of total high-power sales and increased 55% in the quarter. At the high end of the market, we've seen an increased interest and order volumes for our 20 and 30 gigawatt ultra-high power lasers and optical heads. That offer catching speed improvement for materials up to 30 millimeters set and machines as a non on our power and water solution. 
always provide the period in parameters record back efficiency and high ability at the hallmarks of the IPG brand. They are also driving the rates return on investment for our company. Growth in welding applications stood out significantly this quarter. Sales of our high-power QCW lasers for welding applications nearly doubled compared with the same period last year. 
Sales of power adjustable raises increase and continue to gain share in the welding industry for general manufacturing backlift and in electric vehicle with welding applications. 
Our AMB products offer and well quality our competing solutions with a broad range of inability, enabling welding, which is extremely important 
During the first quarter, emerging orders grew by 64% and contributed 20.9% of total revenue as compared to 25% in Q1 2020. Emerging products grow more broad-based, but a highlight of this performance was the substantial growth in within pulp and lasers. The green lasers for solar cell applications, manufacturing and other change is pacing in some instances and scaling up manufacturing to meet demand. 
If we are increasing the power energies of the lasers to enable next-generation applications in our solar, drilling and copper welding for consumer electronics. As the emerging products that performed well per high-power output beam delivery and monitoring and AMB. 
Customer feedback on light wealth, our new state-of-the-art  welder is very positive. Consumers are excited about the ease-of-use, improvements in weld quality, materials that can be joint and program welding parameters for different types and stiffness of materials. In certain applications, enables customers to increase material post for manufacturing parts because they can use metal that cannot be valued by leadership processes. While we also also clean such both before and after welding by reducing cost and improving productivity. 
Additionally, our handheld laser help address portage and cost of qualified welder of course, the training process takes only a few hours, and the device is easy to use even for nonprofessional welders. Revenue from other applications decreased by 9% as higher revenue from advanced application was more than offset by lower revenue in. While revenue in medical decline usually timing of orders, we have a strong order work for our  systems and the installed base for our consumable application continues to grow. 
We continue to focus on product innovation. We have many tens of new products across the wide range of applications. This includes processing of a ceramic campsite material, numerous crystal second board or solar cells. 
Beyond material processing applications, we are developing new soft tissue medical treatment, leading for molecular-level resolution online spectroscopy, inspection, sensing and biomedical research applications and telecom and data com market. 
In addition to reporting our first quarter results, we announced a management transition this morning, which follow a well succession strategy that we have a place for some time. I'm happy to announce that Dr. Eugene Scherbakov, who I consider a co-Founder of IPG, will succeed me as IPG's, Chief Executive Officer. Dr. Scherbakov is a well-known scientists in the field of linear and, in many years, he worked in general physician and the better age of Nobel prizer Alexander program before to join me in IPG Laser Germany in 1995. 
Many years, he managed the best branch of IPG Corporation, sharing the position with Corporate Chief Operation during the last 2 years. I will transition in my new role of Executive Chairman of the Board and will continue to direct research and development function and be involved in strategy. 
In my new role, I will be spending more time on innovation and our technical capabilities, which are my to continue to promote the well operation basis, development and other laser components and application is that we will drive future success and technology leader of IPG. 
And it is an exciting evaluation for me and a very good transition into the company. With that, I will hand the call over to Eugene, IPG's new CEO."

I feel extremely privileged to become the next CEO of this great company and look forward to continue the strategy of Valentin and deliver on our mission to make fiber laser technology the tool of choice in high-tech mass production. 
Going back to our quarterly results, I will highlight additional details of our operations. And performance by region, and I'm happy to report that all our 4 major production facility operating normally. IPG has adapted to help to the new operating environment, and it is running production at high level to support increased demand for our products. 
restriction and safety precaution are limit customer uses, but we have seen the increase in traffic sort of our application labs. They are benefiting from a number of significant environment trends that includes increased investment in capacity for renewable energy and electric vehicles to support growth in sales. 
We are seeing increasing demand for our green pulsed laser enable significant improvements in solar cell efficiency. We also supply a wide range of products that provide improvements in electric clinical battery manufacturing process, including the speed of manufacturing, by process reliability and design flexibility that all lead to increased battery performance and safety while lowering production costs. 
We expect to benefit from growth of electric vehicle sales, driven by high emission standards and government policies, primarily in Europe and China. And that would require additional investment in battery production, manufacturing. And our revenue in China increased 74% year-over-year in the first quarter, representing approximately 41% of our total sales. 
We are seeing a decline demand of our ultra-high power lasers and laser heads from general manufacturing in China driven by this laser in metal processing productivity and ability to cut metals. First quarter booking in China were strong, benefiting from domestic infrastructure investment, EV and general manufacturing. As a result, our outlook for the second quarter is robust, and we expect the demand trends to continue. Sales to sell the rest of Asia increased 45% year-over-year. We are seeing strong demand for our welding and for cutting solutions for electrical battery manufacturing, growth in solar manufacturing and increased demand for our ultrafast lasers across all Asia. 
While sales in Japan decreased 21% year-over-year. Macroeconomic indicators seems to be improving moderately. And we are hopeful that level of business activity will increase from current depressed level. In Europe, revenue increased 14% year-over-year, and we saw an acceleration demand from customers in region, driven by growth in Germany. While core inflation rates remain high in Europe, it appears that industrial growth is improving and booking are incrementally positive, pointing to continuous recovery in the region. 
Our first quarter revenue in North America continued to improve, increasing 9% year-over-year. Growth was primarily driven by automotive and investment in new battery capacity for electric vehicles, being particularly strong. In addition to demand from EV, battery manufacturers, there continue to be opportunistic to replace only us at several outload manufacturers in United States. 
A laser system recovered from the low level in the prior year. Also non laser system sales remain weak. The pipeline of opportunity for lasers and nonlaser systems has improved. And we are spending looking to recovery during the 2021. 
As Valentin mentioned, medical revenue was lower, also increased medical booking in that medical revenue will also improve during the year. And we're particularly pleased with the growth in sale of medical consumable fibers as a number of procedures,  our gold standard system increased along this growing growth base. 
To continue to benefit to our vertical integrated production model, which enables key technology advantages or as the competition, while minimizing the cost and supply chain disruptions. Gross margin improved to 47.5% this quarter as we benefited from increased volumes and our continued focus on cost reduction initiatives. 
Total SG&A and R&D expenses increased by approximately $5 million year-over-year to $82 million in the first quarter. But declined as a percentage of our revenue. We continue to believe that our large and diverse advanced materials and components technology platform, our efficient LNG model, our strong balance sheet and free cash flow provide us ample flexibility to respond to the business disruption and average from this pandemic, a stronger company. 
On behalf of Valentin and myself, I want to thank our employers for the execution during this first quarter, the health, safety and well-being of our employers, their families, our customers, our partners and our communities remains our highest parity. 
With that, I will turn the call over to the Tim to discuss financial highlights in the quarter and the second quarter outlook."

Revenue in the first quarter was $346 million, which increased 39% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Revenue from materials processing applications increased 45% year-over-year and revenue from other applications decreased 9%. 
Sales of high-power CW lasers increased 43% year-over-year and represented approximately 49% of total revenue. Sales of ultra-high power lasers at 6 kilowatts or greater, represented 55% of total high-power CW laser sales and increased 55% compared to the prior year. 
Medium power laser sales increased 41% on growth in cutting, welding and centering applications. QCW laser sales increased 38% year-over-year on increased demand from welding applications. Pulsed laser sales increased 74% year-over-year, with strong growth in green pulsed lasers used in service cell manufacturing as well as higher sales of our high-power and ultrafast pulsed lasers. 
System sales increased 46% year-over-year as lower genesis revenue was offset by higher sales of other IPG laser systems. Other product sales decreased 66% year-over-year, driven by lower medical laser sales. 
First quarter GAAP gross margin was 47.5%, an increase of 620 basis points year-over-year. Compared with the year ago period, the increase in gross margin was driven primarily by improved absorption of manufacturing expenses, a decrease in cost of product, inventory provisions and shipping costs as a percentage of sales, partially offset by lower pricing. 
GAAP operating income was $89 million, and operating margin was 25.7%. First quarter net income was $68 million or $1.26 per diluted share. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 23%. During the quarter, we recognized a foreign exchange gain of $7 million, primarily related to appreciation of the U.S. dollar versus the euro. Foreign exchange gain benefited EPS by $0.09. The exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar had been the same as 1 year ago, we would have expected revenue to be $17 million lower and gross profit to be $10 million now. 
We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.4 billion and total debt of $37 million. Strong operational execution resulted in cash provided by operations of $88 million during the quarter. Capital expenditures were $27 million in the first quarter and we expect capital expenditures will be in the range of $150 million to $160 million for the full year. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 15,000 shares with $3 million. Commenting on outlook for the next quarter, we expect a strong quarter for revenue as regional and global economic indicators remain positive. With continued improvement in manufacturing PMIs in the euros and Europe, but with some moderation of economic indicators in China. 
As mentioned previously, first quarter book-to-bill was meaningfully above 1 and order backlog has increased since the beginning of the year. Displacement of non laser technologies, secular environmental trends and investments we have made in emerging products mean that we continue to see growth opportunities in ultra-high power cutting. Electric vehicle battery production, solar cell manufacturing, medical procedures and advanced applications. 
For the second quarter of 2021, IPG expects revenue of $360 million to $390 million. Given the increase in sales, we are returning to a more normal level of activity with moderately higher compensation and other operating expenses, which means that we expect total operating expenses to be in the range of $82 million to $84 million. 
The company expects the second quarter tax rate to be approximately 25%, excluding any discrete items. IPG anticipates delivering earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.20 to $1.50, with 53.5 million basic common shares outstanding and 54.2 million diluted common shares outstanding. 
There are several risks to our outlook as recent growth in China tempers and from uncertainty regarding the rollouts and timing of vaccines in Europe, Japan and elsewhere. The resumption of normal business and travel activities, the impact of automotive plant disruptions from chip shortages, the resumption of spending in aerospace and stimulus efforts in the U.S. and China. 
Financial guidance provided this quarter continues -- this quarter continues to be subject to greater risk and uncertainty given the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated impact to the global business environment, public health requirements and government mandates. 
As discussed in the safe harbor passage of today's earnings press release, actual results may differ from our guidance due to factors including, but not limited to, goodwill and other impairment charges, product demand, order cancellations and delays, competition, tariffs, trade policies, health epidemics and general economic conditions. Our guidance is based upon current market conditions and expectations, assumes exchange rates referenced in our earnings press release and is subject to risks outlined in the company's reports with the SEC. 
With that, Valentin, Eugene and I will be happy to take your questions."

Given the environment, some of those large scale investments, Jim, have certainly been more moderate over the last year or so, and then they've also been impacted by some of the aerospace activity being a lot lower. So we're moderately more optimistic of that business. If they conclude some of these orders, we'll certainly reach a bit of a turning point.

We're very pleased with the performance of the business. Even in the second half of last year, the strong traction in overall revenue in Q4, a really good revenue number. We've just reported and very solid earnings for Q1 that normally can be a down quarter compared to Q4, where we've actually sequentially seen an improvement even with Chinese New Year. 
Pleased with some of the recovery in Europe in the underlying tone of the business there. North America had started to recover in the second half last year remains fairly robust.

We made 2 announcements today. I will first discuss our results. I'm very pleased to report another quarter of solid performance and excellent execution with strong revenue and earnings. Our revenue increased significantly compared",904,"Good morning, everyone. We made 2 announcements today. I will first discuss our results. I'm very pleased to report another quarter of solid performance and excellent execution with strong revenue and earnings. Our revenue increased significantly compared to the same period in the prior year, which was impacted by weak macroeconomic conditions and global lockdowns related to COVID-19 pandemic.
Revenue was also higher sequentially despite typical seasonality as a result of continued positive performance in North America and sequential improvement [indiscernible] in sales in Europe. Our bookings remain at higher level, particularly in China and we expect growth will continue in the second quarter, and as we benefit from our technology leadership, leading-edge products and global footprint.
During the quarter, we demonstrated excellent progress in our core markets with strong growth in cutting and even stronger growth in welding applications. Ultra-high power lasers made up 55% of total high-power sales and increased 55% in the quarter. At the high end of the market, we've seen an increased interest and order volumes for our 20 and 30 kilowatt ultra-high power lasers and optical heads, that offer cutting speed improvement for materials up to 30 millimeters thick and replacing plasma cutting machine, other non-laser processses and lower power laser solutions.
Our lasers provide superior beam parameters, record wall plug efficiency and high reliability that are the hallmarks of the IPG brand. They also drive a great return on investment for our customers. Growth in welding applications stood out significantly this quarter. Sales of our high-power CW and QCW lasers for welding applications nearly doubled compared with the same period last year.
Sales of our adjustable bode beam laser increased and continue to gain share in the welding industry for general manufacturing purposes and in electric vehicle battery welding applications.
Our AMB products offer superior speed and weld quality over competing solutions with a broad range of beam tunability, enabling spatterless welding, which is extremely important for battery welding.
During the first quarter, emerging products grew by 64% and contributed 29% of total revenue as compared to 25% in Q1 2020. Emerging products growth was broad-based, but a highlight of this performance was the substantial growth in within green pulsed lasers. We doubled sales for green pulsed lasers for solar cell applications -- manufacturing and other applications, displacing competitors in some instances and scaling up manufacturing to meet demand.
Additionally, we are increasing the pulse energies of green lasers to enable next-generation applications in solar, drilling and copper welding for consumer electronics. Other emerging products that performed well were high power pulsed, ultrafast pulsed, beam delivery and monitoring and AMB.
Customer feedback on LightWELD, our new state-of-the-art handheld laser welder is very positive. Consumers are excited about the ease-of-use, improvements in weld quality, diversity of materials that can be joined and programmed welding parameters for different types and thickness of materials. In certain applications, LightWELD enables customers to decrease material costs for manufacturing parts because they can use metal that cannot be welded by legacy processes. LightWELD also cleans surfaces both before and after welding, further reducing cost and improving productivity.
Additionally, our handheld laser help address shortage and cost of qualified welders because the training process takes only a few hours and the device is easy to use even for nonprofessional welders. Revenue from other applications decreased by 9% as higher revenue from advanced application and telecom was more than offset by low revenue in medical. While revenue in medical declined due to the timing of orders, we have a strong order backlog for our thulium laser systems and the installed base for our consumable fibers for urology applications continues to grow.
We continue to focus on product innovation. We have many tens of new projects across a wide range of applications. This includes processing of glass, ceramic, composite material, numerous crystals, circuit board, OLED film, batteries and solar cells.
Beyond material processing applications, we are developing new soft tissue medical treatment, mid-infrared lasers for molecular-level resolution online spectroscopy, inspection, sensing and biomedical research applications and new high-speed transceivers for the telecom and data com market.
In addition to reporting our first quarter results, we announced a management transition this morning, which follow a well-planned succession strategy that we had in place for some time. I'm happy to announce that Dr. Eugene Scherbakov, who I consider Co-Founder of IPG will succeed me as IPG's Chief Executive Officer. Dr. Scherbakov is a world-known scientist in the field of nonlinear and waveguide optics. He many years worked in General Physics Institute of Russian Academy of Science under patronage of Nobel Prizer Alexander Prokhorov, before to join me in IPG Laser Germany in 1995.
Many years, he managed the best branch of IPG Corporation, sharing the position with Corporate Chief Operation Officer duty during the last 2 years. I will transition in my new role of Executive Chairman of the Board and will continue to direct the research and development function and be involved in strategy.
In my new role, I will be spending more time on innovation and our technical capabilities, which are my passions to continue to promote development in lasers -- development in lasers, components and application that will drive future success and technology leadership of IPG.
And it is an exciting evolution for me and a very good transition for the company. With that, I will hand the call over to Eugene, IPG's new CEO."

I feel extremely privileged to become the next CEO of this great company and look forward to continue the strategy of Dr. Gapontsev and deliver on our mission to make fiber laser technology the tool of choice in high-tech mass production.
Going back to our quarterly results, I will provide additional details of our operations and performance by region, and I'm happy to report that all our 4 major production facilities operating normally. IPG has adapted well to the new operating environment and is running production at high level to support increased demand for our products.
Travel restriction and safety precaution limit customer visits, but we have seen the increase in traffic through our application labs. They are benefiting from a number of significant environment trends that includes increased investment in capacity for renewable energy and electric vehicles to support growth in sales.
We are seeing increasing demand for our green pulsed laser, which are enabling significant improvements in solar cell efficiency. We also supply a wide range of products that provide improvements in electric vehicle battery manufacturing process, including the speed of manufacturing, high process reliability and design flexibility that all lead to increased battery performance and safety while lowering production costs.
We expect to benefit from growth of electric vehicle sales, driven by high emission standards and government policies, primarily in Europe and China. And that would require additional investment in battery production -- manufacturing. And our revenue in China increased 104% year-over-year in the first quarter, representing approximately 41% of our total sales.
We are seeing high demand of our ultra-high power lasers and laser heads from general manufacturing in China driven by this lasers' thin metal processing productivity and ability to cut thicker metals. First quarter booking in China were strong, benefiting from domestic infrastructure investment, EV and general manufacturing. As a result, our outlook for the second quarter is robust, and we expect the demand trends to continue. Sales to -- sales rest of Asia increased 45% year-over-year. We are seeing strong demand for our welding and foil cutting solutions for electric vehicles battery manufacturing, growth in solar manufacturing and increased demand for our ultrafast lasers across all Asia.
While sales in Japan decreased 21% year-over-year, macroeconomic indicators seems to be improving moderately. And we are hopeful that level of business activity will increase from current depressed level. In Europe, revenue increased 14% year-over-year, and we saw an acceleration of demand from customers in the region, driven by growth in Germany. While COVID infection rates remain high in Europe, it appears that industrial growth is improving and bookings are incrementally positive, pointing to continuous recovery in the region.
First quarter revenue in North America continued to improve, increasing 9% year-over-year. Growth was primarily driven by automotive with investment in new battery capacity for electric vehicles being particularly strong. In addition to demand from EV battery manufacturers, there continue to be opportunities to replace old lasers at several auto manufacturers in United States.
Laser system recovered from the low level in the prior year, although non-laser system sales remained weak. The pipeline of opportunity for lasers and non-laser systems has improved. And we are expecting booking to recover during the 2021.
As Valentin mentioned, medical revenue was lower, although increased medical bookings mean that medical revenue will also improve during the year. And we're particularly pleased with the growth in sale of medical consumable fibers as a number of procedures for our gold standard lithotripsy system increased along with growing installed base.
We continue to benefit from our vertical integrated production model, which enables key technology advantages over the competition, while minimizing the cost and supply chain disruptions. Gross margin improved to 47.5% this quarter as we benefited from increased volumes and our continued focus on cost reduction initiatives.
Total SG&A and R&D expenses increased by approximately $5 million year-over-year to $82 million in the first quarter, but declined as a percentage of our revenue. We continue to believe that our large and diverse advanced materials and components technology platform, our efficient R&D model, our strong balance sheet and free cash flow provide us ample flexibility to respond to the business disruption and emerge from this pandemic a stronger company.
On behalf of Valentin and myself, I want to thank our employers for the execution during this first quarter. The health, safety and well-being of our employees, their families, our customers, our partners and our communities remains our highest priority.
With that, I will turn the call over to Tim to discuss financial highlights in the quarter and the second quarter outlook."

Revenue in the first quarter was $346 million, which increased 39% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Revenue from materials processing applications increased 45% year-over-year and revenue from other applications decreased 9%.
Sales of high-power CW lasers increased 43% year-over-year and represented approximately 49% of total revenue. Sales of ultra-high power lasers at 6 kilowatts or greater represented 55% of total high-power CW laser sales and increased 55% compared to the prior year.
Medium power laser sales increased 41% on growth in cutting, welding and sintering applications. QCW laser sales increased 38% year-over-year on increased demand from welding applications. Pulsed laser sales increased 74% year-over-year, with strong growth in green pulsed lasers used in solar cell manufacturing as well as higher sales of our high-power and ultrafast pulsed lasers.
System sales increased 46% year-over-year as lower Genesis revenue was offset by higher sales of other IPG laser systems. Other product sales decreased 6 -- 6% year-over-year, driven by lower medical laser sales.
First quarter GAAP gross margin was 47.5%, an increase of 620 basis points year-over-year. Compared with the year ago period, the increase in gross margin was driven primarily by improved absorption of manufacturing expenses, a decrease in cost of product, inventory provisions and shipping costs as a percentage of sales, partially offset by lower pricing.
GAAP operating income was $89 million, and operating margin was 25.7%. First quarter net income was $68 million or $1.26 per diluted share. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 23%. During the quarter, we recognized a foreign exchange gain of $7 million, primarily related to appreciation of the U.S. dollar versus the euro. Foreign exchange gain benefited EPS by $0.09. If exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar had been the same as 1 year ago, we would have expected revenue to be $17 million lower and gross profit to be $10 million lower.
We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.4 billion and total debt of $37 million. Strong operational execution resulted in cash provided by operations of $88 million during the quarter. Capital expenditures were $27 million in the first quarter and we expect capital expenditures will be in the range of $150 million to $160 million for the full year.
During the quarter, we repurchased 15,000 shares for $3 million. Commenting on outlook for the next quarter, we expect a strong quarter for revenue as regional and global economic indicators remain positive. With continued improvement in manufacturing PMIs in the U.S. and Europe, but with some moderation to the economic indicators in China.
As mentioned previously, first quarter book-to-bill was meaningfully above 1 and order backlog has increased since the beginning of the year. Displacement of non-laser technologies, secular environmental trends and investments we have made in emerging products mean that we continue to see growth opportunities in ultra-high power cutting, electric vehicle battery production, solar cell manufacturing, medical procedures and advanced applications.
For the second quarter of 2021, IPG expects revenue of $360 million to $390 million. Given the increase in sales, we are returning to a more normal level of activity with moderately higher compensation and other operating expenses, which means that we expect total operating expenses to be in the range of $82 million to $84 million.
The company expects the second quarter tax rate to be approximately 25%, excluding any discrete items. IPG anticipates delivering earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.20 to $1.50, with 53.5 million basic common shares outstanding and 54.2 million diluted common shares outstanding.
There are several risks to our outlook as recent growth in China tempers and from uncertainty regarding the rollouts and timing of vaccines in Europe, Japan and elsewhere, the resumption of normal business and travel activities, the impact of automotive plant disruptions from chip shortages, the resumption of spending in aerospace and stimulus efforts in the U.S. and China.
Financial guidance provided this quarter continues -- this quarter continues to be subject to greater risk and uncertainty given the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated impact to the global business environment, public health requirements and government mandates.
As discussed in the safe harbor passage of today's earnings press release, actual results may differ from our guidance due to factors including, but not limited to, goodwill and other impairment charges, product demand, order cancellations and delays, competition, tariffs, trade policies, health epidemics and general economic conditions. Our guidance is based upon current market conditions and expectations, assumes exchange rates referenced in our earnings press release and is subject to risks outlined in the company's reports with the SEC.
With that, Valentin, Eugene and I will be happy to take your questions."

So they're actually waiting to close a significant number of orders, some of which are in excess of $5 million a piece.
Given the environment, some of those large-scale investments, Jim, have certainly been more moderate over the last year or so, and then they've also been impacted by some of the aerospace activity being a lot lower. So we're moderately more optimistic of that business. If they conclude some of these orders, we'll certainly reach a bit of a turning point.
I think the big difference is that the size of the equipment they sell in terms of total value is significantly different from even some of our other systems businesses and also from the average ASP even of a high power or ultra-high power laser. So that pipeline -- the message is the pipeline of order flow has certainly improved. They need to close some of those orders. And if they can do so, that will help to turn around that business."

So we had referenced selling significant orders for single-mode lasers that have very strong margin on them. In addition to that, we had sales of very ultra-high power lasers for advanced applications. So for example, 100-kilowatt lasers, those tend to be advanced applications, was good in Q1 and is good in Q2, but we don't have those orders on hand at the moment.
They may pick up in the second half of the year. There is also some strong backlog for advanced applications that we're waiting for confirmation of when that should be delivered. It's unlikely to be in the second quarter. So some of the mix side of it will have being one of the main differences compared to the third quarter and fourth quarter of last year.

Because just time, people can weld without practically developing any spattering. All it is possible with such kind of AMB technology.
And of course, it increased immediately the processing of materials and quality of welding. Monitoring -- online monitoring during the welding.

I'm very pleased to report another quarter of solid performance and excellent execution with strong revenue and earnings. Our revenue increased significantly compared to the same period in the prior year, which was impacted by weak macroeconomic conditions and global lockdowns related to COVID-19 pandemic.
Revenue was also higher sequentially despite typical seasonality as a result of continued positive performance in North America and sequential improvement in sales in Europe. Our bookings remain at higher level, particularly in China and we expect growth will continue in the second quarter, and as we benefit from our technology leadership, leading-edge products and global footprint.
During the quarter, we demonstrated excellent progress in our core markets with strong growth in cutting and even stronger growth in welding applications. Ultra-high power lasers made up 55% of total high-power sales and increased 55% in the quarter. At the high end of the market, we've seen an increased interest and order volumes for our 20 and 30 kilowatt ultra-high power lasers and optical heads, that offer cutting speed improvement for materials up to 30 millimeters thick and replacing plasma cutting machine, other non-laser processses and lower power laser solutions.
Our lasers provide superior beam parameters, record wall plug efficiency and high reliability that are the hallmarks of the IPG brand. They also drive a great return on investment for our customers. Growth in welding applications stood out significantly this quarter. Sales of our high-power CW and QCW lasers for welding applications nearly doubled compared with the same period last year.
Sales of our adjustable bode beam laser increased and continue to gain share in the welding industry for general manufacturing purposes and in electric vehicle battery welding applications.
Our AMB products offer superior speed and weld quality over competing solutions with a broad range of beam tunability, enabling spatterless welding, which is extremely important for battery welding.
During the first quarter, emerging products grew by 64% and contributed 29% of total revenue as compared to 25% in Q1 2020. Emerging products growth was broad-based, but a highlight of this performance was the substantial growth in within green pulsed lasers. We doubled sales for green pulsed lasers for solar cell applications -- manufacturing and other applications, displacing competitors in some instances and scaling up manufacturing to meet demand.
Additionally, we are increasing the pulse energies of green lasers to enable next-generation applications in solar, drilling and copper welding for consumer electronics. Other emerging products that performed well were high power pulsed, ultrafast pulsed, beam delivery and monitoring and AMB.
Customer feedback on LightWELD, our new state-of-the-art handheld laser welder is very positive. Consumers are excited about the ease-of-use, improvements in weld quality, diversity of materials that can be joined and programmed welding parameters for different types and thickness of materials. In certain applications, LightWELD enables customers to decrease material costs for manufacturing parts because they can use metal that cannot be welded by legacy processes. LightWELD also cleans surfaces both before and after welding, further reducing cost and improving productivity.
Additionally, our handheld laser help address shortage and cost of qualified welders because the training process takes only a few hours and the device is easy to use even for nonprofessional welders. Revenue from other applications decreased by 9% as higher revenue from advanced application and telecom was more than offset by low revenue in medical. While revenue in medical declined due to the timing of orders, we have a strong order backlog for our thulium laser systems and the installed base for our consumable fibers for urology applications continues to grow.
We continue to focus on product innovation. We have many tens of new projects across a wide range of applications. This includes processing of glass, ceramic, composite material, numerous crystals, circuit board, OLED film, batteries and solar cells.
Beyond material processing applications, we are developing new soft tissue medical treatment, mid-infrared lasers for molecular-level resolution online spectroscopy, inspection, sensing and biomedical research applications and new high-speed transceivers for the telecom and data com market.
In addition to reporting our first quarter results, we announced a management transition this morning, which follow a well-planned succession strategy that we had in place for some time. I'm happy to announce that Dr. Eugene Scherbakov, who I consider Co-Founder of IPG will succeed me as IPG's Chief Executive Officer. Dr. Scherbakov is a world-known scientist in the field of nonlinear and waveguide optics. He many years worked in General Physics Institute of Russian Academy of Science under patronage of Nobel Prizer Alexander Prokhorov, before to join me in IPG Laser Germany in 1995.
Many years, he managed the best branch of IPG Corporation, sharing the position with Corporate Chief Operation Officer duty during the last 2 years. I will transition in my new role of Executive Chairman of the Board and will continue to direct the research and development function and be involved in strategy.
In my new role, I will be spending more time on innovation and our technical capabilities, which are my passions to continue to promote development in lasers -- development in lasers, components and application that will drive future success and technology leadership of IPG.
And it is an exciting evolution for me and a very good transition for the company. With that, I will hand the call over to Eugene, IPG's new CEO."

I feel extremely privileged to become the next CEO of this great company and look forward to continue the strategy of Dr. Gapontsev and deliver on our mission to make fiber laser technology the tool of choice in high-tech mass production.
Going back to our quarterly results, I will provide additional details of our operations and performance by region, and I'm happy to report that all our 4 major production facilities operating normally. IPG has adapted well to the new operating environment and is running production at high level to support increased demand for our products.
Travel restriction and safety precaution limit customer visits, but we have seen the increase in traffic through our application labs. They are benefiting from a number of significant environment trends that includes increased investment in capacity for renewable energy and electric vehicles to support growth in sales.
We are seeing increasing demand for our green pulsed laser, which are enabling significant improvements in solar cell efficiency. We also supply a wide range of products that provide improvements in electric vehicle battery manufacturing process, including the speed of manufacturing, high process reliability and design flexibility that all lead to increased battery performance and safety while lowering production costs.
We expect to benefit from growth of electric vehicle sales, driven by high emission standards and government policies, primarily in Europe and China. And that would require additional investment in battery production -- manufacturing. And our revenue in China increased 104% year-over-year in the first quarter, representing approximately 41% of our total sales.
We are seeing high demand of our ultra-high power lasers and laser heads from general manufacturing in China driven by this lasers' thin metal processing productivity and ability to cut thicker metals. First quarter booking in China were strong, benefiting from domestic infrastructure investment, EV and general manufacturing. As a result, our outlook for the second quarter is robust, and we expect the demand trends to continue. Sales to -- sales rest of Asia increased 45% year-over-year. We are seeing strong demand for our welding and foil cutting solutions for electric vehicles battery manufacturing, growth in solar manufacturing and increased demand for our ultrafast lasers across all Asia.
While sales in Japan decreased 21% year-over-year, macroeconomic indicators seems to be improving moderately. And we are hopeful that level of business activity will increase from current depressed level. In Europe, revenue increased 14% year-over-year, and we saw an acceleration of demand from customers in the region, driven by growth in Germany. While COVID infection rates remain high in Europe, it appears that industrial growth is improving and bookings are incrementally positive, pointing to continuous recovery in the region.
First quarter revenue in North America continued to improve, increasing 9% year-over-year. Growth was primarily driven by automotive with investment in new battery capacity for electric vehicles being particularly strong. In addition to demand from EV battery manufacturers, there continue to be opportunities to replace old lasers at several auto manufacturers in United States.
Laser system recovered from the low level in the prior year, although non-laser system sales remained weak. The pipeline of opportunity for lasers and non-laser systems has improved. And we are expecting booking to recover during the 2021.
As Valentin mentioned, medical revenue was lower, although increased medical bookings mean that medical revenue will also improve during the year. And we're particularly pleased with the growth in sale of medical consumable fibers as a number of procedures for our gold standard lithotripsy system increased along with growing installed base.
We continue to benefit from our vertical integrated production model, which enables key technology advantages over the competition, while minimizing the cost and supply chain disruptions. Gross margin improved to 47.5% this quarter as we benefited from increased volumes and our continued focus on cost reduction initiatives.
Total SG&A and R&D expenses increased by approximately $5 million year-over-year to $82 million in the first quarter, but declined as a percentage of our revenue. We continue to believe that our large and diverse advanced materials and components technology platform, our efficient R&D model, our strong balance sheet and free cash flow provide us ample flexibility to respond to the business disruption and emerge from this pandemic a stronger company.
On behalf of Valentin and myself, I want to thank our employers for the execution during this first quarter. The health, safety and well-being of our employees, their families, our customers, our partners and our communities remains our highest priority.
With that, I will turn the call over to Tim to discuss financial highlights in the quarter and the second quarter outlook."

Revenue in the first quarter was $346 million, which increased 39% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Revenue from materials processing applications increased 45% year-over-year and revenue from other applications decreased 9%.
Sales of high-power CW lasers increased 43% year-over-year and represented approximately 49% of total revenue. Sales of ultra-high power lasers at 6 kilowatts or greater represented 55% of total high-power CW laser sales and increased 55% compared to the prior year.
Medium power laser sales increased 41% on growth in cutting, welding and sintering applications. QCW laser sales increased 38% year-over-year on increased demand from welding applications. Pulsed laser sales increased 74% year-over-year, with strong growth in green pulsed lasers used in solar cell manufacturing as well as higher sales of our high-power and ultrafast pulsed lasers.
System sales increased 46% year-over-year as lower Genesis revenue was offset by higher sales of other IPG laser systems. Other product sales decreased 6 -- 6% year-over-year, driven by lower medical laser sales.
First quarter GAAP gross margin was 47.5%, an increase of 620 basis points year-over-year. Compared with the year ago period, the increase in gross margin was driven primarily by improved absorption of manufacturing expenses, a decrease in cost of product, inventory provisions and shipping costs as a percentage of sales, partially offset by lower pricing.
GAAP operating income was $89 million, and operating margin was 25.7%. First quarter net income was $68 million or $1.26 per diluted share. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 23%. During the quarter, we recognized a foreign exchange gain of $7 million, primarily related to appreciation of the U.S. dollar versus the euro. Foreign exchange gain benefited EPS by $0.09. If exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar had been the same as 1 year ago, we would have expected revenue to be $17 million lower and gross profit to be $10 million lower.
We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.4 billion and total debt of $37 million. Strong operational execution resulted in cash provided by operations of $88 million during the quarter. Capital expenditures were $27 million in the first quarter and we expect capital expenditures will be in the range of $150 million to $160 million for the full year.
During the quarter, we repurchased 15,000 shares for $3 million. Commenting on outlook for the next quarter, we expect a strong quarter for revenue as regional and global economic indicators remain positive. With continued improvement in manufacturing PMIs in the U.S. and Europe, but with some moderation to the economic indicators in China.
As mentioned previously, first quarter book-to-bill was meaningfully above 1 and order backlog has increased since the beginning of the year. Displacement of non-laser technologies, secular environmental trends and investments we have made in emerging products mean that we continue to see growth opportunities in ultra-high power cutting, electric vehicle battery production, solar cell manufacturing, medical procedures and advanced applications.
For the second quarter of 2021, IPG expects revenue of $360 million to $390 million. Given the increase in sales, we are returning to a more normal level of activity with moderately higher compensation and other operating expenses, which means that we expect total operating expenses to be in the range of $82 million to $84 million.
The company expects the second quarter tax rate to be approximately 25%, excluding any discrete items. IPG anticipates delivering earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.20 to $1.50, with 53.5 million basic common shares outstanding and 54.2 million diluted common shares outstanding.
There are several risks to our outlook as recent growth in China tempers and from uncertainty regarding the rollouts and timing of vaccines in Europe, Japan and elsewhere, the resumption of normal business and travel activities, the impact of automotive plant disruptions from chip shortages, the resumption of spending in aerospace and stimulus efforts in the U.S. and China.
Financial guidance provided this quarter continues -- this quarter continues to be subject to greater risk and uncertainty given the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated impact to the global business environment, public health requirements and government mandates.
As discussed in the safe harbor passage of today's earnings press release, actual results may differ from our guidance due to factors including, but not limited to, goodwill and other impairment charges, product demand, order cancellations and delays, competition, tariffs, trade policies, health epidemics and general economic conditions. Our guidance is based upon current market conditions and expectations, assumes exchange rates referenced in our earnings press release and is subject to risks outlined in the company's reports with the SEC.
With that, Valentin, Eugene and I will be happy to take your questions."

Given the environment, some of those large-scale investments, Jim, have certainly been more moderate over the last year or so, and then they've also been impacted by some of the aerospace activity being a lot lower. So we're moderately more optimistic of that business. If they conclude some of these orders, we'll certainly reach a bit of a turning point.
I think the big difference is that the size of the equipment they sell in terms of total value is significantly different from even some of our other systems businesses and also from the average ASP even of a high power or ultra-high power laser.

Speed of this growing will depend, of course, on many parameters. First of all, electric vehicle. You see one of the applications which demonstrated a very fast-growing application for our new lasers, especially for AMB laser. Why? Because just time, people can weld without practically developing any spattering. All it is possible with such kind of AMB technology.
And of course, it increased immediately the processing of materials and quality of welding. Monitoring -- online monitoring during the welding. Again, it also demonstrates that a very big perspective for future applications because you have the feasibility during the welding to online monitoring the quality of welding and to make immediate resolution, what you have to do.

During the quarter, we demonstrated excellent progress in our core material processing market across all major geographies, with accelerated growth in high power and ultra-high power lasers for applications",977,"Thank you, Valentin, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, we demonstrated excellent progress in our core material processing market across all major geographies, with accelerated growth in high power and ultra-high power lasers for applications in the U.S. and Europe and strong growth in Weld in China and Europe. We also delivered robust growth in emerging products and applications. 
Revenue from material processing applications increased 27% year-over-year and contributed 93% of total revenue in the quarter. Sales in welding applications grew significantly in the last several quarters due to increased sales of our AMB, adjusted motor beam lasers, for general manufacturing purposes and electric vehicle battery welding applications. 
Battery manufacturers are facing challenges, welding together different types of materials such kind of copper, sulphur and aluminum. These materials are extremely same reflective and needs to be loaded with high precision and reliability. Each battery model requires hundreds of welds, and our AMB lasers can address these challenges, offering superior speed and competing solution, this broad range of being tunability and welding. 
We also saw strong demand in marking and micro material processing applications, such as solar cell manufacturing and 3D printing. Sales of our green pulse lasers, which are used to improve solar efficiency, more than tripled compared to the prior year and becoming a more meaningful part of IPG's revenue. We are taking advantage of opportunity created by increasing focus on sustainability globally and expect future solar cell manufacturing capacity to grow, driving additional sales in our green lasers. We are also increasing the pulse Energy lasers to enable next-generation applications in solar, building and welding for consumer electronics. 
Revenue from our other applications increased by 5% year-over-year. Medical sales showed a good growth, both year-over-year and sequentially, as a result of improved demand of our surgical lasers. Advanced application sales improved year-over-year, while telecom revenue declined compared to the same period in the prior year. 
Examining our performance by region. Our revenue in China increased 10% year-over-year in the second quarter, representing approximately 43% of our total sales. Year-over-year comparison for the region was more difficult as China sales rebounding from the pandemic earlier than other regions last year. We see strong demand in welding application for our AMD and other high power as a while demand and cutting at the end of the quarter, so the sales of high-power lasers increased only slightly compared to the second quarter last year. 
We continue to see solid demand in foil cutting and welding applications related to electric vehicle batteries and also starting to see some demand for the LightWELD, by a welding system in China, which should provide a modest benefit to revenue in the second half. While China's market remains very price competitor, we have continued to be disciplined with our pricing given superior performance, quality, energy efficiency and variability of our. 
remains a significant part of the customer base that is very focused on their price alone. Sales to the rest of Asia increased 123% year-over-year, with strong growth in Korea and other countries, offsetting lower revenue in Japan. We are seeing a strong demand for our building and oil cutting solution for EV batteries in Korea and encourage by improved bookings in Japan. 
In Europe, revenue increased 50% year-over-year as we saw an acceleration of demand from customers in the region and strong growth in cutting, welding, market and cleaning applications. Sales improved significantly in high power -- ultra high power in and QCWs. European cutting customers are moving into the ultra high-power lasers and are replacing CO2 laser with fiber lasers to improve productivity. Bookings for the region remain positive, pointing to continued recovery. 
Revenue in North America increased 23% year-over-year. Growth was primarily driven by material processing and increased sales of high-power lasers for patent applications. Sales to automotive was traditional. Electrical and solar markets remain strong. We also saw solid improvement in micro material processing applications and strong growth in demand for LightWELD. 
Besides our normal sales model, we are leveraged new part resells with numerous welding stores and new direct online sales platform for LightWELD in the U.S. Laser system sales improved in the second quarter, this both laser on no laser system, posting strong revenue growth. Bookings remained high, and we expect to see additional improvement in system sales in the third quarter. 
We continue to benefit from our vertically integrated production model, which enable key technology advantages or the competition while minimizing the cost and supply chain disruptions. However, we did experience focus on certain components during the quarter and so increasing lead time that impacted our and our customers' operations. We are also evaluating inflationary pressures on our input cost and prior quotations when they expire. Despite these, we were able to deliver the revenue growth to the midpoint of our guidance and gross margin close to top or expectations for the second quarter. 
IPG has been a technology leader in fiber laser more than 20 years, and none of our competitors have been able to match or approach the capability of our products. Restructuring development is our DNA. And we are continuing to focus on reducing the cost and improving the quality of our components and products. We are also committed to expanding the range of products and applications. We address by pushing on research and development project. By belief, we can commercialize in the near to midterm, which have significant market potential. 
We will continue to focus on opportunities where we can increase our propositions to customers by delivering complete processing and technology solutions with our optical and system capability. I want to thank our employers to the execution view in the second quarter and thank our shareholders for your continuing support. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Tim to discuss financial highlights in the quarter and third quarter outlook."

Revenue in the second quarter was $372 million which increased 25% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. Revenue from materials processing applications increased 27% year-over-year, and revenue from other applications increased 5%. 
Sales of high-power CW lasers increased 20% year-over-year and represented approximately 51% of total revenue. Sales of ultra-high power lasers at 6 kilowatts or greater represented 51% of total high-power CW laser sales and increased 15% compared to the prior year. 
Medium power laser sales increased 70% on growth in cutting, welding, 3D printing and semiconductor applications. QCW laser sales increased 13% year-over-year on higher demand from welding applications. Pulsed laser sales increased 45% year-over-year with strong growth in green pulse lasers used in solar cell manufacturing and higher sales of our infrared lasers for marking and cleaning applications as well as oil cutting applications in the electric vehicle batteries manufacturing process. 
System sales increased 19% year-over-year with improved sales for Genesis and IoT. Other product sales decreased 4% year-over-year. We estimate that supply chain constraints impacted our revenue by $7 million to $10 million in the quarter. 
Second quarter GAAP gross margin was 48.6%, an increase of 260 basis points year-over-year. Compared with the year ago period, the increase in gross margin was driven primarily by improved absorption of manufacturing expenses, partially offset by lower pricing and higher shipping costs as a percentage of sales. 
GAAP operating income was $92 million and operating margin was 24.8%. Second quarter net income was $70 million or $1.29 per diluted share. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 24%. 
During the quarter, we recognized a foreign exchange loss of $3 million, primarily related to the appreciation of the Russian ruble and euro, partially offset by the appreciation of the Chinese yuan. The foreign exchange loss reduced the EPS by $0.04. Exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar had been the same as 1 year ago, we would have expected revenue to be $23 million lower and gross profit to be $13 million lower. 
We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.5 billion and total debt of $36 million. Strong operational execution resulted in cash provided by operations of $116 million during the quarter. Capital expenditures were $27 million in the second quarter, and we now expect capital expenditures to be between $130 million and $150 million for the full year. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 185,000 shares for $39 million. 
Commenting on outlook for the next quarter. Second quarter book-to-bill remained above 1. While we expect continued improvement in sales outside of China, sales in China are likely to moderate in the third quarter due to more difficult comparisons and softer demand in cutting applications. However, displacement of non-laser technologies, secular environmental trends and investments we have made in emerging products, mean that we continue to see growth opportunities in high-power cutting, foil cutting and welding applications for electric vehicle battery productions as well as opportunities in solar cell manufacturing, medical procedures and advanced applications. We also see LightWELD sales gaining traction in multiple geographies in the second half of the year. 
For the third quarter of 2021, IPG expects revenue of $350 million to $380 million, which implies a 15% year-over-year growth at the midpoint despite more difficult third quarter year-over-year comparisons, softness in the cutting market in China and ongoing supply chain constraints. The company expects the third quarter tax rate to be approximately 25%, excluding any discrete items. 
IPG anticipates delivering earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.10 to $1.40 with 53.5 million basic common shares outstanding and 54 million diluted common shares outstanding. I would like to remind you that financial guidance provided this quarter continues to be subject to greater risk and uncertainty, given the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated impacts to the global business environment, public health requirements and government mandates. Please refer to the safe harbor passage of today's earnings press release for more details on risks and uncertainties associated with our forward-looking statements. 
With that, Valentin and Eugene will be happy to take your questions -- and I will be."

If we go back a quarter ago, I think you were talking about macro indicators showing signs of weakness, but I think your data points were strong. We were talking about strong freight agreements that are tied usually to high demand for ultra-high power lasers. If I look at the high-power sales and breaking down between ultra high power and the low 6-kilowatt, we can see that ultra-high power lasers grew very incrementally on a sequential basis. Also on a year-over-year basis, while below 6-kilowatt lasers grew, I think, 24% or 25% year-over-year and about 10%, 15% sequentially. So that implies that China sales should have been strong. So I just want to double click and see the reasons if you can give us more around the softness in China cutting?"

The growth on a year-over-year basis was a bit lower than some other geographies, but don't forget that China had recovered already a significant round of revenue in the second quarter of 2020. So the comparison there is a bit more difficult. I wouldn't say I was not concerned about performance in China in Q2. In fact, bookings as well were strong. The issue is, is that I think a couple of companies even that have announced in the last couple of days have pointed out a weaker macro environment in China and even the government being concerned about a potential a bit more of a slowdown. Yes, we highlighted that on some of the PMI data that initially come out, I think, in April. 
So there is a bit of a concern that China is a bit weaker than expected. And that's clearly driving some of our expectations in addition to the supply chain constraints in  the third quarter. So I mean, bookings are good, but we expect those orders to be delivered over a slightly longer time than necessarily would have been if the demand environment has remained resilient or stronger. It's still resilient and stronger."

We are pleased to report another good quarter for IPG. Our second quarter revenue was significantly booked the same period of last year and increased from strong results in the prior quarter, driven by improved macroeconomic conditions in most major geographies, growth in emerging products as well as excellent execution by the IPG team.  
We saw higher end market demand for our core material processing product where our fiber lasers are replacing traditional tools and handheld welders and continue to pursue the opportunities in emerging markets. We remain focused on growing sales in applications that require innovative solutions, our expertise in fiber laser technology and superior quality of product, such as advanced applications, electric vehicle battery production, medical and microprocessing.  
Our technologies are transforming the way products are created, enabling production of smaller and more complex devices, improving the product we use every day and bringing advanced manufacturing capabilities to electric vehicle and renewable energy industries, helping to address climate change and sustainability initiatives.  
Our investment in new products and the applications are paying dividends. In the second quarter, emerging product sales increased 47% year-over-year and accounted for 29% of sales compared to 25% last year. We continue to focus on innovation at IPG and are working on potential for exciting new opportunities. I hope to share more details about these opportunities with you on our future calls.  
With that, I will turn the call over to Eugene Scherbakov."

During the quarter, we demonstrated excellent progress in our core material processing market across all major geographies, with accelerated growth in high power and ultra-high power lasers for cutting applications in the U.S. and Europe and strong growth in welding in China and Europe. We also delivered robust growth in emerging products and applications.  
Revenue from material processing applications increased 27% year-over-year and contributed 93% of total revenue in the quarter. Sales in welding application grew significantly in the last several quarters due to increased sales of our AMB, adjusted motor beam lasers, for general manufacturing purposes and electric vehicle battery welding applications.  
Battery manufacturers are facing challenges, welding together different type of materials such kind of copper, sulphur and aluminum. These materials are extremely same reflective and need to be welded with high precision and reliability. Each battery model requires hundreds of welds, and our AMB lasers can address these challenges, offering superior speed and weld quality or competence solution, this broad range of beam tunability and spotless welding.  
We also saw strong demand in emerging and micro material processing applications, such as solar cell manufacturing and 3D printing. Sales of our green pulsed lasers, which are used to improve solar efficiency, more than tripled compared to the prior year and becoming a more meaningful part of IPG's revenue. We are taking advantage of opportunity created by increased focus on sustainability globally and expect future solar cell manufacturing capacity to grow, driving additional sales in our green lasers. We are also increasing the pulse energy of the green lasers to enable next-generation applications in solar, drilling and copper welding for consumer electronics.  
Revenue from our other applications increased by 5% year-over-year. Medical sales showed a good growth, both year-over-year and sequentially, as a result of improved demand of our surgical lasers. Advanced application sales improved year-over-year, while telecom revenue declined compared to the same period in the prior year.  
Examining our performance by region. Our revenue in China increased 10% year-over-year in the second quarter, representing approximately 43% of our total sales. Year-over-year comparison for the region was more difficult as China sales rebounding from the pandemic earlier than other regions last year. We saw strong demand in welding application for our AMB and ultra-high power lasers while demand and cutting translate at the end of the quarter, so the sales of high-power lasers increased only slightly compared to the second quarter last year.  
We continue to see solid demand in foil cutting and welding applications related to electric vehicle batteries and also starting to see some demand for the LightWELD, compared by the welding system in China, which should provide a modest benefit to revenue in the second half. While China's market remains very price competitive, we have continued to be disciplined with our approach to pricing, given superior performance, quality, energy efficiency and reliability of our lasers.  
China remains a significant part of the customer base that is very focused on the price alone. Sales to the rest of Asia increased 123% year-over-year, with strong growth in Korea and other countries, offsetting lower revenue in Japan. We are seeing a strong demand for our welding and foil cutting solution for EV batteries in Korea and encourage by improved bookings in Japan.  
In Europe, revenue increased 50% year-over-year as we saw an acceleration of demand from customers in the region and strong growth in cutting, welding, marking and cleaning applications. Sales improved significantly in high power -- ultra-high power in AMB and QCW lasers. European cutting customers are moving into the ultra high-power lasers and are replacing CO2 laser with fiber lasers to improve productivity. Bookings for the region remain positive, pointing to continued recovery.  
Revenue in North America increased 23% year-over-year. Growth was primarily driven by material processing and increased sales of high-power lasers for cutting applications. Sales to automotive was traditional. Electrical and solar markets remain strong. We also saw solid improvement in micro material processing applications and strong growth in demand for LightWELD.  
Besides our normal direct sales model, we are leveraging the new third-party resales with numerous welding stores and new direct online sales platform for LightWELD in U.S. Laser system sales improved in the second quarter. This is both laser and nonlaser system, posting strong revenue growth. Booking remained high, and we expect to see additional improvement in system sales in the third quarter.  
We continue to benefit from our vertically integrated production model, which enable key technology advantages or the competition while minimizing the cost and supply chain disruptions. However, we did experience focus on certain components during the quarter and so increasing lead time that have impacted our and our customers' operations. We are also evaluating inflationary pressures on our input cost and [ we will deviate ] prior quotations when they expire. Despite this troubled years, we were able to deliver the revenue growth to the midpoint of our guidance and gross margin close to top or our expectations for the second quarter.  
IPG itself been a technology leader in fiber laser, more than 20 years. And none of our competitors have been able to match or approach the capability of our products. Restructuring development is our DNA. And we are continuing to focus on reducing the cost and improving the quality of our components and products. We are also committed to expanding the range of products and applications. We address by pushing on research and development project. By belief, we can commercialize in the near to midterm, which have significant market potential.  
We will continue to focus on opportunities where we can increase our value propositions to customers by delivering complete processing and technology solutions with our optical [ DWDM ] and system capability. I want to thank our employers through the execution during in the second quarter and thank our shareholders for your continued support.  
With that, I will turn the call over to Tim to discuss financial highlights in the quarter and third quarter outlook."

Revenue in the second quarter was $372 million which increased 25% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. Revenue from materials processing applications increased 27% year-over-year, and revenue from other applications increased 5%. 
Sales of high-power CW lasers increased 20% year-over-year and represented approximately 51% of total revenue. Sales of ultra-high power lasers at 6 kilowatts or greater represented 51% of total high-power CW laser sales and increased 15% compared to the prior year. 
Medium power laser sales increased 70% on growth in cutting, welding, 3D printing and semiconductor applications. QCW laser sales increased 13% year-over-year on higher demand from welding applications. Pulsed laser sales increased 45% year-over-year with strong growth in green pulsed laser used in solar cell manufacturing and higher sales of our infrared lasers for marking and cleaning applications as well as foil cutting applications in the electric vehicle batteries manufacturing process. 
System sales increased 19% year-over-year with improved sales for Genesis and ILT. Other product sales decreased 4% year-over-year. We estimate that supply chain constraints impacted our revenue by $7 million to $10 million in the quarter. 
Second quarter GAAP gross margin was 48.6%, an increase of 260 basis points year-over-year. Compared with the year ago period, the increase in gross margin was driven primarily by improved absorption of manufacturing expenses, partially offset by lower pricing and higher shipping costs as a percentage of sales. 
GAAP operating income was $92 million and operating margin was 24.8%. Second quarter net income was $70 million or $1.29 per diluted share. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 24%. 
During the quarter, we recognized a foreign exchange loss of $3 million, primarily related to the appreciation of the Russian ruble and euro, partially offset by the appreciation of the Chinese yuan. The foreign exchange loss reduced the EPS by $0.04. Exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar had been the same as 1 year ago, we would have expected revenue to be $23 million lower and gross profit to be $13 million lower. 
We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.5 billion and total debt of $36 million. Strong operational execution resulted in cash provided by operations of $116 million during the quarter. Capital expenditures were $27 million in the second quarter, and we now expect capital expenditures to be between $130 million and $150 million for the full year. During the quarter, we repurchased 185,000 shares for $39 million. 
Commenting on outlook for the next quarter. Second quarter book-to-bill remained above 1. While we expect continued improvement in sales outside of China, sales in China are likely to moderate in the third quarter due to more difficult comparisons and softer demand in cutting applications. However, displacement of nonlaser technologies, secular environmental trends and investments we have made in emerging products, mean that we continue to see growth opportunities in high-power cutting, foil cutting and welding applications for electric vehicle battery productions as well as opportunities in solar cell manufacturing, medical procedures and advanced applications. We also see LightWELD sales gaining traction in multiple geographies in the second half of the year. 
For the third quarter of 2021, IPG expects revenue of $350 million to $380 million, which implies a 15% year-over-year growth at the midpoint despite more difficult third quarter year-over-year comparisons, softness in the cutting market in China and ongoing supply chain constraints. The company expects the third quarter tax rate to be approximately 25%, excluding any discrete items. 
IPG anticipates delivering earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.10 to $1.40 with 53.5 million basic common shares outstanding and 54 million diluted common shares outstanding. I would like to remind you that financial guidance provided this quarter continues to be subject to greater risk and uncertainty, given the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated impacts to the global business environment, public health requirements and government mandates. Please refer to the safe harbor passage of today's earnings press release for more details on risks and uncertainties associated with our forward-looking statements.

If we go back a quarter ago, I think you were talking about macro indicators showing signs of weakness, but I think your data points were strong. We were talking about strong freight agreements that were tied usually to high demand for ultra-high power lasers. If I look at the high-power sales and breaking down between ultra-high power and the low 6-kilowatt, we can see that ultra-high power lasers grew very incrementally on a sequential basis. Also on a year-over-year basis, while below 6-kilowatt lasers grew, I think, 24% or 25% year-over-year and about 10%, 15% sequentially. So that implies that China sales should have been strong.

The growth on a year-over-year basis was a bit lower than some other geographies, but don't forget that China had recovered already a significant round of revenue in the second quarter of 2020. So the comparison there is a bit more difficult. I wouldn't say, I was not concerned about performance in China in Q2. In fact, bookings as well were strong. The issue is, is that I think a couple of companies even that have announced in the last couple of days have pointed out a weaker macro environment in China and even the government being concerned about a potential a bit more of a slowdown. Yes, we highlighted that on some of the PMI data that had initially come out, I think, in April. 
So there is a bit of a concern that China is a bit weaker than expected. And that's clearly driving some of our expectations in addition to the supply chain constraints in  the third quarter. So I mean, bookings are good, but we expect those orders to be delivered over a slightly longer time than necessarily would have been if the demand environment had remained resilient or stronger. It's still resilient and stronger."

We're developed now with this new process for cutting. That's a very sick metal. Recorded number only 7 years, 5, 7 years ago there was expert technical which was set, all fiber lasers volume for few millimeters which should -- may we replace it with even 5 millimeters. Now we develop growth system, we develop machinery which cutting 2, 20 millimeters is still much faster, and much higher quality than plasma cutting. Never before plasma cutting as they use laser for our 20 millimeters, and 25, 30 millimeters. 
Now we heard such process, we heard them unit in exhibition and one, the new distribution we will demonstrate new machine with fantastic speed and quality or we expect obsolete machine prototype which they never -- did not even -- we're making the samples they did not give away -- without any correction now. 
This -- but such that now -- but one such machine we replace in this new application of cutting instead of plasma cutting, also very serious market, and we developed this process, introduced market, new application. We develop application for with the green -- curable green lasers, for example, also for cutting the thin metals, so very high very production metals and for micro cutting from medical and others, it's also very interestingly new markets. So all time we develop new yield process, not commodity like China. China maybe invest -- single time dream this end. So it's not a high-tech product. It's not high-tech product.

We are pleased to report another good quarter for IPG. Our second quarter revenue was significantly booked the same period of last year and increased from strong results in the prior quarter, driven by improved macroeconomic conditions in most major geographies, growth in emerging products as well as excellent execution by the IPG team.  
We saw higher end market demand for our core material processing product where our fiber lasers are replacing traditional tools and handheld welders and continue to pursue the opportunities in emerging markets. We remain focused on growing sales in applications that require innovative solutions, our expertise in fiber laser technology and superior quality of product, such as advanced applications, electric vehicle battery production, medical and microprocessing.  
Our technologies are transforming the way products are created, enabling production of smaller and more complex devices, improving the product we use every day and bringing advanced manufacturing capabilities to electric vehicle and renewable energy industries, helping to address climate change and sustainability initiatives.  
Our investment in new products and the applications are paying dividends. In the second quarter, emerging product sales increased 47% year-over-year and accounted for 29% of sales compared to 25% last year.

During the quarter, we demonstrated excellent progress in our core material processing market across all major geographies, with accelerated growth in high power and ultra-high power lasers for cutting applications in the U.S. and Europe and strong growth in welding in China and Europe. We also delivered robust growth in emerging products and applications.  
Revenue from material processing applications increased 27% year-over-year and contributed 93% of total revenue in the quarter. Sales in welding application grew significantly in the last several quarters due to increased sales of our AMB, adjusted motor beam lasers, for general manufacturing purposes and electric vehicle battery welding applications.  
Battery manufacturers are facing challenges, welding together different type of materials such kind of copper, sulphur and aluminum. These materials are extremely same reflective and need to be welded with high precision and reliability. Each battery model requires hundreds of welds, and our AMB lasers can address these challenges, offering superior speed and weld quality or competence solution, this broad range of beam tunability and spotless welding.  
We also saw strong demand in emerging and micro material processing applications, such as solar cell manufacturing and 3D printing. Sales of our green pulsed lasers, which are used to improve solar efficiency, more than tripled compared to the prior year and becoming a more meaningful part of IPG's revenue. We are taking advantage of opportunity created by increased focus on sustainability globally and expect future solar cell manufacturing capacity to grow, driving additional sales in our green lasers. We are also increasing the pulse energy of the green lasers to enable next-generation applications in solar, drilling and copper welding for consumer electronics.  
Revenue from our other applications increased by 5% year-over-year. Medical sales showed a good growth, both year-over-year and sequentially, as a result of improved demand of our surgical lasers. Advanced application sales improved year-over-year, while telecom revenue declined compared to the same period in the prior year.  
Examining our performance by region. Our revenue in China increased 10% year-over-year in the second quarter, representing approximately 43% of our total sales. Year-over-year comparison for the region was more difficult as China sales rebounding from the pandemic earlier than other regions last year. We saw strong demand in welding application for our AMB and ultra-high power lasers while demand and cutting translate at the end of the quarter, so the sales of high-power lasers increased only slightly compared to the second quarter last year.  
We continue to see solid demand in foil cutting and welding applications related to electric vehicle batteries and also starting to see some demand for the LightWELD, compared by the welding system in China, which should provide a modest benefit to revenue in the second half. While China's market remains very price competitive, we have continued to be disciplined with our approach to pricing, given superior performance, quality, energy efficiency and reliability of our lasers.  
China remains a significant part of the customer base that is very focused on the price alone. Sales to the rest of Asia increased 123% year-over-year, with strong growth in Korea and other countries, offsetting lower revenue in Japan. We are seeing a strong demand for our welding and foil cutting solution for EV batteries in Korea and encourage by improved bookings in Japan.  
In Europe, revenue increased 50% year-over-year as we saw an acceleration of demand from customers in the region and strong growth in cutting, welding, marking and cleaning applications. Sales improved significantly in high power -- ultra-high power in AMB and QCW lasers. European cutting customers are moving into the ultra high-power lasers and are replacing CO2 laser with fiber lasers to improve productivity. Bookings for the region remain positive, pointing to continued recovery.  
Revenue in North America increased 23% year-over-year. Growth was primarily driven by material processing and increased sales of high-power lasers for cutting applications. Sales to automotive was traditional. Electrical and solar markets remain strong. We also saw solid improvement in micro material processing applications and strong growth in demand for LightWELD.  
Besides our normal direct sales model, we are leveraging the new third-party resales with numerous welding stores and new direct online sales platform for LightWELD in U.S. Laser system sales improved in the second quarter. This is both laser and nonlaser system, posting strong revenue growth. Booking remained high, and we expect to see additional improvement in system sales in the third quarter.  
We continue to benefit from our vertically integrated production model, which enable key technology advantages or the competition while minimizing the cost and supply chain disruptions. However, we did experience focus on certain components during the quarter and so increasing lead time that have impacted our and our customers' operations. We are also evaluating inflationary pressures on our input cost and [ we will deviate ] prior quotations when they expire. Despite this troubled years, we were able to deliver the revenue growth to the midpoint of our guidance and gross margin close to top or our expectations for the second quarter.  
IPG itself been a technology leader in fiber laser, more than 20 years. And none of our competitors have been able to match or approach the capability of our products. Restructuring development is our DNA. And we are continuing to focus on reducing the cost and improving the quality of our components and products. We are also committed to expanding the range of products and applications. We address by pushing on research and development project. By belief, we can commercialize in the near to midterm, which have significant market potential.  
We will continue to focus on opportunities where we can increase our value propositions to customers by delivering complete processing and technology solutions with our optical [ DWDM ] and system capability. I want to thank our employers through the execution during in the second quarter and thank our shareholders for your continued support.  
With that, I will turn the call over to Tim to discuss financial highlights in the quarter and third quarter outlook."

Revenue in the second quarter was $372 million which increased 25% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. Revenue from materials processing applications increased 27% year-over-year, and revenue from other applications increased 5%. 
Sales of high-power CW lasers increased 20% year-over-year and represented approximately 51% of total revenue. Sales of ultra-high power lasers at 6 kilowatts or greater represented 51% of total high-power CW laser sales and increased 15% compared to the prior year. 
Medium power laser sales increased 70% on growth in cutting, welding, 3D printing and semiconductor applications. QCW laser sales increased 13% year-over-year on higher demand from welding applications. Pulsed laser sales increased 45% year-over-year with strong growth in green pulsed laser used in solar cell manufacturing and higher sales of our infrared lasers for marking and cleaning applications as well as foil cutting applications in the electric vehicle batteries manufacturing process. 
System sales increased 19% year-over-year with improved sales for Genesis and ILT. Other product sales decreased 4% year-over-year. We estimate that supply chain constraints impacted our revenue by $7 million to $10 million in the quarter. 
Second quarter GAAP gross margin was 48.6%, an increase of 260 basis points year-over-year. Compared with the year ago period, the increase in gross margin was driven primarily by improved absorption of manufacturing expenses, partially offset by lower pricing and higher shipping costs as a percentage of sales. 
GAAP operating income was $92 million and operating margin was 24.8%. Second quarter net income was $70 million or $1.29 per diluted share. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 24%. 
During the quarter, we recognized a foreign exchange loss of $3 million, primarily related to the appreciation of the Russian ruble and euro, partially offset by the appreciation of the Chinese yuan. The foreign exchange loss reduced the EPS by $0.04. Exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar had been the same as 1 year ago, we would have expected revenue to be $23 million lower and gross profit to be $13 million lower. 
We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.5 billion and total debt of $36 million. Strong operational execution resulted in cash provided by operations of $116 million during the quarter. Capital expenditures were $27 million in the second quarter, and we now expect capital expenditures to be between $130 million and $150 million for the full year. During the quarter, we repurchased 185,000 shares for $39 million. 
Commenting on outlook for the next quarter. Second quarter book-to-bill remained above 1. While we expect continued improvement in sales outside of China, sales in China are likely to moderate in the third quarter due to more difficult comparisons and softer demand in cutting applications. However, displacement of nonlaser technologies, secular environmental trends and investments we have made in emerging products, mean that we continue to see growth opportunities in high-power cutting, foil cutting and welding applications for electric vehicle battery productions as well as opportunities in solar cell manufacturing, medical procedures and advanced applications. We also see LightWELD sales gaining traction in multiple geographies in the second half of the year. 
For the third quarter of 2021, IPG expects revenue of $350 million to $380 million, which implies a 15% year-over-year growth at the midpoint despite more difficult third quarter year-over-year comparisons, softness in the cutting market in China and ongoing supply chain constraints. The company expects the third quarter tax rate to be approximately 25%, excluding any discrete items. 
IPG anticipates delivering earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.10 to $1.40 with 53.5 million basic common shares outstanding and 54 million diluted common shares outstanding. I would like to remind you that financial guidance provided this quarter continues to be subject to greater risk and uncertainty, given the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated impacts to the global business environment, public health requirements and government mandates. Please refer to the safe harbor passage of today's earnings press release for more details on risks and uncertainties associated with our forward-looking statements.

If we go back a quarter ago, I think you were talking about macro indicators showing signs of weakness, but I think your data points were strong. We were talking about strong freight agreements that were tied usually to high demand for ultra-high power lasers. If I look at the high-power sales and breaking down between ultra-high power and the low 6-kilowatt, we can see that ultra-high power lasers grew very incrementally on a sequential basis. Also on a year-over-year basis, while below 6-kilowatt lasers grew, I think, 24% or 25% year-over-year and about 10%, 15% sequentially. So that implies that China sales should have been strong.

The growth on a year-over-year basis was a bit lower than some other geographies, but don't forget that China had recovered already a significant round of revenue in the second quarter of 2020. So the comparison there is a bit more difficult. I wouldn't say, I was not concerned about performance in China in Q2. In fact, bookings as well were strong. The issue is, is that I think a couple of companies even that have announced in the last couple of days have pointed out a weaker macro environment in China and even the government being concerned about a potential a bit more of a slowdown. Yes, we highlighted that on some of the PMI data that had initially come out, I think, in April. 
So there is a bit of a concern that China is a bit weaker than expected. And that's clearly driving some of our expectations in addition to the supply chain constraints in  the third quarter. So I mean, bookings are good, but we expect those orders to be delivered over a slightly longer time than necessarily would have been if the demand environment had remained resilient or stronger.

We're developed now with this new process for cutting. That's a very sick metal. Recorded number only 7 years, 5, 7 years ago there was expert technical which was set, all fiber lasers volume for few millimeters which should -- may we replace it with even 5 millimeters. Now we develop growth system, we develop machinery which cutting 2, 20 millimeters is still much faster, and much higher quality than plasma cutting. Never before plasma cutting as they use laser for our 20 millimeters, and 25, 30 millimeters. 
Now we heard such process, we heard them unit in exhibition and one, the new distribution we will demonstrate new machine with fantastic speed and quality or we expect obsolete machine prototype which they never -- did not even -- we're making the samples they did not give away -- without any correction now. 
This -- but such that now -- but one such machine we replace in this new application of cutting instead of plasma cutting, also very serious market, and we developed this process, introduced market, new application. We develop application for with the green -- curable green lasers, for example, also for cutting the thin metals, so very high very production metals and for micro cutting from medical and others, it's also very interestingly new markets. So all time we develop new yield process, not commodity like China. China maybe invest -- single time dream this end. So it's not a high-tech product. It's not high-tech product. It's commodity product. We're not allowed to go to commodity with variable margin where for the -- with high-tech company, unique high-tech companies."

I'm not going to core drawn on like guidance for 2022 at this point in time. But if global GDP remains strong, the underlying materials processing markets particularly with some of the growth coming from other areas and welding has been a standout performer, not just on EV, but in other areas, recovery and additive, ablative processes for cleaning, the foil cutting applications and even the other cutting applications. Generally, that market will grow at a significant premium to global GDP, sometimes as much as twice that amount. And then you have expected growth from some of our new and emerging products to be additive to that, like medical, for example, ultrafast, microprocessing applications, the systems business and accessories and other areas.

During the quarter, we demonstrated excellent progress in our core material processing market across all major geographies, with accelerated growth in high power and ultra-high power lasers for cutting applications in the U.S. and Europe and strong growth in welding in China and Europe. We also delivered robust growth in emerging products and applications.  
Revenue from material processing applications increased 27% year-over-year and contributed 93% of total revenue in the quarter. Sales in welding application grew significantly in the last several quarters due to increased sales of our AMB, adjusted motor beam lasers, for general manufacturing purposes and electric vehicle battery welding applications.  
Battery manufacturers are facing challenges, welding together different type of materials such kind of copper, sulphur and aluminum. These materials are extremely same reflective and need to be welded with high precision and reliability. Each battery model requires hundreds of welds, and our AMB lasers can address these challenges, offering superior speed and weld quality or competence solution, this broad range of beam tunability and spotless welding.  
We also saw strong demand in emerging and micro material processing applications, such as solar cell manufacturing and 3D printing. Sales of our green pulsed lasers, which are used to improve solar efficiency, more than tripled compared to the prior year and becoming a more meaningful part of IPG's revenue. We are taking advantage of opportunity created by increased focus on sustainability globally and expect future solar cell manufacturing capacity to grow, driving additional sales in our green lasers. We are also increasing the pulse energy of the green lasers to enable next-generation applications in solar, drilling and copper welding for consumer electronics.  
Revenue from our other applications increased by 5% year-over-year. Medical sales showed a good growth, both year-over-year and sequentially, as a result of improved demand of our surgical lasers. Advanced application sales improved year-over-year, while telecom revenue declined compared to the same period in the prior year.  
Examining our performance by region. Our revenue in China increased 10% year-over-year in the second quarter, representing approximately 43% of our total sales. Year-over-year comparison for the region was more difficult as China sales rebounding from the pandemic earlier than other regions last year. We saw strong demand in welding application for our AMB and ultra-high power lasers while demand and cutting translate at the end of the quarter, so the sales of high-power lasers increased only slightly compared to the second quarter last year.  
We continue to see solid demand in foil cutting and welding applications related to electric vehicle batteries and also starting to see some demand for the LightWELD, compared by the welding system in China, which should provide a modest benefit to revenue in the second half. While China's market remains very price competitive, we have continued to be disciplined with our approach to pricing, given superior performance, quality, energy efficiency and reliability of our lasers.  
China remains a significant part of the customer base that is very focused on the price alone. Sales to the rest of Asia increased 123% year-over-year, with strong growth in Korea and other countries, offsetting lower revenue in Japan. We are seeing a strong demand for our welding and foil cutting solution for EV batteries in Korea and encourage by improved bookings in Japan.  
In Europe, revenue increased 50% year-over-year as we saw an acceleration of demand from customers in the region and strong growth in cutting, welding, marking and cleaning applications. Sales improved significantly in high power -- ultra-high power in AMB and QCW lasers. European cutting customers are moving into the ultra high-power lasers and are replacing CO2 laser with fiber lasers to improve productivity. Bookings for the region remain positive, pointing to continued recovery.  
Revenue in North America increased 23% year-over-year. Growth was primarily driven by material processing and increased sales of high-power lasers for cutting applications. Sales to automotive was traditional. Electrical and solar markets remain strong. We also saw solid improvement in micro material processing applications and strong growth in demand for LightWELD.  
Besides our normal direct sales model, we are leveraging the new third-party resales with numerous welding stores and new direct online sales platform for LightWELD in U.S. Laser system sales improved in the second quarter. This is both laser and nonlaser system, posting strong revenue growth. Booking remained high, and we expect to see additional improvement in system sales in the third quarter.  
We continue to benefit from our vertically integrated production model, which enable key technology advantages or the competition while minimizing the cost and supply chain disruptions. However, we did experience focus on certain components during the quarter and so increasing lead time that have impacted our and our customers' operations. We are also evaluating inflationary pressures on our input cost and [ we will deviate ] prior quotations when they expire. Despite this troubled years, we were able to deliver the revenue growth to the midpoint of our guidance and gross margin close to top or our expectations for the second quarter.  
IPG itself been a technology leader in fiber laser, more than 20 years. And none of our competitors have been able to match or approach the capability of our products. Restructuring development is our DNA. And we are continuing to focus on reducing the cost and improving the quality of our components and products. We are also committed to expanding the range of products and applications. We address by pushing on research and development project. By belief, we can commercialize in the near to midterm, which have significant market potential.  
We will continue to focus on opportunities where we can increase our value propositions to customers by delivering complete processing and technology solutions with our optical [ DWDM ] and system capability. I want to thank our employers through the execution during in the second quarter and thank our shareholders for your continued support.  
With that, I will turn the call over to Tim to discuss financial highlights in the quarter and third quarter outlook."

Revenue in the second quarter was $372 million which increased 25% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. Revenue from materials processing applications increased 27% year-over-year, and revenue from other applications increased 5%. 
Sales of high-power CW lasers increased 20% year-over-year and represented approximately 51% of total revenue. Sales of ultra-high power lasers at 6 kilowatts or greater represented 51% of total high-power CW laser sales and increased 15% compared to the prior year. 
Medium power laser sales increased 70% on growth in cutting, welding, 3D printing and semiconductor applications. QCW laser sales increased 13% year-over-year on higher demand from welding applications. Pulsed laser sales increased 45% year-over-year with strong growth in green pulsed laser used in solar cell manufacturing and higher sales of our infrared lasers for marking and cleaning applications as well as foil cutting applications in the electric vehicle batteries manufacturing process. 
System sales increased 19% year-over-year with improved sales for Genesis and ILT. Other product sales decreased 4% year-over-year. We estimate that supply chain constraints impacted our revenue by $7 million to $10 million in the quarter. 
Second quarter GAAP gross margin was 48.6%, an increase of 260 basis points year-over-year. Compared with the year ago period, the increase in gross margin was driven primarily by improved absorption of manufacturing expenses, partially offset by lower pricing and higher shipping costs as a percentage of sales. 
GAAP operating income was $92 million and operating margin was 24.8%. Second quarter net income was $70 million or $1.29 per diluted share. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 24%. 
During the quarter, we recognized a foreign exchange loss of $3 million, primarily related to the appreciation of the Russian ruble and euro, partially offset by the appreciation of the Chinese yuan. The foreign exchange loss reduced the EPS by $0.04. Exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar had been the same as 1 year ago, we would have expected revenue to be $23 million lower and gross profit to be $13 million lower. 
We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.5 billion and total debt of $36 million. Strong operational execution resulted in cash provided by operations of $116 million during the quarter. Capital expenditures were $27 million in the second quarter, and we now expect capital expenditures to be between $130 million and $150 million for the full year. During the quarter, we repurchased 185,000 shares for $39 million. 
Commenting on outlook for the next quarter. Second quarter book-to-bill remained above 1. While we expect continued improvement in sales outside of China, sales in China are likely to moderate in the third quarter due to more difficult comparisons and softer demand in cutting applications. However, displacement of nonlaser technologies, secular environmental trends and investments we have made in emerging products, mean that we continue to see growth opportunities in high-power cutting, foil cutting and welding applications for electric vehicle battery productions as well as opportunities in solar cell manufacturing, medical procedures and advanced applications. We also see LightWELD sales gaining traction in multiple geographies in the second half of the year. 
For the third quarter of 2021, IPG expects revenue of $350 million to $380 million, which implies a 15% year-over-year growth at the midpoint despite more difficult third quarter year-over-year comparisons, softness in the cutting market in China and ongoing supply chain constraints. The company expects the third quarter tax rate to be approximately 25%, excluding any discrete items. 
IPG anticipates delivering earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.10 to $1.40 with 53.5 million basic common shares outstanding and 54 million diluted common shares outstanding. I would like to remind you that financial guidance provided this quarter continues to be subject to greater risk and uncertainty, given the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated impacts to the global business environment, public health requirements and government mandates. Please refer to the safe harbor passage of today's earnings press release for more details on risks and uncertainties associated with our forward-looking statements.

If we go back a quarter ago, I think you were talking about macro indicators showing signs of weakness, but I think your data points were strong. We were talking about strong freight agreements that were tied usually to high demand for ultra-high power lasers. If I look at the high-power sales and breaking down between ultra-high power and the low 6-kilowatt, we can see that ultra-high power lasers grew very incrementally on a sequential basis. Also on a year-over-year basis, while below 6-kilowatt lasers grew, I think, 24% or 25% year-over-year and about 10%, 15% sequentially. So that implies that China sales should have been strong.

The growth on a year-over-year basis was a bit lower than some other geographies, but don't forget that China had recovered already a significant round of revenue in the second quarter of 2020. So the comparison there is a bit more difficult. I wouldn't say, I was not concerned about performance in China in Q2. In fact, bookings as well were strong. The issue is, is that I think a couple of companies even that have announced in the last couple of days have pointed out a weaker macro environment in China and even the government being concerned about a potential a bit more of a slowdown. Yes, we highlighted that on some of the PMI data that had initially come out, I think, in April. 
So there is a bit of a concern that China is a bit weaker than expected. And that's clearly driving some of our expectations in addition to the supply chain constraints in  the third quarter. So I mean, bookings are good, but we expect those orders to be delivered over a slightly longer time than necessarily would have been if the demand environment had remained resilient or stronger.

Now it's not only China, many other country now especially after the trade kind of regulation were destroyed towards last year.

Now they return to this situation, which was 20 years, 30 years ago. When even laser from Germany was very difficult to sell in the U.S. due to many regulation, which create because to Europe to sell a quality product to U.S. Now situation returned to their at least 20 years ago in billing [indiscernible] what it had made -- it perhaps with a new policy of government destroy, aviation, trade relations, regulation between worldwide regulation which were created in the last 20 years.

We're developed now with this new process for cutting. That's a very sick metal.

Now we develop growth system, we develop machinery which cutting 2, 20 millimeters is still much faster, and much higher quality than plasma cutting. Never before plasma cutting as they use laser for our 20 millimeters, and 25, 30 millimeters.

This -- but such that now -- but one such machine we replace in this new application of cutting instead of plasma cutting, also very serious market, and we developed this process, introduced market, new application. We develop application for with the green -- curable green lasers, for example, also for cutting the thin metals, so very high very production metals and for micro cutting from medical and others, it's also very interestingly new markets.

We are deeply saddened by the passing of [indiscernible] the founder and Executive Chairman of IPG. This is a tremendous lost for our company and the [indiscernible] community, which benefited greatly from his technical innovations and strategic reason. Because of his region and [indiscernible] work, finalize has become cost-effective, reliable and effective tools that have mass applications in global industrial production, enable automation, efficiency and development of new products. It was recognized as other of the fiber laser industry and great entrepreneur. 
Following his footsteps, we will continue to focus on innovation and internally in manufacturing and research and development capabilities to make the highest quality components as the most reliable products. At IPG, we are also exploring new markets and applications where [indiscernible] can replace existing laser and non-laser technologies by improving efficiency, productivity or enabling technological breakthrough for our customers. 
Our technology are playing well in those major microtrends and include investments in electrical vehicles and renewable energy as well as focus on energy efficiency, industrial automation and [indiscernible] transforms products are created. As a part of our strategy, we have been diversified away from the high competitive and more cyclical cutting market in China, and our results this quarter demonstrated successful execution of this strategy. We are pleased to deliver third quarter revenue and EPS at the top end of our guidance. Results were driven there by strong growth in welding market, 3D printing and as well as the clean semiconductors and a number of other products and applications. 
Demand from IPG laser continued to improve in North America and Europe, with both welding and cutting applications showed a solid growth. We've also seen increased orders and business activity in Japan. These geographies continues to recover from pandemic and so increased investment in new factories and automation. We are benefiting from widespread investments in electric vehicles production globally. Our lasers are used in relative welding, for cutting and cleaning applications for even battery manufacturing. We are also seeing opportunity for laser-welding NAV motor assembly and body-in-white applications. These investments are likely to continue for the next 3, 5 years as automotive manufacturer address the need for EV batteries and new technologies in order to meet agree global carbon emission standards. We are excited about increased demand we are seeing in [indiscernible] product and applications, which contributed just under 30% of our total revenue this quarter with record sales in [indiscernible] lasers and medical and strong growth in high-power pulsed lasers. Both AMB and high-power pulsed lasers are benefiting from increased investment in EV battery capacity worldwide. [indiscernible] are rapidly gaining adoption and both our thulium laser and IPG disposable fibers are considering the new gold standard in the industry. I believe that our medical business will continue to grow significantly, potentially doubling in size over the next 2 to 3 years. 
One of our newest product is [indiscernible], which had launched earlier this year is weaning widespread interest and gaining significant traction in welding community. The launch of our new and improved version of LightWELD in September. It also has cleaning capability in addition to [indiscernible] building parameters. Some customers may choose LightWELD for a clear future, as it can save time, money and reduce cost considerables. LightWELD was the highlight of our presentation at [indiscernible] this year, and we coin agreements with national-wide distributors that depart hundreds of wells in retail stores and the United States. We currently expect to sell tens of thousands of [indiscernible] plate system in the next 3, 5 years. As expected, we saw softer demand condition in China cutting market during the third quarter. The continuation of moderated demand environment driven by widespread supply chain issues, high shipping cost and power shortage as well as a more aggressive price competition from local manufacturers, negatively impacted demand for cutting applications in China [indiscernible]. 
At the same time, we are seeing a record demand in wellness in China as a result of strong sales and EV battery applications and increased revenue from marking and [indiscernible]. In several cases, we saw customers are coming back to IPG after lower-cost local suppliers didn't make customer quality and technical support expectations. We continue to benefit from our vertically integrated product model, which enabled technological advantage while minimizing the supply chain disruptions. However, we have been seeing some impact on our -- and our customer creation from ongoing supply chain issues worldwide, which were able to successfully overcome this quarter. 
As we announced earlier, the Board selected John Pillar as a long executive chair. John has served as Lead Independent Director since 2017. -- and his appointment provides continuous steadier stability as we have worked together well over the years. This deployment continue to separate Q1 [indiscernible] that started in May 2021. And I'm looking forward to working with John and [indiscernible]. With that, I will turn the call to Tim to discuss financial highlights in the quarter and fourth quarter outlook."

My comments generally will follow the earnings call presentation, which is available on our website. I will start with the financial review on Slide 3. 
Revenue in the third quarter was $379 million, which increased 19% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Third quarter GAAP gross margin was 49%, an increase of 100 basis points year-over-year. Compared with the year ago period, the increase in gross margin was driven primarily by lower inventory provisions and a reduction of unabsorbed manufacturing expenses as a percent of sales. GAAP operating income was $102 million and operating margin was 26.9%. Third quarter net income was $75 million or $1.40 per diluted share. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 26%. 
As a reminder, last year's results were negatively impacted by a goodwill impairment charge of $45 million. During the quarter, we recognized an after-tax foreign exchange gain of $2 million or $0.04 per diluted share primarily related to the depreciation of the euro and Chinese yuan. Exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar had been the same as 1 year ago, we would have expected revenue to be $9 million lower and gross profit to be $6 million lower. 
Moving to Slide 4. Sales of high-power CW lasers decreased 4% year-over-year and represented approximately 47% of total revenue. Sales of ultra-high power lasers at 6 kilowatts or greater represented 51% of total high-power CW sales. Medium power laser sales increased 109% on growth in cutting, welding, 3D printing and semiconductor applications. QCW laser sales increased 8% year-over-year on higher demand from marking engraving and drilling applications. Pulsed laser sales, including high-power pulsed lasers, increased 69% year-over-year, with strong growth in foil cutting applications for EV battery manufacturing, solar cell applications as well as higher sales of our infrared lasers for marking and cleaning. 
System sales increased 56% year-over-year with improved revenues for Genesis and IoT and a ramp-up in LightWELD sales. Other product sales increased 58% year-over-year, benefiting from higher sales in medical and beam delivery. Examining our performance by region on Slide 5. Revenue in North America increased 55% year-over-year, driven by materials processing with growth in welding and increased sales of high-power lasers for cutting applications. We also saw record quarterly revenue in Medical as our products continue to gain acceptance. System sales improved in the third quarter with both laser and non-laser systems posting strong revenue growth. 
In Europe, revenue increased 50% year-over-year driven by accelerated demand in cutting and welding applications as well as strong growth in marketing and additive applications. Our revenue in China decreased 7% year-over-year in the third quarter, representing approximately 36% of total sales. Soft sales of high-power lasers and cutting applications more than offset higher demand in welding applications, high-power pulsed lasers for foil cutting and growth in marketing and additive applications. Sales in Japan were up 11%, and revenue in the rest of Asia increased 15% year-over-year. 
Moving to a summary of our balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 6. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.5 billion and total debt of $35 million. Strong operational execution resulted in cash provided by operations of $102 million during the quarter. For our cash deployment, capital expenditures were $40 million in the third quarter, and we expect capital expenditures to be between $130 million and $150 million for the full year. During the quarter, we repurchased 200,000 shares for $36 million and have bought approximately another 135,000 shares so far in the fourth quarter. 
Commenting on outlook for the next quarter. Third quarter book-to-bill remained above 1. We expect stable demand in North America and Europe and continue to see growth opportunities in welding and high-power cutting in North America and Europe, foil cutting and welding applications for EV battery production across many geographies as well as opportunities in solar cell manufacturing, medical procedures and advanced applications. We also see LightWELD sales continue to gain traction. However, sales in China will be down sequentially in the fourth quarter due to soft demand in cutting applications. Uncertainty due to supply chain issues and power outages that may impact demand for our products as well as ongoing competitive pressures. 
For the fourth quarter of 2021, IPG expects revenue of $330 million to $360 million. The company expects the fourth quarter tax rate to be approximately 25%, excluding any discrete items. IPG anticipates delivering earnings per diluted share in the range of $1 to $1.30 with approximately 54 million diluted shares outstanding. 
I would like to remind you that financial guidance provided this quarter continues to be subject to greater risk and uncertainty, given the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated impacts to the global business environment, supply chain, public health requirements and government mandates. Please refer to the safe harbor passage of today's earnings press release for more details on risks and uncertainties associated with our forward-looking statements. And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions."

And clearly, EV battery applications are a very strong driver of growth. We're actually really pleased as well. We've got some good demand coming from additive applications there, which are with lower power, but very high-quality lasers. So competitively, that's been a very positive trend. And the other good positive trend, I think, was on some of the marking engraving applications, which are increasingly being used in automated production lines and therefore, where the quality of the laser is very important, that also performed well there. So other applications outside of cutting were more than robust. I'd say they are good."

The second -- there's probably two or three more drivers. So with slightly lower sales of cutting applications in China and higher sales of other applications. We generally have a mix benefit from that. In addition, you've got a geographic mix benefit with some of the stronger sales in Europe and North America around both cutting and other applications, those are also a benefit. And then we've got sort of strong sales coming out of areas like medical and even some of the semiconductor applications.

Overall, though, we remain really quite optimistic about next year. You've got major growth drivers that we talked about sort of macro trends out there with EV battery manufacturing, EV motor manufacturing body and white applications, new product introductions in the other parts of the welding market with Light well, growth in medical applications, high-power cutting market transitioning to much higher power levels globally as well as in China. We're going to start rolling out our ultra compact laser at higher power levels than 1 and 1.5 kilowatts. So transitioning during the course of the year, early on in the year to 3 and 6-kilowatt and then ultimately, probably in the second half of the year to 8-kilowatt with the ultracompact device. So there's a whole host of different applications that we think are going to really make next year an interesting and exciting one. even from a geographic perspective, you continue to see sort of robust economic data in North America and Europe, but maybe a little bit of a moderation, but not fundamental shift.

And then there continues to be a higher -- this is on the cutting side of things. There continues to be a high end of the market that generally serves higher volume manufacturing and automated manufacturing systems where reliability is very key to the system. So for example, in the production line, if you have downtime of even a few hours, not even a day, the cost of that downtime will be way in excess of the cost of the laser, right? So it's in those areas that we continue to focus on where our share continues to be very high. It's kind of a bit of a [indiscernible] victory trying to play within the very high-volume low end of the market. What we did say, though, is that as we expand the offering of our ultracompact lower-cost lasers, there's certainly an opportunity to increase our share as we go to 3, 6 and ultimately 8 [indiscernible] there. And then in the rest of the China market, you're dealing with much more sophisticated applications and where our competitive products are significantly better.

We are deeply saddened by the passing of Valentin Gapontsev, the founder and Executive Chairman of IPG. This is a tremendous loss for our company and the broader photonics community, which benefited greatly from his technical innovations and strategic vision. Because of his vision and relentless work, fibre lasers have become cost-effective, reliable and effective tools that have mass applications in global industrial production, enabling automation, efficiency and development of new products. He was recognized as the father of the fiber laser industry and a great entrepreneur. Following his footsteps, we will continue to focus on innovation and invest internally in manufacturing and research and development capabilities to make the highest quality components and the most reliable products. 
At IPG, we are also exploring new markets and applications where fibre lasers can replace existing laser and non-laser technologies by improving efficiency, productivity or enabling technological breakthroughs for our customers. Our technologies are playing well in those major macro trends that include investments in electrical vehicles and renewable energy as well as focus on energy efficiency, industrial automation and miniaturization, which are transforming the way products are created. As a part of our strategy, we have been diversifying away from the highly competitive and more cyclical cutting market in China, and our results this quarter demonstrated successful execution of this strategy. 
We are pleased to deliver third quarter revenue and EPS at the top end of our guidance. Results were driven by strong growth in welding, marking, 3D printing and as well as cleaning, semiconductor and a number of other new products and applications. 
Demand for IPG lasers continued to improve in North America and Europe, with both welding and cutting applications showing solid growth. We are also seeing increased orders and business activity in Japan. These geographies continues to recover from the pandemic and saw increased investment in new factories and automation. 
We are benefiting from widespread investments in electric vehicles production globally. Our lasers are used in a variety of welding, foil cutting and cleaning applications for EV battery manufacturing. We are also seeing opportunities for laser-welding in EV motor assembly and body-in-white applications. These investments are likely to continue for the next 3 to 5 years as automotive manufacturers address the need for EV batteries and new technologies in order to meet agressive global carbon emission standards. 
We are excited about increased demand we are seeing in emerging products and applications, which contributed just under 30% of our total revenue this quarter with record sales in AMB lasers and medical and strong growth in high-power pulsed lasers. Both AMB and high-power pulsed lasers are benefiting from increased investment in EV battery capacity worldwide. 
Our medical products are rapidly gaining adoption and both our thulium laser and IPG disposable fibers are considered the new gold standard in the industry. We believe that our medical business will continue to grow significantly, potentially doubling in size over the next 2 to 3 years. 
One of our newest product is handheld lasers, which was launched earlier this year, is winning widespread interest and gaining significant traction in the welding community. We launched our new and improved version of LightWELD in September. It also has cleaning capability in addition to many preset building parameters. Some customers may choose LightWELD just for this cleaning feature as it can save time, money and reduce costly consumables. LightWELD was the highlight of our presentation at FABTECH this year, and we have signed agreements with nationwide distributors that operate hundreds of welding retail stores in the United States. We currently expect to sell tens of thousands of LightWELD systems in the next 3 to 5 years. 
As expected, we saw softer demand condition in China cutting market during the third quarter. The combination of a moderated demand environment driven by widespread supply chain issues, high shipping cost and power shortage as well as a more aggressive price competition from local manufacturers negatively impacted demand for cutting applications in China during this quarter. At the same time, we are seeing a record demand in welding in China as a result of strong sales in EV battery applications and increased revenue for marking and 3D printing. In several cases, we saw customers coming back to IPG after lower-cost local suppliers didn't meet customers' quality and technical support expectations. 
We continue to benefit from our vertically integrated product model, which enables technological advantage while minimizing supply chain disruptions. However, we have been seeing some impact on our and our customers' operation from the ongoing supply chain issues worldwide, which we were able to successfully overcome this quarter. 
As we announced earlier, the Board selected John Peeler as a non-executive chair. John has served as Lead Independent Director since 2017 and his appointment provides continuing stability as we have worked together well over the years. This appointment continues the separate CEO and Chair roles that started in May 2021, and I look forward to working with John in his new position. 
With that, I will turn the call to Tim to discuss financial highlights in the quarter and fourth quarter outlook."
427949,1685551244,2421627,"IPG Photonics Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","IPG Photonics Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Eugene, and good morning, everyone.

My comments generally will follow the earnings call presentation, which is available on our website. I will start with the financial review on Slide 3. 
Revenue in the third quarter was $379 million, which increased 19% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Third quarter GAAP gross margin was 49%, an increase of 100 basis points year-over-year. Compared with the year ago period, the increase in gross margin was driven primarily by lower inventory provisions and a reduction of unabsorbed manufacturing expenses as a percent of sales. GAAP operating income was $102 million and operating margin was 26.9%. Third quarter net income was $75 million or $1.40 per diluted share. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 26%. 
As a reminder, last year's results were negatively impacted by a goodwill impairment charge of $45 million. During the quarter, we recognized an after-tax foreign exchange gain of $2 million or $0.04 per diluted share primarily related to the depreciation of the euro and Chinese yuan. Exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar had been the same as 1 year ago, we would have expected revenue to be $9 million lower and gross profit to be $6 million lower. 
Moving to Slide 4. Sales of high-power CW lasers decreased 4% year-over-year and represented approximately 47% of total revenue. Sales of ultra-high power lasers at 6 kilowatts or greater represented 51% of total high-power CW sales. Medium power laser sales increased 109% on growth in cutting, welding, 3D printing and semiconductor applications. QCW laser sales increased 8% year-over-year on higher demand from marking, engraving and drilling applications. Pulsed laser sales, including high-power pulsed lasers, increased 69% year-over-year, with strong growth in foil cutting applications for EV battery manufacturing, solar cell applications as well as higher sales of our infrared lasers for marking and cleaning. 
System sales increased 56% year-over-year with improved revenues for Genesis and ILT and a ramp-up in LightWELD sales. Other product sales increased 58% year-over-year, benefiting from higher sales in medical and beam delivery. 
Examining our performance by region on Slide 5. Revenue in North America increased 55% year-over-year, driven by materials processing with growth in welding and increased sales of high-power lasers for cutting applications. We also saw record quarterly revenue in Medical as our products continue to gain acceptance. System sales improved in the third quarter with both laser and non-laser systems posting strong revenue growth. 
In Europe, revenue increased 50% year-over-year driven by accelerated demand in cutting and welding applications as well as strong growth in marking and additive applications. 
Our revenue in China decreased 7% year-over-year in the third quarter, representing approximately 36% of total sales. Soft sales of high-power lasers and cutting applications more than offset higher demand in welding applications, high-power pulsed lasers for foil cutting and growth in marking and additive applications. 
Sales in Japan were up 11%, and revenue in the rest of Asia increased 15% year-over-year. 
Moving to a summary of our balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 6. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.5 billion and total debt of $35 million. Strong operational execution resulted in cash provided by operations of $102 million during the quarter. For our cash deployment, capital expenditures were $40 million in the third quarter, and we expect capital expenditures to be between $130 million and $150 million for the full year. During the quarter, we repurchased 200,000 shares for $36 million and have bought approximately another 135,000 shares so far in the fourth quarter. 
Commenting on outlook for the next quarter. Third quarter book-to-bill remained above one. We expect stable demand in North America and Europe and continue to see growth opportunities in welding and high-power cutting in North America and Europe, foil cutting and welding applications for EV battery production across many geographies as well as opportunities in solar cell manufacturing, medical procedures and advanced applications. We also see LightWELD sales continue to gain traction. However, sales in China will be down sequentially in the fourth quarter due to soft demand in cutting applications. Uncertainty due to supply chain issues and power outages that may impact demand for our products as well as ongoing competitive pressures. 
For the fourth quarter of 2021, IPG expects revenue of $330 million to $360 million. The company expects the fourth quarter tax rate to be approximately 25%, excluding any discrete items. IPG anticipates delivering earnings per diluted share in the range of $1 to $1.30 with approximately 54 million diluted shares outstanding. 
I would like to remind you that financial guidance provided this quarter continues to be subject to greater risk and uncertainty, given the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated impacts to the global business environment, supply chain, public health requirements and government mandates. Please refer to the safe harbor passage of today's earnings press release for more details on risks and uncertainties associated with our forward-looking statements. 
And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions."

And the other good positive trend, I think, was on some of the marking engraving applications, which are increasingly being used in automated production lines and therefore, where the quality of the laser is very important, that also performed well there.

You've got major growth drivers that we talked about sort of macro trends out there with EV battery manufacturing, EV motor manufacturing, body and white applications, new product introductions in the other parts of the welding market with LightWELD, growth in medical applications, high-power cutting market transitioning to much higher power levels globally as well as in China. We're going to start rolling out our ultra compact laser at higher power levels than 1 and 1.5 kilowatts. So transitioning during the course of the year, early on in the year to 3 and 6-kilowatt and then ultimately, probably in the second half of the year to 8-kilowatt with the ultracompact device. So there's a whole host of different applications that we think are going to really make next year an interesting and exciting one. even from a geographic perspective, you continue to see sort of robust economic data in North America and Europe, but maybe a little bit of a moderation, but not fundamental shift.

The strategy was developed by Dr. Scherbakov and Dr. Gapontsev, and even other members of the executive team over many years. So continuing to pursue the rollout of fiber laser technologies across multiple applications and end markets. So there's no big change in that direction. Dr. Scherbakov has mentioned a couple of things. We're going to continue to try and optimize the manufacturing footprint and efficiencies that we have there. We're not changing our gross margin guidance range of 45% to 50%, although internally, we're getting increasingly comfortable of achieving the top end of that range and pursuing initiatives that keep us on average, at the top end of that range, of course, there could be some variance depending upon where quarterly revenues fall out. In terms of capital allocation, we've continued to enhance and develop the capital allocation strategy over time. We're executing very regularly against the existing $200 million buyback that we have out there and quickly and expeditiously completed the prior one. So no fundamental changes that are out there, otherwise we would have had to articulate them."

And then there continues to be a higher -- this is on the cutting side of things. There continues to be a high end of the market that generally serves higher volume manufacturing and automated manufacturing systems where reliability is very key to the system. So for example, in the production line, if you have downtime of even a few hours, not even a day, the cost of that downtime will be way in excess of the cost of the laser, right? So it's in those areas that we continue to focus on where our share continues to be very high. It's kind of a bit of a third victory trying to play within the very high-volume low end of the market. What we did say, though, is that as we expand the offering of our ultracompact lower-cost lasers, there's certainly an opportunity to increase our share as we go to 3, 6 and ultimately 8 kilowatt there. And then in the rest of the China market, you're dealing with much more sophisticated applications and where our competitive products are significantly better. So whether it's the AMB laser or the high-power pulsed lasers or even at lower power levels, the single-mode lasers that are being used on some of the additive and even some welding applications looking at using low power single mode, we've got very, very clear advantages in all of those areas."

We are deeply saddened by the passing of Valentin Gapontsev, the founder and Executive Chairman of IPG. This is a tremendous loss for our company and the broader photonics community, which benefited greatly from his technical innovations and strategic vision. Because of his vision and relentless work, fibre lasers have become cost-effective, reliable and effective tools that have mass applications in global industrial production, enabling automation, efficiency and development of new products. He was recognized as the father of the fiber laser industry and a great entrepreneur. Following his footsteps, we will continue to focus on innovation and invest internally in manufacturing and research and development capabilities to make the highest quality components and the most reliable products. 
At IPG, we are also exploring new markets and applications where fibre lasers can replace existing laser and non-laser technologies by improving efficiency, productivity or enabling technological breakthroughs for our customers. Our technologies are playing well in those major macro trends that include investments in electrical vehicles and renewable energy as well as focus on energy efficiency, industrial automation and miniaturization, which are transforming the way products are created. As a part of our strategy, we have been diversifying away from the highly competitive and more cyclical cutting market in China, and our results this quarter demonstrated successful execution of this strategy. 
We are pleased to deliver third quarter revenue and EPS at the top end of our guidance. Results were driven by strong growth in welding, marking, 3D printing and as well as cleaning, semiconductor and a number of other new products and applications. 
Demand for IPG lasers continued to improve in North America and Europe, with both welding and cutting applications showing solid growth. We are also seeing increased orders and business activity in Japan. These geographies continues to recover from the pandemic and saw increased investment in new factories and automation. 
We are benefiting from widespread investments in electric vehicles production globally. Our lasers are used in a variety of welding, foil cutting and cleaning applications for EV battery manufacturing. We are also seeing opportunities for laser-welding in EV motor assembly and body-in-white applications. These investments are likely to continue for the next 3 to 5 years as automotive manufacturers address the need for EV batteries and new technologies in order to meet aggressive global carbon emission standards. 
We are excited about increased demand we are seeing in emerging products and applications, which contributed just under 30% of our total revenue this quarter with record sales in AMB lasers and medical and strong growth in high-power pulsed lasers. Both AMB and high-power pulsed lasers are benefiting from increased investment in EV battery capacity worldwide. 
Our medical products are rapidly gaining adoption and both our thulium laser and IPG disposable fibers are considered the new gold standard in the industry. We believe that our medical business will continue to grow significantly, potentially doubling in size over the next 2 to 3 years. 
One of our newest product is handheld lasers, which was launched earlier this year, is winning widespread interest and gaining significant traction in the welding community. We launched our new and improved version of LightWELD in September. It also has cleaning capability in addition to many preset building parameters. Some customers may choose LightWELD just for this cleaning feature as it can save time, money and reduce costly consumables. LightWELD was the highlight of our presentation at FABTECH this year, and we have signed agreements with nationwide distributors that operate hundreds of welding retail stores in the United States. We currently expect to sell tens of thousands of LightWELD systems in the next 3 to 5 years. 
As expected, we saw softer demand condition in China cutting market during the third quarter. The combination of a moderated demand environment driven by widespread supply chain issues, high shipping cost and power shortage as well as a more aggressive price competition from local manufacturers negatively impacted demand for cutting applications in China during this quarter. At the same time, we are seeing a record demand in welding in China as a result of strong sales in EV battery applications and increased revenue for marking and 3D printing. In several cases, we saw customers coming back to IPG after lower-cost local suppliers didn't meet customers' quality and technical support expectations. 
We continue to benefit from our vertically integrated product model, which enables technological advantage while minimizing supply chain disruptions. However, we have been seeing some impact on our and our customers' operation from the ongoing supply chain issues worldwide, which we were able to successfully overcome this quarter. 
As we announced earlier, the Board selected John Peeler as a non-executive chair. John has served as Lead Independent Director since 2017 and his appointment provides continuing stability as we have worked together well over the years. This appointment continues the separate CEO and Chair roles that started in May 2021, and I look forward to working with John in his new position. 
With that, I will turn the call to Tim to discuss financial highlights in the quarter and fourth quarter outlook."

My comments generally will follow the earnings call presentation, which is available on our website. I will start with the financial review on Slide 3. 
Revenue in the third quarter was $379 million, which increased 19% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Third quarter GAAP gross margin was 49%, an increase of 100 basis points year-over-year. Compared with the year ago period, the increase in gross margin was driven primarily by lower inventory provisions and a reduction of unabsorbed manufacturing expenses as a percent of sales. GAAP operating income was $102 million and operating margin was 26.9%. Third quarter net income was $75 million or $1.40 per diluted share. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 26%. 
As a reminder, last year's results were negatively impacted by a goodwill impairment charge of $45 million. During the quarter, we recognized an after-tax foreign exchange gain of $2 million or $0.04 per diluted share primarily related to the depreciation of the euro and Chinese yuan. Exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar had been the same as 1 year ago, we would have expected revenue to be $9 million lower and gross profit to be $6 million lower. 
Moving to Slide 4. Sales of high-power CW lasers decreased 4% year-over-year and represented approximately 47% of total revenue. Sales of ultra-high power lasers at 6 kilowatts or greater represented 51% of total high-power CW sales. Medium power laser sales increased 109% on growth in cutting, welding, 3D printing and semiconductor applications. QCW laser sales increased 8% year-over-year on higher demand from marking, engraving and drilling applications. Pulsed laser sales, including high-power pulsed lasers, increased 69% year-over-year, with strong growth in foil cutting applications for EV battery manufacturing, solar cell applications as well as higher sales of our infrared lasers for marking and cleaning. 
System sales increased 56% year-over-year with improved revenues for Genesis and ILT and a ramp-up in LightWELD sales. Other product sales increased 58% year-over-year, benefiting from higher sales in medical and beam delivery. 
Examining our performance by region on Slide 5. Revenue in North America increased 55% year-over-year, driven by materials processing with growth in welding and increased sales of high-power lasers for cutting applications. We also saw record quarterly revenue in Medical as our products continue to gain acceptance. System sales improved in the third quarter with both laser and non-laser systems posting strong revenue growth. 
In Europe, revenue increased 50% year-over-year driven by accelerated demand in cutting and welding applications as well as strong growth in marking and additive applications. 
Our revenue in China decreased 7% year-over-year in the third quarter, representing approximately 36% of total sales. Soft sales of high-power lasers and cutting applications more than offset higher demand in welding applications, high-power pulsed lasers for foil cutting and growth in marking and additive applications. 
Sales in Japan were up 11%, and revenue in the rest of Asia increased 15% year-over-year. 
Moving to a summary of our balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 6. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.5 billion and total debt of $35 million. Strong operational execution resulted in cash provided by operations of $102 million during the quarter. For our cash deployment, capital expenditures were $40 million in the third quarter, and we expect capital expenditures to be between $130 million and $150 million for the full year. During the quarter, we repurchased 200,000 shares for $36 million and have bought approximately another 135,000 shares so far in the fourth quarter. 
Commenting on outlook for the next quarter. Third quarter book-to-bill remained above one. We expect stable demand in North America and Europe and continue to see growth opportunities in welding and high-power cutting in North America and Europe, foil cutting and welding applications for EV battery production across many geographies as well as opportunities in solar cell manufacturing, medical procedures and advanced applications. We also see LightWELD sales continue to gain traction. However, sales in China will be down sequentially in the fourth quarter due to soft demand in cutting applications. Uncertainty due to supply chain issues and power outages that may impact demand for our products as well as ongoing competitive pressures. 
For the fourth quarter of 2021, IPG expects revenue of $330 million to $360 million. The company expects the fourth quarter tax rate to be approximately 25%, excluding any discrete items. IPG anticipates delivering earnings per diluted share in the range of $1 to $1.30 with approximately 54 million diluted shares outstanding. 
I would like to remind you that financial guidance provided this quarter continues to be subject to greater risk and uncertainty, given the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated impacts to the global business environment, supply chain, public health requirements and government mandates. Please refer to the safe harbor passage of today's earnings press release for more details on risks and uncertainties associated with our forward-looking statements.

In addition, you've got a geographic mix benefit with some of the stronger sales in Europe and North America around both cutting and other applications, those are also a benefit. And then we've got sort of strong sales coming out of areas like medical and even some of the semiconductor applications.

You've got major growth drivers that we talked about sort of macro trends out there with EV battery manufacturing, EV motor manufacturing, body and white applications, new product introductions in the other parts of the welding market with LightWELD, growth in medical applications, high-power cutting market transitioning to much higher power levels globally as well as in China. We're going to start rolling out our ultra compact laser at higher power levels than 1 and 1.5 kilowatts. So transitioning during the course of the year, early on in the year to 3 and 6-kilowatt and then ultimately, probably in the second half of the year to 8-kilowatt with the ultracompact device. So there's a whole host of different applications that we think are going to really make next year an interesting and exciting one. even from a geographic perspective, you continue to see sort of robust economic data in North America and Europe, but maybe a little bit of a moderation, but not fundamental shift.

We're not changing our gross margin guidance range of 45% to 50%, although internally, we're getting increasingly comfortable of achieving the top end of that range and pursuing initiatives that keep us on average, at the top end of that range, of course, there could be some variance depending upon where quarterly revenues fall out.
