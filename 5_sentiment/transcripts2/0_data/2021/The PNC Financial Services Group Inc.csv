As you've seen this morning, we had a solid fourth quarter and full year 2020 amidst a challenging operating environment. Over the course of the year, we grew loans and deposits, delivered positive operating leverage and executed well on all of our strategic priorities. 
Our balance sheet finished the year in a very strong position, record levels of capital and liquidity and significant credit reserves. In addition, we grew tangible book value per share 17% year-over-year. 
While the economy improved modestly this quarter and we're encouraged by the rollout of the vaccines, we continue to operate amidst the pandemic, a low-rate environment and weak loan demand. And before Rob walks you through the full details of our results, I wanted to share a few high-level observations. 
First, the investments we've made over the years in talent and technology have allowed us to navigate this pandemic, the related economic crisis and the widespread social unrest while supporting our stakeholders and coming out stronger as a company. In addition to taking the steps to help keep our employees and customers safe, we provided billions of dollars of credit to our clients. We granted $14.8 billion in loan modifications and registered more than 70,000 loans worth approximately $13 billion through the federal government's first round of the Paycheck Protection Program. And our team is actively working with our clients right now through the second round of PPP. 
In response to the widespread social unrest and as part of our efforts to help address systemic racism, we committed $1 billion to advance social justice and economic empowerment among Black Americans in low- and moderate-income communities. 
And as you're aware, in the second quarter of 2020, we sold our passive stake -- passive equity stake in BlackRock in November, announced our plan to redeploy those proceeds to acquire BBVA USA. Since that announcement, we spent a lot of time with BBVA's employees and have become even more excited about our combination, given their talent in high-growth markets and the similarities in how we serve clients, manage risk and support our communities. This transaction will create a leading national franchise, significantly accelerate our growth and enhance our profitability. 
And finally, I'd like to close by thanking our employees for their steadfast commitment to our customers through a very challenging year. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our results, and then we'll take your questions."

Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen, we've reported fourth quarter net income of $1.5 billion or $3.26 per diluted common share, resulting in full year 2020 net income from continuing operations of $3 billion or $6.36 per dilut",2606,"Great. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen, we've reported fourth quarter net income of $1.5 billion or $3.26 per diluted common share, resulting in full year 2020 net income from continuing operations of $3 billion or $6.36 per diluted common share. Our balance sheet is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average basis. 
During the quarter, lower utilization and soft loan demand drove a $7 billion or 3% decline in loans. And low rates pressured investment securities, which declined $5 billion or 5%. Our cash balances at the Federal Reserve grew to $76 billion in the fourth quarter. Our elevated liquidity position is a result of continued deposit growth as well as lower loan and securities balances. 
On the liability side, deposit balances averaged $359 billion and were up $9 billion or 3% linked quarter. Borrowed funds decreased $5 billion compared to the third quarter as we used our strong liquidity position to continue to reduce debt. Our tangible book value was $97.43 per common share as of December 31, an increase of 2% linked quarter and 17% year-over-year. And as of December 31, 2020, our CET1 ratio was estimated to be 12.1%. 
In regard to capital return, our Board recently approved a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $1.15 per share or $500 million. And consistent with the Fed mandate, we had no share repurchases during the fourth quarter. Our expectations for share repurchases in 2021 remains the same, as we stated this past December. That is, we'll refrain from share repurchases, excluding employee benefit-related purchases during the period leading up to our pending BBVA USA transaction close date, expected to be mid-summer 2021. Following the close, all else being equal and subject to CCAR 2021, we'd expect to resume share repurchases in the second half of the year. 
Slide 5 shows our average loans and deposits in more detail. Average loan balances of $246 billion in the fourth quarter were down $7.3 billion or 3% compared to the third quarter. This decline included a $5.3 billion decrease in commercial loan balances, which was broad-based, reflecting lower loan utilization and softer loan production, partially offset by higher multifamily warehouse lending. 
In our C&IB segment, utilization rates are currently running at historic lows and approximately 2.5% below pre-pandemic levels as customers continue to maintain strong liquidity positions, evidenced by high levels of deposit. Consumer loans declined $2 billion, and balances were lower across all consumer categories. Compared to the same period a year ago, total average loans grew 3% or $7 billion. 
As the slide shows, the yield on our loan balances is 3.35%, a 3 basis point increase compared to the third quarter, reflecting higher PPP loan forgiveness and a shift in consumer loan mix. 
And we continue to reduce the rate paid on our interest-bearing deposits to 8 basis points, a 4 basis point decline linked quarter. Average deposit balances of $359 billion increased $9 billion or 3% as a result of enhanced liquidity of our customers as well as seasonal growth. Year-over-year, deposits increased $72 billion or 25% with strong growth in both interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposits. As a result, our loan-to-deposit ratio has declined to a low of 66% at the end of the fourth quarter compared to 83% in the same period in 2019. 
As you can see on Slide 6, full year 2020 revenue was $16.9 billion, up slightly compared with 2019, driven by higher fee income. Expenses declined $277 million or 3% and remain well controlled. Our full year provision was $3.2 billion compared with $773 million in 2019, reflecting the economic effects of the pandemic. Our effective tax rate from continuing operations was 12.4% for the full year 2020. 
Now let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Turning to Slide 7. You can see our total revenue has grown consistently over the past several years driven by our broad-based business mix. For the fourth quarter, net interest income of $2.4 billion was down $60 million or 2% from the third quarter primarily due to lower loan and security balances and lower securities. 
Full year 2020 net interest income of $9.9 billion was down slightly by $19 million year-over-year as higher-earning asset balances and lower rates paid on deposits were essentially offset by lower yields on earning assets. The fourth quarter net interest margin of 2.32% declined 7 basis points linked quarter. Notably, growth in Fed cash balances represented a 9 basis point decline, which accounts for more than the total linked quarter decrease to net interest margin. 
Both full year and linked quarter net interest margin reflected the impact of substantially higher Fed cash balances. To size that impact, fourth quarter Fed balances averaged $76 billion, exceeding our LCR requirement by approximately $55 billion. This level of excess liquidity represented 35 basis points of compression to our reported fourth quarter NIM. 
Fourth quarter noninterest income declined $13 million or 1% compared with the third quarter. Fee income of $1.5 billion increased $151 million or 11% linked quarter primarily driven by growth in corporate service fees of $171 million or 36% due to higher merger and acquisition advisory activity. Partially offsetting this growth was a decline in residential mortgage noninterest income of $38 million, reflecting a negative RMSR valuation adjustments and lower servicing fees. 
Other noninterest income of $293 million decreased $164 million linked quarter. The decline was primarily driven by a negative $173 million Visa derivative adjustment related to the extension of the expected timing of the litigation resolution. 
Importantly, we continue to execute on our strategies to grow our fee businesses across the franchise, and those efforts helped to drive record fee income of $5.6 billion in 2020, an increase of $190 million or 4% compared to 2019. This growth was driven by higher corporate service fees primarily related to increased activity in our advisory businesses and treasury management as well as stronger residential mortgage noninterest income. Partially offsetting this growth was a decline in both consumer services and service charges on deposits due to impact of the pandemic, particularly in the second quarter, as well as our ongoing efforts to simplify products and reduce transaction fees for our customers. 
Other noninterest income declined $109 million year-over-year or 8%, reflecting lower private equity revenue and elevated 2019 gains on asset sales related to our asset management business, partially offset by higher net securities gains. 
Turning to Slide 8. Our full year 2020 noninterest expenses were $10.3 billion, a decline of $277 million or 3% compared with 2019, as we responded to the crises and we managed expenses down. 
Taking a look at the fourth quarter. Expenses grew by $177 million or 7% linked quarter primarily driven by an increase in personnel expense of $111 million due to higher incentive compensation associated with increased business activity. And in addition, other expenses were up $55 million due to seasonality and equipment impairments. 
Importantly, we generated 3% positive operating leverage in 2020. And as a result, our efficiency ratio for the full year was 61%, improving from 63% last year. While the current environment presents revenue challenges, we remain deliberate and disciplined around our expense management. We had a 2020 goal of $300 million in cost savings through our continuous improvement program, and we successfully completed actions to achieve that goal. Looking forward to 2021, our annual CIP goal will once again be $300 million. 
Slide 9 is an update regarding specific industries we've identified as most likely to be impacted by the effects of the pandemic. Our outstanding loan balances and the COVID high-impact categories declined in the fourth quarter to $17.2 billion as of December 31 compared to $18.3 billion at the end of the third quarter, largely driven by commercial and industrial paydowns. 
Within the C&I-identified industries, nonperforming loans remained relatively low, representing less than 1% of loans outstanding. And charge-offs have not been material. That being said, we do expect to see further stress in these industries. 
The lower half of this slide presents the highly impacted commercial real estate and related loan categories. These industries are experiencing the most pressure, and downgrades continue to occur. Our 2 largest charge-offs in the fourth quarter were related to loans in this category. Overall, for all of these COVID high-impact loans, we remain well reserved and continue to carefully monitor and manage these exposures. 
Moving to Slide 10. This is an update to our customer hardship release. We continue to see a reduction in the number of consumers and small businesses requesting hardship assistance. And importantly, loans under modification that present credit risk to PNC continue to decline. At the end of the year, we had $900 million of consumer and small business balances in some form of payment assistance with credit risk to PNC, down from $1.7 billion at September 30. 
On the commercial side, we're also continuing to selectively grant loan modifications based on each individual borrower's situation. Within our C&IB segment, less than $150 million of loan balances were in deferral as of December 31. When combining consumer and commercial customers, loans receiving assistance and posing credit risk to PNC are approximately $1 billion, representing less than 0.5% of total loans outstanding, and as I previously mentioned, are appropriately reserved. 
Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 11. Total delinquencies of $1.4 billion at December 31 increased $125 million or 10%. Consumer loan delinquencies increased $72 million primarily due to government-insured mortgages that recently exited modification status. And commercial loan delinquencies grew by $53 million. 
Nonperforming loans increased $201 million or 10% compared to September 30. This growth was almost entirely driven by a $193 million increase in consumer loans, and within that, $189 million related to residential real estate, primarily as a result of borrowers exiting forbearance and deferring payments to the end of the term. Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $229 million, up $74 million from the third quarter. Commercial net charge-offs increased by $71 million to $109 million driven by specific commercial real estate-related borrowers and included certain portfolio management activity. Consumer net charge-offs were relatively stable at $120 million. 
Annualized net charge-offs to total loans in the fourth quarter was 37 basis points, an increase of only 2 basis points compared to the same period last year. As you can see, the allowance for credit losses to loans was 2.46% at quarter end, down slightly from 2.58% last quarter. We believe that our reserves sufficiently reflect the life of loan losses in the current portfolio. 
Slide 12 highlights the components of the change in our allowance for credit losses throughout the year. In the fourth quarter, reserves declined by $495 million. Economic and qualitative factors represented $398 million of the decline as improvement in our economic outlook was partially offset by increased reserves within our CRE portfolio. Correspondingly, our allowance for loan losses on our total commercial real estate portfolio have increased to 3.06% as of December 31. 
The remaining $97 million of the decline in reserves was related to portfolio changes primarily driven by lower loan balances. Our year-end reserves of $5.9 billion have increased materially year-over-year and as I mentioned before, now represent 2.46% of loans. 
Turning to Slide 13. I wanted to spend a few minutes reviewing our recently announced acquisition of BBVA USA. with a focus on update since the call in November. We expect this transaction to add significant value to our shareholders, and we're excited about the power of the combined franchises. We remain confident in our ability to achieve the financial objectives we laid out at the time we announced the deal, including the $900 million of expense saves through enhanced operational efficiencies. Through time, we do expect to generate additional meaningful revenue synergies, which will make the economics of the transaction even more compelling. 
Since the announcement, we've continued to make steady progress towards completing the transaction. Notably, we've established cross-functional business teams to support the integration, submitted required regulatory applications and confirmed the mapping of the technology migration. There's a lot of hard work ahead, but based on our due diligence as well as the progress we've made to date working alongside the BBVA USA team, we're confident in our ability to execute and deliver on our objectives. This transaction will significantly accelerate our expansion efforts into attractive growth markets, is financially compelling and leverages our technology and acquisition expertise. 
In summary, PNC reported a strong fourth quarter and a successful 2020, and we're well positioned for 2021 and beyond. During 2021, naturally, the biggest variable impact in the economy will be the duration of this pandemic, and along with that, the efficacy of the government support plans as well as the vaccine distribution. Our current expectations are for real GDP to return to prerecession levels by the end of the year and the Fed funds rate to remain near 0 throughout the duration of the year. 
Looking ahead at the first quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. We expect total average loans to be stable to down modestly. Inside of that, PPP loans are expected to be up approximately $2 billion. We expect NII to be down approximately 1%, which includes the impact of 2 fewer days in the first quarter. Excluding the impact of PPP, net interest income is expected to decline approximately 3%. 
We expect total noninterest income to be down mid-single digits. Within that, other noninterest income is expected to be between $275 million and $325 million. We expect total noninterest expense to be down in the mid-single-digit range. In regard to net charge-offs, we expect first quarter levels to be between $200 million and $250 million. 
Looking at the full year 2021 guidance. We thought it would be helpful to provide our expectation for PNC's stand-alone performance, excluding any onetime costs related to the BBVA USA transaction. For the full year 2021 compared to the full year 2020 results, we expect average loan growth to be down in the low single-digit range. The significant increase in loan utilization during the beginning of the pandemic elevated average loan balances in 2020, as you know, which created a difficult backdrop for the full year average loan growth comparison. However, we do expect to have loan growth throughout 2021, resulting in low single-digit spot growth for the year. 
We expect total revenue to be stable. We expect expenses to be stable. This represents -- oh, I'm sorry. Back that up. We expect revenues to be stable, and this represents a current net interest income forecast of down modestly. But we acknowledge potential deposit growth and further rate steepening in excess of our current forecast. It is plausible, and that's relative to revenues. We expect our expenses to be stable, and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 17%. 
Regarding the pending acquisition of BBVA USA. As I mentioned, we recently filed the required applications, and we're still targeting a midyear close, subject to regulatory approval. BBVA will not be releasing the results until later this month. Therefore, we will not be providing updates to the previously disclosed financial metrics and estimates related to BBVA USA at this time. 
However, in an effort to provide some context for the transaction in relation to our full year guidance, assuming we close midyear and excluding integration costs, we expect the acquisition to be approximately $600 million accretive to PNC's 2021 pre-provision net revenue. And all of that is consistent with our original assumptions. 
And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions."

But one of the internal debates there's no winner on is this basic notion that as Fed continues the size of their balance sheet and grows it and we have loan growth towards the back end of 2021, that drives deposit growth, right? It's a closed system. And as that happens, P&C benefits disproportionately, at least has and I suspect will, given some constraints on the largest banks on deposit growth, which in turn gives us NII. 
So we kind of say, ""Fine. Call NII flat,but there's a macro variable in here that will hit the industry as a function of loan growth and what the Fed does, it's going to drive this opportunity."""

So that first wave would be about $10.5 billion. And then for the second wave, we expect to originate approximately $4 billion in the first quarter.

As you've seen this morning, we had a solid fourth quarter and full year 2020 amidst a challenging operating environment. Over the course of the year, we grew loans and deposits, delivered positive operating leverage and executed well on all of our strategic priorities.  
Our balance sheet finished the year in a very strong position, record levels of capital and liquidity and significant credit reserves. In addition, we grew tangible book value per share 17% year-over-year.  
While the economy improved modestly this quarter and we're encouraged by the rollout of the vaccines, we continue to operate amidst the pandemic, a low-rate environment and weak loan demand. And before Rob walks you through the full details of our results, I wanted to share a few high-level observations.  
First, the investments we've made over the years in talent and technology have allowed us to navigate this pandemic, the related economic crisis and the widespread social unrest while supporting our stakeholders and coming out stronger as a company. In addition to taking the steps to help keep our employees and customers safe, we provided billions of dollars of credit to our clients. We granted $14.8 billion in loan modifications and registered more than 70,000 loans worth approximately $13 billion through the federal government's first round of the Paycheck Protection Program. And our team is actively working with our clients right now through the second round of PPP.  
In response to the widespread social unrest and as part of our efforts to help address systemic racism, we committed $1 billion to advance social justice and economic empowerment among Black Americans in low- and moderate-income communities.  
And as you're aware, in the second quarter of 2020, we sold our passive stake -- passive equity stake in BlackRock in November, announced our plan to redeploy those proceeds to acquire BBVA USA. Since that announcement, we spent a lot of time with BBVA's employees and have become even more excited about our combination, given their talent in high-growth markets and the similarities in how we serve clients, manage risk and support our communities. This transaction will create a leading national franchise, significantly accelerate our growth and enhance our profitability.  
And finally, I'd like to close by thanking our employees for their steadfast commitment to our customers through a very challenging year.  
And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our results, and then we'll take your questions."

Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen, we've reported fourth quarter net income of $1.5 billion or $3.26 per diluted common share, resulting in full year 2020 net income from continuing operations of $3 billion or $6.36 per dilut",2608,"Great. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen, we've reported fourth quarter net income of $1.5 billion or $3.26 per diluted common share, resulting in full year 2020 net income from continuing operations of $3 billion or $6.36 per diluted common share. Our balance sheet is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average basis.  
During the quarter, lower utilization and soft loan demand drove a $7 billion or a 3% decline in loans, and low rates pressured investment securities, which declined $5 billion or 5%. Our cash balances at the Federal Reserve grew to $76 billion in the fourth quarter. Our elevated liquidity position is a result of continued deposit growth as well as lower loan and securities balances.  
On the liability side, deposit balances averaged $359 billion and were up $9 billion or 3% linked quarter. Borrowed funds decreased $5 billion compared to the third quarter as we used our strong liquidity position to continue to reduce debt. Our tangible book value was $97.43 per common share as of December 31, an increase of 2% linked quarter and 17% year-over-year. And as of December 31, 2020, our CET1 ratio was estimated to be 12.1%.  
In regard to capital return, our Board recently approved a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $1.15 per share or $500 million. And consistent with the Fed mandate, we had no share repurchases during the fourth quarter. Our expectations for share repurchases in 2021 remains the same, as we stated this past December; that is, we'll refrain from share repurchases, excluding employee benefit-related purchases during the period leading up to our pending BBVA USA transaction close date, expected to be mid-summer 2021.  
Following the close, all else being equal and subject to CCAR 2021, we'd expect to resume share repurchases in the second half of the year.  
Slide 5 shows our average loans and deposits in more detail. Average loan balances of $246 billion in the fourth quarter were down $7.3 billion or 3% compared to the third quarter. This decline included a $5.3 billion decrease in commercial loan balances, which was broad-based, reflecting lower loan utilization and softer loan production, partially offset by higher multifamily warehouse lending.  
In our C&IB segment, utilization rates are currently running at historic lows and approximately 2.5% below pre-pandemic levels as customers continue to maintain strong liquidity positions, evidenced by high levels of deposit. Consumer loans declined $2 billion, and balances were lower across all consumer categories.  Compared to the same period a year ago, total average loans grew 3% or $7 billion.  
As the slide shows, the yield on our loan balances is 3.35%, a 3 basis point increase compared to the third quarter, reflecting higher PPP loan forgiveness and a shift in consumer loan mix.  
And we continue to reduce the rate paid on our interest-bearing deposits to 8 basis points, a 4 basis point decline linked quarter. 
Average deposit balances of $359 billion increased $9 billion or 3% as a result of enhanced liquidity of our customers as well as seasonal growth. Year-over-year, deposits increased $72 billion or 25% with strong growth in both interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposits. As a result, our loan-to-deposit ratio has declined to a low of 66% at the end of the fourth quarter compared to 83% in the same period in 2019.  
As you can see on Slide 6, full year 2020 revenue was $16.9 billion, up slightly compared with 2019, driven by higher fee income. Expenses declined $277 million or 3% and remain well controlled. Our full year provision was $3.2 billion compared with $773 million in 2019, reflecting the economic effects of the pandemic. Our effective tax rate from continuing operations was 12.4% for the full year 2020.  
Now let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. 
Turning to Slide 7. You can see our total revenue has grown consistently over the past several years, driven by our broad-based business mix. For the fourth quarter, net interest income of $2.4 billion was down $60 million or 2% from the third quarter, primarily due to lower loan and security balances and lower securities yields. 
Full year 2020 net interest income of $9.9 billion was down slightly by $19 million year-over-year as higher-earning asset balances and lower rates paid on deposits were essentially offset by lower yields on earning assets. The fourth quarter net interest margin of 2.32% declined 7 basis points linked quarter. Notably, growth in Fed cash balances represented a 9 basis point decline, which accounts for more than the total linked quarter decrease to net interest margin. Both full year and linked quarter net interest margin reflected the impact of substantially higher Fed cash balances. To size that impact, fourth quarter Fed balances averaged $76 billion, exceeding our LCR requirement by approximately $55 billion. This level of excess liquidity represented 35 basis points of compression to our reported fourth quarter NIM.  
Fourth quarter noninterest income declined $13 million or 1% compared with the third quarter. Fee income of $1.5 billion increased $151 million or 11% linked quarter, primarily driven by growth in corporate service fees of $171 million or 36% due to higher merger and acquisition advisory activity. Partially offsetting this growth was a decline in residential mortgage noninterest income of $38 million, reflecting a negative RMSR valuation adjustment and lower servicing fees.  
Other noninterest income of $293 million decreased $164 million linked quarter. The decline was primarily driven by a negative $173 million Visa derivative adjustment related to the extension of the expected timing of the litigation resolution.
Importantly, we continue to execute on our strategies to grow our fee businesses across the franchise, and those efforts helped to drive record fee income of $5.6 billion in 2020, an increase of $190 million or 4% compared to 2019. This growth was driven by higher corporate service fees primarily related to increased activity in our advisory businesses and treasury management as well as stronger residential mortgage noninterest income. Partially offsetting this growth was a decline in both consumer services and service charges on deposits due to impacts of the pandemic, particularly in the second quarter, as well as our ongoing efforts to simplify products and reduce transaction fees for our customers.  
Other noninterest income declined $109 million year-over-year or 8%, reflecting lower private equity revenue and elevated 2019 gains on asset sales related to our asset management business, partially offset by higher net securities gains.
Turning to Slide 8. Our full year 2020 noninterest expenses were $10.3 billion, a decline of $277 million or 3% compared with 2019, as we responded to the crises and we managed expenses down.  
Taking a look at the fourth quarter. Expenses grew by $177 million or 7% linked quarter, primarily driven by an increase in personnel expense of $111 million due to higher incentive compensation associated with increased business activity. And in addition, other expenses were up $55 million due to seasonality and equipment impairments.  
Importantly, we generated 3% positive operating leverage in 2020. And as a result, our efficiency ratio for the full year was 61%, improving from 63% last year. While the current environment presents revenue challenges, we remain deliberate and disciplined around our expense management. We had a 2020 goal of $300 million in cost savings through our continuous improvement program, and we successfully completed actions to achieve that goal.  
Looking forward to 2021, our annual CIP goal will once again be $300 million.  
Slide 9 is an update regarding specific industries we've identified as most likely to be impacted by the effects of the pandemic. Our outstanding loan balances in the COVID high-impact categories declined in the fourth quarter to $17.2 billion as of December 31 compared to $18.3 billion at the end of the third quarter, largely driven by commercial and industrial paydowns.
Within the C&I-identified industries, nonperforming loans remained relatively low, representing less than 1% of loans outstanding. And charge-offs have not been material. That being said, we do expect to see further stress in these industries.  
The lower half of this slide presents the highly impacted commercial real estate and related loan categories. These industries are experiencing the most pressure, and downgrades continue to occur. Our 2 largest charge-offs in the fourth quarter were related to loans in this category.  
Overall, for all of these COVID high-impact loans, we remain well reserved and continue to carefully monitor and manage these exposures.  
Moving to Slide 10. This is an update to our customer hardship release. We continue to see a reduction in the number of consumers and small businesses requesting hardship assistance. And importantly, loans under modification that present credit risk to PNC continue to decline. At the end of the year, we had $900 million of consumer and small business balances in some form of payment assistance with credit risk to PNC, down from $1.7 billion at September 30.  
On the commercial side, we're also continuing to selectively grant loan modifications based on each individual borrower's situation. Within our C&IB segment, less than $150 million of loan balances were in deferral as of December 31. When combining consumer and commercial customers, loans receiving assistance and posing credit risk to PNC are approximately $1 billion, representing less than 0.5% of total loans outstanding, and as I previously mentioned, are appropriately reserved.  
Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 11. Total delinquencies of $1.4 billion at December 31 increased $125 million or 10%. Consumer loan delinquencies increased $72 million, primarily due to government-insured mortgages that recently exited modification status. And commercial loan delinquencies grew by $53 million.  
Nonperforming loans increased $201 million or 10% compared to September 30. This growth was almost entirely driven by a $193 million increase in consumer loans, and within that, $189 million related to residential real estate, primarily as a result of borrowers exiting forbearance and deferring payments to the end of the term. Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $229 million, up $74 million from the third quarter. Commercial net charge-offs increased by $71 million to $109 million driven by specific commercial real estate-related borrowers and included certain portfolio management activities. Consumer net charge-offs were relatively stable at $120 million.  
Annualized net charge-offs to total loans in the fourth quarter was 37 basis points, an increase of only 2 basis points compared to the same period last year. As you can see, the allowance for credit losses to loans was 2.46% at quarter end, down slightly from 2.58% last quarter. We believe that our reserves sufficiently reflect the life of loan losses in the current portfolio.  
Slide 12 highlights the components of the change in our allowance for credit losses throughout the year. In the fourth quarter, reserves declined by $495 million. Economic and qualitative factors represented $398 million of the decline as improvement in our economic outlook was partially offset by increased reserves within our CRE portfolio. Correspondingly, our allowance for loan losses on our total commercial real estate portfolio have increased to 3.06% as of December 31.  
The remaining $97 million of the decline in reserves was related to portfolio changes, primarily driven by lower loan balances. Our year-end reserves of $5.9 billion have increased materially year-over-year, and as I mentioned before, now represent 2.46% of loans.  
Turning to Slide 13. I wanted to spend a few minutes reviewing our recently announced acquisition of BBVA USA, with a focus on updates since the call in November. We expect this transaction to add significant value to our shareholders, and we're excited about the power of the combined franchises. We remain confident in our ability to achieve the financial objectives we laid out at the time we announced the deal, including the $900 million of expense saves through enhanced operational efficiencies. Through time, we do expect to generate additional meaningful revenue synergies, which will make the economics of the transaction even more compelling.  
Since the announcement, we've continued to make steady progress towards completing the transaction. Notably, we've established cross-functional business teams to support the integration, submitted required regulatory applications and confirmed the mapping of the technology migration. There's a lot of hard work ahead, but based on our due diligence as well as the progress we've made to date working alongside the BBVA USA team, we're confident in our ability to execute and deliver on our objectives. This transaction will significantly accelerate our expansion efforts into attractive growth markets, is financially compelling and leverages our technology and acquisition expertise.  
In summary, PNC reported a strong fourth quarter and a successful 2020, and we're well positioned for 2021 and beyond. During 2021, naturally, the biggest variable impact in the economy will be the duration of this pandemic, and along with that, the efficacy of the government support plans as well as the vaccine distribution. Our current expectations are for real GDP to return to pre-recession levels by the end of the year and the Fed funds rate to remain near 0 throughout the duration of the year.  
Looking ahead at the first quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. We expect total average loans to be stable to down modestly. Inside of that, PPP loans are expected to be up approximately $2 billion. We expect NII to be down approximately 1%, which includes the impact of 2 fewer days in the first quarter. Excluding the impact of PPP, net interest income is expected to decline approximately 3%.  We expect total noninterest income to be down mid-single digits. Within that, other noninterest income is expected to be between $275 million and $325 million. We expect total noninterest expense to be down in the mid-single-digit range.  
In regard to net charge-offs, we expect first quarter levels to be between $200 million and $250 million.
Looking at the full year 2021 guidance, we thought it would be helpful to provide our expectation for PNC's stand-alone performance, excluding any onetime costs related to the BBVA USA transaction. For the full year 2021 compared to the full year 2020 results, we expect average loan growth to be down in the low single-digit range. The significant increase in loan utilization during the beginning of the pandemic elevated average loan balances in 2020, as you know, which created a difficult backdrop for the full year average loan growth comparison. However, we do expect to have loan growth throughout 2021, resulting in low single-digit spot growth for the year.  
We expect total revenue to be stable. We expect expenses to be stable. This represents -- oh, I'm sorry. Back that up. We expect revenues to be stable, and this represents a current net interest income forecast of down modestly. But we acknowledge potential deposit growth and further rate steepening in excess of our current forecast, it is plausible, and that's relative to revenues. We expect our expenses to be stable, and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 17%.  
Regarding the pending acquisition of BBVA USA, as I mentioned, we recently filed the required applications, and we're still targeting a midyear close, subject to regulatory approval. BBVA will not be releasing the results until later this month. Therefore, we will not be providing updates to the previously disclosed financial metrics and estimates related to BBVA USA at this time.  
However, in an effort to provide some context for the transaction in relation to our full year guidance, assuming we close midyear and excluding integration costs, we expect the acquisition to be approximately $600 million accretive to PNC's 2021 pre-provision net revenue. And all of that is consistent with our original assumptions.
And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions."

Some of the dynamics around QE have led agency MBS spreads over treasuries to turn negative.

So it seems like the benefits of the steeper curve are being tempered somewhat by those dynamics. 
Can you give a little bit of color on where you're seeing the opportunity to invest on the security side? And then maybe on the lending side, if you could remind us what percentage of the loan portfolio is anchored to the short versus the long end of the interest rate complex.

As you've seen this morning, we had a solid fourth quarter and full year 2020 amidst a challenging operating environment. Over the course of the year, we grew loans and deposits, delivered positive operating leverage and executed well on all of our strategic priorities.  
Our balance sheet finished the year in a very strong position, record levels of capital and liquidity and significant credit reserves. In addition, we grew tangible book value per share 17% year-over-year.  
While the economy improved modestly this quarter and we're encouraged by the rollout of the vaccines, we continue to operate amidst the pandemic, a low-rate environment and weak loan demand. And before Rob walks you through the full details of our results, I wanted to share a few high-level observations.  
First, the investments we've made over the years in talent and technology have allowed us to navigate this pandemic, the related economic crisis and the widespread social unrest while supporting our stakeholders and coming out stronger as a company. In addition to taking the steps to help keep our employees and customers safe, we provided billions of dollars of credit to our clients. We granted $14.8 billion in loan modifications and registered more than 70,000 loans worth approximately $13 billion through the federal government's first round of the Paycheck Protection Program. And our team is actively working with our clients right now through the second round of PPP.  
In response to the widespread social unrest and as part of our efforts to help address systemic racism, we committed $1 billion to advance social justice and economic empowerment among Black Americans in low- and moderate-income communities.  
And as you're aware, in the second quarter of 2020, we sold our passive stake -- passive equity stake in BlackRock in November, announced our plan to redeploy those proceeds to acquire BBVA USA. Since that announcement, we spent a lot of time with BBVA's employees and have become even more excited about our combination, given their talent in high-growth markets and the similarities in how we serve clients, manage risk and support our communities. This transaction will create a leading national franchise, significantly accelerate our growth and enhance our profitability.  
And finally, I'd like to close by thanking our employees for their steadfast commitment to our customers through a very challenging year.  
And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our results, and then we'll take your questions."
294585,671018035,2249669,"The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 15, 2021",2021-01-15,"Earnings Calls","The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen, we've reported fourth quarter net income of $1.5 billion or $3.26 per diluted common share, resulting in full year 2020 net income from continuing operations of $3 billion or $6.36 per dilut",2608,"Great. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen, we've reported fourth quarter net income of $1.5 billion or $3.26 per diluted common share, resulting in full year 2020 net income from continuing operations of $3 billion or $6.36 per diluted common share. Our balance sheet is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average basis.  
During the quarter, lower utilization and soft loan demand drove a $7 billion or a 3% decline in loans, and low rates pressured investment securities, which declined $5 billion or 5%. Our cash balances at the Federal Reserve grew to $76 billion in the fourth quarter. Our elevated liquidity position is a result of continued deposit growth as well as lower loan and securities balances.  
On the liability side, deposit balances averaged $359 billion and were up $9 billion or 3% linked quarter. Borrowed funds decreased $5 billion compared to the third quarter as we used our strong liquidity position to continue to reduce debt. Our tangible book value was $97.43 per common share as of December 31, an increase of 2% linked quarter and 17% year-over-year. And as of December 31, 2020, our CET1 ratio was estimated to be 12.1%.  
In regard to capital return, our Board recently approved a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $1.15 per share or $500 million. And consistent with the Fed mandate, we had no share repurchases during the fourth quarter. Our expectations for share repurchases in 2021 remains the same, as we stated this past December; that is, we'll refrain from share repurchases, excluding employee benefit-related purchases during the period leading up to our pending BBVA USA transaction close date, expected to be mid-summer 2021.  
Following the close, all else being equal and subject to CCAR 2021, we'd expect to resume share repurchases in the second half of the year.  
Slide 5 shows our average loans and deposits in more detail. Average loan balances of $246 billion in the fourth quarter were down $7.3 billion or 3% compared to the third quarter. This decline included a $5.3 billion decrease in commercial loan balances, which was broad-based, reflecting lower loan utilization and softer loan production, partially offset by higher multifamily warehouse lending.  
In our C&IB segment, utilization rates are currently running at historic lows and approximately 2.5% below pre-pandemic levels as customers continue to maintain strong liquidity positions, evidenced by high levels of deposit. Consumer loans declined $2 billion, and balances were lower across all consumer categories.  Compared to the same period a year ago, total average loans grew 3% or $7 billion.  
As the slide shows, the yield on our loan balances is 3.35%, a 3 basis point increase compared to the third quarter, reflecting higher PPP loan forgiveness and a shift in consumer loan mix.  
And we continue to reduce the rate paid on our interest-bearing deposits to 8 basis points, a 4 basis point decline linked quarter. 
Average deposit balances of $359 billion increased $9 billion or 3% as a result of enhanced liquidity of our customers as well as seasonal growth. Year-over-year, deposits increased $72 billion or 25% with strong growth in both interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposits. As a result, our loan-to-deposit ratio has declined to a low of 66% at the end of the fourth quarter compared to 83% in the same period in 2019.  
As you can see on Slide 6, full year 2020 revenue was $16.9 billion, up slightly compared with 2019, driven by higher fee income. Expenses declined $277 million or 3% and remain well controlled. Our full year provision was $3.2 billion compared with $773 million in 2019, reflecting the economic effects of the pandemic. Our effective tax rate from continuing operations was 12.4% for the full year 2020.  
Now let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. 
Turning to Slide 7. You can see our total revenue has grown consistently over the past several years, driven by our broad-based business mix. For the fourth quarter, net interest income of $2.4 billion was down $60 million or 2% from the third quarter, primarily due to lower loan and security balances and lower securities yields. 
Full year 2020 net interest income of $9.9 billion was down slightly by $19 million year-over-year as higher-earning asset balances and lower rates paid on deposits were essentially offset by lower yields on earning assets. The fourth quarter net interest margin of 2.32% declined 7 basis points linked quarter. Notably, growth in Fed cash balances represented a 9 basis point decline, which accounts for more than the total linked quarter decrease to net interest margin. Both full year and linked quarter net interest margin reflected the impact of substantially higher Fed cash balances. To size that impact, fourth quarter Fed balances averaged $76 billion, exceeding our LCR requirement by approximately $55 billion. This level of excess liquidity represented 35 basis points of compression to our reported fourth quarter NIM.  
Fourth quarter noninterest income declined $13 million or 1% compared with the third quarter. Fee income of $1.5 billion increased $151 million or 11% linked quarter, primarily driven by growth in corporate service fees of $171 million or 36% due to higher merger and acquisition advisory activity. Partially offsetting this growth was a decline in residential mortgage noninterest income of $38 million, reflecting a negative RMSR valuation adjustment and lower servicing fees.  
Other noninterest income of $293 million decreased $164 million linked quarter. The decline was primarily driven by a negative $173 million Visa derivative adjustment related to the extension of the expected timing of the litigation resolution.
Importantly, we continue to execute on our strategies to grow our fee businesses across the franchise, and those efforts helped to drive record fee income of $5.6 billion in 2020, an increase of $190 million or 4% compared to 2019. This growth was driven by higher corporate service fees primarily related to increased activity in our advisory businesses and treasury management as well as stronger residential mortgage noninterest income. Partially offsetting this growth was a decline in both consumer services and service charges on deposits due to impacts of the pandemic, particularly in the second quarter, as well as our ongoing efforts to simplify products and reduce transaction fees for our customers.  
Other noninterest income declined $109 million year-over-year or 8%, reflecting lower private equity revenue and elevated 2019 gains on asset sales related to our asset management business, partially offset by higher net securities gains.
Turning to Slide 8. Our full year 2020 noninterest expenses were $10.3 billion, a decline of $277 million or 3% compared with 2019, as we responded to the crises and we managed expenses down.  
Taking a look at the fourth quarter. Expenses grew by $177 million or 7% linked quarter, primarily driven by an increase in personnel expense of $111 million due to higher incentive compensation associated with increased business activity. And in addition, other expenses were up $55 million due to seasonality and equipment impairments.  
Importantly, we generated 3% positive operating leverage in 2020. And as a result, our efficiency ratio for the full year was 61%, improving from 63% last year. While the current environment presents revenue challenges, we remain deliberate and disciplined around our expense management. We had a 2020 goal of $300 million in cost savings through our continuous improvement program, and we successfully completed actions to achieve that goal.  
Looking forward to 2021, our annual CIP goal will once again be $300 million.  
Slide 9 is an update regarding specific industries we've identified as most likely to be impacted by the effects of the pandemic. Our outstanding loan balances in the COVID high-impact categories declined in the fourth quarter to $17.2 billion as of December 31 compared to $18.3 billion at the end of the third quarter, largely driven by commercial and industrial paydowns.
Within the C&I-identified industries, nonperforming loans remained relatively low, representing less than 1% of loans outstanding. And charge-offs have not been material. That being said, we do expect to see further stress in these industries.  
The lower half of this slide presents the highly impacted commercial real estate and related loan categories. These industries are experiencing the most pressure, and downgrades continue to occur. Our 2 largest charge-offs in the fourth quarter were related to loans in this category.  
Overall, for all of these COVID high-impact loans, we remain well reserved and continue to carefully monitor and manage these exposures.  
Moving to Slide 10. This is an update to our customer hardship release. We continue to see a reduction in the number of consumers and small businesses requesting hardship assistance. And importantly, loans under modification that present credit risk to PNC continue to decline. At the end of the year, we had $900 million of consumer and small business balances in some form of payment assistance with credit risk to PNC, down from $1.7 billion at September 30.  
On the commercial side, we're also continuing to selectively grant loan modifications based on each individual borrower's situation. Within our C&IB segment, less than $150 million of loan balances were in deferral as of December 31. When combining consumer and commercial customers, loans receiving assistance and posing credit risk to PNC are approximately $1 billion, representing less than 0.5% of total loans outstanding, and as I previously mentioned, are appropriately reserved.  
Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 11. Total delinquencies of $1.4 billion at December 31 increased $125 million or 10%. Consumer loan delinquencies increased $72 million, primarily due to government-insured mortgages that recently exited modification status. And commercial loan delinquencies grew by $53 million.  
Nonperforming loans increased $201 million or 10% compared to September 30. This growth was almost entirely driven by a $193 million increase in consumer loans, and within that, $189 million related to residential real estate, primarily as a result of borrowers exiting forbearance and deferring payments to the end of the term. Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $229 million, up $74 million from the third quarter. Commercial net charge-offs increased by $71 million to $109 million driven by specific commercial real estate-related borrowers and included certain portfolio management activities. Consumer net charge-offs were relatively stable at $120 million.  
Annualized net charge-offs to total loans in the fourth quarter was 37 basis points, an increase of only 2 basis points compared to the same period last year. As you can see, the allowance for credit losses to loans was 2.46% at quarter end, down slightly from 2.58% last quarter. We believe that our reserves sufficiently reflect the life of loan losses in the current portfolio.  
Slide 12 highlights the components of the change in our allowance for credit losses throughout the year. In the fourth quarter, reserves declined by $495 million. Economic and qualitative factors represented $398 million of the decline as improvement in our economic outlook was partially offset by increased reserves within our CRE portfolio. Correspondingly, our allowance for loan losses on our total commercial real estate portfolio have increased to 3.06% as of December 31.  
The remaining $97 million of the decline in reserves was related to portfolio changes, primarily driven by lower loan balances. Our year-end reserves of $5.9 billion have increased materially year-over-year, and as I mentioned before, now represent 2.46% of loans.  
Turning to Slide 13. I wanted to spend a few minutes reviewing our recently announced acquisition of BBVA USA, with a focus on updates since the call in November. We expect this transaction to add significant value to our shareholders, and we're excited about the power of the combined franchises. We remain confident in our ability to achieve the financial objectives we laid out at the time we announced the deal, including the $900 million of expense saves through enhanced operational efficiencies. Through time, we do expect to generate additional meaningful revenue synergies, which will make the economics of the transaction even more compelling.  
Since the announcement, we've continued to make steady progress towards completing the transaction. Notably, we've established cross-functional business teams to support the integration, submitted required regulatory applications and confirmed the mapping of the technology migration. There's a lot of hard work ahead, but based on our due diligence as well as the progress we've made to date working alongside the BBVA USA team, we're confident in our ability to execute and deliver on our objectives. This transaction will significantly accelerate our expansion efforts into attractive growth markets, is financially compelling and leverages our technology and acquisition expertise.  
In summary, PNC reported a strong fourth quarter and a successful 2020, and we're well positioned for 2021 and beyond. During 2021, naturally, the biggest variable impact in the economy will be the duration of this pandemic, and along with that, the efficacy of the government support plans as well as the vaccine distribution. Our current expectations are for real GDP to return to pre-recession levels by the end of the year and the Fed funds rate to remain near 0 throughout the duration of the year.  
Looking ahead at the first quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. We expect total average loans to be stable to down modestly. Inside of that, PPP loans are expected to be up approximately $2 billion. We expect NII to be down approximately 1%, which includes the impact of 2 fewer days in the first quarter. Excluding the impact of PPP, net interest income is expected to decline approximately 3%.  We expect total noninterest income to be down mid-single digits. Within that, other noninterest income is expected to be between $275 million and $325 million. We expect total noninterest expense to be down in the mid-single-digit range.  
In regard to net charge-offs, we expect first quarter levels to be between $200 million and $250 million.
Looking at the full year 2021 guidance, we thought it would be helpful to provide our expectation for PNC's stand-alone performance, excluding any onetime costs related to the BBVA USA transaction. For the full year 2021 compared to the full year 2020 results, we expect average loan growth to be down in the low single-digit range. The significant increase in loan utilization during the beginning of the pandemic elevated average loan balances in 2020, as you know, which created a difficult backdrop for the full year average loan growth comparison. However, we do expect to have loan growth throughout 2021, resulting in low single-digit spot growth for the year.  
We expect total revenue to be stable. We expect expenses to be stable. This represents -- oh, I'm sorry. Back that up. We expect revenues to be stable, and this represents a current net interest income forecast of down modestly. But we acknowledge potential deposit growth and further rate steepening in excess of our current forecast, it is plausible, and that's relative to revenues. We expect our expenses to be stable, and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 17%.  
Regarding the pending acquisition of BBVA USA, as I mentioned, we recently filed the required applications, and we're still targeting a midyear close, subject to regulatory approval. BBVA will not be releasing the results until later this month. Therefore, we will not be providing updates to the previously disclosed financial metrics and estimates related to BBVA USA at this time.  
However, in an effort to provide some context for the transaction in relation to our full year guidance, assuming we close midyear and excluding integration costs, we expect the acquisition to be approximately $600 million accretive to PNC's 2021 pre-provision net revenue. And all of that is consistent with our original assumptions.
And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions."

But one of the internal debates that there's no winner on is this basic notion that as the Fed continues the size of their balance sheet and grows it, and we have loan growth towards the back end of 2021, that drives deposit growth, right? It's a closed system. And as that happens, PNC benefits disproportionately, at least has and I suspect will, given some constraints on the largest banks on deposit growth, which in turn gives us NII. 
So we kind of say, ""Fine. Call NII flat, but there's a macro variable in here that will hit the industry as a function of loan growth and what the Fed does, it's going to drive this opportunity."""

As you've seen this morning, we had a solid fourth quarter and full year 2020 amidst a challenging operating environment. Over the course of the year, we grew loans and deposits, delivered positive operating leverage and executed well on all of our strategic priorities.  
Our balance sheet finished the year in a very strong position, record levels of capital and liquidity and significant credit reserves. In addition, we grew tangible book value per share 17% year-over-year.  
While the economy improved modestly this quarter and we're encouraged by the rollout of the vaccines, we continue to operate amidst the pandemic, a low-rate environment and weak loan demand. And before Rob walks you through the full details of our results, I wanted to share a few high-level observations.  
First, the investments we've made over the years in talent and technology have allowed us to navigate this pandemic, the related economic crisis and the widespread social unrest while supporting our stakeholders and coming out stronger as a company. In addition to taking the steps to help keep our employees and customers safe, we provided billions of dollars of credit to our clients. We granted $14.8 billion in loan modifications and registered more than 70,000 loans worth approximately $13 billion through the federal government's first round of the Paycheck Protection Program. And our team is actively working with our clients right now through the second round of PPP.  
In response to the widespread social unrest and as part of our efforts to help address systemic racism, we committed $1 billion to advance social justice and economic empowerment among Black Americans in low- and moderate-income communities.  
And as you're aware, in the second quarter of 2020, we sold our passive stake -- passive equity stake in BlackRock in November, announced our plan to redeploy those proceeds to acquire BBVA USA. Since that announcement, we spent a lot of time with BBVA's employees and have become even more excited about our combination, given their talent in high-growth markets and the similarities in how we serve clients, manage risk and support our communities. This transaction will create a leading national franchise, significantly accelerate our growth and enhance our profitability.  
And finally, I'd like to close by thanking our employees for their steadfast commitment to our customers through a very challenging year.  
And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our results, and then we'll take your questions."

Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen, we've reported fourth quarter net income of $1.5 billion or $3.26 per diluted common share, resulting in full year 2020 net income from continuing operations of $3 billion or $6.36 per dilut",2608,"Great. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen, we've reported fourth quarter net income of $1.5 billion or $3.26 per diluted common share, resulting in full year 2020 net income from continuing operations of $3 billion or $6.36 per diluted common share. Our balance sheet is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average basis.  
During the quarter, lower utilization and soft loan demand drove a $7 billion or a 3% decline in loans, and low rates pressured investment securities, which declined $5 billion or 5%. Our cash balances at the Federal Reserve grew to $76 billion in the fourth quarter. Our elevated liquidity position is a result of continued deposit growth as well as lower loan and securities balances.  
On the liability side, deposit balances averaged $359 billion and were up $9 billion or 3% linked quarter. Borrowed funds decreased $5 billion compared to the third quarter as we used our strong liquidity position to continue to reduce debt. Our tangible book value was $97.43 per common share as of December 31, an increase of 2% linked quarter and 17% year-over-year. And as of December 31, 2020, our CET1 ratio was estimated to be 12.1%.  
In regard to capital return, our Board recently approved a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $1.15 per share or $500 million. And consistent with the Fed mandate, we had no share repurchases during the fourth quarter. Our expectations for share repurchases in 2021 remains the same, as we stated this past December; that is, we'll refrain from share repurchases, excluding employee benefit-related purchases during the period leading up to our pending BBVA USA transaction close date, expected to be mid-summer 2021.  
Following the close, all else being equal and subject to CCAR 2021, we'd expect to resume share repurchases in the second half of the year.  
Slide 5 shows our average loans and deposits in more detail. Average loan balances of $246 billion in the fourth quarter were down $7.3 billion or 3% compared to the third quarter. This decline included a $5.3 billion decrease in commercial loan balances, which was broad-based, reflecting lower loan utilization and softer loan production, partially offset by higher multifamily warehouse lending.  
In our C&IB segment, utilization rates are currently running at historic lows and approximately 2.5% below pre-pandemic levels as customers continue to maintain strong liquidity positions, evidenced by high levels of deposit. Consumer loans declined $2 billion, and balances were lower across all consumer categories.  Compared to the same period a year ago, total average loans grew 3% or $7 billion.  
As the slide shows, the yield on our loan balances is 3.35%, a 3 basis point increase compared to the third quarter, reflecting higher PPP loan forgiveness and a shift in consumer loan mix.  
And we continue to reduce the rate paid on our interest-bearing deposits to 8 basis points, a 4 basis point decline linked quarter. 
Average deposit balances of $359 billion increased $9 billion or 3% as a result of enhanced liquidity of our customers as well as seasonal growth. Year-over-year, deposits increased $72 billion or 25% with strong growth in both interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposits. As a result, our loan-to-deposit ratio has declined to a low of 66% at the end of the fourth quarter compared to 83% in the same period in 2019.  
As you can see on Slide 6, full year 2020 revenue was $16.9 billion, up slightly compared with 2019, driven by higher fee income. Expenses declined $277 million or 3% and remain well controlled. Our full year provision was $3.2 billion compared with $773 million in 2019, reflecting the economic effects of the pandemic. Our effective tax rate from continuing operations was 12.4% for the full year 2020.  
Now let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. 
Turning to Slide 7. You can see our total revenue has grown consistently over the past several years, driven by our broad-based business mix. For the fourth quarter, net interest income of $2.4 billion was down $60 million or 2% from the third quarter, primarily due to lower loan and security balances and lower securities yields. 
Full year 2020 net interest income of $9.9 billion was down slightly by $19 million year-over-year as higher-earning asset balances and lower rates paid on deposits were essentially offset by lower yields on earning assets. The fourth quarter net interest margin of 2.32% declined 7 basis points linked quarter. Notably, growth in Fed cash balances represented a 9 basis point decline, which accounts for more than the total linked quarter decrease to net interest margin. Both full year and linked quarter net interest margin reflected the impact of substantially higher Fed cash balances. To size that impact, fourth quarter Fed balances averaged $76 billion, exceeding our LCR requirement by approximately $55 billion. This level of excess liquidity represented 35 basis points of compression to our reported fourth quarter NIM.  
Fourth quarter noninterest income declined $13 million or 1% compared with the third quarter. Fee income of $1.5 billion increased $151 million or 11% linked quarter, primarily driven by growth in corporate service fees of $171 million or 36% due to higher merger and acquisition advisory activity. Partially offsetting this growth was a decline in residential mortgage noninterest income of $38 million, reflecting a negative RMSR valuation adjustment and lower servicing fees.  
Other noninterest income of $293 million decreased $164 million linked quarter. The decline was primarily driven by a negative $173 million Visa derivative adjustment related to the extension of the expected timing of the litigation resolution.
Importantly, we continue to execute on our strategies to grow our fee businesses across the franchise, and those efforts helped to drive record fee income of $5.6 billion in 2020, an increase of $190 million or 4% compared to 2019. This growth was driven by higher corporate service fees primarily related to increased activity in our advisory businesses and treasury management as well as stronger residential mortgage noninterest income. Partially offsetting this growth was a decline in both consumer services and service charges on deposits due to impacts of the pandemic, particularly in the second quarter, as well as our ongoing efforts to simplify products and reduce transaction fees for our customers.  
Other noninterest income declined $109 million year-over-year or 8%, reflecting lower private equity revenue and elevated 2019 gains on asset sales related to our asset management business, partially offset by higher net securities gains.
Turning to Slide 8. Our full year 2020 noninterest expenses were $10.3 billion, a decline of $277 million or 3% compared with 2019, as we responded to the crises and we managed expenses down.  
Taking a look at the fourth quarter. Expenses grew by $177 million or 7% linked quarter, primarily driven by an increase in personnel expense of $111 million due to higher incentive compensation associated with increased business activity. And in addition, other expenses were up $55 million due to seasonality and equipment impairments.  
Importantly, we generated 3% positive operating leverage in 2020. And as a result, our efficiency ratio for the full year was 61%, improving from 63% last year. While the current environment presents revenue challenges, we remain deliberate and disciplined around our expense management. We had a 2020 goal of $300 million in cost savings through our continuous improvement program, and we successfully completed actions to achieve that goal.  
Looking forward to 2021, our annual CIP goal will once again be $300 million.  
Slide 9 is an update regarding specific industries we've identified as most likely to be impacted by the effects of the pandemic. Our outstanding loan balances in the COVID high-impact categories declined in the fourth quarter to $17.2 billion as of December 31 compared to $18.3 billion at the end of the third quarter, largely driven by commercial and industrial paydowns.
Within the C&I-identified industries, nonperforming loans remained relatively low, representing less than 1% of loans outstanding. And charge-offs have not been material. That being said, we do expect to see further stress in these industries.  
The lower half of this slide presents the highly impacted commercial real estate and related loan categories. These industries are experiencing the most pressure, and downgrades continue to occur. Our 2 largest charge-offs in the fourth quarter were related to loans in this category.  
Overall, for all of these COVID high-impact loans, we remain well reserved and continue to carefully monitor and manage these exposures.  
Moving to Slide 10. This is an update to our customer hardship release. We continue to see a reduction in the number of consumers and small businesses requesting hardship assistance. And importantly, loans under modification that present credit risk to PNC continue to decline. At the end of the year, we had $900 million of consumer and small business balances in some form of payment assistance with credit risk to PNC, down from $1.7 billion at September 30.  
On the commercial side, we're also continuing to selectively grant loan modifications based on each individual borrower's situation. Within our C&IB segment, less than $150 million of loan balances were in deferral as of December 31. When combining consumer and commercial customers, loans receiving assistance and posing credit risk to PNC are approximately $1 billion, representing less than 0.5% of total loans outstanding, and as I previously mentioned, are appropriately reserved.  
Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 11. Total delinquencies of $1.4 billion at December 31 increased $125 million or 10%. Consumer loan delinquencies increased $72 million, primarily due to government-insured mortgages that recently exited modification status. And commercial loan delinquencies grew by $53 million.  
Nonperforming loans increased $201 million or 10% compared to September 30. This growth was almost entirely driven by a $193 million increase in consumer loans, and within that, $189 million related to residential real estate, primarily as a result of borrowers exiting forbearance and deferring payments to the end of the term. Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $229 million, up $74 million from the third quarter. Commercial net charge-offs increased by $71 million to $109 million driven by specific commercial real estate-related borrowers and included certain portfolio management activities. Consumer net charge-offs were relatively stable at $120 million.  
Annualized net charge-offs to total loans in the fourth quarter was 37 basis points, an increase of only 2 basis points compared to the same period last year. As you can see, the allowance for credit losses to loans was 2.46% at quarter end, down slightly from 2.58% last quarter. We believe that our reserves sufficiently reflect the life of loan losses in the current portfolio.  
Slide 12 highlights the components of the change in our allowance for credit losses throughout the year. In the fourth quarter, reserves declined by $495 million. Economic and qualitative factors represented $398 million of the decline as improvement in our economic outlook was partially offset by increased reserves within our CRE portfolio. Correspondingly, our allowance for loan losses on our total commercial real estate portfolio have increased to 3.06% as of December 31.  
The remaining $97 million of the decline in reserves was related to portfolio changes, primarily driven by lower loan balances. Our year-end reserves of $5.9 billion have increased materially year-over-year, and as I mentioned before, now represent 2.46% of loans.  
Turning to Slide 13. I wanted to spend a few minutes reviewing our recently announced acquisition of BBVA USA, with a focus on updates since the call in November. We expect this transaction to add significant value to our shareholders, and we're excited about the power of the combined franchises. We remain confident in our ability to achieve the financial objectives we laid out at the time we announced the deal, including the $900 million of expense saves through enhanced operational efficiencies. Through time, we do expect to generate additional meaningful revenue synergies, which will make the economics of the transaction even more compelling.  
Since the announcement, we've continued to make steady progress towards completing the transaction. Notably, we've established cross-functional business teams to support the integration, submitted required regulatory applications and confirmed the mapping of the technology migration. There's a lot of hard work ahead, but based on our due diligence as well as the progress we've made to date working alongside the BBVA USA team, we're confident in our ability to execute and deliver on our objectives. This transaction will significantly accelerate our expansion efforts into attractive growth markets, is financially compelling and leverages our technology and acquisition expertise.  
In summary, PNC reported a strong fourth quarter and a successful 2020, and we're well positioned for 2021 and beyond. During 2021, naturally, the biggest variable impact in the economy will be the duration of this pandemic, and along with that, the efficacy of the government support plans as well as the vaccine distribution. Our current expectations are for real GDP to return to pre-recession levels by the end of the year and the Fed funds rate to remain near 0 throughout the duration of the year.  
Looking ahead at the first quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. We expect total average loans to be stable to down modestly. Inside of that, PPP loans are expected to be up approximately $2 billion. We expect NII to be down approximately 1%, which includes the impact of 2 fewer days in the first quarter. Excluding the impact of PPP, net interest income is expected to decline approximately 3%.  We expect total noninterest income to be down mid-single digits. Within that, other noninterest income is expected to be between $275 million and $325 million. We expect total noninterest expense to be down in the mid-single-digit range.  
In regard to net charge-offs, we expect first quarter levels to be between $200 million and $250 million.
Looking at the full year 2021 guidance, we thought it would be helpful to provide our expectation for PNC's stand-alone performance, excluding any onetime costs related to the BBVA USA transaction. For the full year 2021 compared to the full year 2020 results, we expect average loan growth to be down in the low single-digit range. The significant increase in loan utilization during the beginning of the pandemic elevated average loan balances in 2020, as you know, which created a difficult backdrop for the full year average loan growth comparison. However, we do expect to have loan growth throughout 2021, resulting in low single-digit spot growth for the year.  
We expect total revenue to be stable. We expect expenses to be stable. This represents -- oh, I'm sorry. Back that up. We expect revenues to be stable, and this represents a current net interest income forecast of down modestly. But we acknowledge potential deposit growth and further rate steepening in excess of our current forecast, it is plausible, and that's relative to revenues. We expect our expenses to be stable, and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 17%.  
Regarding the pending acquisition of BBVA USA, as I mentioned, we recently filed the required applications, and we're still targeting a midyear close, subject to regulatory approval. BBVA will not be releasing the results until later this month. Therefore, we will not be providing updates to the previously disclosed financial metrics and estimates related to BBVA USA at this time.  
However, in an effort to provide some context for the transaction in relation to our full year guidance, assuming we close midyear and excluding integration costs, we expect the acquisition to be approximately $600 million accretive to PNC's 2021 pre-provision net revenue. And all of that is consistent with our original assumptions.
And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions."

It's a closed system. And as that happens, PNC benefits disproportionately, at least has and I suspect will, given some constraints on the largest banks on deposit growth, which in turn gives us NII. 
So we kind of say, ""Fine. Call NII flat, but there's a macro variable in here that will hit the industry as a function of loan growth and what the Fed does, it's going to drive this opportunity."""

As you saw, we had a solid start to the year as we grew revenue and controlled our expenses to generate positive operating leverage in the linked quarter comparison our first quarter results also benefited from our provision recapture, driven largely by an improving economic outlook. Despite this recapture, our reserves remain at over 2% of loans as we continue to work through the COVID fallout and work to understand potential secular changes on certain asset classes. 
Our capital and liquidity levels also remain at record highs. With a rise in term yields, we've been deploying some of this excess liquidity and increased our investment securities by $9 billion at period end. You'll notice they didn't change much on an average basis as we bought later in the quarter. We also actually added another $9 billion in TBAs that are going to settle early in the second quarter here. 
And finally, we've continued our purchase activity into the second quarter, and we continue to operate, notwithstanding this at very high levels of cash that can be deployed over time in loans or securities-based on market opportunities. While not a surprise, the quarter was impacted by continued weak loan demand in the face of strong strong bond market issuance levels, pay downs and competition resulting in historically low utilization levels. Based on the strength of the U.S. economy, we would expect to see loan demand improve and ultimately drive utilization rates higher time. 
We continue to execute well against our strategic priorities, including our national expansion, which will significantly accelerate through our pending acquisition of BBVA USA. We're making good progress on BBVA integration planning and are on track for a midyear close, pending regulatory approvals. We haven't found any significant surprises regarding the quality or nature of BBVA's business, and our employees are working effectively with their BBVA counterparts on everything, including the technology conversion. 
And the quality of BBVA markets, especially in their largest market in Texas -- and the quality of their largest markets, especially in Texas, and is proving to be everything we hoped it would as we plan for the integration of BBVA U.S.A., we continue to invest in and leverage our own technology so that we can better serve our customers. 
Earlier this week, PNC launched low cash mode, which fundamentally changes the banking experience for our virtual wallet customers by allowing them to avoid fees through unprecedented account transparency and control. Low cash mode represents a shift away from the industry's widely used overdraft approach, which drives customer dissatisfaction and which we believe is unsustainable. 
We firmly believe this differentiated approach will drive significant growth in new and existing customer relationships over time as we execute our national expansion strategy. Low cash mode allows our Virtual Wallet customers to see and control what's happening in their checking accounts in real time. 
If a customer's balance is negative or about to go naive, they have at least 24 hours to cure their negative balance by determining whether certain payments are processed that otherwise might result in overdrafts. This payment control is a significant differentiator that we believe will help customers avoid overdraft fees of approximately $125 million to $150 million annually. 
PNC's full '21 -- full year '21 revenue outlook anticipated this fee reduction, as did our estimate of a contribution to PNC as a result -- and as a result, is not impacted by this change. I'd like to close by thanking our employees who continue to support our clients and communities through the various COVID challenges by executing on our value-added relationship-based model. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a closer look at results and then we'll take questions."

As you've seen, we reported first quarter net income of $1.8 billion or $4.1 per diluted common share. Our balance sheet is on Slide 3 and is presented on an average basis.

Our balance sheet is on Slide 3 and is presented on an average basis. 
During the quarter, loans declined by $8 billion or 3% and due to lower utilization and continued soft loan demand. Investment securities grew approximately $700 million or 1% linked quarter. However, on a spot basis, balances increased $9 billion or 11% as we accelerated our purchase activity near the end of the quarter due to the steepening yield curve. 
Our average cash balances at the Federal Reserve grew to $85 billion in the first quarter, driven by continued deposit growth and lower loan balance. On the liability side, deposit balances averaged $365 billion and were up $6 billion or 2% linked quarter. Borrowed funds decreased $3 billion compared to the fourth quarter due to the runoff and redemption of debt obligations. 
Our tangible book value was $96.57 per common share as of March 31, a decrease on a linked-quarter basis primarily due to a decline in AOCI. Year-over-year, tangible book value increased 14%. And as March -- as of March 31, 2021, our CET1 ratio was estimated to be 12.6%. 
Regarding capital return, our Board recently approved a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $1.15 per share or approximately $500 million. And as you know, we continue to suspend our share repurchases during the first quarter as we await regulatory approval for our pending BBVA USA acquisition. Assuming a midyear close, we expect to resume share repurchases in the second half of the year. 
Slide 4 shows our average loans and deposits in more detail. Average loan balances of $238 billion in the first quarter were down $8 billion or 3% compared to the fourth quarter. Commercial loan balances declined $5.4 billion or 3% as overall utilization rates decline to historically low levels. Beyond that, Paycheck Protection Program balances remained flat as originations were offset by loans for given. And within our commercial real estate business, multifamily warehouse lending declined seasonally by $2 billion. 
Consumer loans were down $2.3 billion with lower balances across all consumer categories as loan demand continued to soften due to the higher consumer cash levels. The yield on loan balances was 3.38%, a 3 basis point increase compared to the fourth quarter. However, the increase reflected elevated commercial real estate prepayment fees and higher PPP loan forgiveness during the quarter. 
The rate paid on our interest-bearing deposits is now 6 basis points, a 2 basis point decline linked quarter. Average deposits increased $6 billion or 2% driven by enhanced consumer liquidity, primarily related to government stimulus payments. In the year-over-year comparison, total average loans decreased 2% or $5 billion, primarily due to the elevated drawdown that occurred during the first quarter of 2020. 
Deposits increased $76 billion or 26% and again, were driven by the high cash balances of our customers. As a point of context, consumer checking account balances are, on average, roughly 40% higher than this time a year ago. As a result, our period-end loan to deposit ratio has declined to a historic low of 63% at the end of the first quarter compared to 87% in the same period in 2020. 
Slide 5 details a change in our average securities and federal reserve balances over the past year. Security balances of $86 billion in the first quarter increased $2 billion or 2% compared to the same period a year ago. Over the same time, our Fed balances have increased nearly fivefold driven by significant government stimulus as well as the proceeds from the sale of our equity investment in BlackRock. 
As most of you know, during 2020, we were patient in deploying this excess liquidity, while interest rates remain at historically low levels. However, with the recent yield curve steepening, we accelerated our rate of purchasing increasing our spot balances by $9 billion, with another $9 billion of forward settling securities as of March 31. 
Average security balances now represent approximately 20% of interest-earning assets. And our expectation is to build these balances to approximately 25% to 30% by year-end. As you can see on Slide 6, net income of $1.8 billion grew 25% compared to the fourth quarter reflecting strong pretax pre-provision earnings and a substantial provision recapture. 
First quarter revenue was $4.2 billion, up slightly compared with the fourth quarter driven by higher noninterest income, which was 44% of total revenue in the first quarter. Expenses declined $134 million or 5% and remained well controlled. The provision recapture of $551 million reflected improved forecasted economic conditions and lower loan balances. 
Now let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Turning to Slide 7. This chart illustrates our diversified business mix. Total revenue increased $12 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Net interest income of $2.3 billion was down $76 million or 3%, primarily due to lower loan balances and 2 fewer days. 
Net interest margin of 2.27% declined 5 basis points, reflecting the impact of higher fed cash balances. Importantly, we think NIM has bottomed this quarter and expect it to slowly rise throughout 2021. 
Noninterest income grew $88 million compared with the fourth quarter. Fee income of $1.4 billion decreased $102 million or 7%. Most of the decline was driven by lower corporate service fees related to elevated fourth quarter merger and acquisition advisory activity. Additionally, consumer services and service charges on deposits were down slightly, reflecting seasonally lower activity and higher consumer cash balances. And growth in both asset management fees and residential mortgage revenue partially offset some of the decline. 
Other noninterest income of $483 million grew $190 million and included higher revenue from both private equity and underwriting. Linked quarter growth also reflected the impact of the $173 million negative visa derivative adjustment in the fourth quarter. 
Compared to the same period a year ago, total revenue declined $116 million, as a decrease in net interest income from lower interest rates and volumes was partially offset by growth in our broad-based fee businesses. 
Turning to Slide 8. Expenses were down by $134 million or 5% linked quarter across all categories. Primarily due to disciplined expense management and seasonality. Year-over-year expenses increased $31 million or 1% and remained well controlled. 
During the first quarter, we generated 5% linked quarter positive operating leverage. And as a result, our efficiency ratio for the first quarter was 61%. We remain deliberate around our expense management and as we've previously stated, we have a goal to reduce costs by $300 million in 2021 through our continuous improvement program and we're confident we'll achieve our full year target. As you know, this program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business in technology investments. 
Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 9 and reflect improvement in all these 3 major categories. Nonperforming loans decreased $148 million or 6% compared to December 31. Commercial nonperforming loans declined by $174 million or 19%, which reflected portfolio activity as well as improved credit performance. 
Consumer nonperforming loans increased $26 million related to residential real estate and home equity loans as a result of borrowers exiting forbearance. Total delinquencies of $1.1 billion at March 31 decreased $217 million or 16%. Consumer loan delinquencies declined $203 million primarily due to lower auto and residential real estate and commercial loan delinquencies decreased by $14 million. 
Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $146 million, a decline of $83 million linked quarter. Commercial net charge-offs of $51 million decreased by $58 million, driven by lower gross charge-offs. And consumer net charge-offs of $95 million declined by $25 million, primarily in our auto and credit card portfolios. 
Annualized net charge-offs to total loans in the first quarter was 25 basis points, a decrease of 10 compared to the same period last year. 
Slide 10 shows a hundred $24 million reduction in our allowance for credit losses during the first quarter. Portfolio changes represented $251 million of the decline, primarily driven by lower loan balances. $473 million of the release in reserves was related to economic and qualitative factors. Improvement in our economic outlook was partially offset by increased reserves within our CRE portfolio, particularly in the areas directly impacted by COVID. In total, our quarter end reserves were $5.2 billion, representing 2.2% of our loans. 
Turning to Slide 11. I want to highlight the progress we've made towards completing the acquisition of BBVA USA. Notably, we filed all major regulatory applications and have completed a number of our key pre-close objectives. We're on track to close the acquisition midyear and remain confident in our ability to achieve the financial objectives we laid out at the time that we announced the deal. 
In summary, P&C reported a strong first quarter. In regard to our view of the overall economy, our current expectations are for GDP to surpass prerecession levels sometime during the third quarter. And for the Fed funds rate to remain near 0 throughout 2021. 
Looking at the second quarter of 2021. Compared to the first quarter of 2021, we expect total average loan balances to be stable. We expect NII to be up approximately 2%. We expect fee income to be up approximately 3% to 5%. We expect other noninterest income to be between $300 million and $350 million excluding net securities and Visa activity. We expect total noninterest expense to be stable, and we expect second quarter net charge-offs to be between $150 million and $200 million. 
Looking at the full year 2021 guidance, we expect PNC stand-alone to remain stable year-over-year in regard to both revenue and expenses. We do expect revenue benefits from a higher rate environment and increased securities balances. However, average loans will continue to be a drag through at least the first half of 2021. We acknowledge some upside exists in spot loan growth during the second half of the year, but that remains to be seen, and as a result, is not included in our guidance. 
Regarding the pending acquisition of BBVA U.S.A., we're increasing our expectations for the full year benefit to PNC's 2021 pre-provision net revenue from $600 million to $700 million, primarily driven by refinements to interest rate assumptions. Consistent with last quarter, this expectation excludes integration costs and assumes a midyear close. 
And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions."

And then third, for the foreseeable future, we'll be running as a percentage of our interest-earning assets securities balances at a higher level. So historically, we've been approximately in the 20% range. We're guiding toward more of the 25% to 30% range."

You see that in the actions late in the fourth quarter -- sorry, late in the first quarter, if we were simply trying to drive NII, we could have front-loaded those purchases at lower yields and had NII flat. We didn't do that. We waited. Waiting turns out to have been the right thing. And you'll see us do that.

Bring on the competition. At some point, they need to make money and to justify their existence. Our challenge is presenting, and we think we do this. A great proposition to our customers with ease of use and the very best products. And I think we have the technology backbone to do that. So I'm less worried about pith somebody. I'm more worried about safety and soundness to the system and data and disruption to our customers who don't understand where data is being shared and who has access to it."

As you saw, we had a solid start to the year as we grew revenue and controlled our expenses to generate positive operating leverage in the linked quarter comparison our first quarter results also benefited from our provision recapture, driven largely by an improving economic outlook. Despite this recapture, our reserves remain at over 2% of loans as we continue to work through the COVID fallout and work to understand potential secular changes on certain asset classes. 
Our capital and liquidity levels also remain at record highs. With a rise in term yields, we've been deploying some of this excess liquidity and increased our investment securities by $9 billion at period end. You'll notice they didn't change much on an average basis as we bought later in the quarter. We also actually added another $9 billion in TBAs that are going to settle early in the second quarter here. 
And finally, we've continued our purchase activity into the second quarter, and we continue to operate, notwithstanding this at very high levels of cash that can be deployed over time in loans or securities-based on market opportunities. While not a surprise, the quarter was impacted by continued weak loan demand in the face of strong strong bond market issuance levels, pay downs and competition resulting in historically low utilization levels. Based on the strength of the U.S. economy, we would expect to see loan demand improve and ultimately drive utilization rates higher time. 
We continue to execute well against our strategic priorities, including our national expansion, which will significantly accelerate through our pending acquisition of BBVA USA. We're making good progress on BBVA integration planning and are on track for a midyear close, pending regulatory approvals. We haven't found any significant surprises regarding the quality or nature of BBVA's business, and our employees are working effectively with their BBVA counterparts on everything, including the technology conversion. 
And the quality of BBVA markets, especially in their largest market in Texas -- and the quality of their largest markets, especially in Texas, and is proving to be everything we hoped it would as we plan for the integration of BBVA U.S.A., we continue to invest in and leverage our own technology so that we can better serve our customers. 
Earlier this week, PNC launched low cash mode, which fundamentally changes the banking experience for our virtual wallet customers by allowing them to avoid fees through unprecedented account transparency and control. Low cash mode represents a shift away from the industry's widely used overdraft approach, which drives customer dissatisfaction and which we believe is unsustainable. 
We firmly believe this differentiated approach will drive significant growth in new and existing customer relationships over time as we execute our national expansion strategy. Low cash mode allows our Virtual Wallet customers to see and control what's happening in their checking accounts in real time. 
If a customer's balance is negative or about to go naive, they have at least 24 hours to cure their negative balance by determining whether certain payments are processed that otherwise might result in overdrafts. This payment control is a significant differentiator that we believe will help customers avoid overdraft fees of approximately $125 million to $150 million annually. 
PNC's full '21 -- full year '21 revenue outlook anticipated this fee reduction, as did our estimate of a contribution to PNC as a result -- and as a result, is not impacted by this change. I'd like to close by thanking our employees who continue to support our clients and communities through the various COVID challenges by executing on our value-added relationship-based model. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a closer look at results and then we'll take questions."

As you've seen, we reported first quarter net income of $1.8 billion or $4.1 per diluted common share. Our balance sheet is on Slide 3 and is presented on an average basis.

Our balance sheet is on Slide 3 and is presented on an average basis. 
During the quarter, loans declined by $8 billion or 3% and due to lower utilization and continued soft loan demand. Investment securities grew approximately $700 million or 1% linked quarter. However, on a spot basis, balances increased $9 billion or 11% as we accelerated our purchase activity near the end of the quarter due to the steepening yield curve. 
Our average cash balances at the Federal Reserve grew to $85 billion in the first quarter, driven by continued deposit growth and lower loan balance. On the liability side, deposit balances averaged $365 billion and were up $6 billion or 2% linked quarter. Borrowed funds decreased $3 billion compared to the fourth quarter due to the runoff and redemption of debt obligations. 
Our tangible book value was $96.57 per common share as of March 31, a decrease on a linked-quarter basis primarily due to a decline in AOCI. Year-over-year, tangible book value increased 14%. And as March -- as of March 31, 2021, our CET1 ratio was estimated to be 12.6%. 
Regarding capital return, our Board recently approved a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $1.15 per share or approximately $500 million. And as you know, we continue to suspend our share repurchases during the first quarter as we await regulatory approval for our pending BBVA USA acquisition. Assuming a midyear close, we expect to resume share repurchases in the second half of the year. 
Slide 4 shows our average loans and deposits in more detail. Average loan balances of $238 billion in the first quarter were down $8 billion or 3% compared to the fourth quarter. Commercial loan balances declined $5.4 billion or 3% as overall utilization rates decline to historically low levels. Beyond that, Paycheck Protection Program balances remained flat as originations were offset by loans for given. And within our commercial real estate business, multifamily warehouse lending declined seasonally by $2 billion. 
Consumer loans were down $2.3 billion with lower balances across all consumer categories as loan demand continued to soften due to the higher consumer cash levels. The yield on loan balances was 3.38%, a 3 basis point increase compared to the fourth quarter. However, the increase reflected elevated commercial real estate prepayment fees and higher PPP loan forgiveness during the quarter. 
The rate paid on our interest-bearing deposits is now 6 basis points, a 2 basis point decline linked quarter. Average deposits increased $6 billion or 2% driven by enhanced consumer liquidity, primarily related to government stimulus payments. In the year-over-year comparison, total average loans decreased 2% or $5 billion, primarily due to the elevated drawdown that occurred during the first quarter of 2020. 
Deposits increased $76 billion or 26% and again, were driven by the high cash balances of our customers. As a point of context, consumer checking account balances are, on average, roughly 40% higher than this time a year ago. As a result, our period-end loan to deposit ratio has declined to a historic low of 63% at the end of the first quarter compared to 87% in the same period in 2020. 
Slide 5 details a change in our average securities and federal reserve balances over the past year. Security balances of $86 billion in the first quarter increased $2 billion or 2% compared to the same period a year ago. Over the same time, our Fed balances have increased nearly fivefold driven by significant government stimulus as well as the proceeds from the sale of our equity investment in BlackRock. 
As most of you know, during 2020, we were patient in deploying this excess liquidity, while interest rates remain at historically low levels. However, with the recent yield curve steepening, we accelerated our rate of purchasing increasing our spot balances by $9 billion, with another $9 billion of forward settling securities as of March 31. 
Average security balances now represent approximately 20% of interest-earning assets. And our expectation is to build these balances to approximately 25% to 30% by year-end. As you can see on Slide 6, net income of $1.8 billion grew 25% compared to the fourth quarter reflecting strong pretax pre-provision earnings and a substantial provision recapture. 
First quarter revenue was $4.2 billion, up slightly compared with the fourth quarter driven by higher noninterest income, which was 44% of total revenue in the first quarter. Expenses declined $134 million or 5% and remained well controlled. The provision recapture of $551 million reflected improved forecasted economic conditions and lower loan balances. 
Now let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Turning to Slide 7. This chart illustrates our diversified business mix. Total revenue increased $12 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Net interest income of $2.3 billion was down $76 million or 3%, primarily due to lower loan balances and 2 fewer days. 
Net interest margin of 2.27% declined 5 basis points, reflecting the impact of higher fed cash balances. Importantly, we think NIM has bottomed this quarter and expect it to slowly rise throughout 2021. 
Noninterest income grew $88 million compared with the fourth quarter. Fee income of $1.4 billion decreased $102 million or 7%. Most of the decline was driven by lower corporate service fees related to elevated fourth quarter merger and acquisition advisory activity. Additionally, consumer services and service charges on deposits were down slightly, reflecting seasonally lower activity and higher consumer cash balances. And growth in both asset management fees and residential mortgage revenue partially offset some of the decline. 
Other noninterest income of $483 million grew $190 million and included higher revenue from both private equity and underwriting. Linked quarter growth also reflected the impact of the $173 million negative visa derivative adjustment in the fourth quarter. 
Compared to the same period a year ago, total revenue declined $116 million, as a decrease in net interest income from lower interest rates and volumes was partially offset by growth in our broad-based fee businesses. 
Turning to Slide 8. Expenses were down by $134 million or 5% linked quarter across all categories. Primarily due to disciplined expense management and seasonality. Year-over-year expenses increased $31 million or 1% and remained well controlled. 
During the first quarter, we generated 5% linked quarter positive operating leverage. And as a result, our efficiency ratio for the first quarter was 61%. We remain deliberate around our expense management and as we've previously stated, we have a goal to reduce costs by $300 million in 2021 through our continuous improvement program and we're confident we'll achieve our full year target. As you know, this program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business in technology investments. 
Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 9 and reflect improvement in all these 3 major categories. Nonperforming loans decreased $148 million or 6% compared to December 31. Commercial nonperforming loans declined by $174 million or 19%, which reflected portfolio activity as well as improved credit performance. 
Consumer nonperforming loans increased $26 million related to residential real estate and home equity loans as a result of borrowers exiting forbearance. Total delinquencies of $1.1 billion at March 31 decreased $217 million or 16%. Consumer loan delinquencies declined $203 million primarily due to lower auto and residential real estate and commercial loan delinquencies decreased by $14 million. 
Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $146 million, a decline of $83 million linked quarter. Commercial net charge-offs of $51 million decreased by $58 million, driven by lower gross charge-offs. And consumer net charge-offs of $95 million declined by $25 million, primarily in our auto and credit card portfolios. 
Annualized net charge-offs to total loans in the first quarter was 25 basis points, a decrease of 10 compared to the same period last year. 
Slide 10 shows a hundred $24 million reduction in our allowance for credit losses during the first quarter. Portfolio changes represented $251 million of the decline, primarily driven by lower loan balances. $473 million of the release in reserves was related to economic and qualitative factors. Improvement in our economic outlook was partially offset by increased reserves within our CRE portfolio, particularly in the areas directly impacted by COVID. In total, our quarter end reserves were $5.2 billion, representing 2.2% of our loans. 
Turning to Slide 11. I want to highlight the progress we've made towards completing the acquisition of BBVA USA. Notably, we filed all major regulatory applications and have completed a number of our key pre-close objectives. We're on track to close the acquisition midyear and remain confident in our ability to achieve the financial objectives we laid out at the time that we announced the deal. 
In summary, P&C reported a strong first quarter. In regard to our view of the overall economy, our current expectations are for GDP to surpass prerecession levels sometime during the third quarter. And for the Fed funds rate to remain near 0 throughout 2021. 
Looking at the second quarter of 2021. Compared to the first quarter of 2021, we expect total average loan balances to be stable. We expect NII to be up approximately 2%. We expect fee income to be up approximately 3% to 5%. We expect other noninterest income to be between $300 million and $350 million excluding net securities and Visa activity. We expect total noninterest expense to be stable, and we expect second quarter net charge-offs to be between $150 million and $200 million. 
Looking at the full year 2021 guidance, we expect PNC stand-alone to remain stable year-over-year in regard to both revenue and expenses. We do expect revenue benefits from a higher rate environment and increased securities balances. However, average loans will continue to be a drag through at least the first half of 2021. We acknowledge some upside exists in spot loan growth during the second half of the year, but that remains to be seen, and as a result, is not included in our guidance. 
Regarding the pending acquisition of BBVA U.S.A., we're increasing our expectations for the full year benefit to PNC's 2021 pre-provision net revenue from $600 million to $700 million, primarily driven by refinements to interest rate assumptions. Consistent with last quarter, this expectation excludes integration costs and assumes a midyear close. 
And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions."

When we take a look at the full year, and this is part of our guidance in terms of revenue being stable for the full year. We do expect some more NII from our securities book. As we increase the balances, and that's going to be offset by a little bit less loan growth than what we were expecting at the beginning of the year. So that's where we come out in terms of stable. In regard to the building up of the securities book, I mean, it's 3 things, really. One, we have put more money to work because the curve has deepened. Second, we're going to continue to do that in a measured way. And then third, for the foreseeable future, we'll be running as a percentage of our interest-earning assets securities balances at a higher level. So historically, we've been approximately in the 20% range. We're guiding toward more of the 25% to 30% range."

You see that in the actions late in the fourth quarter -- sorry, late in the first quarter, if we were simply trying to drive NII, we could have front-loaded those purchases at lower yields and had NII flat. We didn't do that. We waited. Waiting turns out to have been the right thing. And you'll see us do that.

Or is this sort of the competitive landscape that is sort of the new reality?"

And not -- I'm not referring to chime specifically, but rather new entrants into the payment space, the exponential increase in fraud we've seen because of less robust. Know your customer rules and frankly, probably just because of the Covid environment. All of that is gathered attention of politicians and regulators. The competition side, we're happy to compete. I'm somewhat shocked actually, nobody's asked me a question about low cash flow that we rolled out this -- yesterday, day before. That product is a result of years of technology investment that allows us, I think, is the only institution in the world to have effectively real-time capability of what's going on in our customers' accounts. And therefore, showing them what's going on in their accounts and therefore, empowering them to choose what's going on in their accounts. No, fintech has that. Go back to -- because they rely on these small banks as their back office, which, in turn, are relying on 30-year-old cobalt-based mainframe-based batch process, not very exciting core processors. Bring on the competition. At some point, they need to make money and to justify their existence. Our challenge is presenting, and we think we do this. A great proposition to our customers with ease of use and the very best products. And I think we have the technology backbone to do that. So I'm less worried about pith somebody. I'm more worried about safety and soundness to the system and data and disruption to our customers who don't understand where data is being shared and who has access to it."

As you saw, we had a solid start to the year as we grew revenue and controlled our expenses to generate positive operating leverage in the linked quarter comparison.

As you saw, we had a solid start to the year as we grew revenue and controlled our expenses to generate positive operating leverage in the linked quarter comparison. Our first quarter results also benefited from our provision recapture, driven largely by an improving economic outlook. Despite this recapture, our reserves remain at over 2% of loans as we continue to work through the COVID fallout and work to understand potential secular changes on certain asset classes.  
Our capital and liquidity levels also remain at record highs. With a rise in term yields, we've been deploying some of this excess liquidity and increased our investment securities by $9 billion at period end. You'll notice they didn't change much on an average basis as we bought later in the quarter. We also actually added another $9 billion in TBAs that are going to settle early in the second quarter here.  
Now -- and finally, we've continued our purchase activity into the second quarter, and we continue to operate, notwithstanding this at very high levels of cash at the fed that can be deployed over time in loans or securities-based on market opportunities. While not a surprise, the quarter was impacted by continued weak loan demand in the face of strong bond market issuance levels, paydowns and competition resulting in historically low utilization levels. Based on the strength of the U.S. economy, we would expect to see loan demand improve and ultimately drive utilization rates higher over time.  
We continue to execute well against our strategic priorities, including our national expansion, which will significantly accelerate through our pending acquisition of BBVA USA. We're making good progress on BBVA integration planning and are on track for a midyear close pending regulatory approval. We haven't found any significant surprises regarding the quality or nature of BBVA's business, and our employees are working effectively with their BBVA counterparts on everything, including the technology conversion.  
But the quality of BBVA markets, especially in their largest market in Texas -- and the quality of their largest markets, especially in Texas, is proving to be everything we hoped it would be. As we plan for the integration of BBVA U.S.A., we continue to invest in and leverage our own technology so that we can better serve our customers.  
Earlier this week, PNC launched low cash mode, which fundamentally changes the banking experience for our virtual wallet customers by allowing them to avoid overdraft fees through unprecedented account transparency and control. Low cash mode represents a shift away from the industry's widely used overdraft approach, which drives customer dissatisfaction and which we believe is unsustainable.  
We firmly believe this differentiated approach will drive significant growth in new and existing customer relationships over time as we execute our national expansion strategy. Low cash mode allows our virtual wallet customers to see and control what's happening in their checking accounts in real time.  
If a customer's balance is negative or about to go negative, they have at least 24 hours to cure their negative balance by determining whether certain payments are processed that otherwise might result in overdrafts. This payment control is a significant differentiator that we believe will help customers avoid overdraft fees of approximately $125 million to $150 million annually.  
PNC's full '21 -- full year '21 revenue outlook anticipated this fee reduction, as did our estimate of a contribution to PNC as a result -- and as a result is not impacted by this change. I'd like to close by thanking our employees who continue to support our clients and communities through the various COVID challenges by executing on our value-added relationship-based model. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a closer look at results and then we'll take your questions."

Our balance sheet is on Slide 3 and is presented on an average basis.  
During the quarter, loans declined by $8 billion or 3% due to lower utilization and continued soft loan demand. Investment securities grew approximately $700 million or 1% linked quarter. However, on a spot basis, balances increased $9 billion or 11% as we accelerated our purchase activity near the end of the quarter due to the steepening yield curve.  
Our average cash balances at the Federal Reserve grew to $85 billion in the first quarter, driven by continued deposit growth and lower loan balance. On the liability side, deposit balances averaged $365 billion and were up $6 billion or 2% linked quarter. Borrowed funds decreased $3 billion compared to the fourth quarter due to the runoff and redemption of debt obligations.  
Our tangible book value was $96.57 per common share as of March 31, a decrease on a linked-quarter basis primarily due to a decline in AOCI. Year-over-year, tangible book value increased 14%. And as of March 31, 2021, our CET1 ratio was estimated to be 12.6%.  
Regarding capital return, our Board recently approved a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $1.15 per share or approximately $500 million. And as you know, we continue to suspend our share repurchases during the first quarter as we await regulatory approval for our pending BBVA USA acquisition. Assuming a midyear close, we expect to resume share repurchases in the second half of the year.  
Slide 4 shows our average loans and deposits in more detail. Average loan balances of $238 billion in the first quarter were down $8 billion or 3% compared to the fourth quarter. Commercial loan balances declined $5.4 billion or 3% as overall utilization rates decline to historically low levels. Beyond that, Paycheck Protection Program balances remained flat as originations were offset by loans forgiven. And within our commercial real estate business, multifamily warehouse lending declined seasonally by $2 billion.  
Consumer loans were down $2.3 billion with lower balances across all consumer categories as loan demand continued to soften due to the higher consumer cash levels. The yield on loan balances was 3.38%, a 3 basis point increase compared to the fourth quarter. However, the increase reflected elevated commercial real estate prepayment fees and higher PPP loan forgiveness during the quarter.  
The rate paid on our interest-bearing deposits is now 6 basis points, a 2 basis point decline linked quarter. Average deposits increased $6 billion or 2% driven by enhanced consumer liquidity, primarily related to government stimulus payments. In the year-over-year comparison, total average loans decreased 2% or $5 billion, primarily due to the elevated drawdowns that occurred during the first quarter of 2020.  
Deposits increased $76 billion or 26% and, again, were driven by the high cash balances of our customers. As a point of context, consumer checking account balances are, on average, roughly 40% higher than this time a year ago. As a result, our period-end loan to deposit ratio has declined to a historic low of 63% at the end of the first quarter compared to 87% in the same period in 2020.  
Slide 5 details of a change in our average securities and federal reserve balances over the past year. Security balances of $86 billion in the first quarter increased $2 billion or 2% compared to the same period a year ago. Over the same time, our Fed balances have increased nearly fivefold driven by significant government stimulus as well as the proceeds from the sale of our equity investment in BlackRock.  
As most of you know, during 2020, we were patient in deploying this excess liquidity, while interest rates remained at historically low levels. However, with the recent yield curve steepening, we accelerated our rate of purchasing increasing our spot balances by $9 billion, with another $9 billion of forward settling securities as of March 31.  
Average security balances now represent approximately 20% of interest-earning assets. And our expectation is to build these balances to approximately 25% to 30% by year-end. As you can see on Slide 6, net income of $1.8 billion grew 25% compared to the fourth quarter reflecting strong pretax pre-provision earnings and a substantial provision recapture.  
First quarter revenue was $4.2 billion, up slightly compared with the fourth quarter driven by higher noninterest income, which was 44% of total revenue in the first quarter. Expenses declined $134 million or 5% and remained well controlled. The provision recapture of $551 million reflected improved forecasted economic conditions and lower loan balances.  
Now let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Turning to Slide 7. This chart illustrates our diversified business mix. Total revenue increased $12 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Net interest income of $2.3 billion was down $76 million or 3%, primarily due to lower loan balances and 2 fewer days.  
Net interest margin of 2.27% declined 5 basis points, reflecting the impact of higher fed cash balances. Importantly, we think NIM has bottomed this quarter and expect it to slowly rise throughout 2021.  
Noninterest income grew $88 million compared with the fourth quarter. Fee income of $1.4 billion decreased $102 million or 7%. Most of the decline was driven by lower corporate service fees related to elevated fourth quarter merger and acquisition advisory activity. Additionally, consumer services and service charges on deposits were down slightly, reflecting seasonally lower activity and higher consumer cash balances. And growth in both asset management fees and residential mortgage revenue partially offset some of the decline.  
Other noninterest income of $483 million grew $190 million and included higher revenue from both private equity and underwriting. Linked quarter growth also reflected the impact of the $173 million negative visa derivative adjustment in the fourth quarter.  
Compared to the same period a year ago, total revenue declined $116 million, as a decrease in net interest income from lower interest rates and volumes was partially offset by growth in our broad-based fee businesses.  
Turning to Slide 8. Expenses were down by $134 million or 5% linked quarter across all categories primarily due to disciplined expense management and seasonality. Year-over-year expenses increased $31 million or 1% and remained well controlled.  
During the first quarter, we generated 5% linked quarter positive operating leverage. And as a result, our efficiency ratio for the first quarter was 61%. We remain deliberate around our expense management. And as we've previously stated, we have a goal to reduce costs by $300 million in 2021 through our continuous improvement program, and we're confident we'll achieve our full year target. As you know, this program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business in technology investments.  
Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 9 and reflect improvement in all these 3 major categories. Nonperforming loans decreased $148 million or 6% compared to December 31. Commercial nonperforming loans declined by $174 million or 19%, which reflected portfolio activity as well as improved credit performance.  
Consumer nonperforming loans increased $26 million related to residential real estate and home equity loans as a result of borrowers exiting forbearance. Total delinquencies of $1.1 billion at March 31 decreased $217 million or 16%. Consumer loan delinquencies declined $203 million primarily due to lower auto and residential real estate, and commercial loan delinquencies decreased by $14 million.  
Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $146 million, a decline of $83 million linked quarter. Commercial net charge-offs of $51 million decreased by $58 million, driven by lower gross charge-offs. And consumer net charge-offs of $95 million declined by $25 million, primarily in our auto and credit card portfolios.  
Annualized net charge-offs to total loans in the first quarter was 25 basis points, a decrease of 10 basis points compared to the same period last year.  
Slide 10 shows the $724 million reduction in our allowance for credit losses during the first quarter. Portfolio changes represented $251 million of the decline, primarily driven by lower loan balances. $473 million of the release in reserves was related to economic and qualitative factors. Improvement in our economic outlook was partially offset by increased reserves within our CRE portfolio, particularly in the areas directly impacted by COVID. In total, our quarter end reserves were $5.2 billion, representing 2.2% of our loans.  
Turning to Slide 11. I want to highlight the progress we've made towards completing the acquisition of BBVA USA. Notably, we filed all major regulatory applications and have completed a number of our key pre-close objectives. We're on track to close the acquisition midyear and remain confident in our ability to achieve the financial objectives we laid out at the time that we announced the deal.  
In summary, PNC reported a strong first quarter. In regard to our view of the overall economy, our current expectations are for GDP to surpass prerecession levels sometime during the third quarter and for the Fed funds rate to remain near 0 throughout 2021.  
Looking at the second quarter of 2021, compared to the first quarter of 2021, we expect total average loan balances to be stable. We expect NII to be up approximately 2%. We expect fee income to be up approximately 3% to 5%. We expect other noninterest income to be between $300 million and $350 million excluding net securities and Visa activity. We expect total noninterest expense to be stable, and we expect second quarter net charge-offs to be between $150 million and $200 million.  
Looking at the full year 2021 guidance, we expect PNC stand-alone to remain stable year-over-year in regard to both revenue and expenses. We do expect revenue benefits from a higher rate environment and increased securities balances. However, average loans will continue to be a drag through at least the first half of 2021. We acknowledge some upside exists in spot loan growth during the second half of the year. But that remains to be seen and, as a result, is not included in our guidance.  
Regarding the pending acquisition of BBVA U.S.A., we're increasing our expectations for the full year benefit to PNC's 2021 pre-provision net revenue from $600 million to $700 million, primarily driven by refinements to interest rate assumptions. Consistent with last quarter, this expectation excludes integration costs and assumes a midyear close.  
And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions."

When we take a look at the full year, and this is part of our guidance in terms of revenue being stable for the full year. We do expect some more NII from our securities book as we increase the balances, and that's going to be offset by a little bit less loan growth than what we were expecting at the beginning of the year. So that's where we come out in terms of stable. 
In regard to the building up of the securities book, I mean, it's 3 things, really. One, we have put more money to work because the curve has deepened. Second, we're going to continue to do that in a measured way. And then third, for the foreseeable future, we'll be running as a percentage of our interest-earning assets securities balances at a higher level.

I guess, just thinking about, as we look to like sort of these pent-up demand dynamics and sort of like the reopening and like kind of animal spirits being unleashed as you look to the second half of the year and all of that being a positive for loan growth, like how does that differ between the consumer and the commercial side? Like there's a lot of liquidity sitting around on commercial balance sheets. There's -- consumer has a lot of savings. But does that sort of delay like the rebound in balance growth on each side? Or are both sides going to be affected similarly or differently? Maybe just some color or perspective."

And not -- I'm not referring to chime specifically, but rather new entrants into the payment space, the exponential increase in fraud we've seen because of less robust, know your customer rules and frankly, probably just because of the COVID environment. All of that has gathered attention of politicians and regulators. The competition side, we're happy to compete. I'm somewhat shocked actually nobody's asked me a question about low cash flow that we rolled out this -- yesterday, day before. 
That product is a result of years of technology investment that allows us, I think, is the only institution in the world to have effectively real-time capability of what's going on in our customers' accounts. And therefore, showing them what's going on in their accounts and therefore, empowering them to choose what's going on in their accounts. No fintech has that. Go back to -- because they rely on these small banks as their back office, which, in turn, are relying on 30-year-old cobalt-based mainframe-based batch process, not very exciting core processors. Bring on the competition. 
At some point, they need to make money and to justify their existence. Our challenge is presenting, and we think we do this. A great proposition to our customers with ease of use and the very best products. And I think we have the technology backbone to do that. So I'm less worried about competing with somebody. I'm more worried about safety and soundness for the system and data and disruption to our customers who don't understand where data is being shared and who has access to it."

As you've seen, we accomplished a lot in the second quarter, and most important was the closing of the acquisition of BBVA USA on June 1. Obviously, this created a fair amount of noise in our reported results, adding 1 month of BBVA USA operating results and the impact of purchase accounting adjustments as well as merger-related impacts. Rob's going to take you through all of that in a couple of minutes. 
But putting those things aside, we had a pretty good quarter, driven by solid net interest income, strong fee growth, continued improvements in credit quality and announcement of higher capital returns. 
While loans increased primarily due to the acquisition, we did have spot loan growth in both consumer and C&I in the legacy PNC balance sheet. We've seen loan utilization rates stabilize within our Corporate & Institutional Banking business, however, they remain near historic lows. And while new loan approvals have rebounded, actually the highest level in a couple of years, that's been offset by continued pay downs. 
Within the legacy -- within the PNC legacy consumer book, we saw loans grow in the quarter, which was encouraging. And we're confident that strong economic growth is ultimately going to drive strong loan growth, but it remains an open debate as to the timing of that loan growth relative to the second half of '21 and into '22. 
During the quarter, we continued to deploy excess liquidity through $10 billion of net security purchases. Going forward and considering the significant recent rally in treasuries, we'll be disciplined as we look to reduce our elevated cash position. 
You saw that our recent CCAR results underscore the strength of our balance sheet and our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders. Following the results, we announced a 9% increase in our quarterly common stock dividend and a $2.9 billion share repurchase program. Importantly, we're well positioned with substantial capital and liquidity to continue to support our customers and invest in our businesses. 
Regarding BBVA, I couldn't be more pleased with where we are. PNC and BBVA employees have hit the ground running and are making great progress in preparing for a successful conversion and integration. The deal significantly expands our footprint, gives us access to 29 of the top 30 MSAs across the country with a coast-to-coast franchise and it provides us with an opportunity for growth for years to come. All of our original deal metrics are the same or better than we estimated, and Rob is going to take you through those. 
And finally, the underlying growth opportunities in the new markets are outstanding. Across this footprint, employees are making joint calls and we are seeing deal pipelines build, especially as we present our enhanced capabilities and scale of the new markets. we continue to believe the revenue synergy opportunity is significant as we look to drive BBVA USA's noninterest income contribution to total revenue closer to legacy PNC's mid-40% level. 
On the integration front, we're leveraging our past investments in technology and automation to expedite the process, drive synergies and reduce complexity. We're moving the data from more than 600 BBVA USA applications to PNC applications, taking a lift-and-shift approach that allows us to simplify the customer conversion. 
I also want to mention that our continued rollout of Low Cash Mode, which was available to 2.5 million virtual wallet customers as of the end of June. We're planning to roll it out to the remaining 1.1 million virtual wallet customers by the end of this month and look forward to making it available to BBVA customers upon conversion later this year. Since announcing the product in April, we've delivered over 10 million Low Cash Mode alerts and has seen strong engagement with the experiences that helps to address a major frustration for many of our customers across the industry. Over time, we expect it to drive significant growth in new and existing customer relationships as we execute our national expansion strategy. 
Finally, I'd like to close by thanking our legacy PNC and the new BBVA USA employees for all of their hard work that allowed us to close this deal early and prepare for conversion and long-term success. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our results, and then we'll take your questions."

As Bill just mentioned and notable during the second quarter, we successfully completed our acquisition of BBVA USA, significantly expanding our footprint, which now includes growth markets throughout the Sunbelt region. 
Our balance sheet is on Slide 4 and is presented on a spot basis. While we typically cover our average balance sheet, we'll focus this quarter on spot balances due to the timing of the June 1 closing of the acquisition. 
Overall, linked quarter balance sheet growth was driven by the acquisition, of course, which contributed $60 billion in loans, $18 billion of investment securities and $82 billion of deposits at quarter end. Excluding those additions during the quarter, legacy PNC loan balances declined $3 billion, investment securities increased $10 billion and deposits declined by $4 billion. And I'll cover the drivers in more detail over the next few slides. 
We ended the quarter with a tangible book value of $93.83 per share and an estimated CET1 ratio of 10%, substantially above the levels we anticipated at the time of the deal announcement. As a result, we're well positioned with significant capital flexibility. And as Bill just mentioned, we recently announced a $0.10 increase to our quarterly cash dividend on common stock, raising the dividend to $1.25 per share. Additionally, we reinstated our share repurchase programs of up to $2.9 billion for the fourth quarter period, beginning in the third quarter of 2021. 
Slide 5 shows our period-end loans and deposits, accounting for the acquisition and highlighting the relative contributions. Total loans were $295 billion at quarter end. And with the acquisition, our loan mix remains consistent at approximately 2/3 commercial and 1/3 consumer. 
Total deposits were $453 billion at June 30, and  our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits is now 5 basis points, a 1 basis point decline linked quarter. 
Taking a closer look at loans. Commercial loan balances of $200 billion increased $35 billion. BBVA contributed $39 billion. And spot PNC legacy growth of approximately $1 billion was offset by a $4.5 billion decline in PPP loans. 
Consumer loans were up $23 billion, represented by $22 billion of acquired loans as well as growth in legacy PNC consumer loans, primarily in the residential real estate portfolio. 
The yield on loan balances was stable at 3.38% compared to the first quarter and reflected the combined loan portfolio. 
Slide 6 details the change in our spot securities and Federal Reserve balances over the past year. Securities balances were $127 billion at the end of the second quarter, a $28 billion increase linked quarter due to the addition of $18 billion of securities from the acquisition and $10 billion in net purchases. 
Our Fed cash balances decreased $14 billion linked quarter, reflecting continued deployment into securities and the payment of $11.5 billion for the acquisition. Despite the linked quarter decline, our liquidity position remains in excess of our LCR requirements. 
As you can see on Slide 7, our second quarter income statement includes the impact of the acquisition. Our reported EPS was $2.43, which included an initial provision for BBVA USA of $1 billion and integration costs of $111 million. Adjusted for these items, EPS was $4.50 in the second quarter. 
Second quarter revenue was $4.7 billion, up $447 million compared with the first quarter, reflecting the acquisition as well as strong organic fee growth. 
Expenses increased $476 million or 18% linked quarter, including $181 million of significant items related to integration expenses and litigation reserves as well as 1 month of BBVA operating expenses and higher legacy PNC business activity. The provision of $302 million included a provision recapture of $704 million related to improved credit quality and macroeconomic factors as well as balance reductions, which was more than offset by $1 billion initial provision in connection with the acquisition. As a result, total net income was $1.1 billion in the second quarter. 
Now let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Turning to Slide 8, these charts illustrate our diversified business mix, with noninterest income representing 45% of total revenue in the second quarter. Net interest income of $2.6 billion was up $233 million or 10%, and net interest margin of 2.29% was up 2 basis points, both of which reflect the impact of the acquisition. 
Second quarter fee income of $1.6 billion increased $229 million or 16% linked quarter. Within that, legacy PNC fees grew by $167 million and BBVA USA's 1 month of operations contributed $62 million. 
Taking a more detailed look at the performance in each of our fee categories, asset management revenue increased $13 million or 6% as a result of higher average equity markets. 
Consumer services fees grew $73 million or 19%, primarily due to increased transaction volume and higher merchant services revenue. 
Corporate services increased $133 million or 24%, driven by higher M&A advisory activity and treasury management product revenue. 
Service charges on deposits grew $12 million or 10% due to the addition of BBVA USA. 
Other noninterest income of $468 million declined $15 million linked quarter and included a negative Visa derivative adjustment, lower securities gains as well as higher private equity revenue. 
In total, noninterest income of $2.1 billion increased $214 million or 11% compared to the first quarter, driven primarily by legacy PNC fee growth as well as $80 million of noninterest income from the acquisition. 
Turning to Slide 9. Our second quarter expenses were up by $476 million or 18% linked quarter and included $181 million of significant items related to integration expenses and the addition to legal reserves. The remainder of the increase was driven by BBVA's 1-month operating expenses of $179 million as well as increased business activity and marketing for legacy PNC. 
Obviously, with the acquisition,  our operating expenses are going to be higher going forward. Nevertheless, we remain disciplined around our expense management. And as we've previously stated, we have a goal to reduce PNC stand-alone expenses by $300 million in 2021 through our continuous improvement program, and we're on track to achieve our full year target. Additionally, we're confident we'll realize the full $900 million in net expense savings of BBVA USA's expense base in 2022. 
Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 10 and reflect the impact of the acquisition. Apart from the addition of the acquired loans, credit performance improved considerably within the legacy PNC portfolio. Nonperforming loans were $2.8 billion at June 30 and $871 million were related to the acquired loans. PNC's legacy nonperforming loans declined $230 million due to decreases in both commercial and consumer. Total delinquencies were $1.3 billion at June 30, of which the acquisition impact was $291 million. Legacy PNC's delinquecies declined $147 million. 
Net charge-offs for legacy PNC were $58 million, the lowest level since 2007, with an annualized charge-off to total loans ratio of 10 basis points. Acquired loan net charge-offs were $248 million, which was largely the result of required purchase accounting treatment for the acquisition. 
Slide 11 shows the change in our allowance for credit losses during the second quarter. Within our legacy portfolio, we released reserves by approximately $700 million related to both improved credit quality and macroeconomic factors. Upon closing the acquisition, we established a $2.2 billion ACL for the acquired loans or 3.5% through fair value loan marks of $1.2 billion related to purchase credit deteriorated loans and an initial provision of $1 billion related to non-PCD loans. 
The initial BBVA USA ACL to total loans of 3.5% was subsequently reduced to 3.1% at the end of the quarter as a result of portfolio changes. 
So in total, as a result, our total quarter year-end reserves for the combined entity were $6.4 billion, representing 2.16% of consolidated loans outstanding. 
Turning to Slide 12. Now that we've closed the BBVA USA acquisition, I wanted to provide an update to some of the deal metrics, all of which are the same or have improved since our deal announcement. 
As you know, the purchase price was an all-cash fixed price and was approximately $11.5 billion at closing. And as I've already mentioned, tangible book value per share and the CET1 ratio are favorable relative to our original expectations. 
We continue to project an internal rate of return in excess of 19%, earnings per share accretion of more than 20% and an annualized expense reduction of $900 million in 2022. 
Additionally, our expectation for nonrecurring merger and integration costs is approximately $980 million, the majority of which we expect to be recognized in 2021, consistent with our initial expectations. 
Taking a look at the credit metrics. These have all improved since we've announced the deal. And as a result, the ACL to total loans for BBVA USA is better than our original expectations. 
In addition and as anticipated, our net purchase accounting adjustment is nominal, with a net fair value premium of $322 million, the majority of which will be amortized over the next several years. 
For the second quarter, due to the maturity of some short-dated acquired assets, we realized a $30 million benefit to net interest income which will not recur. 
In summary, PNC reported a strong second quarter, highlighted by the successful acquisition of BBVA USA. We expect this transaction to add significant value to our shareholders as we begin to realize the potential of the combined franchise. In regard to our view of the overall economy, our current expectations are for GDP to surpass prerecession levels some time during the third quarter and for the Fed funds rate to remain near 0 throughout 2021. 
Looking at the third quarter of 2021, which will now include a full quarter impact of BBVA USA's operations, compared to the second quarter of 2021, we expect total spot loan balances to be up modestly which includes a $3.5 billion decline in PPP loans. 
On a percentage basis, we expect NII to be up in the mid-teens. 
We expect fee income to be up in the mid-single digits. 
We expect total noninterest expense, excluding integration expenses to be up in the high single digits. 
We expect other noninterest income to be between $325 million and $375 million, excluding net securities gains and Visa activities. 
And we expect third quarter net charge-offs to be between $150 million and $200 million. 
For annual guidance, taking into account our first half operating results and the addition of 6 more months of BBVA USA forecasted operating results, plus our expectation for modest loan growth in the second half of the year, we expect revenues to be up between 12% to 14% and expenses, excluding integration costs, to be up between 13% and 15% for the full year 2021 compared with PNC stand-alone 2020. 
We acknowledge some upside exists in spot loan growth during the second half of the year, but that remains to be seen and, as a result, is not included in our guidance. 
And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions."

As you look ahead, how integral is the acquisition of additional branches to you're furthering your national expansion on paper? It's easy to do a traditional analysis where you look at PNC's revenues per branch and BBVA's revenues per branch to isolate the opportunity to improve productivity and what that would mean in terms of incremental revenues per branch. But when you try to sell the idea of acquiring additional branches to generalists, there's a natural pushback on why those branch acquisitions are necessary in the first place given what we're seeing with the digitization of the business. RBC is a great example where we saw your branch count rise sharply in 2012 before falling significantly for the better part of the next decade.

Where we are seeing continued growth, that we started to see as green shoots in the first quarter, is in our business credit to asset-based book. Real growth there that is encouraging because that tends to be a leading indicator of loan demand. So that's largely where we've seen the growth. 
But on the margin, we would expect to see, in terms of getting to where strong loan growth would be coming, more utilization across the general middle market book, which is yet to show up."

So that may or may not mean additional geographies, it may or may not mean filling in an existing geography, it will very likely mean we'll continue to do small add-on acquisitions that give us product capability for clients. 
The executive order, on looking at competition amongst banks, I mean it's a practical matter that would actually have to change for the bank approval process to change, would be more about the Fed's rules on approving mergers than I think it would be coming out of President Biden's order. I'm not expert on it. But I think it is safe to say that a larger deal in today's environment would get much more political scrutiny and noise than we did with the BBVA deal. That weighs on us."

As you've seen, we accomplished a lot in the second quarter, and most important was the closing of the acquisition of BBVA USA on June 1. Obviously, this created a fair amount of noise in our reported results, a",728,"Thanks, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. As you've seen, we accomplished a lot in the second quarter, and most important was the closing of the acquisition of BBVA USA on June 1. Obviously, this created a fair amount of noise in our reported results, adding 1 month of BBVA USA operating results and the impact of purchase accounting adjustments as well as merger-related impacts. Rob's going to take you through all of that in a couple of minutes. 
But putting those things aside, we had a pretty good quarter, driven by solid net interest income, strong fee growth, continued improvements in credit quality and announcement of higher capital returns. 
While loans increased primarily due to the acquisition, we did have spot loan growth in both consumer and C&I in the legacy PNC balance sheet. We've seen loan utilization rates stabilize within our Corporate & Institutional Banking business, however, they remain near historic lows. And while new loan approvals have rebounded, actually the highest level in a couple of years, that's been offset by continued pay downs. 
Within the legacy -- within the PNC legacy consumer book, we saw loans grow in the quarter, which was encouraging. And we're confident that strong economic growth is ultimately going to drive strong loan growth, but it remains an open debate as to the timing of that loan growth relative to the second half of '21 and into '22. 
During the quarter, we continued to deploy excess liquidity through $10 billion of net security purchases. Going forward and considering the significant recent rally in treasuries, we'll be disciplined as we look to reduce our elevated cash position. 
You saw that our recent CCAR results underscore the strength of our balance sheet and our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders. Following the results, we announced a 9% increase in our quarterly common stock dividend and a $2.9 billion share repurchase program. Importantly, we're well positioned with substantial capital and liquidity to continue to support our customers and invest in our businesses. 
Regarding BBVA, I couldn't be more pleased with where we are. PNC and BBVA employees have hit the ground running and are making great progress in preparing for a successful conversion and integration. The deal significantly expands our footprint, gives us access to 29 of the top 30 MSAs across the country with a coast-to-coast franchise and it provides us with an opportunity for growth for years to come. All of our original deal metrics are the same or better than we estimated, and Rob is going to take you through those. 
And finally, the underlying growth opportunities in the new markets are outstanding. Across this footprint, employees are making joint calls and we are seeing deal pipelines build, especially as we present our enhanced capabilities and scale of the new markets. We continue to believe the revenue synergy opportunity is significant as we look to drive BBVA USA's noninterest income contribution to total revenue closer to legacy PNC's mid-40% level. 
On the integration front, we're leveraging our past investments in technology and automation to expedite the process, drive synergies and reduce complexity. We're moving the data from more than 600 BBVA USA applications to PNC applications, taking a lift-and-shift approach that allows us to simplify the customer conversion. 
I also want to mention that our continued rollout of Low Cash Mode, which was available to 2.5 million virtual wallet customers as of the end of June. We're planning to roll it out to the remaining 1.1 million virtual wallet customers by the end of this month and look forward to making it available to BBVA customers upon conversion later this year. Since announcing the product in April, we've delivered over 10 million Low Cash Mode alerts and has seen strong engagement with the experiences that helps to address a major frustration for many of our customers across the industry. Over time, we expect it to drive significant growth in new and existing customer relationships as we execute our national expansion strategy. 
Finally, I'd like to close by thanking our legacy PNC and the new BBVA USA employees for all of their hard work that allowed us to close this deal early and prepare for conversion and long-term success. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our results, and then we'll take your questions."
294585,671018731,2344982,"The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 14, 2021",2021-07-14,"Earnings Calls","The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill just mentioned and notable during the second quarter, we successfully completed our acquisition of BBVA USA, significantly expanding our footprint, which now includes growth markets throughout the Sun Belt",1830,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill just mentioned and notable during the second quarter, we successfully completed our acquisition of BBVA USA, significantly expanding our footprint, which now includes growth markets throughout the Sun Belt region. 
Our balance sheet is on Slide 4 and is presented on a spot basis. While we typically cover our average balance sheet, we'll focus this quarter on spot balances due to the timing of the June 1 closing of the acquisition. 
Overall, linked quarter balance sheet growth was driven by the acquisition, of course, which contributed $60 billion in loans, $18 billion of investment securities and $82 billion of deposits at quarter end. Excluding those additions during the quarter, legacy PNC loan balances declined $3 billion, investment securities increased $10 billion and deposits declined by $4 billion. And I'll cover the drivers in more detail over the next few slides. 
We ended the quarter with a tangible book value of $93.83 per share and an estimated CET1 ratio of 10%, substantially above the levels we anticipated at the time of the deal announcement. As a result, we're well positioned with significant capital flexibility. And as Bill just mentioned, we recently announced a $0.10 increase to our quarterly cash dividend on common stock, raising the dividend to $1.25 per share. Additionally, we reinstated our share repurchase programs of up to $2.9 billion for the fourth quarter period, beginning in the third quarter of 2021. 
Slide 5 shows our period-end loans and deposits, accounting for the acquisition and highlighting the relative contributions. Total loans were $295 billion at quarter end. And with the acquisition, our loan mix remains consistent at approximately 2/3 commercial and 1/3 consumer. 
Total deposits were $453 billion at June 30, and  our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits is now 5 basis points, a 1 basis point decline linked quarter. 
Taking a closer look at loans. Commercial loan balances of $200 billion increased $35 billion. BBVA contributed $39 billion. And spot PNC legacy growth of approximately $1 billion was offset by a $4.5 billion decline in PPP loans. 
Consumer loans were up $23 billion, represented by $22 billion of acquired loans as well as growth in legacy PNC consumer loans, primarily in the residential real estate portfolio. 
The yield on loan balances was stable at 3.38% compared to the first quarter and reflected the combined loan portfolio. 
Slide 6 details the change in our spot securities and Federal Reserve balances over the past year. Securities balances were $127 billion at the end of the second quarter, a $28 billion increase linked quarter due to the addition of $18 billion of securities from the acquisition and $10 billion in net purchases. 
Our Fed cash balances decreased $14 billion linked quarter, reflecting continued deployment into securities and the payment of $11.5 billion for the acquisition. Despite the linked quarter decline, our liquidity position remains in excess of our LCR requirements. 
As you can see on Slide 7, our second quarter income statement includes the impact of the acquisition. Our reported EPS was $2.43, which included an initial provision for BBVA USA of $1 billion and integration costs of $111 million. Adjusted for these items, EPS was $4.50 in the second quarter. 
Second quarter revenue was $4.7 billion, up $447 million compared with the first quarter, reflecting the acquisition as well as strong organic fee growth. 
Expenses increased $476 million or 18% linked quarter, including $181 million of significant items related to integration expenses and litigation reserves as well as 1 month of BBVA operating expenses and higher legacy PNC business activity. The provision of $302 million included a provision recapture of $704 million related to improved credit quality and macroeconomic factors as well as balance reductions, which was more than offset by $1 billion initial provision in connection with the acquisition. As a result, total net income was $1.1 billion in the second quarter. 
Now let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Turning to Slide 8, these charts illustrate our diversified business mix, with noninterest income representing 45% of total revenue in the second quarter. Net interest income of $2.6 billion was up $233 million or 10%, and net interest margin of 2.29% was up 2 basis points, both of which reflect the impact of the acquisition. 
Second quarter fee income of $1.6 billion increased $229 million or 16% linked quarter. Within that, legacy PNC fees grew by $167 million and BBVA USA's 1 month of operations contributed $62 million. 
Taking a more detailed look at the performance in each of our fee categories, asset management revenue increased $13 million or 6% as a result of higher average equity markets. 
Consumer services fees grew $73 million or 19%, primarily due to increased transaction volume and higher merchant services revenue. 
Corporate services increased $133 million or 24%, driven by higher M&A advisory activity and treasury management product revenue. 
Service charges on deposits grew $12 million or 10% due to the addition of BBVA USA. 
Other noninterest income of $468 million declined $15 million linked quarter and included a negative Visa derivative adjustment, lower securities gains as well as higher private equity revenue. 
In total, noninterest income of $2.1 billion increased $214 million or 11% compared to the first quarter, driven primarily by legacy PNC fee growth as well as $80 million of noninterest income from the acquisition. 
Turning to Slide 9. Our second quarter expenses were up by $476 million or 18% linked quarter and included $181 million of significant items related to integration expenses and the addition to legal reserves. The remainder of the increase was driven by BBVA's 1-month operating expenses of $179 million as well as increased business activity and marketing for legacy PNC. 
Obviously, with the acquisition,  our operating expenses are going to be higher going forward. Nevertheless, we remain disciplined around our expense management. And as we've previously stated, we have a goal to reduce PNC stand-alone expenses by $300 million in 2021 through our continuous improvement program, and we're on track to achieve our full year target. Additionally, we're confident we'll realize the full $900 million in net expense savings of BBVA USA's expense base in 2022. 
Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 10 and reflect the impact of the acquisition. Apart from the addition of the acquired loans, credit performance improved considerably within the legacy PNC portfolio. Nonperforming loans were $2.8 billion at June 30 and $871 million were related to the acquired loans. PNC's legacy nonperforming loans declined $230 million due to decreases in both commercial and consumer. Total delinquencies were $1.3 billion at June 30, of which the acquisition impact was $291 million. Legacy PNC's delinquecies declined $147 million. 
Net charge-offs for legacy PNC were $58 million, the lowest level since 2007, with an annualized charge-off to total loans ratio of 10 basis points. Acquired loan net charge-offs were $248 million, which was largely the result of required purchase accounting treatment for the acquisition. 
Slide 11 shows the change in our allowance for credit losses during the second quarter. Within our legacy portfolio, we released reserves by approximately $700 million related to both improved credit quality and macroeconomic factors. Upon closing the acquisition, we established a $2.2 billion ACL for the acquired loans or 3.5% through fair value loan marks of $1.2 billion related to purchase credit deteriorated loans and an initial provision of $1 billion related to non-PCD loans. 
The initial BBVA USA ACL to total loans of 3.5% was subsequently reduced to 3.1% at the end of the quarter as a result of portfolio changes. 
So in total, as a result, our total quarter year-end reserves for the combined entity were $6.4 billion, representing 2.16% of consolidated loans outstanding. 
Turning to Slide 12. Now that we've closed the BBVA USA acquisition, I wanted to provide an update to some of the deal metrics, all of which are the same or have improved since our deal announcement. 
As you know, the purchase price was an all-cash fixed price and was approximately $11.5 billion at closing. And as I've already mentioned, tangible book value per share and the CET1 ratio are favorable relative to our original expectations. 
We continue to project an internal rate of return in excess of 19%, earnings per share accretion of more than 20% and an annualized expense reduction of $900 million in 2022. 
Additionally, our expectations for nonrecurring merger and integration costs is approximately $980 million, the majority of which we expect to be recognized in 2021, consistent with our initial expectations. 
Taking a look at the credit metrics. These have all improved since we've announced the deal. And as a result, the ACL to total loans for BBVA USA is better than our original expectations. 
In addition and as anticipated, our net purchase accounting adjustment is nominal, with a net fair value premium of $322 million, the majority of which will be amortized over the next several years. 
For the second quarter, due to the maturity of some short-dated acquired assets, we realized a $30 million benefit to net interest income which will not recur. 
In summary, PNC reported a strong second quarter, highlighted by the successful acquisition of BBVA USA. We expect this transaction to add significant value to our shareholders as we begin to realize the potential of the combined franchise. In regard to our view of the overall economy, our current expectations are for GDP to surpass prerecession levels some time during the third quarter and for the Fed funds rate to remain near 0 throughout 2021. 
Looking at the third quarter of 2021, which will now include a full quarter impact of BBVA USA's operations, compared to the second quarter of 2021, we expect total spot loan balances to be up modestly which includes a $3.5 billion decline in PPP loans. 
On a percentage basis, we expect NII to be up in the mid-teens. 
We expect fee income to be up in the mid-single digits. 
We expect total noninterest expense, excluding integration expenses to be up in the high single digits. 
We expect other noninterest income to be between $325 million and $375 million, excluding net securities gains and Visa activities. 
And we expect third quarter net charge-offs to be between $150 million and $200 million. 
For annual guidance, taking into account our first half operating results and the addition of 6 more months of BBVA USA forecasted operating results, plus our expectation for modest loan growth in the second half of the year, we expect revenues to be up between 12% to 14% and expenses, excluding integration costs, to be up between 13% and 15% for the full year 2021 compared with PNC stand-alone 2020. 
We acknowledge some upside exists in spot loan growth during the second half of the year, but that remains to be seen and, as a result, is not included in our guidance. 
And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions."

As you look ahead, how integral is the acquisition of additional branches to your furthering your national expansion on paper? It's easy to do a traditional analysis where you look at PNC's revenues per branch and BBVA's revenues per branch to isolate the opportunity to improve productivity and what that would mean in terms of incremental revenues per branch. 
But when you try to sell the idea of acquiring additional branches to generalists, there's a natural pushback on why those branch acquisitions are necessary in the first place given what we're seeing with the digitization of the business. RBC is a great example where we saw your branch count rise sharply in 2012 before falling significantly for the better part of the next decade. So how important was it to acquire those branches to begin with? I know there's a lot there, but I was hoping you could speak to that point in general."

PNC stand-alone, we said at the beginning of the year, it was going to be stable. We were going to fight for positive operating leverage halfway through.

The executive order, on looking at competition amongst banks, I mean it's a practical matter that would actually have to change for the bank approval process to change, would be more about the Fed's rules on approving mergers than I think it would be coming out of President Biden's order. I'm not expert on it. But I think it is safe to say that a larger deal in today's environment would get much more political scrutiny and noise than we did with the BBVA deal. That weighs on us."

Good morning, everybody. I imagine you have seen that earlier this week, we completed our conversion of BBVA USA. And I got to say I'm really proud of the team and our ability to sign, close and convert $100 billion banking institution with",627,"Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everybody. I imagine you have seen that earlier this week, we completed our conversion of BBVA USA. And I got to say I'm really proud of the team and our ability to sign, close and convert $100 billion banking institution within a year. The dedication of our employees and our sustained investments in technology allowed us to convert roughly 9,000 employees, 2.6 million customers in nearly 600 branches across 7 states. 
BBVA U.S.A. is now integrated into PNC and its customers can bank with us from coast to coast. We're bringing our technology, talent and the full suite of best-in-class products and services to 29 of the nation's 30 largest markets with attractive growth opportunities, as you've heard me talk about, for years to come. 
Now while we still have some more work to do, which is to be expected for a bank conversion of this size, we're making solid progress with our staffing levels and the branch operations and BBVA USA legacy markets. In addition, we're encouraged to see the team's build pipelines and importantly, growing new clients. 
Now with BBVA legacy employees now on PNC systems, we believe our momentum is going to continue to accelerate as we previously, we're following the same game plan that we've used in previous acquisitions. And we know what to do. We just have to execute on it. 
With respect to our third quarter results, we had a solid quarter highlighted by strong revenue growth, which included record fee income in our PNC legacy businesses and continued improvements in credit quality. Similar to last quarter and pretty much as expected, we had a lot of moving parts in our reported results. And of course, Rob will take you through those in a few minutes. 
Loan growth continues to be impacted by supply chain issues and the continued runoff of PPP loans and also the strategic repositioning of the BBVA portfolios, which is consistent with our acquisition projections. That said, total PNC legacy loans, if we back out the PPP runoff, actually grew almost $5 billion, with growth in both commercial and consumer categories. And while the environment is still challenging, we're actually pretty encouraged by what we're seeing on the corporate side with spot utilization rates stabilizing and even rising a little on the back of strong new originations in our secured lending and corporate banking businesses. And on the consumer side, we're also seeing promising origination activity, particularly in the residential real estate business. 
Importantly, and as you see, our balance sheet remains very strong, and we're well positioned with substantial capital and liquidity to continue to support our expanded customer base while making strategic investments in our technology and businesses. 
Another exciting development this quarter was the announcement of our integration with Aclea Data Access Network. This is through an application programming interface. The integration is going to allow millions of our customers, if they choose to do so, to safely share their financial information with fintechs and data aggregators. It's an important step in our efforts to help our customers protect their data while also giving them the choice to share their data with third-party applications. 
Similar to Low Cash Mode, this integration positions us as a leader in technology and innovation and enables us to best serve our customers. 
And I'd like to close just by thanking our employees throughout the newly combined franchise for all their hard work, which enabled this conversion. Our significant collaboration across all divisions is impressive, and it gives me great confidence that we'll capitalize on the enormous opportunities ahead of us. 
And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our results, and then we'll take your questions."
294585,671018904,2406690,"The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 15, 2021",2021-10-15,"Earnings Calls","The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill just mentioned and notable during the third quarter, we converted the BBVA USA franchise to the PNC platform in less than 11 months following the announcement of the deal.

As Bill just mentioned and notable during the third quarter, we converted the BBVA USA franchise to the PNC platform in less than 11 months following the announcement of the deal. PNC's increased scale from this acquisition underscores the opportunity we have with the BBVA USA franchise. We have a proven track record of acquiring attractive strategic opportunities, identifying and reducing inherent risks and successfully growing franchises to deliver enhanced shareholder value. And as Bill just mentioned, we're well on our way to accomplishing this with BBVA USA. 
Due to the June 1 closing of the acquisition, our average balance sheet growth for the third quarter reflected the full quarter impact of the acquisition. As loans grew $36 billion, securities increased $12 billion and deposits grew $53 billion. 
For comparative purposes to the second quarter, which you'll recall included just 1 month of BBVA USA results, our balance sheet on Slide 3 is presented on a spot basis. Total spot loans declined $4.5 billion or 2% linked quarter. Excluding the impact of PPP forgiveness, loans grew, and I'll cover the drivers in more detail over the next few slides. 
Investment securities declined approximately $900 million or 1% as we slowed purchase activity throughout much of the quarter during the relatively unattractive rate environment. Our cash balances at the Federal Reserve continued to grow and ended the third quarter at $75 billion. 
On the liability side, deposit balances were $449 billion at September 30 and declined $4 billion, reflecting the repositioning of certain BBVA USA portfolios. We ended the quarter with a tangible book value of $94.82 per share and an estimated CET1 ratio of 10.2%, both substantially above the pro forma levels we anticipated at the time of the deal announcement. 
During the quarter, we returned capital to shareholders with common dividends of $537 million and share repurchases of $393 million. Given our strong capital ratios, we continue to be well positioned with significant capital flexibility going forward. 
Slide 4 shows our loans in more detail. Average loans increased $36 billion linked quarter to $291 billion, reflecting the full quarter impact of the acquisition. Taking a closer look at the linked quarter change in our spot balances, total loans declined $4.5 billion. The PNC legacy portfolio, excluding PPP loans, grew by $4.7 billion or 2%, with growth in both commercial and consumer loans.  
PNC legacy commercial loans grew $3.7 billion, driven by growth within corporate banking and asset-based lending. This growth in balances has been aided by a slight uptick in spot utilization. And while still near historic lows, utilization did reach its highest level since December 2020. Growth in PNC's legacy consumer loans linked quarter was driven by higher residential real estate balances. 
Within the BBVA USA portfolio, loans declined $4.4 billion, primarily due to intentional runoff relating to the overlapping exposures in nonstrategic loans. Looking ahead, we have approximately $5 billion of additional BBVA USA loans that we intend to let roll off over the next few years, which is in line with our acquisition assumptions. 
Finally, PPP loans declined $4.8 billion due to forgiveness activity. And as of September 30, $6.8 billion of PPP loans remain on our balance sheet. 
Moving to Slide 5. Average deposits of $454 billion increased $53 billion compared to the second quarter, driven by the acquisition. On the right, you can see total period end deposits were $449 billion at September 30, a decline of $4 billion or 1% linked quarter. Inside of this, PNC legacy deposits increased $5.4 billion as deposits continue to grow, reflecting the strong liquidity position of our customers. 
BBVA USA deposits declined approximately $9.4 billion during the third quarter, which was anticipated as we rationalized the rate paid on certain acquired commercial deposit portfolios and exited several noncore deposit-related businesses. Overall, our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits is now 4 basis points, a 1 basis point decline linked quarter. 
Slide 6 details the change in our period end securities and Federal Reserve balances. And as most of you know, we have been disciplined in deploying our excess liquidity with rates at historically low levels. Back at the beginning of the year as the yield curve steepened, we accelerated our rate of purchasing activity. However, towards the end of the second quarter, we deliberately slowed our purchases as yields declined. With the increase in rates at the end of the third quarter, we resumed our increased levels of purchasing, including $5.4 billion of forward-settling securities, which will be reflected in the fourth quarter. 
Average security balances now represent approximately 24% of interest-earning assets and we still expect to be in the range of approximately 25% to 30% by year-end. 
As you can see on Slide 7, our third quarter income statement includes the full quarter impact of the acquisition. Reported EPS was $3.30, which included pretax integration costs of $243 million. Excluding integration costs, adjusted EPS was $3.75. Third quarter revenue was up 11% compared with the second quarter, reflecting the acquisition as well as strong organic fee growth. 
Expenses increased $537 million or 18% linked quarter, including $235 million of integration expenses and 2 additional months of BBVA USA operating expenses. Legacy PNC expenses increased $76 million or 2.7%, virtually all of which was driven by higher fee business activity. 
Pretax pre-provision earnings, excluding integration costs, were $1.9 billion, an increase of $25 million or 7%. The provision recapture of $203 million was primarily driven by improved credit quality and changes in portfolio composition. And our effective tax rate was 17.8%. For the full year, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 17%. As a result, total net income was $1.5 billion in the third quarter. 
Now let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Turning to Slide 8. These charts illustrate our diversified business mix. In total, revenue of $5.2 billion increased $530 million linked quarter. Net interest income of $2.9 billion was up $275 million or 11%, reflecting the full quarter benefit of the earning asset balances acquired from BBVA USA. Inside of that, interest income on loans increased $277 million or 13%, while investment securities income declined $9 million, driven by elevated premium amortization on the acquired BBVA USA portfolio. 
Net interest margin of 2.27% was down 2 basis points, driven primarily by lower security yields. Importantly, in the fourth quarter, we expect premium amortization to decline meaningfully and the yield on securities -- the yield on the securities portfolio to increase. 
Third quarter fee income of $1.9 billion increased $274 million or 17% linked quarter. BBVA USA contributed fee income of $184 million, an increase of $122 million linked quarter, driven by 2 additional months of operating results. Legacy PNC fees grew by $152 million linked quarter or 10%, driven by higher corporate service fees related to record M&A advisory activity as well as growth in residential mortgage revenue. 
Other noninterest income of $449 million decreased $19 million linked quarter as higher private equity revenue was more than offset by the impact of $169 million negative Visa derivative adjustments. This adjustment relates to the extension of the expected timing of litigation resolution. 
Turning to Slide 9. Our third quarter expenses were up by $537 million or 18% linked quarter. The increase was primarily driven by the impact of higher BBVA USA's expenses of $327 million and higher integration expenses of $134 million. PNC legacy expenses increased $76 million or 2.7% due to higher incentive compensation commensurate with a strong performance in our fee businesses, including a record quarter in M&A advisory fees. Our efficiency ratio adjusted for integration costs was 64%. 
Obviously, with the acquisition, our expense base is now higher, but nevertheless, we remain disciplined around our expense management. And as we've stated previously, we have a goal to reduce PNC stand-alone expenses by $300 million in 2021 through our continuous improvement program, and we're on track to achieve our full year target. 
Additionally, we're confident we'll realize the full $900 million in net expense savings off of our forecast of BBVA USA's 2022 expense base, and expect virtually all of the actions that drive the $900 million of savings to be completed by the end of 2021. 
We still expect to incur integration costs of approximately $980 million related to the acquisition. Since the announcement of the acquisition, we've incurred approximately half of these integration costs. And as Bill mentioned, we appreciate all the hard work our teammates have done to keep us on track and to achieve these goals. 
Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 10 and reflect strong credit performance. Nonperforming loans of $2.5 billion decreased $251 million or 9% compared to June 30 and continue to represent less than 1% of total loans. Total delinquencies of $1.4 billion at September 30 increased $106 million or 8%. However, this increase includes approximately $75 million of operational delays in early-stage delinquencies, primarily related to BBVA USA acquired loans. Subsequent to quarter end, all of these operational delinquencies have been or are in the process of being resolved. Excluding these, total delinquencies would have increased $31 million or 2%. 
The net charge-offs for loans and leases were $81 million, a decline of $225 million linked quarter. The second quarter included $248 million of charge-offs related to BBVA USA loans, mostly the result of required purchase accounting and treatment for the acquisition. 
Our annualized net charge-off loans in the third quarter was 11 basis points. And during the third quarter, our allowance for credit losses declined $374 million, primarily driven by improvement in credit quality as well as changes in portfolio composition. At quarter end, our reserves were $6 billion, representing 2.07% of loans. 
In summary, PNC reported a strong third quarter. And notably earlier this week, converted the BBVA USA franchise. With this step completed, we expect to add significant value to our shareholders as we continue to realize the potential of the combined company. 
In regard to our view of the overall economy, after somewhat slower growth during the third quarter of 2021 due in part to the delta variant and supply chain problems, we expect GDP to accelerate to above 6% annualized in the fourth quarter. We also expect the Fed funds rate to remain near 0 for the remainder of the year. 
Looking at the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the recent third quarter results, we expect average loan balances, excluding PPP, to be up modestly. We expect NII to be up modestly. On a percentage basis, we expect fee income to be down between 3% and 5%, mostly reflecting the elevated third quarter M&A activity. We expect other noninterest income to be between $375 million and $425 million, excluding net securities and Visa activity. On a percent [indiscernible] we expect total noninterest expense to be down between 3% and 5%, excluding integration expense, which we approximate to be $450 million during the fourth quarter. And we expect fourth quarter net charge-offs to be between $100 million and $150 million. 
And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions."

So there'll be expenses that are obviously associated with that. In terms of the $900 million in savings, we are achieving savings. Presently, we got some in the third quarter, we'll get some more in the fourth quarter. That's part of the guide, but the bulk of the savings will be in 2022.

So if you were short liquidity at that point, you'd raise wholesale liquidity to kind of keep your ratio at that point. Today, we're so flush with reserves into the system. Wholesale funding is next to 0. And until the Fed -- forget about tapering actually shrinks its balance sheet, that's not going to change. Now loan growth even accelerated and exaggerated loan growth will absorb some of that. But I think you're going to see loan-to-deposit ratios low for a long period of time. And therefore, I think you're going to see security balances as a percentage of a balance sheet. We've already talked about this, increase across the industry. And I -- that's going to -- I think it's going to take years to play out."

We know the line items. It's very precise. The technology, look, it worked. We had, at the margin, some confusion with retail clients on password resets and some other things. But the basic technology, moving it over, turned on, it all worked, which is just a phenomenal effort by our team and validates the investment we've made over the years. 
I don't know what people have or don't have in terms of their ability to do that. But the biggest element for us, Mike, and I think we've talked to you about this, was in effect, this data lake idea where since our applications don't hold their own data, they call from a central lake. And they're linked through API and they're cloud-native. It just makes it very easy to move data and new -- onboard a new client. It's not much different than as if we just got a couple of million new clients overnight. 
That -- I make it sound very easy and all my technologists are ripping their hair but that's what we did and it worked. And the investment in that was everything from the data lake to cloud-native to API and everything. And frankly, to having businesses and technology [indiscernible] so technology if PNC is not in the back office somewhere doing its job. They're actually side-by-side and agile teams working with their business partners to develop product and importantly, to execute the conversion, which we did.

The financial disruption of crypto broadly and probably inside of that stable coin is a real threat. And it depends on how that plays out through time. There's the risk, I think, that people are aware of with certain of the stable coins, having, let's call it, suspicious collateral behind them. But there is also the risk through time that a substantial portion of savings, either domestic savings or even emerging market savings, get absorbed into a stable coin and under the traditional money transmission system.

Part of our lead was in what we charge customers, but a big part of our lead was on technology and simply empowering customers.

And I got to say I'm really proud of the team and our ability to sign, close and convert a $100 billion banking institution wi",628,"Thanks, Bryan. Good morning, everybody. I imagine you have seen that earlier this week, we completed our conversion of BBVA USA. And I got to say I'm really proud of the team and our ability to sign, close and convert a $100 billion banking institution within a year. The dedication of our employees and our sustained investments in technology allowed us to convert roughly 9,000 employees, 2.6 million customers in nearly 600 branches across 7 states.  
BBVA USA is now integrated into PNC and its customers can bank with us from coast to coast. We're bringing our technology, talent and the full suite of best-in-class products and services to 29 of the nation's 30 largest markets with attractive growth opportunities, as you'll hear me talk about, for years to come.  
Now while we still have some more work to do, which is to be expected for a bank conversion of this size, we're making solid progress with our staffing levels and the branch operations and BBVA USA legacy markets. In addition, we're encouraged to see the teams build pipelines and importantly, growing new clients.  
Now with BBVA legacy employees now on PNC systems, we believe our momentum is going to continue to accelerate as we previously, we're following the same game plan that we've used in previous acquisitions. And we know what to do. We just have to execute on it.  
With respect to our third quarter results, we had a solid quarter highlighted by strong revenue growth, which included record fee income in our PNC legacy businesses and continued improvements in credit quality. Similar to last quarter and pretty much as expected, we had a lot of moving parts in our reported results. And of course, Rob will take you through those in a few minutes.  
Loan growth continues to be impacted by supply chain issues and the continued runoff of PPP loans. And also the strategic repositioning of the BBVA portfolios, which is consistent with our acquisition projections. That said, total PNC legacy loans, if we back out the PPP runoff, actually grew almost $5 billion, with growth in both commercial and consumer categories. And while the environment is still challenging, we're actually pretty encouraged by what we're seeing on the corporate side with spot utilization rates stabilizing and even rising a little on the back of strong new originations in our secured lending and corporate banking businesses. And on the consumer side, we're also seeing promising origination activity, particularly in the residential real estate business.  
Importantly, and as you see, our balance sheet remains very strong, and we're well positioned with substantial capital and liquidity to continue to support our expanded customer base while making strategic investments in our technology and businesses.  
Another exciting development this quarter was the announcement of our integration with Akoya Data Access Network. This is through an application programming interface. The integration is going to allow millions of our customers, if they choose to do so, to safely share their financial information with fintechs and data aggregators. It's an important step in our efforts to help our customers protect their data while also giving them the choice to share their data with third-party applications. Similar to Low Cash Mode, this integration positions us as a leader in technology and innovation and enables us to best serve our customers. 
And I'd like to close just by thanking our employees throughout the newly combined franchise for all their hard work, which enabled this conversion. Our significant collaboration across all divisions is impressive, and it gives me great confidence that we'll capitalize on the enormous opportunities ahead of us.  
And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our results, and then we'll take your questions."
294585,671018904,2406707,"The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 15, 2021",2021-10-15,"Earnings Calls","The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill just mentioned and notable during the third quarter, we converted the BBVA USA franchise to the PNC platform in less than 11 months following the announcement of he deal. PNC's increased scale from this",1857,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. 
As Bill just mentioned and notable during the third quarter, we converted the BBVA USA franchise to the PNC platform in less than 11 months following the announcement of he deal. PNC's increased scale from this acquisition underscores the opportunity we have with the BBVA USA franchise. We have a proven track record of acquiring attractive strategic opportunities, identifying and reducing inherent risks and successfully growing franchises to deliver enhanced shareholder value. And as Bill just mentioned, we're well on our way to accomplishing this with BBVA USA.  
Due to the June 1 closing of the acquisition, our average balance sheet growth for the third quarter reflected the full quarter impact of the acquisition. As loans grew $36 billion, securities increased $12 billion and deposits grew $53 billion.  
For comparative purposes to the second quarter, which you'll recall included just 1 month of BBVA USA results, our balance sheet on Slide 3 is presented on a spot basis. Total spot loans declined $4.5 billion or 2% linked quarter. Excluding the impact of PPP forgiveness, loans grew, and I'll cover the drivers in more detail over the next few slides.  
Investment securities declined approximately $900 million or 1% as we slowed purchase activity throughout much of the quarter during the relatively unattractive rate environment. Our cash balances at the Federal Reserve continued to grow and ended the third quarter at $75 billion.  
On the liability side, deposit balances were $449 billion at September 30 and declined $4 billion, reflecting the repositioning of certain BBVA USA portfolios. We ended the quarter with a tangible book value of $94.82 per share and an estimated CET1 ratio of 10.2%, both substantially above the pro forma levels we anticipated at the time of the deal announcement.  
During the quarter, we returned capital to shareholders with common dividends of $537 million and share repurchases of $393 million. Given our strong capital ratios, we continue to be well positioned with significant capital flexibility going forward.  
Slide 4 shows our loans in more detail. Average loans increased $36 billion linked quarter to $291 billion, reflecting the full quarter impact of the acquisition. Taking a closer look at the linked quarter change in our spot balances, total loans declined $4.5 billion. The PNC legacy portfolio, excluding PPP loans, grew by $4.7 billion or 2%, with growth in both commercial and consumer loans.   
PNC legacy commercial loans grew $3.7 billion, driven by growth within Corporate Banking and asset-based lending. This growth in balances has been aided by a slight uptick in spot utilization. And while still near the historic lows, utilization did reach its highest level since December 2020. Growth in PNC's legacy consumer loans linked quarter was driven by higher residential real estate balances.  
Within the BBVA USA portfolio, loans declined $4.4 billion, primarily due to intentional runoff relating to the overlapping exposures in nonstrategic loans. Looking ahead, we have approximately $5 billion of additional BBVA USA loans that we intend to let roll off over the next few years, which is in line with our acquisition assumptions. Finally, PPP loans declined $4.8 billion due to forgiveness activity. And as of September 30, $6.8 billion of PPP loans remain on our balance sheet.  
Moving to Slide 5. Average deposits of $454 billion increased $53 billion compared to the second quarter, driven by the acquisition. On the right, you can see total period end deposits were $449 billion at September 30, a decline of $4 billion or 1% linked quarter. Inside of this, PNC legacy deposits increased $5.4 billion as deposits continue to grow, reflecting the strong liquidity position of our customers.  
BBVA USA deposits declined approximately $9.4 billion during the third quarter, which was anticipated as we rationalized the rate paid on certain acquired commercial deposit portfolios and exited several noncore deposit-related businesses. Overall, our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits is now 4 basis points, a 1 basis point decline linked quarter.
Slide 6 details the change in our period end securities and Federal Reserve balances. And as most of you know, we have been disciplined in deploying our excess liquidity with rates at historically low levels. Back at the beginning of the year as the yield curve steepened, we accelerated our rate of purchasing activity. However, towards the end of the second quarter, we deliberately slowed our purchases as yields declined. With the increase in rates at the end of the third quarter, we resumed our increased levels of purchasing, including $5.4 billion of forward-settling securities, which will be reflected in the fourth quarter.  
Average security balances now represent approximately 24% of interest-earning assets, and we still expect to be in the range of approximately 25% to 30% by year-end.  
As you can see on Slide 7, our third quarter income statement includes the full quarter impact of the acquisition. Reported EPS was $3.30, which included pretax integration costs of $243 million. Excluding integration costs, adjusted EPS was $3.75. Third quarter revenue was up 11% compared with the second quarter, reflecting the acquisition as well as strong organic fee growth.  
Expenses increased $537 million or 18% linked quarter, including $235 million of integration expenses and 2 additional months of BBVA USA operating expenses. Legacy PNC expenses increased $76 million or 2.7%, virtually all of which was driven by higher fee business activity.  
Pretax pre-provision earnings, excluding integration costs, were $1.9 billion, an increase of $25 million or 7%. The provision recapture of $203 million was primarily driven by improved credit quality and changes in portfolio composition. And our effective tax rate was 17.8%. For the full year, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 17%. As a result, total net income was $1.5 billion in the third quarter.  
Now let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Turning to Slide 8. These charts illustrate our diversified business mix. In total, revenue of $5.2 billion increased $530 million linked quarter. Net interest income of $2.9 billion was up $275 million or 11%, reflecting the full quarter benefit of the earning asset balances acquired from BBVA USA. Inside of that, interest income on loans increased $277 million or 13%, while investment securities income declined $9 million, driven by elevated premium amortization on the acquired BBVA USA portfolio.  
Net interest margin of 2.27% was down 2 basis points, driven primarily by lower security yields. Importantly, in the fourth quarter, we expect premium amortization to decline meaningfully and the yield on securities -- the yield on the securities portfolio to increase.  
Third quarter fee income of $1.9 billion increased $274 million or 17% linked quarter. BBVA USA contributed fee income of $184 million, an increase of $122 million linked quarter, driven by 2 additional months of operating results. Legacy PNC fees grew by $152 million linked quarter or 10%, driven by higher corporate service fees related to record M&A advisory activity as well as growth in residential mortgage revenue.  
Other noninterest income of $449 million decreased $19 million linked quarter as higher private equity revenue was more than offset by the impact of $169 million negative Visa derivative adjustment. This adjustment relates to the extension of the expected timing of litigation resolution.  
Turning to Slide 9. Our third quarter expenses were up by $537 million or 18% linked quarter. The increase was primarily driven by the impact of higher BBVA USA's expenses of $327 million and higher integration expenses of $134 million. PNC legacy expenses increased $76 million or 2.7% due to higher incentive compensation commensurate with a strong performance in our fee businesses, including a record quarter in M&A advisory fees. Our efficiency ratio adjusted for integration costs was 64%.  
Obviously, with the acquisition, our expense base is now higher, but nevertheless, we remain disciplined around our expense management. And as we've stated previously, we have a goal to reduce PNC stand-alone expenses by $300 million in 2021 through our continuous improvement program, and we're on track to achieve our full year target.  
Additionally, we're confident we'll realize the full $900 million in net expense savings off of our forecast of BBVA USA's 2022 expense base, and expect virtually all of the actions that drive the $900 million of savings to be completed by the end of 2021.  
We still expect to incur integration costs of approximately $980 million related to the acquisition. Since the announcement of the acquisition, we've incurred approximately half of these integration costs. And as Bill mentioned, we appreciate all the hard work our teammates have done to keep us on track and to achieve these goals.  
Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 10 and reflect strong credit performance. Nonperforming loans of $2.5 billion decreased $251 million or 9% compared to June 30, and continue to represent less than 1% of total loans. Total delinquencies of $1.4 billion at September 30 increased $106 million or 8%. However, this increase includes approximately $75 million of operational delays in early-stage delinquencies, primarily related to BBVA USA acquired loans. Subsequent to quarter end, all of these operational delinquencies have been or are in the process of being resolved. Excluding these, total delinquencies would have increased $31 million or 2%.  
Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $81 million, a decline of $225 million linked quarter. The second quarter included $248 million of charge-offs related to BBVA USA loans, mostly the result of required purchase accounting and treatment for the acquisition.  
Our annualized net charge-off loans in the third quarter was 11 basis points. And during the third quarter, our allowance for credit losses declined $374 million, primarily driven by improvement in credit quality as well as changes in portfolio composition. At quarter end, our reserves were $6 billion, representing 2.07% of loans.  
In summary, PNC reported a strong third quarter. And notably earlier this week, converted the BBVA USA franchise. With this step completed, we expect to add significant value to our shareholders as we continue to realize the potential of the combined company.  
In regard to our view of the overall economy, after somewhat slower growth during the third quarter of 2021 due in part to the delta variant and supply chain problems, we expect GDP to accelerate to above 6% annualized in the fourth quarter. We also expect the Fed funds rate to remain near 0 for the remainder of the year.  
Looking at the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the recent third quarter results, we expect average loan balances, excluding PPP, to be up modestly. We expect NII to be up modestly. On a percentage basis, we expect fee income to be down between 3% and 5%, mostly reflecting the elevated third quarter M&A activity. We expect other noninterest income to be between $375 million and $425 million, excluding net securities and Visa activity. On a percentage basis, we expect total noninterest expense to be down between 3% and 5%, excluding integration expense, which we approximate to be $450 million during the fourth quarter. And we expect fourth quarter net charge-offs to be between $100 million and $150 million.  
And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions."

I don't know what people have or don't have in terms of their ability to do that. But the biggest element for us, Mike, and I think we've talked to you about this, was in effect, this data lake idea where since our applications don't hold their own data, they call from a central lake. And they're linked through API and they're cloud-native. It just makes it very easy to move data and new -- onboard a new client. It's not much different than as if we just got a couple of million new clients overnight.  
That -- and I make it sound very easy and all my technologists are ripping their hair off. But that's what we did and it worked.

So technology if PNC is not in the back office somewhere doing its job, they're actually side-by-side and agile teams working with their business partners to develop product, and importantly, to execute the conversion, which we did. That cultural element is probably as important or more important than all the rest."

The financial disruption of crypto broadly and probably inside of that stable coin is a real threat. And it depends on how that plays out through time. There's the risk, I think, that people are aware of with certain of the stable coins having, let's call it, suspicious collateral behind them. But there is also the risk through time that a substantial portion of savings, either domestic savings or even emerging market savings, get absorbed into a stable coin and under the traditional money transmission system. And that would affect the economy and the ability to control the money supply long term.

And of course, we just -- with the conversion of BBVA, we put all of their customers or enabled that Low Cash Mode on all other products who converted over. I forget the current stats, but it's millions and millions and millions of alerts that have gone out. It's millions of people who have been able to transfer money before they get hit with a charge. It's people being able to choose the order at which they want to pay a bill and return items with no return fee. 
And look, we -- in some ways, we kind of led the industry into this discussion, and you've seen how people have reacted. Part of our lead was in what we charge customers. But a big part of our lead was on technology and simply empowering customers. And most everyone who has followed is kind of doing it through brute force and just cutting fees as opposed to offering different solutions, which is the most important thing about Low Cash Mode, I think. No. So we're happy with what it's doing. It's knocked our complaint volume into the care center down by, I don't know what the number is on overdraft, over 50% or some."
