Through incredibly challenging circumstances, our focused execution and increased investment in people and new content enabled us to achieve record results during 2020. On a GAAP basis, revenues",1346,"Thank you, Chris, and thank you all for joining us today. Through incredibly challenging circumstances, our focused execution and increased investment in people and new content enabled us to achieve record results during 2020. 
On a GAAP basis, revenues increased year-over-year by 25%. Operating income increased 70% to $2.7 billion and earnings per share increased by 45%. Since present management assumed control of the company 30 years ago, our returns to shareholders have been 4x greater than the returns generated by the S&P 500 during the same period of time. Our shareholders had the benefit of our strong financial performance in 2020, and our 400 million players had the benefit of the connection and joy our games delivered each and every day. 
In a year filled with adversity, our mission, connecting and engaging the world through epic entertainment has never been more important. I'm incredibly proud of our employees and the way they responded with resilience, compassion and dedication to support each other and our communities. And with almost 400 million players in 190 countries, our games welcome some of the most diverse audiences in the world. 
We have long understood that we simply cannot create broad appeal entertainment without diverse views, voices and talents. To that end, we continue to invest in initiatives to identify and develop emerging leaders and exceptional talent, both within our company and throughout our industry and other sectors. 
Our company and our employees remain committed to the communities in which we operate. One important example of our community commitment is the Call of Duty endowment. Our efforts to place veterans and high-quality jobs provide our company as well as thousands of other employers with the most dedicated, ambitious, disciplined and hard-working talent. 
We resolutely believe the heroes who serve their countries to protect freedom and liberty deserve special opportunities as a result of their surface. With unemployment rates skyrocketing, we still managed to achieve our most successful year ever placing over 15,000 veterans into high-quality jobs in 2020. 
Of those we helped place last year, 21% were women and 28% were black. Metrics in which we take great pride, considering that women veterans and black veterans composed just 10% and 12%, respectively, of the U.S. veteran community. 
Since 2009, we funded the placement of 81,000 veterans into new jobs, but now more than ever, we must ensure that our dedicated public servants have access to the very best employment opportunities. We've also sought to create career pathways for talented young people, especially from backgrounds that have been historically underrepresented in tech and entertainment. Our investment in management leadership for tomorrow has allowed that organization to grow its extraordinary career preparation program doubling the number of participants and equipping high achieving black, Latinx and indigenous Americans with skills and coaching to accelerate their careers. 
Our support for the United Negro College Fund has funded scholarships for some of our nation's most promising use. These initiatives further remind the 10,000 people who work at Activision Blizzard that purpose and meaning is the most powerful way to broaden the connection and engagement that our games offer to so many. 
Our employees around the world are determined to serve our audiences and deliver acceleration through accomplishment, provide welcome and necessary distraction during turbulent times and enable moments of solids and comfort throughout the day. We create safe venues that reward unity and celebrate our differences. Differences is sometimes unnecessarily divide our society. Gaming connects people more deeply than any other form of media, and video games are redefining what it means to interact socially. 
In 2020, we introduced even more ways for players to connect and find community, particularly in Call of Duty. Our approach to the franchise has become the road map we are now applying to many of our other games. Within Call of Duty, we have meaningfully expanded social connections and improved engagement through free-to-play experiences on mobile phones, computers and game consoles. These initiatives expanded franchise reach with over 250 million people playing Call of Duty last year, more than tripling the 70 million people who played Call of Duty in 2018. 
Our approach has made the franchise more social than ever, benefiting both our players and our business performance. Call of Duty players who play in groups with friends spend over 3x more hours in the game and invest around 3x more on in-game content compared to other players. And we've really only just started to scratch the surface of what's possible for social interaction within our franchises, and we have initiatives underway to enhance the social nature of all of our key franchises. 
Call of Duty has also established a clear blueprint for franchise-based innovation and we're applying this strategy across our other core franchises to grow reach, engagement and player investment. As I mentioned, we had roughly 400 million monthly active players in 2020, and we're accelerating our path to reach 1 billion players as we apply the Call of Duty framework across our other wholly-owned franchises. Of course, we always begin the process with inspiration and creativity. We then offer great gameplay through free-to-play access to all consumers availability on mobile phones and continuous regular delivery of in-game content and premium content. 
In Call of Duty, we expect further growth, both in our traditional regions and new countries as we continue to enhance the player experience across all platforms. In the Diablo franchise, Diablo Immortal, our upcoming free-to-play mobile title was extremely well received during its recent regional testing. And this has set the stage for the franchise to meaningfully expand its global reach. In addition to launching new Diablo content this year, our highly anticipated diablo for is on the horizon. As we execute on our Diablo pipeline, we expect the franchise to contribute meaningfully to our reach engagement and player investment growth in the coming quarters and years ahead. 
In our Warcraft franchise, we intend to deliver more frequent premium content to sustain and expand the World of Warcraft community. And we've made multiple mobile free-to-play Warcraft experiences, and they're now in advanced development based on our franchises beloved IP. This will create opportunities for both existing players and new fans to experience the Warcraft universe in entirely new ways. 
For Overwatch, we intend to not only reinvigorate the franchise for the existing community with the launch of Overwatch 2, but also substantially broaden the community through business model and growth initiatives across platforms. And in Candy Crush, which more than 0.5 billion people have already played since launch, we have a clear opportunity to continue winning back players as we execute against the pipeline of social and competitive features that current, lapsed and future players will find compelling. 
As we expand the opportunities for fans to engage with our games and our intellectual property overall, we expect our strong financial performance to continue. 3 franchises generated over $1 billion in net bookings in 2020, and we're on a clear path to further increase their growth, engagement and monetization. We expect at least 2 additional franchises will reach similar scale over the next couple of years. We plan to grow earnings per share again this year given the structural expansion we've driven in our largest franchises, and we'll maintain our focus and further increase our investment in creative talent while continuing to reposition our business to leverage our direct digital relationships with players. And to take advantage of the increasing demand around the world for our gains. 
And 2022 should see even more significant growth given our planned release of new content across multiple platforms, we're confident that executing against our plans will allow us to realize the full potential of our portfolio of fully owned intellectual property and deliver superior shareholder returns as we have for 3 decades. Of course, none of this would be achievable without the unwavering commitment of our employees and our players around the world. And of course, thank you to our shareholders for your ongoing support. Daniel will now review the highlights of our record year with you."
4222231,700829367,2192545,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bobby. Activision Blizzard delivered better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter and for the fiscal year, and we are entering 2021 with momentum across our largest franchises. Throughout 2020, we continued executing on the fundamental c",2087,"Thank you, Bobby. Activision Blizzard delivered better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter and for the fiscal year, and we are entering 2021 with momentum across our largest franchises. Throughout 2020, we continued executing on the fundamental changes to our core franchises, investing in development resources and doubling down on content delivery. 
We saw early returns from our initiatives to transform our largest franchises through compelling premium content, more robust in-game operations, expanding to mobile and ramping new engagement models, including advertising and especially expanding free-to-play opportunities to attract new players. 
In Call of Duty, our new approach to player engagement and investment through adding free-to-play war zone and mobile entry points have meaningfully expanded the ways in which players can interact with a franchise. And this is only adding to our premium proposition. Creating highly differentiated ecosystem with consistent and immersive seasonal content across mobile, console and PC. 
If you look back at the reach for the franchise since we embarked on this new direction, we have seen monthly active users grow from approximately 40 million in 2018 to over 100 million in 2020, and we see more opportunities to grow the user base. In World of Warcraft, the introduction of the classic game drove substantial growth in reach and engagement between expansions for the modern game, and we have built on this momentum with the shadow lab expansion, which has seen a tremendous response. 
We have multiple initiatives underway to ensure players can continue to experience the magical Warcraft on a more consistent basis in our more platforms than ever before. And in Candy Crush, our investments to expand the payer base, while keeping players engaged with continually updated content and went to double-digit year-over-year growth in net bookings in the fourth quarter, and we finished the year with the strongest performance since we acquired King. 
Throughout 2020, we also continue to invest in building our direct digital relationship with players, including through bottle net, the entry point for tens of millions of players on PC to access our games each month. Since inception, over 400 million accounts worldwide have been created with multiple forms of payment. Our record results illustrate our opportunity to drive step changes in the reach, engagement and player investment of our franchise. While our businesses benefited from industry tailwinds in 2020, much of our growth was driven by strong product and commercial execution. We expect our growth initiatives for Call of Duty, Global Warcraft and Candy Crush to again drive strong results in 2021. The and we believe all of our large franchises will see meaningful user growth, engagement growth and player investment growth over the next 2 to 3 years. 
We are making significant progress against our development pipeline for our key intellectual properties, which we expect to fuel further growth in 2022 and beyond. We have more new content being created and at any time in our history. And we expect our content-related investment in 2021 to be almost 40% higher than in 2019. As we adapt the Call of Duty model, creating free-to-play entry points across new platforms and geographies, increasing social functionality and frequency of content delivery as well as improving player investment opportunities, we are very confident we can continue to grow at an accelerated pace. 
Now let's review our Q4 and full year operational highlights, and then we will provide more insight into our future plans. At Activision, 2020 was an extraordinary year for reach, engagement and player investment in our Call of Duty franchise. Live to date, consumer spending of around $27 billion makes it one of the most successful entertainment franchises of all time, yet the franchise delivered a structural change in 2020 with net bookings approximately doubling year-over-year, and we expect further growth this year. Activision's monthly active users were 128 million, marking the fifth consecutive quarter with more than 100 million players driven by Call of Duty. This level of scale for the franchise leads to better gaming experiences for the community, provides more data for us to continue improving our experiences and creates more opportunities for player investment. 
Call of Duty momentum continued into the fourth quarter, the biggest quarter of the year with net bookings growing double digits year-over-year. The November launch of Black Ops' Cold War, the newest premium Call of Duty experience, further expanded the ecosystem across console and PC. Monthly active users, or MAUs, on console and PC grew approximately 70% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and time spent in game more than doubled. Our premium business has never been stronger. Full year premium unit sales grew over 40% year-over-year. With a further strong shift to digital premium downloads. 
In December, we launched the first season of Black Ops color in-game content and integrated the game with war zone. This drove strong acceleration in premium sales with units growing sharply year-over-year in December and January, again, demonstrating the power of our free-to-play experience in driving demand for our premium content. 
And in-game player investment also continues to have momentum. In-game net bookings on console and PC grew more than 50% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. And the first season of Black Ops and war zone content that is still underway, has seen the highest number of battle passes consumed since we introduced the investable season content pass in late 2019. The Call of Duty Mobile delivered its best quarter yet with strong double-digit growth in net bookings year-over-year. As we increase developer resources for mobile, the expanded team has continued to enhance gameplay and deliver even more compelling seasonal content for players. This increased capacity on the mobile title is clearly paying off with monthly payers in the West, reaching the highest level yet in Q4, with average spend per payer increasing strongly year-over-year. And in late December, Call of Duty Mobile also launched in China. Bringing the franchise to the largest mobile ince in the world. The game quickly reached the top of the download charts with over 50 million installs to date, once again, illustrating the global appeal of the franchise and setting the foundation for a meaningful contribution in 2021. 
The Call of Duty League will kick off its second season next weekend. Fans will get to enjoy even more large-scale competitive play this season as its 12 city-based teams compete in a new tournament style format in the Black Ops Cold War era. Call of Duty is entering 2021 with the largest player community it has ever had to start a year. And with a compelling pipeline of live operations and seasonal content across PC, console and mobile, and now mobile momentum in China, our focus will be to continue to expand the reach of our franchise while sustaining deep engagement for existing players. 
Now turning to Blizzard. Blizzard is committed to improving consistent innovation and content delivery for its dedicated players. World of Warcraft had a very strong year with net bookings growing over 40% year-over-year to the highest level in nearly a decade. Fourth quarter net bookings for the franchise grew by a double-digit percentage year-over-year, driven by strong sales of the shadowlands expansion, subscriber growth in high participation in value-added services. 
World of Warcraft reach expanded year-over-year for the sixth consecutive quarter, contributing to overall Blizzard MAUs of 29 million in Q4. The trends for reach and engagement after the launch of Shadowlands are even stronger than the levels we typically see at this stage after an expansion launch. With both the modern and the classic nodes continuing to operate at global scale. Blizzard has more opportunity to delight and engage the World of Warcraft community than ever before. 
Looking forward, the multiple Warcraft teams have an unwavering commitment to innovation and expansion for reach, engagement and player investment through more new content initiatives across platforms positioning the franchise for further growth in 2021 and beyond. 
The Overwatch franchise continues to engage its community with in-game content and to celebrate its players in the Overwatch League. Where teams are preparing for the start of the 2021 season in April. And mobile remains a top priority at Blizzard, both to give existing fans new ways to engage and to allow new players to experience its franchises. The Ablo Moral completed its first stage of regional testing with very positive player feedback, a lot of excitement about the depth and authenticity of this latest Diablo experience and strong engagement metrics. We look forward to getting the game in the hands of more players in further regional testing ahead of a launch planned for later this year. And the Blizzard team is looking forward to channeling the spirit of BlizzCon to engage and celebrate the community once again at BlizzCon line on February 19 and 20, where they will share more about the plans for the franchises. 
At King, the business concluded its best full year performance since the acquisition. In-game net bookings grew by a double-digit percentage year-over-year in the fourth quarter, with growth accelerating relative to Q3. MAUs were 240 million in Q4, and payer numbers continued on a positive year-over-year trajectory following the team's initiatives to broaden the payer base. Within the Candy Crush franchise, players responded particularly positively to new features choosing to invest more deeply in their experience in driving strong growth in in-game spend per player. Candy Crush was once again the top grossing franchise in the U.S. app stores and the combination of a broader payer base and strong execution in live operations means the franchise is entering 2021 with strong momentum. 
Elsewhere in the King portfolio, Farm Heroes and Bubble which, again, grew quarterly net bookings year-over-year, driven by strong execution across live operation and seasonal events. King also delivered significant year-over-year growth in advertising with net bookings in both the direct and partner sales channels growing sharply. For the full year, advertising revenues grew nearly 50% year-over-year. 
As the team continues to invest in the direct sales channel, tech infrastructure and further product innovation, we expect the advertising business to deliver another strong year in 2021. King will add to its portfolio this quarter with the launch of Crash Bandicoot on the run next month. The launch of Crash on mobile is a great example of how we are leveraging our strength across business units and the global appeal of our owned IP, and we look forward to introducing fans to an entirely new crash experience on the mobile platform. 2020 was a fantastic year for the King business. In which the team accelerated clumped delivery for its live franchises, introducing more new features and engaging seasonal content to drive broader and deeper player investment across the network. And this year, King will build on its strong execution as it delivers against a large pipeline of product innovation, including new social and competitive features, positioning the business for ongoing growth in 2021 and beyond. 
Across the business, focus and execution on our largest franchises delivered another strong quarter in our most successful year. This performance represents a base from which we intend to build. And as you will hear from Dennis, we expect another strong year in 2021, driven by momentum and ongoing execution across our largest franchises. 
We are also making clear progress in our other initiatives to expand the scale of the other key franchises in our portfolio, which are set to drive further growth next year and beyond. At Blizzard, in particular, our teams are hard at work on Diablo 4, Overwatch 2 and multiple mobile titles. We have further bolstered headcount on key franchises, supporting the team's plans to follow these ambitious titles with compelling content that sustains Blizzard's communities over the long term. 
The pipeline is progressing really well, and we anticipate that 2022 will be a great year for Blizzard. To achieve these plans, we will continue to invest in growing creative talent across our key franchises, funding this through efficiencies as we continue to better leverage the talent, expertise and scale of our business units. We will also continue to invest in our platform and ensure that we are leveraging the direct digital relationship we enjoy with our players to efficiently maximize the reach of our new content. 
We believe we're only at the beginning of unlocking the full potential of our portfolio and expect another step change in financial performance in 2022 as we execute against our pipeline. Dennis will now share the detailed results of our fourth quarter and specifics for our outlook. Dennis?"

Today, I will review our 2020 and Q4 results as well as our outlook for 2021 and the first quarter. All growth comparisons are year-over-year. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP figures. Please refer to our earnings",1247,"Thanks, Daniel. Today, I will review our 2020 and Q4 results as well as our outlook for 2021 and the first quarter. All growth comparisons are year-over-year. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. 
Our full year results were substantially above our original outlook. This was a record-setting year in which successful growth initiatives for several of our key franchises saw net bookings grow 32% year-over-year, GAAP revenues increased 25%. Operating income grew 70% and EPS grew 45%, all reaching new highs. 
For the year, we generated GAAP revenues of $8.1 billion. This includes the net deferral of $333 million. Net bookings were $8.4 billion. We generated GAAP diluted EPS of $2.82 and non-GAAP EPS of $3.21. These figures include net deferrals of $0.26. 
Over the fourth quarter, GAAP and non-GAAP EPS were ahead of our prior outlook, reflecting business overperformance at a lower tax rate. Now let's look at segment results. For the full year, Activision revenue grew 78%, with Call of Duty revenues approximately doubling. Operating income increased 120% and operating margin expanded 9 percentage points to 47%. 
For the quarter, Activision revenue of $1.66 billion grew 16%, driven primarily by Call of Duty and game revenues. Operating income rose 12% to $780 million with an operating margin of 47%. Blizzard full year revenue increased 11% and operating income grew 49% and with a 9 percentage point expansion in operating margin. 
Blizzard Q4 revenue of $579 million was slightly lower year-over-year as growth for World of Warcraft was offset by a decline for other titles and the absence of BlizzCon in the quarter. Operating income was $160 million, lower year-over-year, driven primarily by increased marketing investment and amortization of development costs behind the launch of Shadowlands. Blizzard's operating margin was 28% in the fourth quarter. For the full year, King revenue grew 7%, with operating income growing 16% and margin expanding 3 percentage points. King grew revenue 15% year-over-year to $577 million in Q4 with both in-game net bookings and advertising growing strongly. Operating income was $242 million with an operating margin of 42%, 3 points higher year-over-year, driven by high incremental margins from advertising. 
Our business continues to shift to more recurring and digital revenue streams, driving structurally higher margins over time. In 2020, in-game net bookings grew 44% year-over-year to reach 58% of net bookings. And digital net bookings grew 45% to represent 85% of total net bookings. 
A record performance on the income statement also drove record full year cash flow. Annual operating cash flow grew 23% to $2.3 billion despite cash payments for tax settlements. For the full year, free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditure grew 27% to $2.2 billion. Our cash and investments at the end of December was approximately $8.8 billion, with net cash of approximately $5.2 billion. 
Turning to capital allocation. We enter 2021 with a strong balance sheet and significant flexibility. As always, we continue to take a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation. With this in mind, our Board has authorized for the 11th year in a row, an increase in our annual dividend this year to $0.47 per share, an increase of 15% over the prior year, which will be payable in May. And also, our Board has adopted a new 2-year $4 billion share repurchase authorization, an increase from our prior $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization. 
Now let's turn to our outlook for 2021. First, I will provide some context. Much of our success in 2020 was due to strong product and commercial execution, driving structural improvements in our largest owned franchises. While we believe we benefited from various shelter-at-home requirements we are seeing continued strength even in markets where restrictions have eased. Overall, we are entering 2021 with momentum in our biggest franchises and a pipeline of content and growth initiatives that we expect will enable each of our segments to grow operating income for the full year 2021. Activision enters the year with strong momentum for Call of Duty and has a fantastic pipeline of in-game content ahead across all platforms. We will benefit from a full year of war zone driving upgrades to our premium content and incremental in-game player investment. And we have a substantial opportunity to continue migrating the community to Black Ops Cold War as well as another strong premium release planned for Q4 in 2021. 
In our outlook, we are conservatively assuming Call of Duty premium units are lower year-over-year. However, with opportunities in in-game across all platforms, including the ramp-up of Call of Duty Mobile in China, we do expect growth in net bookings overall for the Call of Duty franchise. 
We expect Blizzard's net bookings to grow given the momentum in World of Warcraft and the other growth initiatives we have in the business. Our outlook does not include Diablo 4 or Overwatch 2 launching in 2021. And  while Diablo Immortal is progressing well, and we anticipate its launch later this year, we don't have any material contribution from the title in our outlook presently. We expect top line growth at King, primarily by ongoing growth in Candy Crush, across both in-app purchases and advertising. We assume relatively little contribution from the release of Crash Bandicoot on the run as is customary for new mobile titles. 
From a margin perspective, our outlook reflects further GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin improvement year-over-year, building off the record margin performance in 2020 with ongoing benefits from an increasing mix of digital revenues and operational discipline. 
Now let's turn to the numbers. On a GAAP basis for 2021, we expect revenues of $8.23 billion, including net deferrals of $225 million. We expect net bookings of $8.45 billion. A GAAP operating margin of 36%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 787 million and GAAP EPS of $2.83. 
For 2021, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect an operating margin of 41% and  non-GAAP EPS of $3.34, including net deferrals of $0.26. Now let's turn to our Q1 outlook. On a GAAP basis for Q1, we expect revenues of $2.02 billion including the net recognition of deferrals of $265 million. We expect net bookings of $1.75 billion, a GAAP operating margin of 30%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 784 million and GAAP EPS of $0.59. 
For Q1, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect an operating margin of 42% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.84, including the net recognition of deferrals of $0.19. In summary, 2020 was a record year for the company. And as our 2021 outlook indicates, we believe the business has reached a new structurally higher financial profile following our actions to expand our largest franchises. But there is much more to come. Our pipeline has never been stronger. And as we look beyond 2021 and plan for 2022, we are looking forward to delivering some of the most eagerly anticipated content in the industry. 
In addition to our regular cadence of content across Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush. We expect Blizzard to release major new titles across console, PC and mobile, contributing to another step change in financial performance for the company next year. We are confident that delivering against our plan will continue to deliver strong shareholder value over the long term. Now I welcome our business leaders, Jay, Humam and Rob, as they join us for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator?"

4222231,700829367,2192545,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Tyler, it's Rob. Thanks for the question. As you mentioned, War zone is now tightly integrated both with Black Ops Cold War and modern warfare. And this was a really big effort by our development teams across content, progression and game systems and a lo",656,"Tyler, it's Rob. Thanks for the question. As you mentioned, War zone is now tightly integrated both with Black Ops Cold War and modern warfare. And this was a really big effort by our development teams across content, progression and game systems and a lot more. And overall, as we've noted on the call, it's gone extremely well. We had historic fourth quarter engagement across our premium games in War zone. We had record second year sales for modern Warfare in 2020. And also the Black Ops Cold War sales started strong, even gained momentum in December when we launched Season 1 and the great news is we're seeing positive momentum early in this quarter as well. 
Now that said, to your question, we learned a lot through this integration, and I'd say there's probably a few of the top lines. Black Ops Cold War brought a ton of content to war zone. It had over 30 new weapons, new operators and a lot more. And this was a massive update that required a lot of resources on our side. And having gone through this integration now, we now have even a greater sense for how we can make these transitions to work even better and smoother for all of our players in the future. And this is really important for us because War Zone is going to be front and center for us for a long time. And on that front, I'd like to take a moment to thank our players for their content and continuous feedback on all aspects of the game. It's something we listen to each and every day, and it's important to our process. And overall, on the content side, the community responded really well to Black Ops content. As we saw with Bell Half, as you heard those being increased and off to a record start, our upsell was strong, and our engagement respoke in the fourth quarter, particularly around the season 1 launch in December when a ton of Black Ops content came in. Now this has only strengthened our commitment to continue to bring compelling new content to both premium and free-to-play players on a regular basis. And that said, we know our player expectations are very high for new content and rightly so. And we want to make sure we overdeliver on that front as we move forward. I'd say another insight that became evident to us over the course of the year and in the fourth quarter is that war zone has just become the best way for us to communicate with our fans. So in the game itself, events like the reveal of Black Ops Cold War we're fun for the community. It attracted like a large and engaged audience. It also had a great impact on our results. 
On the marketing front, year-on-year, now we've more than doubled the number of players who've opted into marketing from us. And that will provide a great ongoing benefit. And additionally, we've also seen great results on conversion with our free premium trials with the free-to-play audience and War zone. So net, having this direct relationship and dialogue with our community really puts us in a unique position relative to other forms of entertainment to communicate to really a broad, broad audience and also relative to other -- many other games. So on your last part of your question, overall, we feel really good about and very confident in our strategy going forward. War zone will continue to be a central part of that future content planning to where our entire community can come together and experience the latest the franchise has to offer. And our goal remains the same, whether you're a premium or free-to-play Call of Duty player, we want to provide everyone with incredible gameplay experiences, and we're going to continue to invest significantly across all fronts to support that effort for the community."

First, as Rob said, I just really want to take this opportunity to thank our development teams for their incredible resilience and real dedication to our mission. I know it hasn't been easy, and they have just nevertheless delivered an incredible quality that our players have come to expect of all our games. To your question, the biggest factor in how our communities have grown across our portfolio really is our focus on the execution of the new engagement models and platforms such as with War zone and Call of Duty that I talked about a little bit earlier. This is why I have a very strong conviction that our momentum is sustainable. We have a deep pipeline of content and initiatives within our franchises to really meet and exceed our players' expectations. Now going to the shelter-at-home, we're seeing a consistent pattern in audience size and engagement that I referred to earlier. As you may expect, many of our key titles saw an uplift in players and engagement around the first wave of the lockdown. And engagement patterns really oscillated throughout the pandemic, in particular, in countries where restrictions were eventually lifted. But 2 things that we saw, one, is that on our more social titles, engagement remained at an elevated level. Second, and I think more importantly, we see that for the franchise where we are executing on our new franchise strategy, especially Call of Duty and World of Warcraft. We see engagement substantially higher than we had even as regions reopen. And that's why we're just so focused on making content available across all platforms, enabling us to reach much wider audiences globally and connecting players through our games. And through this COVID time, that connection that players have found has really been special and has rewarded. 
Now regarding the retail to digital shift, we have seen an acceleration, obviously, COVID has helped it, but this is actually a shift that's been going on for quite some time, and I don't need to emphasize the improved margins to our business from digital distribution. So across all these initiatives, I think 1 thing I really need to emphasize is quality is key. That's the expectations that players have of our games. And the developer teams have executed really fantastically under very difficult circumstances. And I know this very talented team will continue to delight our players. Thanks, again, Eric."

As you can imagine, we do spend a lot of time putting together our full year plan and our long-range plan as well. And we always try and be thoughtful and prudent in the numbers we put together and guide to, and this year is no different on that front. You did hear a lot about the strong momentum that we have, particularly in our biggest franchises. So it's always nice to start the year out strong. But each of our big 3 franchises really have great opportunities for growth this year, and that's really embedded in our guidance. And -- I mean, in COD, you can see we've got, obviously, a full year of war zone and the premium integration and as well as obviously, the mobile opportunity, in particular, with China being added this year. WoW has tremendous momentum coming out of the late Shadowlands launch from last year, great engagement, as we've heard on the classic side, which frankly will give us great momentum throughout the year, which is kind of unusual in a non-expansion year for a while. And then Humam and King and the Candy team had a really great 2020, and the business is really firing all cylinders, both on the in-app purchase side, the advertising side. 
So across our 3 biggest franchises, we have great momentum. And then we have a few other things up our sleeve in terms of remastered content that will unveil in due course, which should provide further opportunity for us this year. And as Daniel mentioned, and we sort of mentioned throughout our remarks, all of this incremental opportunity is digital, which should allow us to continue to grow our margin as we did and we set record margins last year. So we should be able to build upon that. From a phasing point of view, you see our Q1 guide is obviously extremely strong. And we expect that to continue into Q2. Our Q2 will probably be roughly in the same range as Q1. And that's a little bit of a tough comp versus last year when War zone launched and some of the earliest shelter-at-home trends hit. But then you -- you should see pretty natural phasing, as you'd expect in the back half of the year. And then we'll have very strong momentum as you pivot and we pivot to looking at 2022. It's obviously early, and we still have work to do, but we have an incredible lineup planned across all platforms. And it should be a great year for each of our business units with Blizzard, in particular, obviously, driving significant financial growth. I suggest, obviously, we try to model the business prudently. But when you think about the ramp-up that we have with multiple bets in mobile and the 3 franchises that we have operating at scale. And the opportunity to bring maybe a fourth and a fifth franchise to that. We can have a meaningful step change in our earnings power over the next couple of years. 
So obviously, we feel great about the trajectory for not only this year, but next year and beyond. And the opportunity is sizable, and we're just very focused on execution so we can realize that potential."

Earlier in the year, we saw the highest daily game rounds across our network ever. And then we closed the year out in real strength so in Q4, Candy Crush Saga posted its highest revenue days, and we had the strongest quarter since 2014. And then across all of King, our revenues grew 7% sequentially and 14% year-on-year. So we're really pleased with the momentum and trajectory as we enter into 2021. 
Now let me talk a little bit about what drove that performance. In Candy Crush, we accelerated the pace of content and feature delivery in 2020. And again, to echo everybody's thoughts, amazing execution from the teams under very difficult circumstances. But we've also invested in deeper product road maps in the Candy franchise. And so we had more structure around seasonal events and a lot more integrated player-facing programming, and that seems to resonate quite well. We saw the benefit of this as we saw more player investment trends. So the payers in Candy were up year-over-year in Q4. But broadly, we also started increasing frequency and high-impact events and live ops in our other titles in the portfolio. And that led Farm Heroes and Bubble Witch to grow year-over-year for the second quarter in a row in Q4. And so we like the momentum in that as well. 
So as I look ahead in 2021, our live business has got really good momentum, and we want to continue to add to that. We think we have a good formula, and we're going to continue to improve it. So we'll continue to bring a fresh slate of content and events to our players. And then we're going to complement that with big feature innovation, including more collaborative and competitive social features especially in Candy. And we've seen that when we have that social connection in our games, it correlates with player engagement and player investment. So let me give you a quick example here. We're creating more modes in the game so that it brings more players and teams together to experience the game at the same time. We're also finding ways to connect those players with each other in large audience network that's getting hand. 
Now if that's the momentum we're driving in the live games, what we have in '21 is we're gearing up for a game launch later in this quarter. So we're hard at work, bringing cash crash on the run to our mobile audiences next month. We're super excited about working on this very iconic IP and we've chosen the runner genre, which is a very attractive category in mobile because it comes with largest volumes historically and has the potential for mass reach. 
So we'll bring this amazing mobile title to our crash plan, but we equally are focused on broadening the franchise's audience in mobile. So when I put all those together, I feel pretty good about the momentum in '21 and beyond."

And we have a great community event or come in February 19 and 20, and we'll share some of the plans that we have and the things we're working on, I think there would be excited about. The company has accomplished a lot in the last 30 years. And when I think about our near and long-term development pipelines, when you look at just the Warcraft franchise alone, there are hundreds of millions of players around the world who have either played or interactive with warcraft through different games or different expressions in that universe. And when we bring those experiences to players, we think that there's a lot of potential or beyond where we are today, especially if we get these games right. 
The same is true for our other franchises. And so if we look at the near-term for the, as an example, we have the AAA, Diablo 4 that's in development, as well as a free-to-play mobile expression in the Diablo Immortal. Both teams have continued to make great progress. Overwatch 2 is another great example. We've successfully passed a major internal milestone in December, and that involved testing many key features of the game with hundreds of developers across Blizzard. And so we're happy with how that game is progressing. So doing and achieve all these aspirations takes the right kind of talent as you brought up. And so we're continuing to grow and lean in all the teams and we have plans to hire more developers going forward. One of the competitive advantages that we have at voyager is the ability to really focus talent and bring talent from 1 game to another internally. That's something that served us really well in the past. And I think the last note that's important to bring up is our aspiration to bring games and players around the world across different platforms and genres. We're always going to be led by gameplay and quality, but our goal is to give the teams everything that they need in order to make the best possible experience as strong players."

So look, the ads business is entering '21 with incredible momentum, particularly in our direct sales part of the business, which grew more than 80% some or grew 80% last year. 
So I'll touch on some of the specific initiatives that drove that performance because I really believe that those are also the levers that we move the business forward in '21 and beyond. What we saw is that the team executed really well in deepening our product offering around the, what we call the platform brand-safe proposition. When we -- it allows us to specifically focus our offering on large-scale brands. All this was in the context of building a product that was very compatible with the player experience. And so we think that's working really well. It worked in 2020, and we continue to forward in '21. And alongside of that, we grew the direct sales team and growing the sales team allowed us to broaden our coverage to reach new brands. And then we started seeing those 2 things come together and really give us a great result. So as 1 example, we worked with Sky in the United Kingdom to design alongside of them and execute an ad campaign that leverage that rewarding video product that we have, and it created a really engaging gamified ad experience that really drove results for kind of the advertisers. 
So the campaign that I'm referring to drove an 8-point uplift in ad recall and a 6-point uplift in pair association to the Sky brand messaging. So we continue to drive that forward. And as you alluded to, we're also preparing for the IDFA changes in the industry with initiatives underway kind of just specifically addressing that. I think our current momentum and the direct sales momentum that we have gives us confidence in the growth trajectory of our ad business overall, even with taking IDFA in context. So this year, what I see ahead of us is further product innovation that are already underway and further ramping up of the direct sales resources, and both of which should enable us to reach more brands and provide more experiences. 
And more broadly, we think that there's expansion even beyond there. So as I look at more titles available to repeat what we did with Candy and our other King paddles, we have other launches across the company that we can look into integrating that experience and broaden the overall network. So all these opportunities ahead of us and the scale of the player network gives us a really good kind of momentum, and we feel pretty good about where the business is headed."

The 2 communities are really different in the engage in different ways. But we think they have the same love of the game world. And they have a unified subscription, which is virtuous to both communities. The release of Shadowlands and the work-from-home environment is a huge point of pride for us. I think the expansion turned out great, and it's got content for players of all kinds to really engage with. The metrics that we traditionally track and expansion for an expansion's relief have been quite successful. Life to date, on Shadowlands. It's actually the highest of any expansion in the last 10 years. We also see significantly more player engagement than we typically see at this stage. And that momentum has continued through January with the player base, so significantly larger than it was a year ago. So while classic, the community continues to be highly engaged and it's a global community. Since the launch, classic has really given players who love the game, a way to experience as or up in the community the way they experienced it for the very first time. And as a result, the overall World of Warcraft is a significantly larger player base, which provides us with a lot of opportunities. Looking ahead, we have plans to continue serving both those communities in creative ways and allow players to continue to explore classic in ways that feel great. We'll have more to share about the various content updates for a while shortly, but we do see WoW as a significant growth driver for Blizzard overall this year.

Look, I'd say, overall, we see a ton of opportunity ahead on mobile. I think it's really important for us to step back and look at the fact that quality mobile in the West has only been live for about actually a little less than 1.5 years. And in that time period, we shared this data, but we quickly scaled over 300 million downloads and Dan would also mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we delivered our best quarter yet. And obviously, a clear sign that our teams focus on gameplay, new seasonal content and just driving engagement overall is driving strong results for us. But this is certainly just a point in time. And when you step back and look at the biggest games in the West, they continue to scale at the 3-year mark and well beyond in many cases. So we believe we have a lot of headroom in regions around the world to grow this business. And the beauty of mobile that allows us to reach new players in markets where console and PC may not be as well developed. And we've seen tens of millions of new players in regions like Latin America, India and beyond, where we're seeing potential for a lot more upside. And looking ahead for this global community, of course, we're going to take our endgame seasons and content in advance to another level for our community. And I also see a lot of opportunity press at the local market level to drive local initiatives to make Call of Duty even more relevant in those local markets. 
And I want to go back and mention 1 another thing, which I think I mentioned on a previous call, which is it's really important to note that all of this right now is accretive to our overall franchise success. When we look at registered players who play both on mobile and on console or PC, these players show significantly higher engagement and player investment than other groups. And so again, it's just proof that I think the ecosystem is working really, really well together. Now you also asked about the recent release in China by Tencent, and it is early, right? But the game is off to a great start. We've seen tens of millions of downloads in the first month, a lot of good reception early on. And we do think this is going to be a meaningful contributor to our overall mobile results as we move forward. And as I step back, I'm just really excited about our ability to now grow our brand further on a global basis by being in such a massive, massive market. And so what I -- the way I'd sum it up is that it's been a great start on mobile, but it's just that. It's a great start. Mobile is a critical long-term growth driver for Activision. And we are definitely taking a long-term view of the platform and the opportunity. We're hiring aggressively to make sure we're well positioned to create the best possible mobile experiences for our community and I think importantly, as we project even further out, making sure we have the ability to expand to mobile, the very best of what's working in the quality ecosystem, which I think presents yet another layer of opportunity for us in the years ahead. Thanks for the question."

Through incredibly challenging circumstances, our focused execution and increased investment in people and new content enabled us to achieve record results during 2020.On a GAAP basis, revenues i",1345,"Thank you, Chris, and thank you all for joining us today. Through incredibly challenging circumstances, our focused execution and increased investment in people and new content enabled us to achieve record results during 2020.
On a GAAP basis, revenues increased year-over-year by 25%. Operating income increased 70% to $2.7 billion and earnings per share increased by 45%. Since present management assumed control of the company 30 years ago, our returns to shareholders have been 4x greater than the returns generated by the S&P 500 during the same period of time. Our shareholders had the benefit of our strong financial performance in 2020, and our 400 million players had the benefit of the connection and joy our games delivered each and every day.
In a year filled with adversity, our mission, connecting and engaging the world through epic entertainment has never been more important. I'm incredibly proud of our employees and the way they responded with resilience, compassion and dedication to support each other and our communities. And with almost 400 million players in 190 countries, our games welcome some of the most diverse audiences in the world.
We have long understood that we simply cannot create broad appeal entertainment without diverse views, voices and talents. To that end, we continue to invest in initiatives to identify and develop emerging leaders and exceptional talent, both within our company and throughout our industry and other sectors.
Our company and our employees remain committed to the communities in which we operate. One important example of our community commitment is the Call of Duty Endowment. Our efforts to place veterans in high-quality jobs provide our company as well as thousands of other employers with the most dedicated, ambitious, disciplined and hard-working talent.
We resolutely believe the heroes who serve their countries to protect freedom and liberty deserve special opportunities as a result of their surface. With unemployment rates skyrocketing, we still managed to achieve our most successful year ever placing over 15,000 veterans into high-quality jobs in 2020.
Of those we help placed last year, 21% were women and 28% were black. Metrics in which we take great pride, considering that women veterans and black veterans composed just 10% and 12%, respectively, of the U.S. veteran community.
Since 2009, we funded the placement of 81,000 veterans into new jobs, but now more than ever, we must ensure that our dedicated public servants have access to the very best employment opportunities. We've also sought to create career pathways for talented young people, especially from backgrounds that have been historically underrepresented in tech and entertainment. Our investment in management leadership for tomorrow has allowed that organization to grow its extraordinary career preparation program doubling the number of participants and equipping high achieving black, Latinx and indigenous Americans with skills and coaching to accelerate their careers.
Our support for the United Negro College Fund has funded scholarships for some of our nation's most promising youths. These initiatives further remind the 10,000 people who work at Activision Blizzard that purpose and meaning is the most powerful way to broaden the connection and engagement that our games offer to so many.
Our employees around the world are determined to serve our audiences and deliver acceleration through accomplishment, provide welcome and necessary distraction during turbulent times and enable moments of solace and comfort throughout the day. We create safe venues that reward unity and celebrate our differences. Differences is sometimes unnecessarily divide our society. Gaming connects people more deeply than any other form of media, and video games are redefining what it means to interact socially.
In 2020, we introduced even more ways for players to connect and find community, particularly in Call of Duty. Our approach to the franchise has become the road map we are now applying to many of our other games. Within Call of Duty, we have meaningfully expanded social connections and improved engagement through free-to-play experiences on mobile phones, computers and game consoles. These initiatives expanded franchise reach with over 250 million people playing Call of Duty last year, more than tripling the 70 million people who played Call of Duty in 2018.
Our approach has made the franchise more social than ever, benefiting both our players and our business performance. Call of Duty players who play in groups with friends spend over 3x more hours in the game and invest around 3x more on in-game content compared to other players. And we've really only just started to scratch the surface of what's possible for social interaction within our franchises, and we have initiatives underway to enhance the social nature of all of our key franchises.
Call of Duty has also established a clear blueprint for franchise-based innovation and we're applying this strategy across our other core franchises to grow reach, engagement and player investment. As I mentioned, we had roughly 400 million monthly active players in 2020, and we're accelerating our path to reach 1 billion players as we apply the Call of Duty framework across our other wholly-owned franchises. Of course, we always begin the process with inspiration and creativity. We then offer great gameplay through free-to-play access to all consumers availability on mobile phones and continuous regular delivery of in-game content and premium content.
In Call of Duty, we expect further growth, both in our traditional regions and new countries as we continue to enhance the player experience across all platforms.
In the Diablo franchise, Diablo Immortal, our upcoming free-to-play mobile title was extremely well received during its recent regional testing. And this has set the stage for the franchise to meaningfully expand its global reach. In addition to launching new Diablo content this year, our highly anticipated Diablo IV is on the horizon. As we execute on our Diablo pipeline, we expect the franchise to contribute meaningfully to our reach, engagement and player investment growth in the coming quarters and years ahead.
In our Warcraft franchise, we intend to deliver more frequent premium content to sustain and expand the World of Warcraft community. And we've made multiple mobile free-to-play Warcraft experiences, and they're now in advanced development based on our franchises beloved IP. This will create opportunities for both existing players and new fans to experience the Warcraft universe in entirely new ways.
For Overwatch, we intend to not only reinvigorate the franchise for the existing community with the launch of Overwatch 2, but also substantially broaden the community through business model and growth initiatives across platforms.
And in Candy Crush, which more than 0.5 billion people have already played since launch, we have a clear opportunity to continue winning back players as we execute against the pipeline of social and competitive features that current, lapsed and future players will find compelling.
As we expand the opportunities for fans to engage with our games and our intellectual property overall, we expect our strong financial performance to continue. Three franchises generated over $1 billion in net bookings in 2020, and we're on a clear path to further increase their growth, engagement and monetization. We expect at least 2 additional franchises will reach similar scale over the next couple of years. We plan to grow earnings per share again this year given the structural expansion we've driven in our largest franchises, and we'll maintain our focus and further increase our investment in creative talent while continuing to reposition our business to leverage our direct digital relationships with players and to take advantage of the increasing demand around the world for our games.
And 2022 should see even more significant growth given our planned release of new content across multiple platforms. We're confident that executing against our plans will allow us to realize the full potential of our portfolio of fully-owned intellectual property and deliver superior shareholder returns as we have for 3 decades. Of course, none of this would be achievable without the unwavering commitment of our employees and our players around the world. And of course, thank you to our shareholders for your ongoing support.
Daniel will now review the highlights of our record year with you."

Activision Blizzard delivered better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter and for the fiscal year, and we are entering 2021 with momentum across our largest franchises. Throughout 2020, we continued executing on the fundamental c",2082,"Thank you, Bobby. Activision Blizzard delivered better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter and for the fiscal year, and we are entering 2021 with momentum across our largest franchises. Throughout 2020, we continued executing on the fundamental changes to our core franchises, investing in development resources and doubling down on content delivery.
We saw early returns from our initiatives to transform our largest franchises through compelling premium content, more robust in-game operations, expanding to mobile and ramping new engagement models, including advertising and especially expanding free-to-play opportunities to attract new players.
In Call of Duty, our new approach to player engagement and investment through adding free-to-play Warzone and mobile entry points have meaningfully expanded the ways in which players can interact with a franchise. And this is only adding to our premium proposition, creating highly differentiated ecosystem with consistent and immersive seasonal content across mobile, console and PC.
If you look back at the reach for the franchise since we embarked on this new direction, we have seen monthly active users grow from approximately 40 million in 2018 to over 100 million in 2020, and we see more opportunities to grow the user base.
In World of Warcraft, the introduction of the classic game drove substantial growth in reach and engagement between expansions for the modern game, and we have built on this momentum with the Shadowlands expansion, which has seen a tremendous response. We have multiple initiatives underway to ensure players can continue to experience the magical Warcraft on a more consistent basis in our more platforms than ever before.
And in Candy Crush, our investments to expand the payer base, while keeping players engaged with continually updated content and went to double-digit year-over-year growth in net bookings in the fourth quarter, and we finished the year with the strongest performance since we acquired King.
Throughout 2020, we also continue to invest in building our direct digital relationship with players, including through Battle.net, the entry point for tens of millions of players on PC to access our games each month. Since inception, over 400 million accounts worldwide have been created with multiple forms of payment.
Our record results illustrate our opportunity to drive step changes in the reach, engagement and player investment of our franchise. While our business has benefited from industry tailwinds in 2020, much of our growth was driven by strong product and commercial execution. We expect our growth initiatives for Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush to again drive strong results in 2021. And we believe all of our large franchises will see meaningful user growth, engagement growth and player investment growth over the next 2 to 3 years.
We are making significant progress against our development pipeline for our key intellectual properties, which we expect to fuel further growth in 2022 and beyond. We have more new content being created than in any time in our history. And we expect our content-related investment in 2021 to be almost 40% higher than in 2019.
As we adapt the Call of Duty model, creating free-to-play entry points across new platforms and geographies, increasing social functionality and frequency of content delivery as well as improving player investment opportunities, we are very confident we can continue to grow at an accelerated pace.
Now let's review our Q4 and full year operational highlights, and then we will provide more insight into our future plans. At Activision, 2020 was an extraordinary year for reach, engagement and player investment in our Call of Duty franchise. Live to date, consumer spending of around $27 billion makes it one of the most successful entertainment franchises of all time, yet the franchise delivered a structural change in 2020 with net bookings approximately doubling year-over-year, and we expect further growth this year.
Activision's monthly active users were 128 million, marking the fifth consecutive quarter with more than 100 million players driven by Call of Duty. This level of scale for the franchise leads to better gaming experiences for the community, provides more data for us to continue improving our experiences and creates more opportunities for player investment.
Call of Duty momentum continued into the fourth quarter, the biggest quarter of the year with net bookings growing double digits year-over-year. The November launch of Black Ops Cold War, the newest premium Call of Duty experience, further expanded the ecosystem across console and PC. Monthly active users, or MAUs, on console and PC grew approximately 70% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and time spent in game more than doubled. Our premium business has never been stronger. Full year premium unit sales grew over 40% year-over-year, with a further strong shift to digital premium downloads.
In December, we launched the first season of Black Ops Cold War  in-game content and integrated the game with Warzone. This drove strong acceleration in premium sales with units growing sharply year-over-year in December and January, again, demonstrating the power of our free-to-play experience in driving demand for our premium content.
And in-game player investment also continues to have momentum. In-game net bookings on console and PC grew more than 50% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. And the first season of Black Ops and Warzone content that is still underway, has seen the highest number of battle passes consumed since we introduced the investable season content pass in late 2019.
Call of Duty Mobile delivered its best quarter yet with strong double-digit growth in net bookings year-over-year. As we increase developer resources for mobile, the expanded team has continued to enhance gameplay and delivered even more compelling seasonal content for players. This increased capacity on the mobile title is clearly paying off with monthly payers in the West, reaching the highest level yet in Q4, with average spend per payer increasing strongly year-over-year.
And in late December, Call of Duty Mobile also launched in China, bringing the franchise to the largest mobile alliance in the world. The game quickly reached the top of the download charts with over 50 million installs to date, once again, illustrating the global appeal of the franchise and setting the foundation for a meaningful contribution in 2021.
The Call of Duty League will kick off its second season next weekend. Fans will get to enjoy even more large-scale competitive play this season as its 12-city-based teams compete in a new tournament style format in the Black Ops Cold War era. Call of Duty is entering 2021 with the largest player community it has ever had to start a year. And with a compelling pipeline of live operations and seasonal content across PC, console and mobile, and now mobile momentum in China, our focus will be to continue to expand the reach of our franchise while sustaining deep engagement for existing players.
Now turning to Blizzard. Blizzard is committed to improving consistent innovation and content delivery for its dedicated players. World of Warcraft had a very strong year with net bookings growing over 40% year-over-year to the highest level in nearly a decade. Fourth quarter net bookings for the franchise grew by a double-digit percentage year-over-year, driven by strong sales of the Shadowlands expansion, subscriber growth and high participation in value-added services. 
World of Warcraft reached expanded year-over-year for the sixth consecutive quarter, contributing to overall Blizzard MAUs of 29 million in Q4. The trends for reach and engagement after the launch of Shadowlands are even stronger than the levels we typically see at this stage after an expansion launch. With both the modern and the classic nodes continuing to operate at global scale, Blizzard has more opportunity to delight and engage the World of Warcraft community than ever before.
Looking forward, the multiple Warcraft teams have an unwavering commitment to innovation and expansion for reach, engagement and player investment through more new content initiatives across platforms positioning the franchise for further growth in 2021 and beyond.
The Overwatch franchise continues to engage its community with in-game content and to celebrate its players in the Overwatch League where teams are preparing for the start of the 2021 season in April. And mobile remains a top priority at Blizzard, both to give existing fans new ways to engage and to allow new players to experience its franchises.
Diablo Immortal Completed its first stage of regional testing with very positive player feedback, a lot of excitement about the depth and authenticity of this latest Diablo experience and strong engagement metrics. We look forward to getting the game in the hands of more players in a further regional testing ahead of a launch planned for later this year. And the Blizzard team is looking forward to channeling the spirit of BlizzCon to engage and celebrate the community once again at BlizzConline on February 19 and 20, where they will share more about the plans for the franchises.
At King, the business concluded its best full year performance since the acquisition. In-game net bookings grew by a double-digit percentage year-over-year in the fourth quarter, with growth accelerating relative to Q3. MAUs were 240 million in Q4, and payer numbers continued on a positive year-over-year trajectory following the team's initiatives to broaden the payer base.
Within the Candy Crush franchise, players responded particularly positively to new features choosing to invest more deeply in their experience in driving strong growth in in-game spend per player. Candy Crush was once again the top grossing franchise in the U.S. app stores and the combination of a broader payer base and strong execution in live operations means the franchise is entering 2021 with strong momentum.
Elsewhere in the King portfolio, Farm Heroes and Bubble Witch again grew quarterly net bookings year-over-year, driven by strong execution across live operation and seasonal events. King also delivered significant year-over-year growth in advertising with net bookings in both the direct and partner sales channels growing sharply. For the full year, advertising revenues grew nearly 50% year-over-year.
As the team continues to invest in the direct sales channel, tech infrastructure and further product innovation, we expect that advertising business to deliver another strong year in 2021. King will add to its portfolio this quarter with the launch of Crash Bandicoot: On the Run next month. The launch of Crash on mobile is a great example of how we are leveraging our strength across business units and the global appeal of our owned IP, and we look forward to introducing fans to an entirely new Crash experience on the mobile platform.
2020 was a fantastic year for the King business. In which the team accelerated clumped delivery for its live franchises, introducing more new features and engaging seasonal content to drive broader and deeper player investment across the network. And this year, King will build on its strong execution as it delivers against a large pipeline of product innovation, including new social and competitive features, positioning the business for ongoing growth in 2021 and beyond.
Across the business, focus and execution on our largest franchises delivered another strong quarter in our most successful year. This performance represents a base from which we intend to build. And as you will hear from Dennis, we expect another strong year in 2021, driven by momentum and ongoing execution across our largest franchises.
We are also making clear progress in our other initiatives to expand the scale of the other key franchises in our portfolio, which are set to drive further growth next year and beyond. At Blizzard, in particular, our teams are hard at work on Diablo IV, Overwatch 2 and multiple mobile titles. We have further bolstered headcount on key franchises, supporting the team's plans to follow these ambitious titles with compelling content that sustains Blizzard's communities over the long term.
The pipeline is progressing really well, and we anticipate that 2022 will be a great year for Blizzard. To achieve these plans, we will continue to invest in growing creative talent across our key franchises, funding this through efficiencies as we continue to better leverage the talent, expertise and scale of our business units. We will also continue to invest in our Battle.net platform and ensure that we are leveraging the direct digital relationship we enjoy with our players to efficiently maximize the reach of our new content.
We believe we're only at the beginning of unlocking the full potential of our portfolio and expect another step change in financial performance in 2022 as we execute against our pipeline. Dennis will now share the detailed results of our fourth quarter and specifics for our outlook. Dennis?"

Today, I will review our 2020 and Q4 results as well as our outlook for 2021 and the first quarter. All growth comparisons are year-over-year. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP figures. Please refer to our earnings",1245,"Thanks, Daniel. Today, I will review our 2020 and Q4 results as well as our outlook for 2021 and the first quarter. All growth comparisons are year-over-year. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations.
Our full year results were substantially above our original outlook. This was a record-setting year in which successful growth initiatives for several of our key franchises saw net bookings grow 32% year-over-year, GAAP revenues increased 25%, operating income grew 70% and EPS grew 45%, all reaching new highs.
For the year, we generated GAAP revenues of $8.1 billion. This includes the net deferral of $333 million. Net bookings were $8.4 billion. We generated GAAP diluted EPS of $2.82 and non-GAAP EPS of $3.21. These figures include net deferrals of $0.26.
Over the fourth quarter, GAAP and non-GAAP EPS were ahead of our prior outlook, reflecting business overperformance and a lower tax rate.
Now let's look at segment results. For the full year, Activision revenue grew 78%, with Call of Duty revenues approximately doubling. Operating income increased 120% and operating margin expanded 9 percentage points to 47%.
For the quarter, Activision revenue of $1.66 billion grew 16%, driven primarily by Call of Duty Endgame revenues. Operating income rose 12% to $780 million, with an operating margin of 47%.
Blizzard full year revenue increased 11% and operating income grew 49% and with a 9 percentage point expansion in operating margin. Blizzard Q4 revenue of $579 million was slightly lower year-over-year as growth for World of Warcraft was offset by a decline for other titles and the absence of BlizzCon in the quarter. Operating income was $160 million, lower year-over-year, driven primarily by increased marketing investment and amortization of development costs behind the launch of Shadowlands. Blizzard's operating margin was 28% in the fourth quarter.
For the full year, King revenue grew 7%, with operating income growing 16% and margin expanding 3 percentage points. King grew revenue 15% year-over-year to $577 million in Q4 with both in-game net bookings and advertising growing strongly. Operating income was $242 million with an operating margin of 42%, 3 points higher year-over-year, driven by high incremental margins from advertising.
Our business continues to shift to more recurring and digital revenue streams, driving structurally higher margins over time. In 2020, in-game net bookings grew 44% year-over-year to reach 58% of net bookings. And digital net bookings grew 45% to represent 85% of total net bookings.
A record performance on the income statement also drove record full year cash flow. Annual operating cash flow grew 23% to $2.3 billion despite cash payments for tax settlements. For the full year, free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditure, grew 27% to $2.2 billion. Our cash and investments at the end of December was approximately $8.8 billion, with net cash of approximately $5.2 billion.
Turning to capital allocation. We enter 2021 with a strong balance sheet and significant flexibility. As always, we continue to take a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation. With this in mind, our Board has authorized, for the 11th year in a row, an increase in our annual dividend this year to $0.47 per share, an increase of 15% over the prior year, which will be payable in May. And also, our Board has adopted a new 2-year $4 billion share repurchase authorization, an increase from our prior $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization.
Now let's turn to our outlook for 2021. First, I will provide some context. Much of our success in 2020 was due to strong product and commercial execution, driving structural improvements in our largest owned franchises. While we believe we benefited from various shelter-at-home requirements we are seeing continued strength even in markets where restrictions have eased.
Overall, we are entering 2021 with momentum in our biggest franchises and a pipeline of content and growth initiatives that we expect will enable each of our segments to grow operating income for the full year 2021. Activision enters the year with strong momentum for Call of Duty and has a fantastic pipeline of in-game content ahead across all platforms. We will benefit from a full year of Warzone driving upgrades to our premium content and incremental in-game player investment. And we have a substantial opportunity to continue migrating the community to Black Ops Cold War as well as another strong premium release planned for Q4 in 2021.
In our outlook, we are conservatively assuming Call of Duty premium units are lower year-over-year. However, with opportunities in in-game across all platforms, including the ramp-up of Call of Duty Mobile in China, we do expect growth in net bookings overall for the Call of Duty franchise.
We expect Blizzard's net bookings to grow given the momentum in World of Warcraft and the other growth initiatives we have in the business. Our outlook does not include Diablo IV or Overwatch 2 launching in 2021. And while Diablo Immortal is progressing well, and we anticipate its launch later this year, we don't have any material contribution from the title in our outlook presently.
We expect top line growth at King, primarily by ongoing growth in Candy Crush, across both in-app purchases and advertising. We assume relatively little contribution from the release of Crash Bandicoot: On the Run as it's customary for new mobile titles.
From a margin perspective, our outlook reflects further GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin improvement year-over-year, building off the record margin performance in 2020 with ongoing benefits from an increasing mix of digital revenues and operational discipline.
Now let's turn to the numbers. On a GAAP basis for 2021, we expect revenues of $8.23 billion, including net deferrals of $225 million. We expect net bookings of $8.45 billion. A GAAP operating margin of 36%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 787 million and GAAP EPS of $2.83.
For 2021, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect an operating margin of 41% and non-GAAP EPS of $3.34, including net deferrals of $0.26.
Now let's turn to our Q1 outlook. On a GAAP basis for Q1, we expect revenues of $2.02 billion including the net recognition of deferrals of $265 million. We expect net bookings of $1.75 billion, a GAAP operating margin of 30%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 784 million and GAAP EPS of $0.59.
For Q1, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect an operating margin of 42% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.84, including the net recognition of deferrals of $0.19.
In summary, 2020 was a record year for the company. And as our 2021 outlook indicates, we believe the business has reached a new structurally higher financial profile following our actions to expand our largest franchises. But there is much more to come. Our pipeline has never been stronger. And as we look beyond 2021 and plan for 2022, we are looking forward to delivering some of the most eagerly anticipated content in the industry.
In addition to our regular cadence of content across Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush, we expect Blizzard to release major new titles across console, PC and mobile, contributing to another step change in financial performance for the company next year. We are confident that delivering against our plan will continue to deliver strong shareholder value over the long term.
Now I welcome our business leaders, Jay, Humam and Rob, as they join us for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator?"

Thanks for the question. As you mentioned, Warzone is now tightly integrated both with Black Ops Cold War and Modern Warfare. And this was a really big effort by our development teams across content, progression and game systems and a lot",648,"Tyler, it's Rob. Thanks for the question. As you mentioned, Warzone is now tightly integrated both with Black Ops Cold War and Modern Warfare. And this was a really big effort by our development teams across content, progression and game systems and a lot more. And overall, as we've noted on the call, it's gone extremely well. We had historic fourth quarter engagement across our premium games in Warzone. We had record second year sales from Modern Warfare in 2020. And also the Black Ops Cold War sales started strong, even gained momentum in December when we launched Season 1 and the great news is we're seeing positive momentum early in this quarter as well.
Now that said, to your question, we learned a lot through this integration, and I'd say here's probably a few of the top lines. Black Ops Cold War brought a ton of content to Warzone. It had over 30 new weapons, new operators and a lot more. And this was a massive update that required a lot of resources on our side. And having gone through this integration now, we now have even a greater sense for how we can make these transitions to work even better and smoother for all of our players in the future. And this is really important for us because Warzone is going to be front and center for us for a long time.
And on that front, I'd like to take a moment to thank our players for their content and continuous feedback on all aspects of the game. It's something we listen to you each and every day, and it's important to our process. Overall, on the content side, the community responded really well to Black Ops content. As we saw with battle passes, you heard those being increased and off to a record start, our upsell was strong, and our engagement re-spiked in the fourth quarter, particularly around the Season 1 launch in December when a ton of Black Ops content came in.
Now this has only strengthened our commitment to continue to bring compelling new content to both premium and free-to-play players on a regular basis. And that said, we know our player expectations are very high for new content and rightly so. And we want to make sure we overdeliver on that front as we move forward.
I'd say another insight that became evident to us over the course of the year and in the fourth quarter is that Warzone has just become the best way for us to communicate with our fans. So in the game itself, events like the reveal of Black Ops Cold War were fun for the community. It attracted like a large and engaged audience. It also had a great impact on our results.
On the marketing front, year-on-year, now we've more than doubled the number of players who've opted into marketing from us. And that will provide a great ongoing benefit. And additionally, we've also seen great results on conversion with our free premium trials with the free-to-play audience in Warzone.
So net, having this direct relationship and dialogue with our community really puts us in a unique position relative to other forms of entertainment to communicate to really a broad, broad audience and also relative to other -- many other games.
So on your last part of your question, overall, we feel really good about and very confident in our strategy going forward. Warzone will continue to be a central part of that future content planning to where our entire community can come together and experience the latest the franchise has to offer. And our goal remains the same, whether you're a premium or free-to-play Call of Duty player, we want to provide everyone with incredible gameplay experiences, and we're going to continue to invest significantly across all fronts to support that effort for the community."

First, as Rob said, I just really want to take this opportunity to thank our development teams for their incredible resilience and real dedication to our mission. I know it hasn't been easy, and they have just nevertheless delivered an incredible quality that our players have come to expect of all our games.
To your question, the biggest factor in how our communities have grown across our portfolio really is our focus on the execution of the new engagement models and platforms such as with Warzone and Call of Duty that I talked about a little bit earlier. This is why I have a very strong conviction that our momentum is sustainable. We have a deep pipeline of content and initiatives within our franchises to really meet and exceed our players' expectations.
Now going to the shelter-at-home, we're seeing a consistent pattern in audience size and engagement that I referred to earlier. As you may expect, many of our key titles saw an uplift in players and engagement around the first wave of the lockdown. And engagement patterns really oscillated throughout the pandemic, in particular, in countries where restrictions were eventually lifted. But 2 things that we saw, one, is that on our more social titles, engagement remained at an elevated level. Second, and I think more importantly, we see that for the franchises where we are executing on our new franchise strategy, especially Call of Duty and World of Warcraft, we see engagement substantially higher than we had even as regions reopened. And that's why we're just so focused on making content available across all platforms, enabling us to reach much wider audiences globally and connecting players through our games. And through this COVID time, that connection that players have found has really been special and has rewarded.
Now regarding the retail to digital shift, we have seen an acceleration, obviously, COVID has helped it, but this is actually a shift that's been going on for quite some time, and I don't need to emphasize the improved margins to our business from digital distribution.
So across all these initiatives, I think one thing I really need to emphasize is quality is key. That's the expectations that players have of our games. And the developer teams have executed really fantastically under very difficult circumstances. And I know this very talented team will continue to delight our players. Thanks, again, Eric."

As you can imagine, we do spend a lot of time putting together our full year plan and our long-range plan as well. And we always try and be thoughtful and prudent in the numbers we put together and guide to, and this year is no different on that front.
You did hear a lot about the strong momentum that we have, particularly in our biggest franchises. So it's always nice to start the year out strong. But each of our big 3 franchises really have great opportunities for growth this year, and that's really embedded in our guidance.
I mean, in COD, you can see we've got, obviously, a full year of Warzone and the premium integration and as well as obviously, the mobile opportunity, in particular, with China being added this year. WoW has tremendous momentum coming out of the late Shadowlands launch from last year, great engagement, as we've heard on the classic side, which frankly will give us great momentum throughout the year, which is kind of unusual in a non-expansion year for a while. And then Humam and King and the Candy team had a really great 2020, and the business is really firing all cylinders, both on the in-app purchase side, the advertising side.
So across our 3 biggest franchises, we have great momentum. And then we have a few other things up our sleeve in terms of remastered content that will unveil in due course, which should provide further opportunity for us this year.
And as Daniel mentioned, and we sort of mentioned throughout our remarks, all of this incremental opportunity is digital, which should allow us to continue to grow our margin as we did and we set record margins last year. So we should be able to build upon that.
From a phasing point of view, you see our Q1 guide is obviously extremely strong. And we expect that to continue into Q2. Our Q2 will probably be roughly in the same range as Q1. And that's a little bit of a tough comp versus last year when Warzone launched and some of the earliest shelter-at-home trends hit. But then you should see pretty natural phasing, as you'd expect in the back half of the year.
And then we'll have very strong momentum as you pivot and we pivot to looking at 2022. It's obviously early, and we still have work to do, but we have an incredible lineup planned across all platforms. And it should be a great year for each of our business units with Blizzard, in particular, obviously, driving significant financial growth. 
I suggest, obviously, we try to model the business prudently. But when you think about the ramp-up that we have with multiple bets in mobile and the 3 franchises that we have operating at scale. And the opportunity to bring maybe a fourth and a fifth franchise to that, we can have a meaningful step change in our earnings power over the next couple of years.
So obviously, we feel great about the trajectory for not only this year, but next year and beyond. And the opportunity is sizable, and we're just very focused on execution so we can realize that potential."

So in Q4, Candy Crush Saga posted it",509,"Thanks for the question. This is Humam. So look, 2020 was a remarkable year for King. Earlier in the year, we saw the highest daily game rounds across our network ever. And then we closed the year out in real strength. So in Q4, Candy Crush Saga posted its highest revenue days, and we had the strongest quarter since 2014. And then across all of King, our revenues grew 7% sequentially and 14% year-on-year. So we're really pleased with the momentum and trajectory as we enter into 2021.
Now let me talk a little bit about what drove that performance. In Candy Crush, we accelerated the pace of content and feature delivery in 2020. And again, to echo everybody's thoughts, amazing execution from the teams under very difficult circumstances. But we've also invested in deeper product road maps in the Candy franchise. And so we had more structure around seasonal events and a lot more integrated player-facing programming, and that seems to resonate quite well.
We saw the benefit of this as we saw more player investment trends. So the payers in Candy were up year-over-year in Q4. But broadly, we also started increasing frequency and high-impact events and live ops in our other titles in the portfolio. And that led Farm Heroes and Bubble Witch to grow year-over-year for the second quarter in a row in Q4. And so we like the momentum in that as well.
So as I look ahead in 2021, our live business has got really good momentum, and we want to continue to add to that. We think we have a good formula, and we're going to continue to improve it. So we'll continue to bring a fresh slate of content and events to our players. And then we're going to complement that with big feature innovation, including more collaborative and competitive social features especially in Candy. And we've seen that when we have that social connection in our games, it correlates with player engagement and player investment.
So let me give you a quick example here. We're creating more modes in the game so that it brings more players and teams together to experience the game at the same time. We're also finding ways to connect those players with each other in large audience network that's getting hand.
Now if that's the momentum we're driving in the live games, what we have in '21 is we're gearing up for a game launch later in this quarter. So we're hard at work, bringing cash crash on the run to our mobile audiences next month. We're super excited about working on this very iconic IP and we've chosen the runner genre, which is a very attractive category in mobile because it comes with largest volumes historically and has the potential for mass reach.
So we'll bring this amazing mobile title to our crash plan, but we equally are focused on broadening the franchise's audience in mobile. So when I put all those together, I feel pretty good about the momentum in '21 and beyond."

And we have a great community event on February 19 and 20, and we'll share some of the plans that we have and the things we're working on, I think that should be really excited about. The company has accomplished a lot in the last 30 years. And when I think about our near and long-term development pipelines, when you look at just the Warcraft franchise alone, there are hundreds of millions of players around the world who have either played or interactive with Warcraft through different games or different expressions in that universe. And when we bring those experiences to players, we think that there's a lot of potential far beyond where we are today, especially if we get these games right.
The same is true for our other franchises. And so if we look at the near term for Diablo as an example, we have the AAA, Diablo IV that's in development, as well as a free-to-play mobile expression in the Diablo Immortal. Both teams have continued to make great progress. Overwatch 2 is another great example. We've successfully passed a major internal milestone in December, and that involved testing many key features of the game with hundreds of developers across Blizzard. And so we're happy with how that game is progressing.
So doing and achieving all these aspirations takes the right kind of talent as you brought up. And so we're continuing to grow and lean in all the teams and we have plans to hire more developers going forward. One of the competitive advantages that we have at Blizzard is the ability to really focus talent and bring talent from one game to another internally. That's something that served us really well in the past.
And I think the last note that's important to bring up is our aspiration to bring games and players around the world across different platforms and genres. We're always going to be led by gameplay and quality, but our goal is to give the teams everything that they need in order to make the best possible experience as strong players."

So look, the ads business is entering '21 with incredible momentum, particularly in our direct sales part of the business, which grew more than 80% from last -- or grew 80% last year.
So I'll touch on some of the specific initiatives that drove that performance because I really believe that those are also the levers that will move the business forward in '21 and beyond. What we saw is that the team executed really well in deepening our product offering around the, what we call the platform brand-safe proposition. When we -- it allowed us to specifically focus our offering on large-scale brands.
All this was in the context of building a product that was very compatible with the player experience. And so we think that's working really well. It worked in 2020, and we continue to look forward in '21. And alongside of that, we grew the direct sales team and growing the sales team allowed us to broaden our coverage to reach new brands.
And then we started seeing those 2 things come together and really give us a great result. So as one example, we worked with Sky in the United Kingdom to design alongside of them and execute an ad campaign that leverage that rewarded video product that we have, and it created a really engaging gamified ad experience that really drove results for kind of the advertisers.
So the campaign that I'm referring to drove an 8-point uplift in ad recall and a 6-point uplift in pair association to the Sky brand messaging. So we continue to drive that forward.
And as you alluded to, we're also preparing for the IDFA changes in the industry with initiatives underway kind of just specifically addressing that. I think our current momentum and the direct sales momentum, that we have, gives us confidence in the growth trajectory of our ad business overall, even with taking IDFA in context.
So this year, what I see ahead of us is further product innovations that are already underway and further ramping up of the direct sales resources, and both of which should enable us to reach more brands and provide more experiences.
And more broadly, we think that there's expansion even beyond there. So as I look at more titles available to repeat what we did with Candy and our other King titles, we have other launches across the company that we can look into integrating that experience and broaden the overall network. So all these opportunities ahead of us and the scale of the player network gives us a really good kind of momentum, and we feel pretty good about where the business is headed."

The 2 communities are really different in the engage in different ways. But we think they have the same love of the game world. And they have a unified subscription, which is virtuous to both communities. The release of Shadowlands and the work-from-home environment is a huge point of pride for us. I think the expansion turned out great, and it's got content for players of all kinds to really engage with.
The metrics that we traditionally track and -- for an expansion's release have been quite successful. Life to date, on Shadowlands, it's actually the highest of any expansion in the last 10 years. We also see significantly more player engagement than we typically see at this stage. And that momentum has continued through January with the player base, so significantly larger than it was a year ago. So while classic, the community continues to be highly engaged and it's a global community. Since the launch, classic has really given players who love the game, a way to experience as or up in the community, the way they experienced it for the very first time. And as a result, the overall World of Warcraft is a significantly larger player base, which provides us with a lot of opportunities.
Looking ahead, we have plans to continue serving both those communities in creative ways and allow players to continue to explore classic round nostalgia in ways that feel great. We'll have more to share about the various content updates for a while shortly, but we do see WoW as a significant growth driver for Blizzard overall this year."

Look, I'd say, overall, we see a ton of opportunity ahead on mobile. I think it's really important for us to step back and look at the fact that quality mobile in the West has only been live for about actually a little less than 1.5 years. And in that time period, we shared this data, but we quickly scaled over 300 million downloads and Daniel had also mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we delivered our best quarter yet. And obviously, a clear sign that our teams focus on gameplay, new seasonal content and just driving engagement overall is driving strong results for us. But this is certainly just a point in time. And when you step back and look at the biggest games in the West, they continue to scale at the 3-year mark and well beyond in many cases. So we believe we have a lot of headroom in regions around the world to grow this business.
And the beauty of COD Mobile that allows us to reach new players in markets where console and PC may not be as well developed. And we've seen tens of millions of new players in regions like Latin America, India and beyond, where we're seeing potential for a lot more upside.
And looking ahead for this global community, of course, we're going to take our endgame seasons and content in advance to another level for our community. And I also see a lot of opportunity press at the local market level to drive local initiatives to make Call of Duty even more relevant in those local markets.
And I want to go back and mention one another thing, which I think I mentioned on a previous call, which is it's really important to note that all of this right now is accretive to our overall franchise success. When we look at registered players who play both on mobile and on console or PC, these players show significantly higher engagement and player investment than other groups. And so again, it's just proof that I think the ecosystem is working really, really well together.
Now you also asked about the recent release in China by Tencent, and it is early, right? But the game is off to a great start. We've seen tens of millions of downloads in the first month, a lot of good reception early on. And we do think this is going to be a meaningful contributor to our overall mobile results as we move forward. 
And as I step back, I'm just really excited about our ability to now grow our brand further on a global basis by being in such a massive, massive market. And so what I -- the way I'd sum it up is that it's been a great start on mobile, but it's just that. It's a great start. Mobile is a critical long-term growth driver for Activision. And we are definitely taking a long-term view of the platform and the opportunity.
We're hiring aggressively to make sure we're well positioned to create the best possible mobile experiences for our community and I think importantly, as we project even further out, making sure we have the ability to expand to mobile, the very best of what's working in the quality ecosystem, which I think presents yet another layer of opportunity for us in the years ahead. Thanks for the question."

For more than a year now, amid very challenging conditions, the teams at Activision Blizzard have played an important role and supporting and serving our community of 400 million players in 190 cou",957,"Thank you, Chris, and thank you all for joining us today. For more than a year now, amid very challenging conditions, the teams at Activision Blizzard have played an important role and supporting and serving our community of 400 million players in 190 countries. 
Our teams have kept players connected using our platform to comfort, inspire and draw people together. Their hard work and dedication enabled us to deliver significantly better-than-expected first quarter results. First quarter net bookings increased year-over-year by 36% and to $2.1 billion. Non-GAAP operating income grew 38% and non-GAAP earnings per share increased by 29%. 
Year-over-year performance was driven by our 3 largest franchises: Call of Duty, Warcraft and Candy Crush, with each delivering strong double-digit growth in net bookings. This over performance was well ahead of our expectations and confirms that our multiyear franchise strategy and continued execution is delivering value to our shareholders. 
With momentum continuing across our business, we're raising our financial outlook for the year. In the last 20 years, we've delivered 21% compound rates of return as compared to the S&P 500, which delivered 8% compounded rates of return. $1,000 invested in Activision in 2001 would be worth over $45,000 today as compared to $4,900 in the S&P 500. This performance is possible because of our deep library of franchises. 
We own some of the most enduring and popular global entertainment franchises, supported by the very best creative teams in our industry. Our strategy centers around our long-held view that wholly-owned entertainment franchises offer the opportunity for limitless innovation. We continue to increase investment in creative and commercial resources for our franchises and potential new franchises to deliver new compelling experiences for players and superior financial returns for our shareholders. With free-to-play entry points across mobile, PC and console, call of Duty experienced an increase of over 100 million players in a little over a year. 
Call of Duty is the template we're applying to our proven franchises as well as our new potential franchises as we attempt to grow our audiences to 1 billion players. Our increase in live operations is reflected in last quarter's results and our forward outlook as we've seen our business shift from a seasonal focus with a holiday emphasis, to an always-on business model with far less seasonality. This quarter also marked the 5-year anniversary of our acquisition of King and the Candy Crush franchise. With the Candy Crush team delivering more year-round content to over 200 million monthly players King's business is delivering excellent results. Segment revenue grew over 20% year-over-year to reach  new record in the first quarter. 
It's especially noteworthy that of the top 10 mobile franchises worldwide, at the time we announced the acquisition of King, no other game has grown in-app revenues over the period or matched Kandy's compound growth rate. King's advertising business continues to deliver spectacular results, too, with revenue growing 70% year-over-year in the first quarter. 
As we look ahead, demand for our content has never been stronger. We continue to ramp our investment in creative and development talent, especially with increased competition from Chinese companies and platform providers, and this will allow us to better serve our players. From the start of 2020 through the end of next year, we intend to hire more than 2,000 developers. We plan to triple the size of certain franchise teams compared to those team sizes in 2019. 
And we have aggressive hiring plans around the world, including new studios or major expansion in Poland, China, Australia and Canada. And as our shareholders expect, we remain laser-focused on finding and retaining the best talent in the industry and always aligning performance and reward. 
From the extensive shareholder outreach we conducted this past year, reaching well over 60% of our shareholders, we are pleased that our company-wide pay-for-performance compensation philosophy and ESG initiatives are aligned with the expectations of our shareholders. 
This quarter, we'll release our first ESG report, highlighting our commitment to the environment, human capital management, social good, the very best governance practices and their direct connection to the creation of shareholder value. While the report is new, our commitment to these practices and shareholder value creation is not. 
In particular, we've long appreciated that the creation of broadly appealing games requires diverse views, diverse voices and diverse skills and an environment that fosters inclusion. And importantly, our ESG report will include our commitments to help ensure that our scale serves our players, our employees, our communities and especially our shareholders and that those commitments are embedded into and across our business. 
Also in the service of our shareholders, I'm pleased to introduce Armin Zerza as our new Chief Financial Officer. Arman's deep experience as a global finance and operations executive and his contributions as Chief Operating Officer of Blizzard; and Chief Commercial Officer of the company, make him especially well suited to serve as our next CFO. In his 6 years with the company, Armon has been a central figure in the company's continued growth and record financial results. He has the commitment to profitable growth and operational excellence that our shareholders have always recognized us for. And Arman comes to the role with an incredible team assembled by Dennis and Thomas over the last decade. 
Dennis has been a key contributor in some of the most value-creating moments of our history, including the buyback of Control from Vivendi in 2013 and our expansion into mobile through the acquisition of King. Dennis' contributions have meaningfully shaped our culture, leaving the company in a much stronger position than when he joined 10 years ago. 
Dennis, on behalf of Brian, Thomas and our Board of Directors. I thank you for your friendship, your partnership and your leadership."

I will certainly miss our partnership, although I am thrilled to continue my close working relationship with Armin in his new role. 
As you've just heard, Activision Blizzard significantly exceeded its prior outlook for the first quarter. Delivering very strong growth across our largest franchises. These results confirm that our strategy is working, creating new experiences for our franchises across platforms, alongside engagement and player investment opportunities that appeal to the broadest audience. 
It is incredible to see with the backdrop of ongoing challenges from working from home, our teams have risen to the occasion and they really continue to deliver exceptional results. Our increased investments in our largest franchises are enabling us to connect and engage people in more ways than ever before. Shelter from home has accelerated a trend we have been seeing where consumers around the world are turning to gaming for entertainment, connection and community. 
Our successful growth initiatives in our largest franchises, vibrant and active communities and our strong pipeline position us to continue driving strong results this year as regions start to reopen. Aligned with our overall strategy, we also continue to enhance our battle net platform as we build on our direct digital relationship with our players. 
In the first quarter, we rolled out the biggest front end upgrade to Battle.net in years, delivering improved navigation, enhanced social features and a rich storefront contributing to strong year-over-year growth in sales per visitor to the platform in the quarter. 
And as we look into 2022 and beyond, our teams continue to make great progress on a pipeline that includes Diablo IV and Overwatch 2 for over watch 2 and multiple World craft mobile titles, which we expect to deliver substantial growth for the company. Now turning to our franchise and operational highlights across our business units. Starting with activision, which had a record 150 million monthly active users in Q1. Our call of Duty free-to-play war zone and mobile experiences have transformed the franchise more than tripling the number of monthly players over the last 2 years and adding over $1 billion of operating income to Activision segment results last year. The franchise once again delivered fantastic year-over-year growth in reach, engagement and player investment in the first quarter. MoUs increased sequentially and grew over 40% year-over-year, both on console PC and mobile. 
Time spent grew even faster year-over-year, again, to a new quarterly record for the franchise. Now moving to console in PC. Since we integrated warzone with Black ops Cold war in December, we have continued to see a strong conversion to the premium game. 
Q1 premium sales were well above the levels typically seen in the first quarter and in-game player investment trends similarly remain robust. In-game net bookings on console and PC grew more than 60% year-over-year in the first quarter. And the first 2 seasons of Black Ops Cold War and Wars on content were both in the top 3 seasons in Call of Duty history for in-game net bookings. 
And season three, which launched just 2 weeks ago, alongside a major refresh of the Wars and Experience is sustaining this strong run rate. Fracking a line with the first 2 seasons. 
On mobile, Call of Duty Mobile saw strong year-over-year growth in reach, engagement and player investment in the first quarter, benefiting from the team's ongoing enhancements to the game in the West and the launch of the title in China. The team continues to make great progress optimizing the game in the West with the March season concluding as the highest for player investment yet. 
And momentum has continued into the second quarter with the April season, now the top grossing to date at this point after launch. And in China, call of Duty Mobile brought tens of millions of new players to the franchise following its launch in late December. Player investment in China in the first quarter was on par with the rest of the world combined. 
Similar to the western launch 18 months ago, the team is now focused on refining gameplay and content for local tastes to build durable engagement and monetization in 2021 and beyond. With the 2021 season of Call of Duty League, also off to a great start, enjoying strong year-over-year growth in average minute audience through the first 2 stages of competition, it is clear that there is ongoing momentum across the entire franchise. 
And there is so much more to come for call of Duty. We continue to invest to grow our creative teams, successfully adding hundreds of developers to the franchise in the last year, and enabling us to deliver even more compelling experiences in coming quarters. And in particular, we are very excited for this year's premium Call of Duty release. Development is being led by Sledgehammer games and the game is looking great and on track for its fall release. This is a build for next-generation experience with stunning visuals across campaign, multiplayer and cooperative modes of play. Designed to both integrate with and enhance the existing COD ecosystem. We look forward to sharing more details with the community soon. 
Now turning to Blizzard where the teams continue to make great progress on rich pipeline of premium releases and extending key franchises to mobile. MAUs were $27 million. In the Warcraft franchise, the World of Warcraft shadowlands expansion continued to drive strong results following its record-setting release in November, with wow net bookings growing sharply year-over-year. 
Shadowlands is building on the momentum seen since the 2019 introduction of classic drove a substantial increase in scale and an enhanced financial trajectory for a while. The team's work to deliver a high-quality expansion is being recognized by the community. First quarter reach was sustained at a higher rate than we typically see following expansion launches accompanied by deep engagement. 
And Blizzard saw particularly high number of new players joining the WOW community in the quarter, boosted by its initiatives to enhance the onboarding experience. And will the warcraft also saw strong participation in value-added services, further bolstering year-over-year growth in net bookings. Blizzard is building on this momentum with further content for the modern game and the upcoming introduction of the burning Crusade, the expansion first launched in 2007 to wow classic. 
The Burning Crusade was critically acclaimed at launch, and we expect the upcoming release to more deeply engage current subscribers, bring back lapsed classic fans and also bring entirely new players into wild classic. With the expanded development team executing well against a strong pipeline, WoW remains positioned for much stronger annual financial performance and is typical outside of a modern expansion year. 
Now staying within the Warcraft universe, Heartstone is seeing encouraging trends as the team executes on a strong pipeline of new in game content, features and game modes. Hearthstone's latest expansion Forged in the Barons was released at the end of the first quarter with a game on track to deliver expansion over expansion, net bookings growth for a second consecutive release and Blizzard expects to sustain this trajectory with more new content including mercenaries, an innovative new mode in the popular role-playing genre planned for the coming months. 
And the Diablo franchise is nearing the start of its reincarnation. Blizzard announced the launch later this year of Diablo II Resurrected, the return of one of the most acclaimed titles in PC gaming history. The game received very positive feedback during early testing in April. An online viewership of the alpha test was the highest Blizzard has ever seen for a game test, illustrating the community's anticipation for this release. 
On  mobile, after highly successful regional testing last December, Diablo Immortal has just entered its second phase of testing and is on track for global release later this year. We expect Diablo Immortal to broaden Diablo's reach ahead of the launch of Diablo IV on PC and console. Diablo 4 development is progressing very well. With a significant expanded team focused on not only launching an epic new experience, but also following this up with robust in-game content to sustain community. 
In Overwatch, the team is making good progress on Overwatch 2 and is looking forward to sharing more frequent updates with the community in the near future. April saw fans around the world returned to celebrate our players and city-based teams in the opening weekend of the 2021 season of the Overwatch League. The league also signed a multiyear partnership with Billy Billy Esports for exclusive rights to broadcast lead games to the platform's passionate and growing Overwatch league fan base in China. 
Now turning to King, which continued to benefit from strong execution on growth initiatives in the first quarter. MAUs were $258 million, exhibiting better seasonality than we typically see following the fourth quarter, led by its most important franchise, Candy Crush. For a number of quarters, King has been pursuing initiatives to broaden the payer base, deliver more frequent seasonal events and introduce compelling new features into Candy Crush as well as portfolio titles. This work again delivered excellent results in Q1 with in-game net bookings growing high teens year-over-year and accelerating further relative to Q4. 
Candy Crush grew in-game net bookings very strongly year-over-year and was once again the top grossing gaming franchise in the U.S. App store. Farm Heroes, King's second largest franchise also grew sharply year-over-year. King built on the strength to increase investment in growing the Candy and Farm audiences in key regions. 
We expect the ROI positive investment to contribute to King's operating income performance in the coming quarters. As King continues to execute against this strategy, in-game net bookings have remained strong into the second quarter, continuing to grow well year-over-year in April, even against tough comparables from the start of lockdown in the year ago quarter. 
Late in Q1, King launched Crash Bandicoot On the Run, a new mobile title based on the beloved activision franchise. The game has been downloaded over 30 million times to date, and the team is now focused on optimizing the game for retention and engagement. That said, we continue to assume limited contribution for the game in our full year outlook. 
Along with the strong performance for in app purchases, King again delivered significant growth in advertising across both direct and partner sales channels. As the mobile advertising backdrop continues to evolve, the team is expanding its partner network, and it's growing its direct sales force, building advertiser awareness for its differentiated, brand-safe platform and positioning the business for ongoing growth throughout the year. 
In summary, we are executing well against our strategy. While the business is delivering strong results, we believe we are only at the beginning of unlocking the full potential of our portfolio. And we look forward to demonstrating further progress against this potential in the coming quarters and beyond. 
Now I will hand over to Armin, who will provide more color on our financial results. Armin?"

He has been a fantastic mentor and partner over the years, and I wish him all the best for the future.",1194,"Thanks, Daniel. I'm glad to be with you all for my first earnings call as CFO, and would like to echo Bobby's and Daniel's comments in thanking Dennis. He has been a fantastic mentor and partner over the years, and I wish him all the best for the future. Now let me review our record first quarter results as well as outlook for 2021 and the second quarter. 
Our first quarter revenue and earnings per share we're well ahead of our prior outlook, driven by better-than-expected performance for Call of Duty and Candy Crush. Net bookings grew 36% year-over-year to $2.07 billion, and segment operating income grew 59% to $853 million. Total segment operating margin expanded 6 percentage points year-over-year reflecting the high incremental margins associated with digital revenue streams. Now let me turn to our segment results. Each of Activision Blizzard and King contributed to top and bottom line growth in the quarter. Activision revenue was $891 million, growing 72% year-over-year. 
Growth was driven by Call of Duty Black of hardware and [indiscernible] in-game revenues, premium sales and Call of Duty Mobile. Operating income more than doubled year-over-year to $442 million with an operating margin of 50%, 14 percentage points higher year-over-year. 
Blizzard revenue was $483 million, increasing 7% year-over-year with very strong growth for World of world class, partially offset by product timing. Operating income was $208 million and business operating margin was 43%, probably consistent year-over-year. 
King revenue grew 22% year-over-year to $609 million. This is a new record, led by strong Indian revenue growth for Candy Crush. And advertising revenue grew 70% year-over-year. Operating income was $203 million, growing 30% year-over-year, even after increased investment in user acquisition. And King's operating margin was 33%, 2 percentage points higher year-over-year. 
Finally, across our segments, Indian net bookings grew 40% year-over-year to $1.34 billion, representing 65% of overall net bookings with each of Activision Blizzard and King contributing to the strong performance. 
Okay. Now I'll turn to our overall consolidated results. And unless otherwise indicated, I'll be referencing non-GAAP figures. As always, please refer to our earnings release for a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. Now for the quarter, we generated quarter 1 GAAP revenues of $2.28, $260 million above our February outlook. This includes the net recognition of deferrals of $209 million, and net bookings of $2.07 billion were $316 million above our outlook, and we generated this GAAP EPS of $0.79 and quarter 1 non-GAAP EPS of $0.98, which was $0.14 above our February outlook. 
These figures include the net recognition of deferrals of $0.14. Now turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Our strong business fundamentals also drove substantial cash flow generation in the quarter. We delivered operating cash flow of $844 million significantly higher year-over-year, reflecting higher operating income, tax settlements in the year ago quarter and changes in working capital. Our cash and investments at the end of March were approximately $9.5 billion, and we ended the quarter with a net cash position of approximately $5.9 billion. And as previously announced this week will pan annual dividend of $0.47 per share, 15% higher year-over-year. 
Now let me turn to our outlook for quarter 2 and the full year. Regarding the fleet, our expanded teams are focused on delivering epic in-game and upfront content. This means that we'll continue to support our franchisees with new Indian content, events and features all of which are critical elements of our business as we focus on keeping our communities engaged and drive year-round player investment. In terms of upfront releases, we will release while burning Costas classics in the coming months, and we are looking forward to launching gable to retirees and the latest premium release of colorful in the second half of the year. 
And on Mobile, we continue to plan for the launch of a model in the second half. Although as is customary, we do not include meaningful contribution from new mobile launches in our outlook. Now before I discuss the specifics of our outlook, let me provide some context. 
The year is off to a very strong start. Our growth initiative continues to deliver great results in the first quarter, and our momentum has continued across all of our key franchises into the second quarter. Competition for cement remains high. And in this  context, we have been increasing our investment in creative and commercial talent to deliver even more compelling experiences across our portfolio through the remainder of the year. As a result, we feel great about our ability to continue Lighting and engaging our communities. So while this is still early in the year, and we remain prudent in our assumptions, we are raising our outlook for full year net bookings and earnings per share. 
From a phasing perspective, as discussed on the last earnings call, core FTE base is a difficult year-over-year comparison in Q2. Since premium cars a year ago benefited from the launch of Watson, product timing and the introduction of Salteron Home mandate. We also intend to take advantage of our strong business momentum to increase marketing around new content in Q2. We, therefore, continue to expect total segment operating profit to be lower year-over-year in the second quarter, with stronger year-over-year performance in the second half of the year as we delivered against our second half pipeline. 
Now let me get into the specifics. For quarter 2, on a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $2.14 billion, including the net recognition of deferrals of $285 million. We expect net bookings of $1.85 billion. We expect a GAAP operating margin of 39%, a tax rate of 21%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of $785 million and EPS of $0.81. For quarter 2 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect a tax rate of 18% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.91, including a net recognition of the $0.21. 
Now turning to the fiscal on a GAAP basis for 2021, we now expect revenues of $8.37 billion, including net deferrals of $230 million. We now expect net bookings of $8.6 billion. We expect a GAAP operating margin of 36%, a GAAP tax rate of 22%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of $787 million and GAAP EPS of $2.91. For 2021 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect a tax rate of 20% and non-GAAP EPS of $3.42, including net net deferral decent $0.28. 
So to close, in Q1, we continued to deliver strong results across our largest franchises, and our momentum has continued into Q2. We are making great progress on our pipeline, which includes key content that we expect to deliver another step change in financial performance in 2022 as well as unannounced initiatives that we expect to drive longer-term growth for the company. 
We have a combination of leading owned franchises, best-in-class developer and commercial talent and expertise across platforms and business models, all of which create a powerful platform for sustained financial performance. We remain focused on execution and operational discipline and committed to profitable growth to drive shareholder value over the long term. 
Now I'll ask our business leaders, Rob Humanin to join Bobby Dennean and myself to answer your questions. Operator?"

It's great to see people out and about and obviously healthy. When we've been looking at engagement trends very, very closely. And as you'd probably expect, the trends vary between the franchises, depending on the nature of the audience and also the type of the game. Now we do see some variation between regions that are reopening versus those that are locking back down. But overall, as we continue to execute against our strategy, we really continue to see strong engagement across each of our largest franchises. And importantly, player investment really remains very consistent across regions. And that's important to note. I'd reiterate that while we have seen some benefit from sheltering from the home similar to the rest of the gaming industry, we do believe that much of the expansion that we've seen in our latest -- the largest franchises is due to product initiatives that we've implemented, be it the launch of War Zone and Call of Duty Mobile or the introduction of Classic and a great low expansion in channel lands or our work to grow the payer base and deliver more frequent compelling content in Candy. And I think some of the comments you heard today support that in terms of how April went for us even as some of the regions have continued to open. For instance, Call of Duty Season 3 is on a similarly strong trajectory as we've seen for season 1 and season 2. The current season of Call of Duty Mobile is tracking as the best yet in terms of player investment in the West. And World of Warcraft is performing very well, with strong engagement ahead of the upcoming launch of Burning Forsade classic and Centigrade. Candy is continuing to grow year-over-year against really tough comps. So these trends really do show our ability to build on the expansion that we've already seen in some of our franchises even as regions reopen. And as we look forward, we see a long-term trend of more people gaming than ever before in more geographies and on more platforms. And that's been going on for a decade. And we only see that continuing with gaming becoming an even more significant form of social connection and obviously, entertainment. So it's great to see so many people being vaccinated around the world. And some regions reopening. And we're encouraged by the fact that we're seeing engagement as economies reopen. But as ever, we remain prudent in our outlook. And I appreciate your question. Hopefully, that answers it."

I'll take this one. But I guess before I get into those questions directly, I do think it's worth stepping back and noting some of the incredible milestones we've hit across the Call of Duty ecosystem, which has always been focused on building more holistically. Warzone, which you've probably seen, which has obviously been transformational for our business in so many ways, has now crossed 100 million players. Our premium Call of Duty games have now sold over 400 million copies life-to-date on the franchise. And Colony Mobile has now crossed over 500 million downloads. So remarkably, after all these years, the franchise has never been stronger or more widely played. And for that, we are just super thankful for the community's ongoing support, and we are more committed than ever to provide them with the best possible experiences in the years that lie ahead. Now with respect to the integration of Warzone and Black Ops, we're really pleased with the integration. You've heard some of the financial results already on the call. Season 3 has maintained the great momentum of Seasons 1 and 2. And we look at even other factors, Season 3 set a new viewership record for us at reveal with over 2 million streaming viewers, and this is higher than even Warzone's launch in March of last year, and this just continues to demonstrate the strength of our direct connection we have with our players. And with all that said, we still truly fundamentally believe we are just scratching the surface of what Warzone can expand into for the community. And that's the exciting part. And thanks to our world-class development and publishing teams, we certainly believe the future of Warzone has never looked better. 
Now as we look ahead for Warzone later this year, there'll be some other really fun integrations with the great work that Sledgehammer games is leading for this year's new premium release. And Daniel mentioned this already. It's worth noting that sledge as a studio now is also stronger than ever. The studio has expanded its very talented team across its foster City and Melbourne locations and now is even expanding further with [indiscernible] in Toronto. 
Most importantly, at the end of the day, we believe sands are going to be really, really excited and I going to love with the studio is building. That's what it's all about in this business, and we can't wait to share more on this front. And finally, back to just your question on mobile. We talked about a lot of the data, I think, on the call a little bit, but mobile is live in China, as you know, doing very well. The West continues to perform very strongly. And globally today, Call of Duty Mobile has now crossed over $1 billion in player investment in addition to the over 500 million downloads around the world. The current season as referenced, Tokyo Escape. It's tracking to the -- as the highest grossing to date. So what I would say is, overall, our teams are just continuing to execute really well across the east and the west, and we continue to see really strong opportunities in all regions and we remain very, very excited for the future of this platform and the broader quality of ecosystem. Thank you for the question."

And then if you could talk a little bit more about what else might be in the pipeline, that would be great. Her, this is Jay. Thanks for the question. When we look at the sort of the Blizzard development population, we've added hundreds of developers across our key franchises over the last few years. And we continue to invest in world class development, working to bring talent in from all around the globe. And the goal here is to execute on the plans that we have to create continuous content for players across all of our games. Speaking of Overwatch 2. We've got some great feedback from the player community around the development progress that we showcased in February at Blossom line. And we feel really confident in both the game and the team, and they're going to continue to share updates about Overwatch 2 progress, new features in a live game going forward. With Diablo, there's a lot of strong momentum right now. We have public testing that's taken place in both April and May for both Mortal and Diablo Resurrected -- Diablo II Resurrected rather. And we also have a lot of community interest around the development of Diablo IV, as you. We're also continuing to make progress across multiple mobile titles that we've alluded to in the past. We really want to bring authentic Blizzard quality experiences to all the games that we have. And so for us, it's a pretty exciting time as we continue to work on PC, console and mobile expressions of all of our franchises.

This is Humam. So as you noted, Q1 was a great quarter for King. We marked the 5-year anniversary of Kings acquisition, and we did that with record financial performance across the business, including our best revenue quarter ever. Now as you've heard, we have momentum across both our in-game and advertising sides of the business, and we expect that momentum to continue. So on IDSA, I believe we're very well equipped as the industry navigates those IDFA changes. And we're equipped on both the advertising side and also on the user acquisition side. So let me give you a little bit of color on each of those on the advertising side, with our Q1 exit trajectory and including kind of the continued momentum we see in our direct business. That positions us well as we navigate those advertising changes. And as we look ahead, we are adding to that momentum with initiatives underway along some examples in product innovation, where we're expanding kind of the number of ad products that we have in our network. We're expanding our partner network and our direct sales force. And we're broadening the categories of the advertisers that we work with. And so when you put all those together, we believe we still have a long runway for growth in the advertising side. And we're constantly bringing in new brands, I should say, as we develop deeper and deeper relationships with brands across the category. As just one example of the United Kingdom, we worked with Sky across 3 parts -- 3 different areas of their business in Q1, and we're able to drive significant improvement in their brand metrics across, we call consideration and association of their plan. So with all of that, we continue to believe that there is a good trajectory there as we -- as the industry navigates with IDO. Now I'd like to turn on the other side, which is our user acquisition, we have strong momentum in our business. And we continue to leverage the strength of our brand as we invest in our live ops, and we invest also in ROI positive marketing to deliver new installs and bring back returning players. So more broadly, we -- as we put more live events like Candy Crush All Stars. And as we add more social features, as an example, the March launch of our competitive mode in Candy Soda, we are bringing more exciting moments that help us on that user acquisition. So all in all, current momentum is really good, as you saw, and we expect that momentum to continue and have confidence in our ability to deliver that over the next few quarters."

So what you should expect from me is a focus on a few key areas. Look, it all starts with a focus on shareholder value creation. This has always been a focus for the company and frankly, we have never been better positioned. As you have heard today, all of our franchisees have incredible potential. So I'm very focused on working with the teams to price is investments and resources towards our biggest value creation opportunities. Next, as I mentioned, expect a very strong focus from me on execution excellence, both critically and commercially. And in that context, I do believe that the CFO has an important role to play in not just overseeing the achievement of our financial target, but also the progress against our operating and commercial plan. So if you expect me to leverage my experiences as Chief Commercial Officer of the company and Chief Operating Officer of Blizzard to help make sure that all of our franchisees are set up for success. And then, of course, you should expect continued focus around financial discipline and organizational excellence. Ultimately, our culture is centered around growth operational discipline and financial conservatism, and that won't change. So from an organizational perspective, finally, I continue to be focused on building the world-class team in order to support our growth plans that we have discussed today. So I hope that gives you a sense of I'm approaching the role. But really, really, what I'm looking forward to is getting out there and meeting all of you in the coming months."

When we think and look at Diablo, we've got 3 upcoming releases that we expect to really expand the audience and really delight the community and exceed their expectations. So Diablo 2 Resurrected is bringing -- we think of it as really a true classic in gaming into the modern gaming world for both new fans and that and fans that really are going to come back and play it again. 
Diablo Immortal, the point there or the goal there is to broaden the audience, bring an authentic version of Diablo to mobile. 
And then with the Diablo 4, that's going to be our next mainline title. That we feel is going to advance the art of the action RPG genre. And so it's really never been a better time in the history of Diablo to be a Diablo fan. We've seen positive reception to the development progress that we shared this year for Diablo IV. We announced the new class, the Rogue, at Blizzcon line, and the team is continuing to progress through important internal development milestones. With Diablo Immortal, it's currently in the second phase of testing. We've introduced another new class. We've introduced new zones, and we've also introduced first time to the for tie public, the high end in-game and PVP content. And we've seen the community respond pretty positively thus far, particularly around the systems design, and we're looking forward to more of their feedback as testing continues. On top of being an authentic diablo experience on mobile, Immortal is also bridging a narrative gap between the events of what happened at the end of Diablo II and the start of Diablo 3. And so that's that's bringing additional storytelling into the franchise. And then lastly, Diablo II resurrected recently completed its first public test, and the reception that we received was really great. The original Diablo II is a landmark game in Blizzard's history and that we're really happy that we've been able to kind of reintroduce this experience to new players. And Spark renewed passion and players who really love the original. And so the overall strategy for Diablo is to really provide players with different ways to engage in the franchise on their platform of choice. And we think that this will welcome all kinds of people all around the world into the Diablo player community. Thanks for the question."

First of all, our focus is absolutely ensuring the health and safety of our employees. This means both physical and psychological. And we've been in constant touch with our team managers to ensure that our employees are kept safe and also, if they're able to find the time that they really need to recharge when needed. Early on in the pandemic, Bobby shared his personal telephone number with each and every employee for them to reach out if they needed any help. And I'm personally very proud of our company's response and also just amazed by the talent in our organization who have adapted to so many curveballs that this pandemic has really thrown at people. As for your question on game development, we are fortunate that to date, we really haven't seen any significant impact to game development with our current games and pipeline because we're really meeting our pre COVID milestones. And as we have seen in 2020 and also in early 2021, we've delivered the games that our players have expected and with the quality that really defines our company. And we also have been very fortunate that we haven't had to compromise game scope and our players have, as a result, gotten just the best value for their money. So it's been incredible to see. Now as mentioned in previous earning calls, we have reopened some of our studio capabilities in a limited fashion for areas that really needed it like motion capture, for instance. That was really to ensure that we just stated on top of our milestone. And in each case, we obviously ensured strict adherence to heightened Covid testing and separation protocols that have ensured that our employees were kept save. But having said that, we recognized with our strategy of increasing game content and frequency as well as doubling down on live operations, we must and we have to continue to grow our developer base. And this is why we recently announced, as Bobby alluded to in his opening remarks, the goal to hire 2,000-plus developers over the coming few years. And we're actively hiring around the globe. And we have the benefit of having studios and cities across Asia, Europe and, of course, across the Americas. So our teams are really adept at working across geographies, and you'll see us opening our expanding studios and locations, such as Poland and in Toronto, for instance, to give us access to some of the great pools of talent to really help us deliver on even more content in the years ahead. Thanks again, Andrew."

Thanks, Gerrick. Look, we haven't changed our approach. We have a very strong track record of being balanced and disciplined in how we allocate capital across investing into organic business growth, returning capital to shareholders via buybacks and dividends as well as strategic M&A. And on M&A specifically, we have completed several transactions that have created significant value. As you mentioned, King is a great example of that. We mentioned today that we just celebrated the fifth anniversary of its acquisition which gave us a leadership position in mobile at a valuation that delivers significant value of our shareholders, as you know. Now when we look at the industry today, we do continue to see scale benefits. Look, as you know, we are still only 4% of a very fragmented market, even though we are the leading stand-alone game publisher in the best. But we will and we can afford to be disciplined in our approach around the key criteria, which we believe are essential for value creation through M&A. And on those, we generally look for large established franchises or technologies that have the potential for scale. We also look for strong leadership teams with a strong track record of profitability. And then, of course, we look for an attractive valuation that hits our return thresholds. That's a pretty high bar, and it can be difficult to find the right target that meets this criteria, especially, as we mentioned, with so much capital in the industry right now. But as I mentioned, we can afford to be, and we will stay disciplined, frankly, even more so with the significant organic growth opportunities we have. So we will remain patient for the right opportunity. It's an approach that has served the company well for the last 30 years, and we believe it will serve us well into the future. Again, thanks for your question."

And I'll take the last question, it's Daniel again. Look, we believe our franchises absolutely have to be accessible wherever the players are and that obviously includes mobile, not only in developed countries, but even more so in developing countries. And mobile is just the ultimate driver of reach with almost 3 billion smartphones worldwide. That's forecasted to increase to 4 billion in the next 5 years. We are really doing ourselves and the community a disservice if our games are not on those platforms. So that's why this is so critical to our strategy. And the opportunity is crystal clear. Little known fact is most of the top 10 franchises on mobile worldwide are actually based on existing PC or console IP. And our franchises are in genres that are just particularly well suited for mobile. And they are amongst the few franchises in the industry to really have the appeal around the world including regions where mobile is the main way that people play core games. And as a result, we really want all of our franchises to be on mobile. And in some cases, there might be several different ways in which a franchise can be represented on mobile. You may have reimaginations of an IP on mobile in addition to games that are just more similar to an existing console or a PC experience. And as a core part of our strategy to make our franchise available across platforms, we've done a number of things. So obviously, we acquired King and that brought tremendous mobile talent, which has proven to be the case through continued momentum in that business, exemplified by what you just saw in our Q1 results. And we've also -- as a company, we leveraged the learnings from King across the business: platform engagement, live ops, user acquisition or managing game economies. And across activision and Blizzard, we started with call of Duty Mobile, following up with the Diablo Immortal that Jay was just referring to. And we're also working on a number of mobile titles and have some unannounced initiatives as well underway. So players will increasingly be able to enjoy these franchises they love on console, PC and on the mobile experiences we're building. So as you can tell, this is a real priority for us. A lot of investment. We're hiring hundreds of mobile developers to achieve these targets, and you should continue to see the results of this work in the coming quarters."

For more than a year now, amid very challenging conditions, the teams at Activision Blizzard have played an important role in supporting and serving our community of 400 million players in 190 countries.  
Our teams have kept players connected using our platform to comfort, inspire and draw people together. Their hard work and dedication enabled us to deliver significantly better-than-expected first quarter results. First quarter net bookings increased year-over-year by 36% to $2.1 billion. Non-GAAP operating income grew 38% and non-GAAP earnings per share increased by 29%. 
Year-over-year performance was driven by our 3 largest franchises: Call of Duty, Warcraft and Candy Crush, with each delivering strong double-digit growth in net bookings. This over performance was well ahead of our expectations and confirms that our multiyear franchise strategy and continued execution is delivering value to our shareholders.  
With momentum continuing across our business, we're raising our financial outlook for the year. In the last 20 years, we've delivered 21% compound rates of return as compared to the S&P 500, which delivered 8% compounded rates of return. $1,000 invested in Activision in 2001 would be worth over $45,000 today as compared to $4,900 in the S&P 500. This performance is possible because of our deep library of franchises.  
We own some of the most enduring and popular global entertainment franchises, supported by the very best creative teams in our industry. Our strategy centers around our long-held view that wholly-owned entertainment franchises offer the opportunity for limitless innovation. We continue to increase investment in creative and commercial resources for our franchises and potential new franchises to deliver new compelling experiences for players and superior financial returns for our shareholders. With free-to-play entry points across mobile, PC and console, Call of Duty experienced an increase of over 100 million players in a little over a year.  
Call of Duty is the template we're applying to our proven franchises as well as our new potential franchises as we attempt to grow our audiences to 1 billion players. Our increase in live operations is reflected in last quarter's results and our forward outlook as we've seen our business shift from a seasonal focus with a holiday emphasis, to an always-on business model with far less seasonality. This quarter also marked the 5-year anniversary of our acquisition of King and the Candy Crush franchise. With the Candy Crush team delivering more year-round content to over 200 million monthly players, King's business is delivering excellent results. Segment revenue grew over 20% year-over-year to reach a new record in the first quarter. It's especially noteworthy that of the top 10 mobile franchises worldwide, at the time we announced the acquisition of King, no other game has grown in-app revenues over the period or matched Candy's compound growth rate. King's advertising business continues to deliver spectacular results, too, with revenue growing 70% year-over-year in the first quarter.  
As we look ahead, demand for our content has never been stronger. We continue to ramp our investment in creative and development talent, especially with increased competition from Chinese companies and platform providers, and this will allow us to better serve our players. From the start of 2020 through the end of next year, we intend to hire more than 2,000 developers. We plan to triple the size of certain franchise teams compared to those team sizes in 2019.  
And we have aggressive hiring plans around the world, including new studios or major expansion in Poland, China, Australia and Canada. And as our shareholders expect, we remain laser-focused on finding and retaining the best talent in the industry and always aligning performance and reward. From the extensive shareholder outreach we conducted this past year reaching well over 60% of our shareholders, we are pleased that our company-wide pay-for-performance compensation philosophy and ESG initiatives are aligned with the expectations of our shareholders.  
This quarter, we'll release our first ESG report, highlighting our commitment to the environment, human capital management, social good, the very best governance practices and their direct connection to the creation of shareholder value. While the report is new, our commitment to these practices and shareholder value creation is not. In particular, we've long appreciated that the creation of broadly appealing games requires diverse views, diverse voices and diverse skills and an environment that fosters inclusion. And importantly, our ESG report will include our commitments to help ensure that our scale serves our players, our employees, our communities and especially our shareholders and that those commitments are embedded into and across our business.  
Also in the service of our shareholders, I'm pleased to introduce Armin Zerza as our new Chief Financial Officer. Armin's deep experience as a global finance and operations executive and his contributions as Chief Operating Officer of Blizzard and Chief Commercial Officer of the company, make him especially well suited to serve as our next CFO. In his 6 years with the company, Armin has been a central figure in the company's continued growth and record financial results. He has the commitment to profitable growth and operational excellence that our shareholders have always recognized us for. And Armin comes to the role with an incredible team assembled by Dennis and Thomas over the last decade. Dennis has been a key contributor in some of the most value-creating moments of our history, including the buyback of control from Vivendi in 2013 and our expansion into mobile through the acquisition of King. Dennis' contributions have meaningfully shaped our culture, leaving the company in a much stronger position than when he joined 10 years ago.  
Dennis, on behalf of Brian, Thomas and our Board of Directors, I thank you for your friendship, your partnership and your leadership."

As you've just heard, Activision Blizzard significantly exceeded its prior outlook for the first quarter, delivering very strong growth across our largest franchises. These results confirm that our strategy is working, creating new experiences for our franchises across platforms, alongside engagement and player investment opportunities that appeal to the broadest audience.  
It is incredible to see with the backdrop of ongoing challenges from working from home, our teams have risen to the occasion and they really continue to deliver exceptional results. Our increased investments in our largest franchises are enabling us to connect and engage people in more ways than ever before. Shelter from home has accelerated a trend we have been seeing where consumers around the world are turning to gaming for entertainment, connection and community.  
Our successful growth initiatives in our largest franchises, vibrant and active communities and our strong pipeline position us to continue driving strong results this year as regions start to reopen. Aligned with our overall strategy, we also continue to enhance our Battle.net platform as we build on our direct digital relationship with our players.  
In the first quarter, we rolled out the biggest front end upgrade to Battle.net in years, delivering improved navigation, enhanced social features and a rich storefront contributing to strong year-over-year growth in sales per visitor to the platform in the quarter.  
And as we look into 2022 and beyond, our teams continue to make great progress on a pipeline that includes Diablo IV, Overwatch 2 and multiple Warcraft mobile titles, which we expect to deliver substantial growth for the company. 
Now turning to our franchise and operational highlights across our business units. Starting with Activision, which had a record 150 million monthly active users in Q1. Our Call of Duty free-to-play Warzone and mobile experiences have transformed the franchise more than tripling the number of monthly players over the last 2 years and adding over $1 billion of operating income to Activision segment results last year. The franchise once again delivered fantastic year-over-year growth in reach, engagement and player investment in the first quarter. MAUs increased sequentially and grew over 40% year-over-year, both on console PC and mobile.  
Time spent grew even faster year-over-year, again, to a new quarterly record for the franchise. Now moving to console and PC. Since we integrated Warzone with Black Ops Cold War in December, we have continued to see a strong conversion to the premium game.  
Q1 premium sales were well above the levels typically seen in the first quarter and in-game player investment trends similarly remain robust. In-game net bookings on console and PC grew more than 60% year-over-year in the first quarter. And the first 2 seasons of Black Ops Cold War and Wars content were both in the top 3 seasons in Call of Duty history for in-game net bookings.  
And season 3, which launched just 2 weeks ago, alongside a major refresh of the Warzone experience is sustaining this strong run rate, tracking the line with the first 2 seasons.  
On mobile, Call of Duty Mobile saw strong year-over-year growth in reach, engagement and player investment in the first quarter, benefiting from the team's ongoing enhancements to the game in the West and the launch of the title in China. The team continues to make great progress optimizing the game in the West with the March season concluding as the highest for player investment yet.  
And momentum has continued into the second quarter with the April season now the top grossing to date at this point after launch. And in China, Call of Duty Mobile brought tens of millions of new players to the franchise following its launch in late December. Player investment in China in the first quarter was on par with the rest of the world combined.  
Similar to the western launch 18 months ago, the team is now focused on refining gameplay and content for local tastes to build durable engagement and monetization in 2021 and beyond. With the 2021 season of Call of Duty League also off to a great start, enjoying strong year-over-year growth in average minute audience through the first 2 stages of competition, it is clear that there is ongoing momentum across the entire franchise.  
And there is so much more to come for Call of Duty. We continue to invest to grow our creative teams, successfully adding hundreds of developers to the franchise in the last year, and enabling us to deliver even more compelling experiences in coming quarters. And in particular, we are very excited for this year's premium Call of Duty release. Development is being led by Sledgehammer Games and the game is looking great and on track for its fall release. This is a build for next-generation experience with stunning visuals across campaign, multiplayer and cooperative modes of play designed to both integrate with and enhance the existing COD ecosystem. We look forward to sharing more details with the community soon.  
Now turning to Blizzard where the teams continue to make great progress on rich pipeline of premium releases and extending key franchises to mobile. MAUs were $27 million. In the Warcraft franchise, the World of Warcraft Shadowlands expansion continued to drive strong results following its record-setting release in November, with WoW net bookings growing sharply year-over-year.  
Shadowlands is building on the momentum seen since the 2019 introduction of classic drove a substantial increase in scale and an enhanced financial trajectory for a WoW. The team's work to deliver a high-quality expansion is being recognized by the community. First quarter reach was sustained at a higher rate than we typically see following expansion launches accompanied by deep engagement.  
And Blizzard saw particularly high number of new players joining the WoW community in the quarter, boosted by its initiatives to enhance the onboarding experience. And World of Warcraft also saw strong participation in value-added services, further bolstering year-over-year growth in net bookings. Blizzard is building on this momentum with further content for the modern game and the upcoming introduction of the Burning Crusade, the expansion first launched in 2007 to WoW classic.  
The Burning Crusade was critically acclaimed at launch, and we expect the upcoming release to more deeply engage current subscribers, bring back lapsed classic fans and also bring entirely new players into WoW classic. With the expanded development team executing well against a strong pipeline, WoW remains positioned for much stronger annual financial performance as is typical outside of a modern expansion year.  
Now staying within the Warcraft universe, Hearthstone is seeing encouraging trends as the team executes on a strong pipeline of new in-game content, features and game modes. Hearthstone's latest expansion Forged in the Barrens was released at the end of the first quarter with the game on track to deliver expansion, over expansion, net bookings growth for a second consecutive release. And Blizzard expects to sustain this trajectory with more new content, including Mercenaries, an innovative new mode in the popular role-playing genre planned for the coming months.  
And the Diablo franchise is nearing the start of its reincarnation. Blizzard announced the launch later this year of Diablo II: Resurrected, the return of one of the most acclaimed titles in PC gaming history. The game received very positive feedback during early testing in April. An online viewership of the alpha test was the highest Blizzard has ever seen for a game test, illustrating the community's anticipation for this release.  
On mobile, after highly successful regional testing last December, Diablo Immortal has just entered its second phase of testing and is on track for global release later this year. We expect Diablo Immortal to broaden Diablo's reach ahead of the launch of Diablo IV on PC and console. Diablo IV development is progressing very well, with a significant expanded team focused on not only launching an epic new experience but also following this up with robust in-game content to sustain community.  
In Overwatch, the team is making good progress on Overwatch 2 and is looking forward to sharing more frequent updates with the community in the near future. April saw fans around the world return to celebrate our players and city-based teams in the opening weekend of the 2021 season of the Overwatch League. The league also signed a multiyear partnership with Bilibili eSports for exclusive rights to broadcast lead games to the platform's passionate and growing Overwatch League fan base in China.  
Now turning to King, which continued to benefit from strong execution on growth initiatives in the first quarter. MAUs were $258 million, exhibiting better seasonality than we typically see following the fourth quarter, led by its most important franchise, Candy Crush. For a number of quarters, King has been pursuing initiatives to broaden the payer base, deliver more frequent seasonal events and introduce compelling new features into Candy Crush as well as portfolio titles. This work again delivered excellent results in Q1 with in-game net bookings growing high teens year-over-year and accelerating further relative to Q4. Candy Crush grew in-game net bookings very strongly year-over-year and was once again the top grossing gaming franchise in the U.S. app store. Farm Heroes, King's second largest franchise, also grew sharply year-over-year. King built on the strength to increase investment in growing the Candy and Farm audiences in key regions.  
We expect the ROI positive investment to contribute to King's operating income performance in the coming quarters. As King continues to execute against this strategy, in-game net bookings have remained strong into the second quarter, continuing to grow well year-over-year in April even against tough comparables from the start of lockdown in the year ago quarter.  
Late in Q1, King launched Crash Bandicoot: On the Run, a new mobile title based on the beloved Activision franchise. The game has been downloaded over 30 million times to date, and the team is now focused on optimizing the game for retention and engagement. That said, we continue to assume limited contribution for the game in our full year outlook.  
Along with the strong performance for in-app purchases, King again delivered significant growth in advertising across both direct and partner sales channels. As the mobile advertising backdrop continues to evolve, the team is expanding its partner network and it's growing its direct sales force, building advertiser awareness for its differentiated, brand-safe platform and positioning the business for ongoing growth throughout the year.  
In summary, we are executing well against our strategy. While the business is delivering strong results, we believe we are only at the beginning of unlocking the full potential of our portfolio. And we look forward to demonstrating further progress against this potential in the coming quarters and beyond.  
Now I will hand over to Armin, who will provide more color on our financial results. Armin?"

I'm glad to be with you all for my first earnings call as CFO, and would like to echo Bobby's and Daniel's comments in thanking Dennis. He has been a fantastic mentor and partner over the years, and I wish him all the best for the future.",1198,"Thanks, Daniel. I'm glad to be with you all for my first earnings call as CFO, and would like to echo Bobby's and Daniel's comments in thanking Dennis. He has been a fantastic mentor and partner over the years, and I wish him all the best for the future. Now let me review our record first quarter results as well as outlook for 2021 and the second quarter.  
Our first quarter revenue and earnings per share were well ahead of our prior outlook, driven by better-than-expected performance for Call of Duty and Candy Crush. Net bookings grew 36% year-over-year to $2.07 billion, and segment operating income grew 59% to $853 million. Total segment operating margin expanded 6 percentage points year-over-year reflecting the high incremental margins associated with digital revenue streams. Now let me turn to our segment results. Each Activision, Blizzard and King contributed to top and bottom line growth in the quarter. Activision revenue was $891 million, growing 72% year-over-year.  
Growth was driven by Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Warzone in-game revenues, premium sales and Call of Duty Mobile. Operating income more than doubled year-over-year to $442 million with an operating margin of 50%, 14 percentage points higher year-over-year. Blizzard revenue was $483 million, increasing 7% year-over-year with very strong growth for World of Warcraft, partially offset by product timing. Operating income was $208 million and business operating margin was 43%, [ probably ] consistent year-over-year.  
King revenue grew 22% year-over-year to $609 million. This is a new record, led by strong in-game revenue growth for Candy Crush. And advertising revenue grew 70% year-over-year. Operating income was $203 million, growing 30% year-over-year even after increased investment in user acquisition. And King's operating margin was 33%, 2 percentage points higher year-over-year. 
Finally, across our segments, in-game net bookings grew 40% year-over-year to $1.34 billion, representing 65% of overall net bookings with each of Activision, Blizzard and King contributing to the strong performance.  
Okay. Now let's turn to our overall consolidated results and, unless otherwise indicated, I'll be referencing non-GAAP figures. As always, please refer to our earnings release for a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. Now for the quarter, we generated quarter 1 GAAP revenues of $2.28, $260 million above our February outlook. This includes the net recognition of deferrals of $209 million, and net bookings of $2.07 billion were $316 million above our outlook, and we generated GAAP EPS of $0.79 and quarter 1 non-GAAP EPS of $0.98, which was $0.14 above our February outlook.  
These figures include the net recognition of deferrals of $0.14. Now turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Our strong business fundamentals also drove substantial cash flow generation in the quarter. We delivered operating cash flow of $844 million significantly higher year-over-year, reflecting higher operating income, tax settlements in the year ago quarter and changes in working capital. Our cash and investments at the end of March were approximately $9.5 billion, and we ended the quarter with a net cash position of approximately $5.9 billion. And as previously announced, this week, we'll pay an annual dividend of $0.47 per share, 15% higher year-over-year.  
Now let me turn to our outlook for quarter 2 and the full year. Regarding the fleet, our expanded teams are focused on delivering epic in-game and upfront content. This means that we'll continue to support our franchises with new in-game content, events and features all of which are critical elements of our business as we focus on keeping our communities engaged and drive year-round player investment. In terms of upfront releases, we will release WoW: Burning Crusade classic in the coming months, and we are looking forward to launching Diablo II: Resurrected and the latest premium release of Call of Duty in the second half of the year.  
And on mobile, we continue to plan for the launch of Diablo Immortal in the second half. Although as is customary, we do not include meaningful contribution from new mobile launches in our outlook. Now before I discuss the specifics of our outlook, let me provide some context.  
The year is off to a very strong start. Our growth initiative continues to deliver great results in the first quarter, and our momentum has continued across all of our key franchises into the second quarter. Competition for talent remains high. And in this context, we have been increasing our investment in creative and commercial talent to deliver even more compelling experiences across our portfolio through the remainder of the year. As a result, we feel great about our ability to continue delighting and engaging our communities. So while this is still early in the year, and we remain prudent in our assumptions, we are raising our outlook for full year net bookings and earnings per share.  
From a phasing perspective, as discussed on the last earnings call, Call of Duty faces a difficult year-over-year comparison in Q2. Since premium sales a year ago benefited from the launch of Warzone, product timing and the introduction of shelter-from-home mandate. We also intend to take advantage of our strong business momentum to increase marketing around new content in Q2. We, therefore continue to expect total segment operating profit to be lower year-over-year in the second quarter, with stronger year-over-year performance in the second half of the year as we deliver against our second half pipeline. 
Now let me get into the specifics. For quarter 2, on a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $2.14 billion, including the net recognition of deferrals of $285 million. We expect net bookings of $1.85 billion. We expect a GAAP operating margin of 39%, a tax rate of 21%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 785 million and EPS of $0.81.  
For quarter 2, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect a tax rate of 18% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.91, including a net recognition of deferrals of $0.21.  
Now turning to the fiscal. On a GAAP basis for 2021, we now expect revenues of $8.37 billion, including net deferrals of $230 million. We now expect net bookings of $8.6 billion. We expect a GAAP operating margin of 36%, a GAAP tax rate of 22%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 787 million and GAAP EPS of $2.91. For 2021 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect a tax rate of 20% and non-GAAP EPS of $3.42, including net deferral of $0.28.  
So to close, in Q1, we continued to deliver strong results across our largest franchises, and our momentum has continued into Q2. We are making great progress on our pipeline, which includes key content that we expect to deliver another step change in financial performance in 2022 as well as unannounced initiatives that we expect to drive longer-term growth for the company.  
We have a combination of leading owned franchises, best-in-class developer and commercial talent and expertise across platforms and business models, all of which create a powerful platform for sustained financial performance. We remain focused on execution and operational discipline and committed to profitable growth to drive shareholder value over the long term.

It's great to see people out and about and obviously healthy. We've been looking at engagement trends very, very closely. And as you'd probably expect, the trends vary between the franchises, depending on the nature of the audience and also the type of the game. Now we do see some variation between regions that are reopening versus those that are locking back down. But overall, as we continue to execute against our strategy, we really continue to see strong engagement across each of our largest franchises. And importantly, player investment really remains very consistent across regions. And that's important to note. 
I'd reiterate that while we have seen some benefit from sheltering from the home similar to the rest of the gaming industry, we do believe that much of the expansion that we've seen in our latest -- the largest franchises is due to product initiatives that we've implemented, be it the launch of Warzone and Call of Duty Mobile or the introduction of classic and a great WoW expansion in Shadowlands or our work to grow the payer base and deliver more frequent compelling content in Candy. And I think some of the comments you heard today support that in terms of how April went for us even as some of the regions have continued to open. For instance, Call of Duty season 3 is on a similarly strong trajectory as we've seen for season 1 and season 2. The current season of Call of Duty Mobile is tracking as the best yet in terms of player investment in the West. And World of Warcraft is performing very well, with strong engagement ahead of the upcoming launch of Burning Crusade classic and can't ignore Candy. Candy is continuing to grow year-over-year against really tough comps. 
So these trends really do show our ability to build on the expansion that we've already seen in some of our franchises even as regions reopen. And as we look forward, we see a long-term trend of more people gaming than ever before in more geographies and on more platforms. And that's been going on for decades. And we only see that continuing with gaming becoming an even more significant form of social connection and obviously, entertainment. So it's great to see so many people being vaccinated around the world and some regions reopening. And we're encouraged by the fact that we're seeing engagement as economies reopen. But as ever, we remain prudent in our outlook. And I appreciate your question. Hopefully, that answers it."

I'll take this one. But I guess before I get into those questions directly, I do think it's worth stepping back and noting some of the incredible milestones we've hit across the Call of Duty ecosystem, which has always been focused on building more holistically. Warzone, which you've probably seen, which has obviously been transformational for our business in so many ways, has now crossed 100 million players. Our premium Call of Duty games have now sold over 400 million copies life-to-date on the franchise. And Call of Duty Mobile has now crossed over 500 million downloads. 
So remarkably, after all these years, the franchise has never been stronger or more widely played. And for that, we are just super thankful for the community's ongoing support, and we are more committed than ever to provide them with the best possible experiences in the years that lie ahead. 
Now with respect to the integration of Warzone and Black Ops, we're really pleased with the integration. You've heard some of the financial results already on the call. Season 3 has maintained the great momentum of seasons 1 and 2. And we look at even other factors. Season 3 set a new viewership record for us at reveal with over 2 million streaming viewers, and this is higher than even Warzone's launch in March of last year. And this just continues to demonstrate the strength of our direct connection we have with our players. And with all that said, we still truly fundamentally believe we are just scratching the surface of what Warzone can expand into for the community. And that's the exciting part. And thanks to our world-class development and publishing teams, we certainly believe the future of Warzone has never looked better. 
Now as we look ahead for Warzone later this year, there'll be some other really fun integrations with the great work that Sledgehammer Games is leading for this year's new premium release, and Daniel mentioned this already. It's worth noting that Sledge as a studio now is also stronger than ever. The studio has expanded its very talented team across its foster city and Melbourne locations and now is even expanding further with Sledgehammer Toronto. 
Most importantly, at the end of the day, we believe fans are going to be really, really excited and are going to love what the studio is building. That's what it's all about in this business, and we can't wait to share more on this front. 
And finally, back to just your question on mobile. We talked about a lot of the data, I think, on the call a little bit, but mobile is live in China, as you know. It's doing very well. The West continues to perform very strongly. And globally today, Call of Duty Mobile has now crossed over $1 billion in player investment in addition to the over 500 million downloads around the world. The current season, as referenced, Tokyo Escape, is tracking to the -- as the highest grossing to date. So what I would say is, overall, our teams are just continuing to execute really well across the east and the west. And we continue to see really strong opportunities in all regions and we remain very, very excited for the future of this platform and the broader Call of Duty ecosystem. Thank you for the question."

Speaking of Overwatch 2. We've got some great feedback from the player community around the development progress that we showcased in February at BlizzConline. And we feel really confident in both the game and the team. And they're going to continue to share updates about Overwatch 2 progress, new features to the live game going forward. 
With Diablo, there's a lot of strong momentum right now. We have public testing that's taking place in both April and May for both Immortal and Diablo Resurrected -- Diablo II: Resurrected rather. And we also have a lot of community interest around the development of Diablo IV, as you mentioned. We're also continuing to make progress across multiple mobile titles that we've alluded to in the past. We really want to bring authentic Blizzard quality experiences to all the games that we have. And so for us, it's a pretty exciting time as we continue to work on PC, console and mobile expressions of all of our franchises.

This is Humam. So as you noted, Q1 was a great quarter for King. We marked the 5-year anniversary of King's acquisition, and we did that with record financial performance across the business, including our best revenue quarter ever. Now as you've heard, we have momentum across both our in-game and advertising sides of the business, and we expect that momentum to continue. So on IDSA, I believe we're very well equipped as the industry navigates those IDSA changes. And we're equipped on both the advertising side and also on the user acquisition side. So let me give you a little bit of color on each of those. 
On the advertising side, with our Q1 exit trajectory and including kind of the continued momentum we see in our direct business, that positions us well as we navigate those advertising changes. And as we look ahead, we are adding to that momentum with initiatives underway along some examples in product innovation, where we're expanding kind of the number of ad products that we have in our network. We're expanding our partner network and our direct sales force. And we're broadening the categories of the advertisers that we work with. And so when you put all those together, we believe we still have a long runway for growth in the advertising side. And we're constantly bringing in new brands, I should say, as we develop deeper and deeper relationships with brands across the category. 
As just one example. In the United Kingdom, we worked with Sky across 3 parts -- 3 different areas of their business in Q1, and we're able to drive significant improvement in their brand metrics across, we call, consideration and association of their plan. So with all of that, we continue to believe that there is a good trajectory there as we -- as the industry navigates with IDSA. 
Now as I turn on the other side, which is our user acquisition, we have strong momentum in our business. And we continue to leverage the strength of our brand as we invest in our live ops, and we invest also in ROI positive marketing to deliver new installs and bring back returning players. So more broadly, we -- as we put more live events like Candy Crush All Stars and as we add more social features, as an example, the March launch of our competitive mode in Candy Soda, we are bringing more exciting moments that help us on that user acquisition. So all in all, current momentum is really good, as you saw. And we expect that momentum to continue and have confidence in our ability to deliver that over the next few quarters."

And as you've heard today, we also have an incredible pipeline. And we know when we execute that well, we not only delight our players, but we also create attractive returns for our shareholders. So what you should expect from me is a focus on a few key areas. Look, it all starts with a focus on shareholder value creation. This has always been a focus for the company. And frankly, we have never been better positioned. As you have heard today, all of our franchises have incredible potential. So I'm very focused on working with the teams to price that investment and resources towards our biggest value creation opportunities. 
Next, as I mentioned, expect a very strong focus from me on execution excellence, both critically and commercially. And in that context, I do believe that the CFO has an important role to play in not just overseeing the achievement of our financial target, but also the progress against our operating and commercial plan. So if you expect me to leverage my experiences as Chief Commercial Officer of the company and Chief Operating Officer of Blizzard to help make sure that all of our franchises are set up for success. 
And then, of course, you should expect continued focus around financial discipline and organizational excellence. Ultimately, our culture is centered around growth, operational discipline and financial conservatism. And that won't change. So from an organizational perspective, finally, I continue to be focused on building a world-class team in order to support our growth plans that we have discussed today. So I hope that gives you a sense of how I'm approaching the role. But really, really, what I'm looking forward to is getting out there and meeting all of you in the coming months.

I have put in thousands of hours into various Diablo games over the decades. And we're all very excited about the overall strategy and the direction of the games that you mentioned. When we think and look at Diablo, we've got 3 upcoming releases that we expect to really expand the audience and really delight the community and exceed their expectations. So Diablo II: Resurrected is bringing -- we think of it as really a true classic in gaming into the modern gaming world for both new fans and that -- and fans that really are going to come back and play it again. 
Diablo Immortal, the point there or the goal there is to broaden the audience, bring an authentic version of Diablo to mobile. 
And then with the Diablo IV, that's going to be our next mainline title that we feel is going to advance the art of the action RPG genre. And so it's really never been a better time in the history of Diablo to be a Diablo fan. We've seen positive reception to the development progress that we shared this year for Diablo IV. We announced a new class, the rogue, at BlizzConline, and the team is continuing to progress through important internal development milestones. 
With Diablo Immortal, it's currently in the second phase of testing. We introduced another new class. We've introduced new zones, and we've also introduced first time to the public, the high end in-game and PVP content. And we've seen the community respond pretty positively thus far, particularly around the systems design. And we're looking forward to more of their feedback as testing continues. Now on top of being an authentic Diablo experience on mobile, Immortal is also bridging a narrative gap between the events of what happened at the end of Diablo II and the start of Diablo III. And so that's  bringing additional storytelling into the franchise. And then lastly, Diablo II: Resurrected recently completed its first public test, and the reception that we received was really great. The original Diablo II is a landmark game in Blizzard's history and that we're really happy that we've been able to kind of reintroduce this experience to new players and spark renewed passion and players who really love the original. And so the overall strategy for Diablo is to really provide players with different ways to engage in the franchise on their platform of choice.

First of all, our focus is absolutely ensuring the health and safety of our employees. This means both physical and psychological. And we've been in constant touch with our team managers to ensure that our employees are kept safe and also, if they're able to find the time that they really need to recharge when needed. Early on in the pandemic, Bobby shared his personal telephone number with each and every employee for them to reach out if they needed any help. And I'm personally very proud of our company's response and also just amazed by the talent in our organization who have adapted to so many curveballs that this pandemic has really thrown at people.
 As for your question on game development, we are fortunate that to date, we really haven't seen any significant impact to game development with our current games and pipeline because we're really meeting our pre-COVID milestones. And as we have seen in 2020 and also in early 2021, we've delivered the games that our players have expected and with the quality that really defines our company. And we also have been very fortunate that we haven't had to compromise game scope. And our players have, as a result, gotten just the best value for their money. So it's been incredible to see. 
Now as mentioned in previous earning calls, we have reopened some of our studio capabilities in a limited fashion for areas that really needed it like motion capture, for instance. That was really to ensure that we just stayed on top of our milestone. And in each case, we obviously ensured strict adherence to heightened COVID testing and separation protocols that have ensured that our employees were kept save. But having said that, we recognized with our strategy of increasing game content and frequency as well as doubling down on live operations, we must and we have to continue to grow our developer base. And this is why we recently announced, as Bobby alluded to in his opening remarks, the goal to hire 2,000-plus developers over the coming few years, and we're actively hiring around the globe. And we have the benefit of having studios in cities across Asia, Europe and, of course, across the Americas. So our teams are really adept at working across geographies, and you'll see us opening or expanding studios and locations, such as Poland and in Toronto, for instance, to give us access to some of the great pools of talent to really help us deliver on even more content in the years ahead. Thanks again, Andrew."

Thanks, Gerrick. Look, we haven't changed our approach. We have a very strong track record of being balanced and disciplined in how we allocate capital across investing into organic business growth, returning capital to shareholders via buybacks and dividends as well as strategic M&A. And on M&A specifically, we have completed several transactions that have created significant value. As you mentioned, King is a great example of that. We mentioned today that we just celebrated the fifth anniversary of its acquisition which gave us a leadership position in mobile at a valuation that delivers significant value for our shareholders, as you know. 
Now when we look at the industry today, we do continue to see scale benefits. Look, as you know, we are still only 4% of a very fragmented market, even though we are the leading stand-alone game publisher in the West. But we will and we can afford to be disciplined in our approach around the key criteria, which we believe are essential for value creation through M&A. And on those, we generally look for large established franchises or technologies that have the potential for scale. We also look for strong leadership teams with a strong track record of profitability. And then, of course, we look for an attractive valuation that hits our return thresholds. That's a pretty high bar, and it can be difficult to find the right target that meets this criteria, especially, as we mentioned, with so much capital in the industry right now. 
But as I mentioned, we can afford to be, and we will stay disciplined, frankly, even more so with the significant organic growth opportunities we have. So we will remain patient for the right opportunity. It's an approach that has served the company well for the last 30 years, and we believe it will serve us well into the future. Again, thanks for your question.

Thanks, Colin. And I'll take the last question. It's Daniel again. Look, we believe our franchises absolutely have to be accessible wherever the players are and that obviously includes mobile, not only in developed countries, but even more so in developing countries. And mobile is just the ultimate driver of reach with almost 3 billion smartphones worldwide, that's forecasted to increase to 4 billion in the next 5 years. We are really doing ourselves and the community a disservice if our games are not on those platforms. And that's why this is so critical to our strategy. And the opportunity is crystal clear. Little known fact is most of the top 10 franchises on mobile worldwide are actually based on existing PC or console IP. And our franchises are in genres that are just particularly well suited for mobile. And they are amongst the few franchises in the industry to really have the appeal around the world, including regions where mobile is the main way that people play core games. And as a result, we really want all of our franchises to be on mobile. And in some cases, there might be several different ways in which a franchise can be represented on mobile. You may have reimaginations of an IP on mobile in addition to games that are just more similar to an existing console or a PC experience. 
And as a core part of our strategy to make our franchise available across platforms, we've done a number of things. So obviously, we acquired King and that brought tremendous mobile talent, which has proven to be the case through continued momentum in that business, exemplified by what you just saw in our Q1 results. And we've also -- as a company, we leveraged the learnings from King across the business: platform engagement, live ops, user acquisition or managing game economies. And across Activision and Blizzard, we started with Call of Duty Mobile, following up with the Diablo Immortal that Jay was just referring to. And we're also working on a number of Warcraft mobile titles and have some unannounced initiatives as well underway. So players will increasingly be able to enjoy these franchises they love on console, PC and on the mobile experiences we're building. So as you can tell, this is a real priority for us. A lot of investment. We're hiring hundreds of mobile developers to achieve these targets, and you should continue to see the results of this work in the coming quarters. Thanks, Colin."

We so appreciate the current and former employees who have come forward and pass in recent days with courage, and I want to reiterate the commitments we have made to you. 
Our work environment, everywhere we operate will not permit discrimination, harassment or unequal treatment. We will be the company that sets the example for this in our industry. While we've taken many steps towards this objective already, today, we are taking even more. Jennifer ONeal and Mike Ybarra have been named the new co lead to Blizzard. Jen has been with the company for 18 years. She's the former Head of our studio Vicarious Visions and most recently had production and development oversight for our Diablo and Overwatch franchises. Mike has been in our industry for over 20 years, including in leadership roles within Microsoft Xbox division and at Blizzard as General Manager of BattleNet. I'm also pleased to have Alan Adam here today. As most of you know, Alan is one of the founders of Blizzard. After a 12-year hiatus, Alan returned to Blizzard to lead our new product and new IP incubation efforts. Each of these individuals brings vast industry experience and tremendous integrity to their roles. They are the very best examples of leadership with character and accountability. 
I'm confident this team will ensure that Blizzard provides the welcoming, comfortable and safe workplace that is essential to foster creativity and inspiration. 
In addition,  we'll continue to investigate each and every claim and complaint that we receive. When we learn of shortcomings, we will take decisive action and to strengthen our capabilities in this area, we'll be adding additional staff and resources.  People will be held accountable for their actions. That commitment means that we will not just terminate employees where appropriate, but we'll also terminate any manager or leader down to have impeded the integrity of our processes for evaluating claims and imposing appropriate consequences. Because our work cannot be successful without diverse voices, views and talent,  we made a commitment to consider diversive candidates for all open positions, and we'll continue to add resources to ensure this occurs throughout the company. 
Over the past several years, we've made significant changes to address company culture, reflect more diversity within our leadership teams and create environments conducive to reporting any type of misconduct. We've amplified internal programs that encourage employees to report valuation. We've reinforced channels for employees to voice concerns and confidential and safe ways without any fear of retaliation. We're directing additional resources to our compliance and employee relations teams dedicated to investigating complaints. We pride ourselves on paying our employees competitively and fairly for equal or substantially similar work. We regularly review our compensation to ensure that we remain equitable in our approach. We take a variety of proactive steps to ensure that pay is driven by nondiscriminatory factors such as performance, role and expertise. And we conduct extensive antidiscrimination trainings, including for all employees involved in the compensation process. 
Our workplace initiatives are crucial to our continued success and our leadership in this effort is my priority. Our workplace safety also remains our priority. And as we consider our return to work initiatives we remain focused on providing the very best health care for our employees and their families. You have my unwavering commitment that we will continue to focus on serving our players and delivering the sustainable growth that you've come to expect. And we will take all necessary actions to foster a culture that is supportive and welcoming for all of our employees. And we expect to be the very best example for other companies to emulate.

Our continued strong performance is because of the efforts of our incredibly talented people and we will make certain the workplace facilitates the best possible performance for constant improvement to our culture and unwavering conviction to our value. Now turning to the second quarter. We exceeded our prior outlook, benefiting from strong execution by our creative and commercial team in delivering compelling experiences and in-game content to our deeply engaged community. Over the last 2 years, we have increased investment in our biggest opportunity, creating new ways for our communities to engage and investing in our franchises across platforms. 
This strategy has significantly expanded the financial scale of our 3 largest franchises: Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush, and this work continued to deliver strong results in the second quarter, even as countries continue to reopen from lockdown due to the pandemic. Looking forward, we continue to transform our franchise portfolio through faster delivery of compelling premium content, more robust in-game operations, expanding to mobile and accelerating new engagement models, including free-to-play and advertising. 
Now I'll discuss our Q2 franchise and operational highlights across our business units. Starting with Activision, where 127 million monthly active users engaged in our content in the second quarter. Our commitment to delivering innovative, engaging experiences to our expanded Call of Duty ecosystem continued to deliver strong results. The franchise sustained reach, engagement and player investment well above levels being prior to our introduction of free-to-play experiences across console, PC and mobile. 
Across the Call of Duty ecosystem, second quarter MAU were consistent versus the year ago quarter and over 3x higher than Q2 of 2019. Hours played in the franchise in the second quarter were higher than for all of 2019. We continue to see robust engagement even as regions continue to reopen. On console and PC, MAU and time spent across Black Ops Cold War, Modern Warfare and Warzone saw higher retention from Q1 to Q2 in our experiences in years leading up to the launch of Warzone. Conversion from Warzone again drove strong premium sales in Q2 and multiples of the level typically seen in second quarters prior to last year. 
In-game player investment remains strong, with console PC in-game net bookings, similar to that seen in the first quarter. While lower year-over-year against the quarter that benefited from the launch of Warzone and likely more people at home, in-game net bookings in the quarter were approximately 4x the level of Q2 2019. 
Our teams remain hard at work on the next new premium Call of Duty release, planned for the fourth quarter. From a setting that our fans know and love to an incredible amount of content in development, including an extensive live of schedule, we believe this release will be incredibly well received. In addition to launching a great seamless experience for both current and next-gen console players, we are focused on continuing to integrate Warzone and engage our direct relationship with our player base through even deeper content integration between the premium and free experiences and substantial innovations coming within Warzone itself. Our teams cannot wait to unveil what they have been working on. 
Call of Duty Mobile net bookings grew double digits year-over-year and sequentially driven by strong execution in seasonal content in the West and the recent launch of the game in China. Our team continues to enhance the game, building on learnings from player data and leveraging over 15 years of Call of Duty content to deliver increasingly compelling content and driving greater player investment over time. 
As we build on this momentum, we recently added new social gameplay to the title and have new mode, map and seasonal events planned for the second half of the year. Call of Duty Mobile is on track to exceed $1 billion in consumer spending for the year. And as we continue to optimize the title, we're also investing in mobile capabilities with a singular goal to create the best mobile experiences for our community. 
We have established a new internal mobile studio and are aggressively adding mobile resources across several teams, including DNO and Activision Shanghai. Together, these teams are leading the development of an unannounced new mobile title within the Call of Duty universe that we expect will help take the franchise to new heights. Turning to Blizzard. We couldn't be more excited about the leadership changes. Jen and Mike are outstanding leaders, and we look forward to the impact they will have on the culture, accountability in fostering the very best work environment. 
The launch of Burning Crusade Classic in June marked the start of what is intended to be a very significant 18-month period for content releases. MAUs were 26 million. 
In the Warcraft franchise, World of Warcraft net bookings again grew double digits year-over-year in the second quarter, driven by the well-received launch of Burning Crusade Classic in June. Subscriber numbers and hours played were up following the release, again, showing the importance of classic in enabling more ways for players to engage in WoW. The strength in Classic added to ongoing deep engagement in the modern game following the Q4 Shadowlands launch and launch of its first major content update in June. 
And as a result, WoW remains on track for much stronger engagement this year than is typical outside of a modern expansion year. Elsewhere in the Warcraft Universe, Hearthstone's latest expansion, forged in the Baron delivered expansion over expansion net bookings growth for a second consecutive release. And with the latest expansion, United and StormWind launched today and mercenary, a new mode in the popular role-playing genre plan for the coming months, we expect Hearthstone's  financial performance to strengthen in the second half of the year. 
Blizzard continues to make progress in its work on ambitious new World of Warcraft mobile experiences that can attract entirely new players to the franchise as well as offering new ways for existing fans to engage. Two Warcraft mobile experiences are in various stages of internal testing with the team looking forward to sharing more about these titles soon. 
Now turning to Diablo. We have added hundreds of developers to the franchise over the last 3 years, and we continue to grow our teams as we prepare to launch 3 unique and complementary experiences across platform. Diablo II resurrected will launch on PC and console on September 23. The anticipation for this remaster of the quintessential action role-playing game is high, and we can't wait for the community to experience the quality of the title. On mobile, Diablo Immortal continues to progress well through testing, receiving excellent feedback for its nameplate. We see substantial potential for this release, both in its own right as a long-running authentic ago experience and to broaden the franchise's reach ahead of Diable IV. Recent testing revealed some exciting additional opportunities the team is going to pursue to make the title even more engaging for a wider audience. While that means the game is now planned for release in the first half of 2022, we believe these efforts will set the title up for an even greater contribution next year and beyond. 
And most importantly, Blizzard continues to make strong progress on Diablo IV. The game is shaping up incredibly well, and the team is allocating substantial resources to creating exciting content to drive engagement over multiple years. The expanded Overwatch team is similarly making strong progress on Overwatch 2, with development passing an important internal milestone in recent weeks. After a great response to the recent community update,  the team is looking forward to reviewing more of the game in the coming months as they approach the later stages of production. 
At King,  the team continues to execute extremely well, again delivering double-digit net bookings growth against a tough year ago comparable. MAUs were 255 million. King continued to drive growth through its work to optimize live operation, in-game economies and user acquisition for titles, particularly Candy Crush and Farm Heroes, its 2 largest franchises. 
The business saw ongoing year-over-year growth in franchise payers and investment per payer in the second quarter, with Candy Crush once again the highest grossing game franchise in the United States app stores. Building on successful initiatives to broaden its payer base over the last 2 years, the Candy Crush team has been accelerating the delivery of compelling seasonal content that delights our players and drive in-game investment. 
In the second quarter, King reached a monthly cadence for seasonal content within Candy Crush Saga, its biggest title. These seasonal events not only sustain strong engagement among existing players but also drive reengagement of lapsed players as well as attracting new players to the franchise. 
The Candy team is planning an innovative slate of seasonal events and live operations for the second half of the year, including tie-ins with brands that value the association with our premium network, positioning the franchise for ongoing momentum in its in-game business. 
King's advertising business is also delivering. Q2 advertising revenue grew sequentially and doubled year-over-year. King's ongoing initiatives to enhance that platform, work with more demand partners and reach more categories of advertisers drove year-over-year growth in both volume and pricing with broad-based strength across geographies. 
In summary, Q2 was another strong quarter. We are taking actions to address stakeholder concerns and the adverse consequences to our business. If we experience prolonged periods of adverse publicity, significantly reduced productivity or other negative consequences related to this matter, our business likely would be adversely impacted. We are carefully monitoring all aspects of our business for any such impacts. From a pipeline perspective, we have a strong lineup plans for the second half of the year. And as we look to 2022, our current plans contemplate compelling new experiences across Call of Duty, WoW and Candy, alongside several major new titles across PC, console and mobile from Blizzard, with the aim to deliver significant expansion in the reach and engagement of our portfolio. 
Above all, as we go forward, I want to reemphasize that the safety and well-being of our employees is of utmost priority. Our teams are the source of all creativity and magic in our game. Now I will hand over to Armin, who will provide a detailed review of our financial results. Armin?"

I want to reiterate that our priority is ensuring a workplace that provides opportunity for all in the most welcoming and inclusive way possible. 
Today, I'll review our second quarter results as well as our outlook for the third quarter and full year 2021. Our second quarter results were ahead of our prior outlook, driven by both operational outperformance and some nonoperating items. For the first half, we delivered double-digit year-over-year growth in net bookings and solid growth in operating income in year. We achieved new records for each, even as we continue to increase investment in the business, and our development team to support our strong pipeline. As Region 3 opened, our business continues to operate at significantly greater scale than that's seen prior to our successful growth initiatives across our largest franchise. Now let me turn to our consolidated financial results. Unless otherwise indicated, I'll be referencing non-GAAP figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. 
For the quarter, we generated quarter 2 GAAP revenues of $2.30 billion, $161 million above our May guidance. This includes the net recognition of deferrals of $375 million. Net bookings of $1.92 billion were $71 million above our May outlook. And we generated quarter 2 GAAP EPS of $1.12 and core to non-GAAP EPS of $1.20, which was $0.29 above our guidance. These figures include the net recognition of deferrals of $0.29. 
Quarter 2 EPS includes a $0.07 benefit from a gain on an investment, most of which was unrealized. We also experienced a lower than PCP tax rate in the quarter due to the timing of overseas tax reform. Although our full year tax rate is something is unchanged. 
Now turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Quarter 2 operating cash flow was $388 million, lower year-over-year impacting operating results, local capital timing and the timing of cash taxes. During the quarter, we paid an annual dividend of $0.47 per share, 15% higher year-over-year for a total of $365 million. Our cash and investments at the end of June were approximately $9.6 billion, and we ended the quarter with a net cash position of approximately $6 million. Now let me turn to our segment results. Ag Division delivered another strong quarter, contributing to record first half segment revenue and operating income. Quarter 2 revenue was $789 million. As expected, Color Beauty revenue on PC and console was lower year-over-year against last year's quarter that benefited from the March 2020 launches of Warzone and Modern Warfare Remastered as well as the introduction of Teltrondate. However, Call of Duty Mobile grew strongly year-over-year. Quarter 2 segment operating income was $363 million, with an operating margin of 46%. 
Listed revenue was $433 million, with double-digit year-over-year growth in World of Warcraft, offset by product timing for Warzone and lower overseas revenues as explained in prior quarters. 
Operating income was $141 million with an operating margin of 33%, reflecting investments into product development against the risk content pipeline as well as sales and marketing around the launch of Burning Crusade at quarter end. King revenue grew 15% year-over-year to $635 million. This is another new record, driven by double-digit in-game revenue growth for Candy Crush and Farm Hero. 
Advertising revenue doubled year-over-year and trailing fourth quarter advertising revenue is now above $300 million for the first time. King operating margin was also strong at 39%, delivering record operating income at $248 million. 
Across our segments, strong execution in live operations and in-game content drove India net bookings to a combined $1.32 billion, broadly consistent with the level of the prior 4 quarters and almost 70% of total net bookings this quarter, the in-game business represents a recurring base of profitability for the company with a significant opportunity for further growth in both existing and new franchise experiences. Finally,  the second quarter saw strong double-digit year-over-year growth in mobile net bookings, which exceeded a $3 billion annualized run rate for the first time this quarter. The mobile platform delivered more than 40% of total net bookings and is a key strategic priority for us as we expand each of our key franchises to mobile in the coming years. 
Now let me turn to our outlook for the third quarter and the full year. With regard to our slate, our expanded teams are focused on delivering epic in-game and upcoming content. In the third quarter, acquisition fit seasonal content for Call of Duty Cold War And Warzone launches later this month. And the team will continue to release significant new features, events and seasons for Call of Duty Mobile. Today, Blizzard released [indiscernible] latest expansion, United in [indiscernible] . Resurrected, we launched on September 1. -- and King with of course Candy Crush and other games across this portfolio with numerous seasonal events, features and innovative life operations. In the fourth quarter, in addition to ongoing LifeLock and Indian content across the portfolio, we're looking forward to Activision, launching new core bit premium content alongside major new income experiences to water. These are the most important releases of the year for us, and we can't get show the community what our teams have been working on. In the second half, we will also continue to refine and test new mobile content in our pipeline.  Including for both Warcraft and Diablo. Consistent with our prior outlook, we don't include material revenue from new mobile titles in our guidance for the current year. 
Now before I discuss the specifics of our outlook,  let me provide some context. We are taking substantial actions to address the concerns of employees and other key stakeholders. While there are risks that our business could be adversely impacted of benefit cuts, currently, our business performance is strong. In the third quarter, we expect ongoing robust performance for Core Beauty, Candy and World Warcraft to be complemented by the launch of the Diablo II Resurrected. While we are taking a prudent approach to our outlook, we do expect year-over-year net bookings growth in the third quarter. We will increase investments in the quarter in our product compliance, employee relations and sales and marketing to help unlock the full potential of our franchises heading into 2022. 
As we move into the fourth quarter, where we continue to invest in the business, we expect lower costs and growth in earnings year-over-year. Finally, as mentioned, we experienced an investment gain in the second quarter, which we are passing through in our outlook based on a valuation at the end of July. Bringing this all together, we are once again raising our outlook for net bookings, revenue and EPS for the year. 
Now let me get into some specifics. For quarter 3 on a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $1.97 billion, including the net recognition of deferrals of $120 million. We expect net bookings of $1.85 billion. We expect a GAAP operating margin of 25%, a tax rate of 22%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 785 million and EPS of 60%. For quarter 3 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect a tax rate of 20% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.75, including the net recognition of [indiscernible] 
Now turning to the fiscal year. On a GAAP basis for 2021, we expect revenues of $8.52 billion, including net defer of $135 million. We now expect net bookings of $8.65 billion. We expect the GAAP operating margin of 37%, a GAAP tax rate of 21%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 785 million and GAAP EPS of  $3.08. For 2021 on a month GAAP basis, we expect a tax rate of 20% and non-GAAP EPS of $3.54, including net deferrals of $0.22. 
In closing, our business continues to perform well in the second quarter, delivering strong results. We will continue investing in our creative team and positioning our franchisees for even greater retail engagement in the future with our current plan, continuing to support growth in our financial performance in 2022. Look, as Bob and made clear, we understand that our people are our greatest asset. These are the people responsible for continued strong performance. We couldn't be more committed to ensuring an inclusive work environment for all our employees as well as the long-term sustainable growth. We'll be working with our team to improve our company together to become the most inspiring and inclusive entertainment company possible.

As you heard from Bobby, our employees are truly our greatest asset. And we remain absolutely focused as a leadership team on providing a diverse and a safe environment for our teams and have taken a number of actions thus far. For instance, we've engaged an outside law firm to conduct a review of our policies and procedures with respect to our workplace and where employees can connect if they have experienced any issues whatsoever. 
We will also be adding staff to our compliance and employee relations teams that investigate employee concerns. This is to ensure that we are always considering also diverse candidates for all open positions. As a Hispanic leader myself, I know how important having a diverse workforce can be for all aspects of our business, and this is critical. 
We will be evaluating and training also our people managers to make sure they are compliant with our processes  for handling employee concerns as well as taking the right actions, and we are proactively engaging with our employees to hear and respond to their feedback. For several years now, we have been focused on ensuring more diversity throughout the company, especially in our leadership roles and have dramatically increased the number of women and minorities in both the C-suite and in our business unit. And our compensation practices that women and men are paid equitably for equal work. 
As you heard, we have appointed Jen Oneal and Mike Ybarra as the new coleads at Blizzard, and I am so glad that an original Blizzard founder, Alan Adam, who returned to the company a few years ago, continues to lead our game incubation projects. We have a great leadership bench Blizzard and are excited about the new direction the company will take. 
Also, we are committed to an equitable and safe work environment, and that's what's important as we evolve our company, you should expect further announcements from us going forward. 
Now to answer your question on productivity and pipeline, as you heard today, the pipeline is progressing well. In particular, some of the content in the pipeline has been in development for many years, and it is approaching the final stages of production. We're monitoring the impact of recent events, obviously, as we discussed today. But based on what we see currently, we have a strong lineup plan for the second half of the year. And as we look into 2022, we're currently planning for several new titles across PC, console and mobile from Blizzard, alongside more great experiences from Call of Duty, Candy and Warcraft.

And the trends can vary across platforms game pay types and numerous other factors. More specifically, when we look at some of our largest franchises, we actually saw minimal variations in engagement and player investment as countries reopened. 
And even though we did see some variations, they were small relative to the structural growth we have seen on the business in the last year or 2. Look, what's really key is that when we look at the data, we see that product and other initiatives are the bigger determinant of reach and engagement. So we do believe that much of the expansion we have seen in our largest franchises is due to strong product initiatives, more frequent life operation and new engagement models, all of which we have started to successfully implement. Examples of that include the introduction of free-to-play experiences on mobile and on Warzone Call of Duty; the launch of Classic on World Warcraft and more frequent compelling content on Candy. And as a result, we are operating at much greater scale and continue to have momentum as evidenced by our quarterly results as well as trends into July. 
Now  as it relates to guidance, we are always thoughtful and careful in our approach. We assume lockdown talent continue to moderate in the third quarter. And of course, we are monitoring any impact of recent trends as discussed. But as you've heard, we still expect year-over-year growth in net booking as these initiatives continue to deliver results and we start to generate a return from our many years of work to reinvigorate Diablo. Finally, looking forward, we see a long-term trend of more people gaming than ever before across genres, platforms, business models and geographies. And as you know, we already operate successfully today across many of these growth vectors. So we are very well positioned to continue to grow in this market environment. Next, we believe growth is largely in our own hands. -- and our talented employees and teams. Thanks again for your question, Mike."

So that is first and foremost on our minds that our focus at the moment. 
Now turning back to answer your question directly. We do feel really good about what Sledgehammer Games is leading for release in the fourth quarter of this year. The studio itself has never been bigger or stronger   now with its teams in Foster City, in Melbourne and also now in Toronto. And across all modes of play across multiplayer, across campaign and across co-op, development is coming along really well, and we're going to be sharing those details   with the community very soon. 
Content-wise, it's a really robust game at launch across all the modes. And the good news for us right now is  we've gotten farther ahead on our live ops planning for supporting the community post launch, and the community should also expect that support to be very, very significant. We've learned a lot over the last couple of years, and that's all in our plans as we go forward.   
We also have really exciting new plans in Warzone, which Raven is leading. Now together with our premium release, we've had some really fun and what I consider the most significant updates   plan for the community across both Warzone and premium as we head into the fall.   
Now I do want to mention just a huge thanks to all of our amazing studios who have come together in amazing ways  to drive the franchise for this year and for this fall and for beyond. They're doing incredible work together as a team and also as independent studios.   
And finally, touching on your question on competition,   I think competition is really out there each and every year for us. And I think we consider it a good thing for the industry and for our players.   And to us, it's not a zero-sum game at all. We believe compelling new offerings have the potential to only grow the industry as we move them forward.   So our focus is really the same as it's been each and every year, and that's making sure we provide the most fun, the most incredible and the most innovative experiences we can to our community as we go forward.   And when we look at the breadth, depth and quality of content that our teams are delivering in Q4 across all our offerings, we do like our position a lot, but thanks for the question, Matt."

As you saw from our results, the IDFA changes really haven't had much of an impact on our business and actually even less of an impact than we expected. So firstly, on the advertising side,   we're still early in building this business, and we're just seeing great results as we grow both the supply and the demand. On the supply side, we've been introducing innovative new products and have started letting players watch more ads if they wish to, growing our ad inventory   in a way that's really consistent with our focus of really not impacting the player experience, and that's worked out really well. 
On the demand side, we're working with more demand partners and more categories of advertisers  driving more volume and price competition, and this really has been very impactful. We're also working hard to maximize the consent rates following the IDFA changes and have seen much better-than-expected results there.   So as we said last quarter, we really still see a long runway for growth in ad. 
Now secondly, in terms of user acquisition, again, if you look at the results,   you can see the ongoing strength of the business. Most of our installs each quarter are organic as we benefit from just the incredible awareness that our brands have globally, particularly a game like Candy.   And our increasingly frequent live events are also just great vehicles for driving organic installs as well. And we have direct relationships with many of our most valuable players. And that allows us to reengage them   if they lap and to really have a direct connection with them. 
Now in terms of paid acquisition, we saw plenty of ways to bring players into the network even following these changes on 1 particular platform.   And the great growth we're seeing in player investment really actually enables us to invest in even more ROI-positive marketing while still delivering strong profits for each quarter.   So again, more than comfortable in King's ability to deliver a sustained growth and in-game business, even after these changes and the results, I think, bear fruit to what I just said.

Let me address the first part of your question on CoudMobil specifically.   And then maybe I'll invite Armin or someone else to chime in on a more macro view on China and any potential restrictions there. 
On mobile for us, we see 3 key opportunities kind of going forward. And I'd say those could be bucketed as   geographic, operational and strategic, and let me touch on each of those. On the geographic front, for Call of Duty Mobile, we're seeing, obviously, great success in the U.S. and through Europe, and we're also continuing to optimize across those regions,  but we're seeing also great growth in emerging markets such as Latin America and Southeast Asia. And where we're focusing execution and investment for local players. And so that's something we they can still scale and help grow the business overall.   
On the operational side, Call of Duty Mobile is already a great game, and we see opportunity to make it even better. Our mobile team is continuing to do an incredible job of constantly improving the experience   and adding content to players in the web. And the team just keeps getting better and better, which is a testament to their passion and commitment to the mobile community. And China is just another example there where the title itself is off to a strong start  but still has a lot of opportunity in front of it to be tailored and optimized for the local audience. And the team is also very focused on that as well. 
And then lastly is strategic. As we think about long term, where we see compelling -- more compelling growth   on the platform. And overall, I'd say we believe there's an opportunity to better connect mobile to the overall quality ecosystem,  and we're aggressively hiring talent to help on this journey for us. We've created our own internal mobile studio and are driving a major recruiting effort across Box and Activision Shanghai to support as well.   And together, I think as Daniel already mentioned on the call, these teams are living an unannounced new mobile project in the Call Duty franchise, which we're very excited about. 
So as I think about the business, as we start to approach the 2-year anniversary of the launch in the West,   we think there's a lot of both near-term and long-term opportunities on the platform for us and to grow the audience and engage the audience on a broad basis. Armin, do you want to comment on the China piece?"

Now from a business perspective, China was less than 5% of our net bookings for us last year. And as you know, we have a long history of adapting   and responding to changes in the regulatory environment there. And of course, we aim to continue to do so going forward. So thanks again for your question."

Look, the good news is we're actually already vertically integrated. And we have our own in-house ads business that supports in-game advertising across our mobile games across all of the Activision Blizzard and King. The ads team have organically built our own advertising technology platform. And this is really made to enable both the demand and the supply management,  which also leverages third-party technology wherever it may make sense. This approach has actually served us really well and has enabled us to differentiate versus others in the industry.   through a much higher quality player experience, both in terms of ad formats and then also how seamlessly ads are integrated into our games. And the other thing is just the opportunity to be involved in such a premium experience for the player has actually been very well received by our brand advertising. So we have both advertisers and players who are benefiting from this experience. And I'd say that this goes beyond just King as we launch more mobile experiences, as Alan talked about earlier and across the company, we're continuing to invest in our technology platform.   And that's just to make sure that we have the capabilities to power ad monetization and cross-promotional activities across our mobile titles. 
So  I feel we're in a great position. Having built these capabilities internally. And of course, longer term, we have a great deal of optionality in terms of where we can take the platform.   And that's why we continue to invest in this area, which is critical to our business. Thanks for your question."

I want to start by making it clear to everyone that there is no place at our company where discrimination, harassment or unequal treatment of any kind will be tolerated, nowhere. We so appreciate the current and former employees who have come forward in past and recent days with courage, and I want to reiterate the commitments we have made to you.  
Our work environment, everywhere we operate, will not permit discrimination, harassment or unequal treatment. We will be the company that sets the example for this in our industry. While we've taken many steps towards this objective already, today, we are taking even more. Jennifer Oneal and Mike Ybarra have been named the new co-leads to Blizzard. Jen has been with the company for 18 years. She's the former Head of our studio Vicarious Visions and most recently had production and development oversight for our Diablo and Overwatch franchises. Mike has been in our industry for over 20 years, including in leadership roles within Microsoft Xbox division and at Blizzard as General Manager of BattleNet. I'm also pleased to have Allen Adham here today. As most of you know, Allen is one of the founders of Blizzard. After a 12-year hiatus, Allen returned to Blizzard to lead our new product and new IP incubation efforts. Each of these individuals brings vast industry experience and tremendous integrity to their roles. They are the very best examples of leadership with character and accountability.  
I'm confident this team will ensure that Blizzard provides the welcoming, comfortable and safe workplace that is essential to foster creativity and inspiration.  
In addition, we'll continue to investigate each and every claim and complaint that we receive. When we learn of shortcomings, we will take decisive action and to strengthen our capabilities in this area, we'll be adding additional staff and resources.  People will be held accountable for their actions. That commitment means that we will not just terminate employees where appropriate, but we'll also terminate any manager or leader found to have impeded the integrity of our processes for evaluating claims and imposing appropriate consequences. Because our work cannot be successful without diverse voices, views and talent, we made a commitment to consider diverse slates of candidates for all open positions, and we'll continue to add resources to ensure this occurs throughout the company.  
Over the past several years, we've made significant changes to address company culture, reflect more diversity within our leadership teams and create environments conducive to reporting any type of misconduct. We've amplified internal programs that encourage employees to report violation. We've reinforced channels for employees to voice concerns and confidential and safe ways without any fear of retaliation. We're directing additional resources to our compliance and employee relations teams dedicated to investigating complaints. We pride ourselves on paying our employees competitively and fairly for equal or substantially similar work. We regularly review our compensation to ensure that we remain equitable in our approach. We take a variety of proactive steps to ensure that pay is driven by nondiscriminatory factors such as performance, role and expertise. And we conduct extensive antidiscrimination trainings, including for all employees involved in the compensation process.  
Our workplace initiatives are crucial to our continued success and our leadership in this effort is my priority. Our workplace safety also remains our priority, and as we consider our return to work initiatives, we remain focused on providing the very best health care for our employees and their families. You have my unwavering commitment that we will continue to focus on serving our players and delivering the sustainable growth that you've come to expect. And we will take all necessary actions to foster a culture that is supportive and welcoming for all of our employees. And we expect to be the very best example for other companies to emulate.  
Daniel will now review the highlights of our operations for the past quarter with you."

There will be no tolerance at our company for harassment or unequal treatment of any kind.  
Our continued strong performance is because of the efforts of our incredibly talented people and we will make certain the workplace facilitates the best possible performance for constant improvement to our culture and unwavering conviction to our values. Now turning to the second quarter. We exceeded our prior outlook, benefiting from strong execution by our creative and commercial team in delivering compelling experiences and in-game content to our deeply engaged community. Over the last 2 years, we have increased investment in our biggest opportunity, creating new ways for our communities to engage and investing in our franchises across platforms.  
This strategy has significantly expanded the financial scale of our 3 largest franchises: Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush, and this work continued to deliver strong results in the second quarter, even as countries continue to reopen from lockdown due to the pandemic. Looking forward, we continue to transform our franchise portfolio through faster delivery of compelling premium content, more robust in-game operation, expanding to mobile and accelerating new engagement models, including free-to-play and advertising.  
Now I'll discuss our Q2 franchise and operational highlights across our business units. Starting with Activision, where 127 million monthly active users engaged in our content in the second quarter. Our commitment to delivering innovative, engaging experiences to our expanded Call of Duty ecosystem continued to deliver strong results. The franchise sustained reach, engagement and player investment well above levels seen prior to our introduction of free-to-play experiences across console, PC and mobile.  
Across the Call of Duty ecosystem, second quarter MAU were consistent versus the year ago quarter and over 3x higher than Q2 of 2019. Hours played in the franchise in the second quarter were higher than for all of 2019. We continue to see robust engagement, even as regions continue to reopen. On console and PC, MAUs and time spent across Black Ops Cold War, Modern Warfare and Warzone saw higher retention from Q1 to Q2 in our experiences in years leading up to the launch of Warzone. Conversion from Warzone again drove strong premium sales in Q2 and multiples of the level typically seen in second quarters prior to last year.  
In-game player investment remains strong, with console and PC in-game net booking, similar to that seen in the first quarter. While lower year-over-year against the quarter that benefited from the launch of Warzone and likely more people at home, in-game net bookings in the quarter were approximately 4x the level of Q2 2019.  
Our teams remain hard at work on the next new premium Call of Duty release, planned for the fourth quarter. From a setting that our fans know and love, to an incredible amount of content in development, including an extensive live ops schedule, we believe this release will be incredibly well received. In addition to launching a great, seamless experience for both current and next-gen console players, we are focused on continuing to integrate Warzone and engage our direct relationship with our player base through even deeper content integrations between the premium and free experiences and substantial innovations coming within Warzone itself. Our teams cannot wait to unveil what they have been working on.  
Call of Duty Mobile net bookings grew double digits year-over-year and sequentially, driven by strong execution in seasonal content in the West and the recent launch of the game in China. Our team continues to enhance the game, building on learnings from player data and leveraging over 15 years of Call of Duty content to deliver increasingly compelling content and driving greater player investment over time.  
As we build on this momentum, we recently added new social gameplay to the title and have new mode, map and seasonal events planned for the second half of the year. Call of Duty Mobile is on track to exceed $1 billion in consumer spending for the year. And as we continue to optimize the title, we're also investing in mobile capabilities with a singular goal to create the best mobile experiences for our community.  
We have established a new internal mobile studio and are aggressively adding mobile resources across several teams, including DNO and Activision Shanghai. Together, these teams are leading the development of an unannounced new mobile title within the Call of Duty universe that we expect will help take the franchise to new heights. Turning to Blizzard. We couldn't be more excited about the leadership changes. Jen and Mike are outstanding leaders, and we look forward to the impact they will have on the culture, accountability and fostering the very best work environment.  
The launch of Burning Crusade Classic in June marked the start of what is intended to be a very significant 18-month period for content releases. MAUs were 26 million.  
In the Warcraft franchise, World of Warcraft net bookings again grew double digits year-over-year in the second quarter, driven by the well-received launch of Burning Crusade Classic in June. Subscriber numbers and hours played were up following the release, again, showing the importance of Classic in enabling more ways for players to engage in WoW. The strength in Classic added to ongoing deep engagement in the modern game following the Q4 Shadowlands launch and the launch of its first major content update in June.  
And as a result, WoW remains on track for much stronger engagement this year than is typical outside of a modern expansion year. Elsewhere in the Warcraft Universe, Hearthstone's latest expansion, Forged in the Barrens delivered expansion over expansion net bookings growth for a second consecutive release. And with the latest expansion, United in Stormwind, launched today and Mercenaries, a new mode in the popular role-playing genre planned for the coming months, we expect Hearthstone's financial performance to strengthen in the second half of the year.  
Blizzard continues to make progress in its work on ambitious new Warcraft mobile experiences that can attract entirely new players to the franchise as well as offering new ways for existing fans to engage. Two Warcraft mobile experiences are in various stages of internal testing, with the team looking forward to sharing more about these titles soon.  
Now turning to Diablo. We have added hundreds of developers to the franchise over the last 3 years, and we continue to grow our teams as we prepare to launch 3 unique and complementary experiences across platform. Diablo II Resurrected will launch on PC and console on September 23. The anticipation for this remaster of the quintessential action role-playing game is high, and we can't wait for the community to experience the quality of the title. On mobile, Diablo Immortal continues to progress well through testing, receiving excellent feedback for its gameplay. We see substantial potential for this release, both in its own right as a long-running authentic Diablo experience and to broaden the franchise's reach ahead of Diablo IV. Recent testing revealed some exciting additional opportunities the team is going to pursue to make the title even more engaging for a wider audience. While that means the game is now planned for release in the first half of 2022, we believe these efforts will set the title up for an even greater contribution next year and beyond.  
And most importantly, Blizzard continues to make strong progress on Diablo IV. The game is shaping up incredibly well, and the team is allocating substantial resources to creating exciting content to drive engagement over multiple years. The expanded Overwatch team is similarly making strong progress on Overwatch 2, with development passing an important internal milestone in recent weeks. After a great response to the recent community update,  the team is looking forward to revealing more of the game in the coming months as they approach the later stages of production.  
At King, the team continues to execute extremely well, again delivering double-digit net bookings growth against a tough year ago comparable. MAUs were 255 million. King continued to drive growth through its work to optimize live operation, in-game economies and user acquisition for titles, particularly Candy Crush and Farm Heroes, its 2 largest franchises.  
The business saw ongoing year-over-year growth in franchise payers and investment per player in the second quarter, with CanDy Crush once again the highest grossing game franchise in the United States app stores. Building on successful initiatives to broaden its payer base over the last 2 years, the Candy Crush team has been accelerating the delivery of compelling seasonal content that delights our players and drive in-game investment.  
In the second quarter, King reached a monthly cadence for seasonal content within Candy Crush Saga, its biggest title. These seasonal events not only sustain strong engagement among existing players but also drive reengagement of lapsed players as well as attracting new players to the franchise.  
The Candy team is planning an innovative slate of seasonal events and live operations for the second half of the year, including tie-ins with brands that value the association with our premium network, positioning the franchise for ongoing momentum in its in-game business.  
Even the advertising business is also delivering. Q2 advertising revenue grew sequentially and doubled year-over-year. King's ongoing initiatives to enhance the ad platform, work with more demand partners and reach more categories of advertisers drove year-over-year growth in both volume and pricing with broad-based strength across geographies.  
In summary, Q2 was another strong quarter. We are taking actions to address stakeholder concerns and the adverse consequences to our business. If we experience prolonged periods of adverse publicity, significantly reduced productivity or other negative consequences related to this matter, our business likely would be adversely impacted. We are carefully monitoring all aspects of our business for any such impacts. From a pipeline perspective, we have strong lineup plans for the second half of the year. And as we look to 2022, our current plans contemplate compelling new experiences across Call of Duty, WoW and Candy, alongside several major new titles across PC, console and mobile from Blizzard, with the aim to deliver significant expansion in the reach and engagement of our portfolio.  
Above all, as we go forward, I want to reemphasize that the safety and well-being of our employees is of our utmost priority. Our teams are the source of all creativity and magic in our games. Now I will hand over to Armin, who will provide a detailed review of our financial results. Armin?"

I want to reiterate that our priority is ensuring a workplace that provides opportunity for all in the most welcoming and inclusive way possible. Today, I'll review our second quarter results as well as our outlook for the third quarte",1424,"Thanks, Daniel. I want to reiterate that our priority is ensuring a workplace that provides opportunity for all in the most welcoming and inclusive way possible.
 
Today, I'll review our second quarter results as well as our outlook for the third quarter and full year 2021. Our second quarter results were ahead of our prior outlook, driven by both operational outperformance and some nonoperating items. For the first half, we delivered some double-digit, year-over-year growth in net bookings and solid growth in operating income in this year. We achieved new records for each, even as we continue to increase investment in the business, and our development teams to support our strong pipeline. As Region 3 opened, our business continues to operate at significantly greater scale than that seen prior to our successful growth initiatives across our largest franchise. 
Now let me turn to our consolidated financial results. Unless otherwise indicated, I'll be referencing non-GAAP figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. 
For the quarter, we generated quarter 2 GAAP revenues of $2.30 billion, $161 million above our May guidance. This includes the net recognition of deferrals of $375 million. Net bookings of $1.92 billion were $71 million above our May outlook. And we generated quarter 2 GAAP EPS of $1.12 and core to non-GAAP EPS of $1.20, which was $0.29 above our guidance. These figures include the net recognition of deferrals of $0.29. 
Quarter 2 EPS includes a $0.07 benefit from a gain on an investment, most of which was unrealized. We also experienced a lower than effective tax rate in the quarter due to the timing of overseas tax reform. Although our full year tax rate is something that is unchanged. 
Now turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Quarter 2 operating cash flow was $388 million, lower year-over-year impacting operating results, local capital timing and the timing of cash taxes. During the quarter, we paid an annual dividend of $0.47 per share, 15% higher year-over-year for a total of $365 million. Our cash and investments at the end of June were approximately $9.6 billion, and we ended the quarter with a net cash position of approximately $6 million. Now let me turn to our segment results.  Activision delivered another strong quarter, contributing to record first half segment revenue and operating income. Quarter 2 revenue was $789 million. As expected, Call of Duty revenue on PC and console was lower year-over-year against last year's quarter 2 that benefited from the March 2020 launches of Warzone and Modern Warfare Remastered as well as the introduction of [indiscernible]. However, Call of Duty Mobile grew strongly year-over-year. Quarter 2 segment operating income was $363 million, with an operating margin of 46%. 
Listed revenue was $433 million, with double-digit year-over-year growth in World of Warcraft, offset by product timing for Hearthstone and lower overseas revenues as explained in prior quarters. 
Operating income was $141 million with an operating margin of 53%, reflecting investments into product development against the risk content pipeline as well as sales and marketing around the launch of Burning Crusade at quarter end. King revenue grew 15% year-over-year to $635 million. This is another new record, driven by double-digit in-game revenue growth for Candy Crush and Farm Hero. 
Advertising revenue doubled year-over-year and trailing fourth quarter advertising revenue is now above $300 million for the first time. King operating margin was also strong at 39%, delivering record operating income at $248 million. 
Across our segments, strong execution in live operations and in-game content drove in-game net bookings to a combined $1.32 billion, broadly consistent with the level of the prior 4 quarters and almost 70% of total net bookings this quarter, the in-game business represents a recurring base of profitability for the company with a significant opportunity for further growth in both existing and new franchise experiences. Finally, the second quarter saw strong double-digit year-over-year growth in mobile net bookings, which exceeded a $3 billion annualized run rate for the first time this quarter. The mobile platform delivered more than 40% of total net bookings and is a key strategic priority for us as we expand each of our key franchises to mobile in the coming years. 
Now let me turn to our outlook for the third quarter and the full year. With regard to our slate, our expanded teams are focused on delivering epic in-game and upcoming content. 
In the third quarter, Activision fifth seasonal content for Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Warzone launches later this month. And the team will continue to release significant new features, events and seasons for Call of Duty Mobile. Today, Blizzard released Hearthstone's latest expansion, United in Stormwind. Diablo II: Resurrected, will launch on September 23. And King will support Candy Crush and other games across this portfolio with numerous seasonal events, features and innovative live operations. In the fourth quarter, in addition to ongoing [indiscernible] and in-game content across the portfolio, we're looking forward to Activision launching new core premium content alongside major new income experiences to Warcraft. These are the most important releases of the year for us, and we can't wait to show the community what our teams have been working on. 
In the second half, we will also continue to refine and test new mobile content in our pipeline, including for both Warcraft and Diablo. Consistent with our prior outlook, we don't include material revenue from new mobile titles in our guidance for the current year. 
Now before I discuss the specifics of our outlook,  let me provide some context. We are taking substantial actions to address the concerns of employees and other key stakeholders. While there are risks that our business could be adversely impacted as Daniel discussed, currently, our business performance is strong. In the third quarter, we expect ongoing robust performance for Call of Duty, Candy and World of Warcraft, to be complemented by the launch of the Diablo II: Resurrected. While we are taking a prudent approach to our outlook, we do expect year-over-year net bookings growth in the third quarter. We will increase investments in the quarter in our product suite, compliance, employee relations and sales and marketing to help unlock the full potential of our franchises heading into 2022. 
As we move into the fourth quarter, where we continue to invest in the business, we expect lower costs and growth in earnings year-over-year. Finally, as mentioned, we experienced an investment gain in the second quarter, which we are passing through in our outlook based on evaluation at the end of July. Bringing this all together, we are once again raising our outlook for net bookings, revenue and EPS for the year. 
Now let me get into some specifics. For quarter 3 on a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $1.97 billion, including the net recognition of deferrals of $120 million. We expect net bookings of $1.85 billion. We expect a GAAP operating margin of 35%, a tax rate of 22%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 785 million and EPS of 60%. For quarter 3 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect a tax rate of 20% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.75, including the net recognition of $0.10. 
Now turning to the fiscal year. On a GAAP basis for 2021, we expect revenues of $8.52 billion, including net defers of $135 million. We now expect net bookings of $8.65 billion. We expect the GAAP operating margin of 37%, a GAAP tax rate of 21%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 785 million and GAAP EPS of  $3.08. For 2021 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect a tax rate of 20% and non-GAAP EPS of $3.54, including net deferrals of $0.22. 
In closing, our business continues to perform well in the second quarter, delivering strong results. We will continue investing in our creative team and positioning our franchisees for even greater reach and engagement in the future, with our current plans continuing to support growth in our financial performance in 2022. Look, as Bob and Daniel made it clear, we understand that our people are our greatest asset. These are the people responsible for our continued strong performance. We couldn't be more committed to ensuring an inclusive work environment for all our employees as well as the long-term sustainable growth. We'll be working with our team to improve our company together, to become the most inspiring and inclusive entertainment company possible.

As you heard from Bobby, our employees are truly our greatest asset. And we remain absolutely focused as a leadership team on providing a diverse and a safe environment for our teams and have taken a number of actions thus far. For instance, we've engaged an outside law firm to conduct a review of our policies and procedures with respect to our workplace and where employees can connect if they have experienced any issues whatsoever. 
We will also be adding staff to our compliance and employee relations teams that investigate employee concerns. This is to ensure that we are always considering also diverse candidates for all open positions. As a Hispanic leader myself, I know how important having a diverse workforce can be for all aspects of our business, and this is critical. 
We will be evaluating and training also our people managers to make sure they are compliant with our processes for handling employee concerns as well as taking the right actions, and we are proactively engaging with our employees to hear and respond to their feedback for several years now, we have been focused on ensuring more diversity throughout the company, especially in our leadership roles and have dramatically increased the number of women and minorities in both the C-suite and in our business unit. And our compensation practice is that women and men are paid equitably for equal work. 
As you heard, we have appointed Jen Oneal and Mike Ybarra as the new co-leads at Blizzard, and I am so glad that an original Blizzard founder, Allen Adham, who returned to the company a few years ago, continues to lead our game incubation projects. We have a great leadership bench at Blizzard and are excited about the new direction the company will take. 
Also, we are committed to an equitable and safe work environment, and that's what's important. As we evolve our company, you should expect further announcements from us going forward. 
Now to answer your question on productivity and pipeline, as you heard today, the pipeline is progressing well. In particular, some of the content in the pipeline has been in development for many years, and it is approaching the final stages of production. We're monitoring the impact of recent events, obviously, as we discussed today. But based on what we see currently, we have a strong lineup planned for the second half of the year. And as we look into 2022, we're currently planning for several new titles across PC, console and mobile from Blizzard, alongside more great experiences from Call of Duty, Candy and Warcraft. Thanks for the question."

And these trends can vary across platforms, gameplay types and numerous other factors. More specifically, when we look at some of our largest franchises, we actually saw minimal variations in engagement and player investment as countries reopened. 
And even though we did see some variation, they were small relative to the structural growth we have seen on the business in the last year or 2. Look, what's really key is that when we look at the data, we see that product and other initiatives are the bigger determinant of reach and engagement. So we do believe that much of the expansion we have seen in our largest franchises is due to strong product initiatives, more frequent life operation and new engagement models, all of which we have started to successfully implement. Examples of that include the introduction of free-to-play experiences on mobile and on Warzone Call of Duty; the launch of Classics on World of Warcraft and more frequent compelling content on Candy. And as a result, we are operating at much greater scale and continue to have momentum as evidenced by our quarter 2 results as well as trends into July. 
Now as it relates to guidance, we are always thoughtful and careful in our approach. We assume lockdown campaigns continue to moderate in the third quarter. And of course, we are monitoring any impact of recent trends as discussed. But as you've heard, we still expect year-over-year growth in net booking as these initiatives continue to deliver results and we start to generate a return from our many years of work to reinvigorate Diablo. 
Finally, looking forward, we see a long-term trend of more people gaming than ever before across genres, platforms, business models and geographies. And as you know, we already operate successfully today across many of these growth vectors. So we are very well positioned to continue to grow in this market environment. Next, we believe growth is largely in our own hands, and our talented employees and teams. Thanks again for your question, Mike."

I am constantly inspired by our talented teams, their creative vision, their commitment to putting gameplay first. Our people are passionate about our games. They understand our players. And in many cases  They have come from the player communities themselves and naturally are driven to serve them.  And as Bobby and Daniel have mentioned, we are expanding these teams, and we're doubling down on our development recruiting as we expand the scope and vision of our franchises.

And before I get to it, I just do want to throw in some of the overarching comments, which I think are important as it relates to Activision Publishing as well. Obviously, there's no place for any harassment or discrimination whatsoever of any kind in society, in this industry or in this company. And so making sure we have a safe, inclusive and equitable environment for all of our employees is really the only way we can begin to live up to the values we aspire to, and it's the only way we can become the company we aspire to be. So that is first and foremost on our minds, is our focus at the moment. 
Now turning back to answer your question directly. We do feel really good about what Sledgehammer Games is leading for release in the fourth quarter of this year. The studio itself has never been bigger or stronger. Now with its teams in Foster City, in Melbourne and also now in Toronto. And across all modes of play, across multiplayer, across campaign and across co-op, development is coming along really well, and we're going to be sharing those details   with the community very soon. 
Content-wise, it's a really robust game at launch across all the modes. And the good news for us right now is, we've gotten farther ahead on our live ops planning for supporting the community post launch, and the community should also expect that support to be very, very significant. We've learned a lot over the last couple of years, and that's all in our plans as we go forward.   
We also have really exciting new plans in Warzone, which Raven is leading. Now together with our premium release, we've had some really fun and what I consider the most significant updated plan for the community across both Warzone and premium as we head into the fall.   
Now I do want to mention just a huge thanks to all of our amazing studios who have come together in amazing ways to drive the franchise for this year and for this fall and for beyond. They're doing incredible work together as a team and also as independent studios.   
And finally, touching on your question on competition. I think competition is really out there each and every year for us. And I think we consider it a good thing for the industry and for our players. And to us, it's not a zero-sum game at all. We believe compelling new offerings have the potential to only grow the industry as we move them forward. So our focus is really the same as it's been each and every year, and that's making sure we provide the most fun, the most incredible and the most innovative experiences we can to our community as we go forward. And when we look at the breadth, depth and quality of content that our teams are delivering in Q4 across all our offerings, we do like our position a lot, but thanks for the question, Matt."

As you saw from our results, the IDFA changes really haven't had much of an impact on our business and actually even less of an impact than we expected. So firstly, on the advertising side, we're still early in building this business, and we're just seeing great results as we grow both the supply and the demand. On the supply side, we've been introducing innovative new products and have started letting players watch more ads if they wish to, growing our ad inventory in a way that's really consistent with our focus of really not impacting the player experience, and that's worked out really well. 
On the demand side, we're working with more demand partners and more categories of advertisers, driving more volume and price competition, and this really has been very impactful. We're also working hard to maximize the consent rates following the IDFA changes and have seen much better-than-expected results there. So as we said last quarter, we really still see a long runway for growth in ad. 
Now secondly, in terms of user acquisition, again, if you look at the results, you can see the ongoing strength of the business. Most of our installs each quarter are organic as we benefit from just the incredible awareness that our brands have globally, particularly a game like Candy. And our increasingly frequent live events are also just great vehicles for driving organic installs as well. And we have direct relationships with many of our most valuable players. And that allows us to reengage them if they lap and to really have a direct connection with them. 
Now in terms of paid acquisition, we saw plenty of ways to bring players into the network, even following these changes on 1 particular platform.   And the great growth we're seeing in player investment really actually enables us to invest in even more ROI-positive marketing while still delivering strong profits for each quarter. So again, more than comfortable in King's ability to deliver sustained growth and in-game business, even after these changes and the results, I think, bear fruit to what I just said. Thanks for your question, Tyler."

Let me address the first part of your question on COD Mobile specifically.   And then maybe I'll invite Armin or someone else to chime in on a more macro view on China and any potential restrictions there. 
On mobile for us, we see 3 key opportunities kind of going forward. And I'd say those could be bucketed as geographic, operational and strategic, and let me touch on each of those. On the geographic front, for Call of Duty Mobile, we're seeing, obviously, great success in the U.S. and through Europe, and we're also continuing to optimize across those regions,  but we're seeing also great growth in emerging markets such as Latin America, India and Southeast Asia. And where we're focusing execution and investment for local players. And so that's something they can still scale and help grow the business overall.   
On the operational side, Call of Duty Mobile is already a great game, and we see opportunity to make it even better. Our mobile team is continuing to do an incredible job of constantly improving the experience and adding content to players in the west. And the team just keeps getting better and better, which is a testament to their passion and commitment to the mobile community. And China is just another example there where the title itself is off to a strong start, but still has a lot of opportunity in front of it to be tailored and optimized for the local audience. And the team is also very focused on that as well. 
And then lastly is strategic. As we think about long term, where we see a compelling -- more compelling growth on the platform. And overall, I'd say we believe there's an opportunity to better connect mobile to the overall quality of the ecosystem, and we're aggressively hiring talent to help on this journey for us. We've created our own internal mobile studio and are driving a major recruiting effort across Beenox and Activision Shanghai to support as well. And together, I think as Daniel already mentioned on the call, these teams are living an unannounced new mobile project in the Call Duty franchise, which we're very excited about. 
So as I think about the business, as we start to approach the 2-year anniversary of the launch in the West, we think there's a lot of both near-term and long-term opportunities on the platform for us and to grow the audience and engage the audience on a broad basis. Armin, do you want to comment on the China piece?"

And this is really made to enable both the demand and the supply management, which also leverages third-party technology wherever it may make sense. This approach has actually served us really well and has enabled us to differentiate versus others in the industry.   through a much higher quality player experience, both in terms of ad formats and then also how seamlessly ads are integrated into our games. 
And the other thing is just the opportunity to be involved in such a premium experience for the player, has actually been very well received by our brand advertising. So we have both advertisers and players who are benefiting from the experience.

As I said during our last earnings call, I want Activision Blizzard to be the leader in our industry for workplace culture. Since then, the leadership team and I have been hard at work listening",979,"Thank you, Chris, and thank you all for joining us today. 
As I said during our last earnings call, I want Activision Blizzard to be the leader in our industry for workplace culture. Since then, the leadership team and I have been hard at work listening to employees and implementing meaningful changes. I'd like to review the actions we've taken over the past few months with you today. As we've made clear in certain instances relating to workplace culture, we should have done a better job ensuring our values were embraced across all parts of the company. Over the last few years, we've been focused on the improvements that are necessary to become a model workplace. We are, of course, taking these actions because any single instance of wrongful conduct at our company is unacceptable. But these actions we're taking are also the right ones for our business success. We can't achieve our business ambitions without the very best talent. People with the talents we need have more alternatives for highly paid work opportunities than ever before. If we don't constantly evolve as a great place to work, we won't retain or attract the talent we need to realize our tremendous potential. As a company, we have more opportunities ahead of us than I've seen in almost all the years I've led the company. The success we've achieved thus far is the result of an overwhelmingly large number of extraordinarily talented people with high integrity and good values focused on delivering great games to our players, which has resulted in superior shareholder returns. This company and many of its leaders and so many of our talented employees, past and present, have shown strength of will, dedicated to the achievement of bold aspirations. Our commitment to make Activision Blizzard the most welcoming and inclusive company in the world will be accomplished the same way our industry leadership has been accomplished, focusing commitment, persistence, strength of will, the unwavering ambition of truly talented people with equally unwavering integrity and the continuous commitments to improvement. In September, we announced a comprehensive agreement with the U.S. Equal Opportunity Commission, which is subject to court approval to strengthen policies and programs intended to further improve the prevention of harassment, discrimination and related conduct. As part of this agreement, we'll establish an [ $80 million ] fund to compensate those who have experienced such behavior at our company. With respect to pay equity, another critically important issue that we have always worked hard to ensure we achieve we recently disclosed to employees the results of a review of 2020 pay equity in our company, which was conducted by an independent research firm. The U.S. analysis showed that women on average earned slightly more than men for comparable work in 2020. And we're committed to compensation remaining equitable for men and women performing comparable work always. 
Last week, we also announced a number of important new workplace initiatives. We announced the 0 tolerance harassment policy company-wide. This includes tougher rules and greater consistency across the organization to make certain reports are always properly and promptly handled. Now any Activision Blizzard employees found through our new investigative processes and resources to have retaliated against anyone for making a compliance complaint will be terminated immediately. In many other instances of workplace misconduct, we will no longer rely on written warnings, terminations will be the outcome, including in most cases of harassment based on any legally protected category. Future employment contracts and equity awards will state the termination for these reasons will result in immediate forfeiture of future compensation. Another is our pledge to increase the percentage of women and nonbinary people in our workforce by 50%. Today, approximately 23% of our global employee population identifies as women or nonbinary. So within the next 5 years and hopefully faster, we will seek to increase our percentage of women and nonbinary professionals to more than 1/3 across the entire company. To further this commitment, we'll be investing an additional $250 million over the next 10 years in initiatives that foster expanded opportunities in gaming and technology for underrepresented communities. Additionally, based on feedback from many employees, we are waiving required arbitration of future individual sexual harassment and discrimination claims. That means for any employee who chooses not to arbitrate an individual claim with sexual harassment, a lawful discrimination or related retaliation arising in the future, the company will waive any obligation to do so. 
As we report regularly on our progress in our financial results, you will continue to hear more about our workplace initiatives which we firmly believe will help us remain one of the world's most successful entertainment companies. I want to thank our employees for their continued commitment to each other, the company and our players. For those employees past and present who have been brave enough to step forward and share their stories, we continue to be committed to investigating all claims thoroughly and holding people accountable. For those employees who have shared feedback, thoughts, suggestions, concerns and complaints and there are many of you, we hope you can see from our actions that we are listening. We are evolving our organization through your ideas and active participation in their execution. And for those employees who have worked tirelessly to deliver great experiences to our players, your resilience in these challenging times is inspiring. We expect that we'll continue to face challenging and negative media attention regardless of our progress, but we are determined to stay focused on providing great opportunities in the very best work environment for our talented employees to deliver the very best gain for our players and to continue to provide superior returns for our shareholders. 
Thank you for your participation today. And now I'll turn the call over to Daniel to share the results of our operations for the last quarter."

Before I discuss our operating results, I want to take this opportunity to thank our incredibly talented teams across the entire company who share the passion to make exciting and groundbreaking experiences for our players all around t",2065,"Thank you, Bobby. 
Before I discuss our operating results, I want to take this opportunity to thank our incredibly talented teams across the entire company who share the passion to make exciting and groundbreaking experiences for our players all around the world. Activision Blizzard's third quarter results were above our outlook. Our monthly active users and time spent in our content were consistent with the year ago level, even as regions continue to reopen while net bookings and operating income grew year-over-year. This performance again, illustrates the structural expansion in our largest franchises as we execute our strategy of delivering gaming experiences across new platforms with more regular content and leveraging multiple commercialization models, including free-to-play. Execution against this strategy enables us to grow our communities, including in geographies outside of our traditional regions to deepen engagement and to create more opportunities for player investment. Critical to this is a continued investment in creative talent. We continue to grow our developer headcount in the third quarter and have increased our development organization by hundreds of talented professionals year-to-date, including announcing new studios and expansions in multiple new cities globally. This geographic diversification strategy is paying dividends, allowing us to tap into critical talent pools in all corners of the world. As we grow our teams with new hires, we are keenly aware of the importance and responsibility we have to ensure a safe working environment for our people. This is our #1 priority. 
Specifically, in recent months, we have taken actions that resulted in the departure of a number of individuals across the company. Additionally, we have seen increased competition in the market for our talent and higher voluntary turnover that has partly offset our success in hiring. As we have worked with new leadership on Blizzard and within the franchises themselves, particularly in certain key creative roles, it's become apparent that some of the Blizzard content plan for next year will benefit from more development time to reach its full potential. While we are still planning to deliver a substantial amount of content from Blizzard next year, we are now planning for a later launch for Overwatch 2 and Diablo 4 than originally envisaged. These are 2 of the most eagerly anticipated titles in the industry, and our teams have made great strides towards completion in recent quarters. But we believe giving the team some extra time to complete production and continue growing their creative resources to support the titles after launch, we'll ensure that these releases delight and engage their communities for many years into the future. These decisions will push out the financial uplift that we had expected to see next year, but we are confident that this is the right course of action for our people, our players and the long-term success of our franchises. 
Now I will cover our third quarter franchise and operational highlights across our business units. Starting with Activision, where, on average, 119 million people engage in our content monthly in the third quarter. Call of Duty continues to sustain reach, engagement and player investment well above levels seen prior to our introduction of free-to-play experiences across console, PC and mobile. Monthly active users in the franchise were consistent year-over-year on console, PC and grew our mobile. Console and PC engagement trends were consistent with typical trends as we moved away from the premium launch even as regions continue to reopen through the quarter. Console and PC now and time spent exhibited very similar retention from Q2 to Q3 as our experiences in prior years. In-game player investment on console and PC remained well above pre-war zone levels at approximately 3x the level of Q3 2019 and strong conversion from free-to-play drove premium sales higher than in any third quarter prior, the launch of Warzone. 
And our teams are all set to launch the next phase of exciting new Call of Duty content for players worldwide. This Friday sees the release of Call of Duty, Vanguard. And on December 2, we will roll out Call of Duty, Warzone Pacific, the biggest update to the Wars on experience since launch. As we've demonstrated with Modern Warfare and Black Ops: Cold War, the release of Vanguard is just the first step in delivering the community an incredible amount of ongoing content, live engagements and much more. Across Campaign, Zombies, Multiplayer and War Zone, there's no bigger experience or better value over the duration of the game's life cycle across our premium and free-to-play business. And then we expect Warzone Pacific and its new Caldera map to take the free-to-play experience to another level. The premium and free-to-play experiences are more integrated than ever before sharing the same engine, weapon integration and content integration as well as Call of Duty standards of cross-play, cross-progression and more. Both titles are set to benefit from Ricochet, a new anti-cheat technology aimed at addressing one of the key improvements requested by the community. We are confident that our players are in store for an incredible set of experiences this holiday season and beyond. 
On mobile, Call of Duty net bookings grew over 40% year-over-year in the third quarter, driven by double-digit growth in the West and a continued contribution from the game in China. The team continues to refine the player experience, building on learnings from the title's first 2 years to optimize content, events and features our communities around the world. And at the same time, we continue to ramp our teams working on new mobile title within the Call of Duty universe. 
In addition to hiring a substantial number of developers over the last quarter, we were pleased to announce last week the acquisition of Digital Legends, a Barcelona-based mobile game developer that will further bolster the world-class team we are assembling. 
Turning to Blizzard. Monthly active users were 26 million in the third quarter. For Diablo, our plan to deliver an era of unprecedented levels of content for the franchise has experienced a strong start with the September release of the Alpha 2: Resurrected, the return of one of the most acclaimed titles in PC gaming history. First week of sales of the title were the highest recorded for Remaster from our company, and we have seen strong ongoing demand, particularly in Korea, where the game is proving 1 of the most popular titles in Internet game rooms. 
With such strong engagement, the team is now working hard to ensure that players have the smoothest possible experience as they explore the world of Sanctuary. This is just the first step in Blizzard's plans for the franchise. On mobile, Diablo Mortal is in public testing and remains on track for release in the first half of next year. And with Diablo 4 set to be the foundation for great experiences for PC and console fans over many years, we believe the pieces are in place to expand and serve the Diablo community better than ever before. 
Turning to Overwatch, where millions of people continue to engage in both the game and esport. September saw the grand finals of the or watch League become the most watched in league's history. Starting in the spring, the next season of Overwatch League will run on an early build of Overwatch 2's new 5V5 competitive multiplayer mode, giving the community a fantastic view into the development team's strong work of an next iteration in the franchise, and the team plans to follow this with new content and initiatives to engage existing returning and new overwatch players next year. 
Within the Warcraft franchise, Oral Warcraft reach and engagement continues to benefit from the combination of the modern game and classic under a single subscription. The 2 games offer players more ways to engage and create more opportunities for our teams to deliver compelling experiences to fans of the franchise. With deep engagement across both classic and modern, WOW!'s overall subscriber base is stronger than we typically see at this point after a modern expansion launch. And for 2021, Global Warcraft is on track to deliver its strongest engagement in net bookings outside of a modern expansion year in a decade. Our WoW team has been rolling out numerous quality of life improvements across the modern and classic games franchise in response to player feedback. And today, the modern game released its latest content update with classic soon-to-launch fresh servers, with greater challenges to engage the passionate community. Heartstone net bookings were stable year-over-year in the third quarter. And in October, the team launched Mercenaries, an innovative role-playing mode that gives the Heartstone community an entirely new way to play the game. Initial results from Mercenaries have been very encouraging, and we believe Heartstone is positioned for a return to year-over-year growth in net bookings in the fourth quarter. Across the Warcraft franchise, our teams are working on a substantial pipeline of content planned for next year. including experiences in classic and modern WoW, more innovations in Heartstone and getting all new mobile Warcraft content into players hands for the first time. Blizzard cannot wait to share more details on their plans.
The King business continues to deliver fantastic results with very strong year-over-year trends for both in-app purchases and advertising. Now [indiscernible] $245 million in the third quarter. Kim's deep capabilities of live operations are driving engagement from both existing and new players. Hours played across the King portfolio grew year-over-year in the third quarter, with players responding positively to a more frequent cadence of compelling in-game content and events for key titles. The team's prior actions to grow payer conversion alongside ongoing strong execution and user acquisition, saw payer numbers growing by a double-digit percentage versus the year ago quarter. These initiatives drove over 20% year-over-year growth in in-game net bookings for Candy Crush with Candy once again the top grossing game franchise in the U.S. app stores.
Additionally, at the end of the third quarter, King launched the -- All Stars U.S. tournament, a competitive event that saw Kandi Crassaga players battle to be crowned the Ultimate Candy Crush Allstar. The event has driven meaningful increases in installs, rounds played and in-app purchases in recent weeks, highlighting competitive gameplay is another opportunity for franchise growth and our investment in the Candy Crush brand.
In addition to this innovation and success at Candy, for several quarters now, King has been accelerating and refining content delivery in Farm Heroes, its second largest franchise. This work continued to bear fruit in Q3 and year-to-date in-game net bookings have grown around 20% year-over-year. And finally, King's advertising business again grew robustly, with quarterly revenue growing sequentially and year-over-year to a new high. Both volume and pricing grew strongly year-over-year, benefiting from the team's growing relationships with demand partners and the ongoing ramp of new categories of advertisers. In summary, saw solid year-over-year growth in the business, and we see substantial growth ahead for our portfolio of internally owned IP. While we have seen some slippage in the release schedule for specific titles at Blizzard, we could not be more excited about our plans to unlock the full potential of our largest franchises and to drive meaningful expansion in our reach, engagement and operating performance. This is only possible because of our teams. I want to share an announcement about the leadership of 1 of those teams. Jen O'Neil, who has been co-lead of Blizzard has been a passionate advocate for bringing positive changes to the video gaming industry and has been doing so as Board member of Women in Gaming International, or WIGI, a nonprofit organization that cultivates and advances the quality and diversity in the global games industry. Jen has decided to leave the company at the end of the year, and we have agreed to support Gen in our involvement with Wig by making a donation to WIGI and honor of gen. In her remaining months with the company, given their commitment to this work, Jen will build the foundation of programs funded by the grant. As such, Mike Ybarra will take on Jen's leadership responsibilities. It is great to see how employees at our company are committed to bring about the positive changes in our industry and beyond, and our leadership team stands behind these efforts. Now I will hand over to Armin, who will provide more color on our financial results and outlook, Armin?"

First, I'd like to reiterate that ensuring a workplace that provides opportunity for all in the most welcome an inclusive way is our top priority. Today, I'll review our third quarter results as well as outlook for the fourth quarter and",1432,"Thanks, Daniel. 
First, I'd like to reiterate that ensuring a workplace that provides opportunity for all in the most welcome an inclusive way is our top priority. Today, I'll review our third quarter results as well as outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2021. Our third quarter results were ahead of our prior outlook -- with year-over-year growth in net bookings, revenue, operating income and EPS against difficult year ago comparable. Importantly, each of these metrics has also grown year-over-year on a year-to-date basis. So even as region continue to reopen, our business is operating at significantly greater scale and that in prior to our successful growth initiatives across our largest franchises. 
Let me start with our consolidated financial results. Unless otherwise indicated, I be referencing non-GAAP figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation. Now for the quarter, we generated quarter 3 GAAP revenues of $2.07 billion, $100 million above out order outlook. This includes the net recognition of deferrals of $190 million. Net bookings of $1.88 billion were $30 million above our August outlook. And we generated growth with GAAP EPS of $0.82 and quarter 3 non-GAAP EPS of $0.89, which was $0.14 above our guidance. 
These figures include the net recognition of deferral of $0.17. Quarter 3 EPS included [ 33 ] from an unrealized loss on investment as well as the benefit from a lower-than-anticipated tax rate in the quarter. 
Now turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Quarter 3 operating cash flow was $521 million, more than double the year ago level, driven by lower cash taxes and favorable working capital movements. Our cash and investments at the end of September were approximately $10 billion, and we ended the quarter with a net cash position of approximately $6.4 billion. Growing shareholder value through capital allocation is a key focus for us. And over the long term, investors should expect a balanced approach across investing in credit talent in our own business, strategic M&A and returning cash to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. 
Now let me turn to our segment results. Activision revenue was $641 million. Segment revenue was lower year-over-year as expected in our outlook. This was due to the launch of Tony Hawk in the year ago quarter and declines in [indiscernible] upfront in Indian net bookings against the quarter that benefited from Chief Monday and the early ramp of Water. Year-to-date, net bookings for the acquisition segment and the Call of Duty franchise were higher year-over-year. with a franchise now consistently operating at greater scale than before our free-to-play and mobile initiatives. Activision's third quarter operating income was $244 million and operating margin was 38%. Blizzard revenue of $493 million grew 20% year-over-year, driven by the successful launch of Diablo II: Resurrected. Year-to-date, net bookings for liters and for water Warcraft its largest fences were higher year-over-year. This first quarter operating income was $188 million with an operating margin of 38%. King delivered another record quarter. Revenue grew 22% year-over-year to $652 million. That's a new high. First quarter India net bookings grew in the mid-teens year-over-year, while advertising were approximately 60%. King's first quarter operating income was a record $303 million. with an operating margin of 46%. The team's strong execution across live operations, marketing and advertising both records for both revenue and operating income. -- for the first quarter and year-to-date. King's ability to delight and engage players with robust life operation provides a lot of learning that we time to apply to both active and business and not just in mobile. Looking across our segments, in-game net bookings were $1.2 billion, roughly flat year-over-year and approximately $500 million higher than the level of quarter 3 of 2019. And during the third quarter, mobile net bookings grew over 20% year-over-year, driven by the strength of both Activision and King. Consumer spending and advertising within our mobile content was almost $1 billion in the quarter. And we see substantial room for further growth as we take each of our key franchises to the largest and fastest-growing platform, leveraging our creative and life operations capabilities of Activision, Blizzard and semi. 
Now let me turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year. With regard to our slate, in addition to ongoing live ops and Indian content across the portfolio, the fourth quarter will be active in relief Call of Duty Banker this Friday, November 5, followed by the biggest water update yet wasn't specific on December 2. This has launched a new mercenary mode in Heartstone in mid-October, and we released the next Hearthstone expansion later this quarter. And Kim continues to support candy crush and other games across the portfolio with numerous seasonal events and new features. Our team has done a phenomenal job building this content, even if many of them continue to work from home, and we can't wait for our players to get their hands on this experience. With that said. we remain prudent in our revenue assumptions for the fourth quarter. And regarding costs, we have decided to further step up investment in mobile marketing. The strong returns we are currently seeing. -- and into compliance in [indiscernible]. We expect the earnings impact of these investments to be affected by a lower tax rate, and we continue to expect full year earnings per share to be up strongly year-over-year and comfortably ahead of the outlook provided at the beginning of the year. 
Now let me get into the Specifics. For quarter 4, on a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $2.02 billion, including net deferrals of $763 million. We expect net bookings of $2.78 billion. We expect GAAP operating margin of 30%, a tax rate of 26%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of $785 million and EPS of $0.54. For quarter 4 and non-GAAP basis, we expect a tax rate of 25% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.62, including net deferrals of $0.67. This means that on a GAAP basis for 2021, we now expect revenues of $8.66 billion, including the net recognition of deferrals of $10 million. We now expect net bookings of $8.65 billion. We expect GAAP operating margin a GAAP tax rate of 18%; GAAP and non-GAAP share count of $184 million and GAAP EPS of $3.27. For 2021, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect a tax rate and non-GAAP EPS of $3.70, including net deferrals of $0.06. 
With respect to risks, as you've heard, we're taking action to the stakeholder concerns and the adverse consequences to our business from growth rate issues. If we experience further adverse publicity regarding our company and executives, increased competition for talent higher voluntary turnover, significantly reduced productivity for other negative consequences relating to these issues, our business likely would be adversely invested. But therefore, carefully monitoring all aspects of our business by such impact, and we're taking action to help address them. 
Now I'd also like to provide an update on how we are planning for next year specifically. At the starting point, our business continues to operate at much greater scale. And we have clear minus sight to expanding the reach, engagement and financial performance of our business further in the coming years. as we have signed a framework that has worked so well for colocating cameras to other franchisees in our portfolio. 
At the same time, as Daniel described, we've taken a decision to give the overtime the extra time they need to deliver the experiences that their communities to serve and to set the franchise is up for maximum success over a multiyear period. We, therefore, are currently not planning for material contribution from over to the 4 in 2012. While this development will push out the financial uplift that we are expected to see next year, we firmly believe that this is the right course of action for our people for the long-term success of this franchise and for our shareholders. We still have a lot of content in the pipeline for next year for our largest franchisees that we can't wait to unveil and we'll provide more color on that in the provider fully outlook in early February. 
In conclusion, we see substantial opportunity for shareholder value creation ahead to unlocking the full potential of our portfolio. It will only be possible because of our people, and we remain focused on ensuring a safe working environment that is essential to enable creativity and professional growth for all employees.

I feel very good about the progress actually. Right now, workplace leadership is my focus. Our opportunities for growth, as we've talked about, have never been better, but we won't be able to realize all that growth potential without talent. And to retain and attract the talent we need, we obviously have to be recognized as the very best place to work. This means we have to be the most welcoming, inclusive embark. And we've got to have the best industry-leading programs for growth and development, we've got to have the best recruiting capabilities for the diverse talent we need to create the very best games, and we have to have competitive compensation that is aligned with performance. If you think about it, over the last 30 years, we've shown that we can consistently create the very best games, and that has always translated into long-term shareholder returns that are far greater than the S&P 500 and compared to most companies. And we believe that superior shareholder returns will continue to be delivered through our franchise strategies, the operational excellence that we're recognized for. And we also recognize that to achieve the same level of shareholder returns we have historically and to ensure continued excellence in execution. We believe we -- and all great companies need to deliver workplace excellence. This means some of the things that we've discussed over the last few weeks about harassment and discrimination free work environments, recruiting excellence to ensure we have diverse skills, abilities and talent and a culture that celebrates the rewards commitment to these principles, I couldn't be more passionate and committed to being the most performance-focused, welcoming and inclusive company in entertainment. What you heard me discuss earlier is just the beginning of the actions that we intend to take to achieve that objective. And of course, we need accountability. So we'll continue to provide regular progress in updates both quarterly to our shareholders as well as annually in our ESG reports and we'll be monitoring the progress of our business units, our franchise teams and our functional leaders with respect to workplace initiatives, and that status will also be reported to our employees quarterly. Right now and going forward, communicating with our employees and getting feedback has been a crucial part of the process. We'll obviously continue to keep our investors informed, but the work that we've done with our employees has resulted in very constructive new initiatives more that we'll continue to announce over the next few months, but the long answer to your question is I feel good about the progress that we're making.

Since becoming the co-leader of Board 3 months ago and meeting with teams around the company, I have been impressed by their passion for what they are creating and their drive to build a more inclusive culture. Looking at our upcoming releases across all of our teams here at Blizzard, we have a deep bench of veteran development talent, and we have new leadership on both Overwatch 2 and Diablo 4, both our season buzzer developers with over 30 years experience at the company between them.

We looked at what was left in the final phases of production with fresh eyes, and we saw that allowing the teams more time would enable both great experiences at launch and they also help ensure that everything will be in place to engage the communities for many years to come. This extra time will also help us continue significantly increasing the size of our development teams ahead of the launch. Again, to ensure we are following up the releases of substantial content to continue delighting the community. We're not sharing release dates at this time, but I have absolute confidence in these new leaders and their teams to deliver. They care deeply about creating high-quality products and allowing everyone on their teams to bring their best sales to their projects."

As you can see from the Q3 results, had a terrific quarter and kind of achieved its highest revenue quarter since the acquisition. So let me focus in on that in our performance specifically. There are a number of initiatives that have really been contributing to the success over the recent quarters and will carry out into the future. We've increased the optimizations that we put in the game. So we think about this as outdoor journey and we've continued to improve that player journey with strong life of execution. This benefits across cohorts of players. So we've delivered compelling content and events more frequently across all of our key titles. So to give you an example, in Candy, we've increased that engagement by further developing the condensate into monthly seasonal events that really draw in new and existing players and provide fund experience across the board. With this quarter, we've complemented that with the launch of the Candy All Stars competition in the U.S. and we've seen some very strong initial results across reach, engagement and player investment. We feel -- we also found a successful formula over the past 12 months to invest and grow live ops -- And we're now applying that with great results, not just in candy, but across other games too. So our second biggest franchise, for example, Conners over the past few quarters, we've been delivering this content cadence and great events and the farm season pass. And we've seen the results from that as well. Our in-app growth in farm mirrors have been up 20% year-to-date as a result. With that, we've continued to reinvest into the network and in our brands as well. So we've seen that our payer numbers have grown double-digit percentage year-on-year versus the year ago quarter. And this is, again, down to the strong execution that we have in our teams around user acquisition. And when you combine with the features and events that are happening in the game, it's really an application of all these great trends that we are seeing. So that's also allowed us to maximize our success in more marketing investment and continuing to broaden our player base. So overall, I feel like we've demonstrated that ability to grow both revenue and operating income at the same time. We feel there's still quite a bit of runway ahead of us."

It really has just been an exceptional performance and journey. And just from an Activision Blizzard King perspective, there are a lot of learnings that we really want to apply across both Activision and Blizzard. And it's not just in mobile from the King team's operations. For instance, King's live operation capabilities, their deeply analytical approach to creating amazing experiences that truly engage the players and the disciplined data-driven approach to marketing is just very applicable across the rest of the business. So we're already making sure that these performance marketing learnings are being applied to a work on Call of Duty Mobile and to Diablo and Mortal and other mobile initiatives that will be coming in the not-too-distant future across the company. So similar to how we are looking to apply the Call of Duty framework to our other franchises. It's another example of how Activision Blizzard is really leveraging the best of each of our businesses to truly maximize the potential of our portfolio."

So to start, we're obviously excited about both the launch of Vanguard this week and also Warzone's new Pacific map called Caldera, which is releasing early in December. The new map represents really the first built from the ground up new experience for War Zone since the launch of Warzone basically in March of 2020. So we think the community is going to be really excited to get it in and play that and experience the entire Vanguard universe. Coming with that, of course, there are a lot of things, some of which were mentioned. I'll just briefly cover them, one of which was WarZone share the same tech as Vanguard. So what does that mean? This is the same tech that debuted with modern warfare. And so from a player perspective, you're going to get a lot more seamless weapon and play balance experience across both experiences. And what's become a staple for us now is really, again, that's fully optimized for cross-play, cross-progression and cross-gen support. We've seen that the last couple of years, and that carries forward. And I think importantly, for our community, we're also going to be launching Rick Acea's our new anti-cheat system across Vanguard and Water zone so that our players can have the best possible experience as we move forward here in the future. Now specifically, as to the integration, we're going to continue to have the shared progression across Vanguard and War Zone just like we had to go against Modern Warfare and Black Ops Cold War previously. So all the great weapons, operators, unlocks and everything that you get on the Vanguard premium experience will also be usable in War Zone. So how the 2 work together is absolutely intact and better than ever. [indiscernible] path store in store content, of course, will also go back and forth for players to use and have fun with. Now there is a new component for us here. And the new Warzone experience is going to offer some new dedicated playlists that are very specific to the Vanguard theme that we think is going to be really fun for the community. And of course, to honor the players' investment, we'll also have unique playlists that are more of the combined arms Battle Royale experience we achieve slowdowns across Modern Warfare, Black Ops or Vanguard. So I think that will be really fun for the community to choose how they want to experience the new map and the new content. And also, I think what's become stable for us as we move forward, our players can expect a ton of free post-launch content and updates from Vanguard and from War zone to keep them having fun for the long haul. So both games are really just going to get bigger and better as they evolve over time for the community. 
Now going back to your question on the impact of blackout last December, so we certainly saw an uptick last December, and I believe we talked about that in the previous earnings call. And similarly, we expect another uptick this fourth quarter for our premium sales as we go through that cycle, launch the new map and see how the community engages more broadly, both within Warzone and within our premium experience. Thank you, Alexia, for the question."

As you heard Daniel mention first week sales were the highest recorded for a remaster from Activision Blizzard as a whole. This, alongside the continued engagement with Diablo III really is confirmation that our plan for the Diablo franchise as a whole is the right one. There's a huge appetite from our player community for more content from the Stark gated universe, and it's our job to exceed player expectations. Diablo III was erected as an early step towards meeting this demand. We have ignited histology players who experienced the original way back in 2000 as well as brought all new players into the fold. Diablo Immortal being in its next stage of testing is incredibly exciting, and we'll give players another window into the world of sanctuary. They'll be able to take part in an all-new narrative in a persistent free-to-play social experience. all from their mobile devices. -- mortal provides an even easier entry point for players into a game broader in scope and scale than Diablo 3. Then Diablo 4, which will be the darkest expression of the universe yet is an immersive world, players can dive into together on PC and console. This is one of the most highly anticipated games in the industry, and we are confident we are building something incredible. These experiences combined, create an ecosystem where players of all types can feel at home, and it doesn't stop there. Diablo will always be living and breathing with broad content updates over time to continue to delight our players. Seeing the first step of this plan executed with the release of Diablo treated off to such a strong start is invigorating to the teams across Blizzard and we can't wait to get more into the hands of our players. Thanks for the question."

But so far, we're seeing this create opportunities for us on the user acquisition side. And as you would have seen on the advertising side, we are continuing to grow quite robustly. So on the user acquisition side, we have a very large and sophisticated user acquisition team. And they've been really hands-on and granular when they run our campaigns. And so when we've seen these changes in dynamism in the industry because of IDFA, they've created market opportunities that we've been able to capitalize on. And the tailwinds that we are seeing in our payer conversion and spending gives us a lot of flexibility to invest in these ROI positive opportunities. So much of our UA is aimed at win back. So over 1 billion people with the way have downloaded Candy in the past. And so this gives us also a very great brand advantage.

Looking ahead, we see significant opportunities across gameplay expansion, platform expansion and geographic expansion to take the ecosystem to an entirely new level for our players around the world. I'd say put another way, we feel there's more opportunity in front of the franchise at any point in our history. And that's a pretty incredible thing to be able to say given the success that we've seen to date. Of course, the next phase begins in the coming days and weeks with Vanguard and the new map, Caldera and War Zone. But really, there's so much more as we look ahead in the future, both near and long term. Driving this ambition for us, of course, is our talented development teams and the resources we have there, which we're committed to greatly expanding both at our existing studios but also geographically to find new talent around the globe. So we're expanding in locations like Austin, Gilford, Cracow, Melbourne, Mexico City and Toronto to augment our teams. And you may already know, we recently acquired Digital Legends in Barcelona. They joined our mobile development roster, which now includes our new internal team, solid state as well as the mobile teams at Box in Shanghai, who are all coming together on an unannounced project in the Call of Duty universe that's very exciting. So I'd say, overall, we feel really good about our plans, our outlook, our team, and our gameplay innovation as we look out over the next few years and beyond."

Now as you know, we have been very disciplined inpatient in this area. But the longer-term opportunity for M&A means that we pay significant option value on having a strong and flexible balance sheet. Now at the same time, with respect to buybacks, to come to the core your question, we do have a $4 million authorization. And what we haven't seen us do anything in a long time here, we do evaluate our position with respect to buyback frequently. Now obviously, the increasing cash generation from the company gives us more and more flexibility over time. But just bear in mind, though, that we don't announce when we're buying wet stock ahead of time. And sometimes there may be restrictions allowability to come into the buyback.

As I said during our last earnings call, I want Activision Blizzard to be the leader in our industry for workplace culture. Since then, the leadership team and I have been hard at work listening",975,"Thank you, Chris, and thank you all for joining us today. 
As I said during our last earnings call, I want Activision Blizzard to be the leader in our industry for workplace culture. Since then, the leadership team and I have been hard at work listening to employees and implementing meaningful changes. I'd like to review the actions we've taken over the past few months with you today. As we've made clear in certain instances relating to workplace culture, we should have done a better job ensuring our values were embraced across all parts of the company. Over the last few years, we've been focused on the improvements that are necessary to become a model workplace. We are, of course, taking these actions because any single instance of wrongful conduct at our company is unacceptable. But these actions we're taking are also the right ones for our business success. We can't achieve our business ambitions without the very best talent. People with the talents we need have more alternatives for highly paid work opportunities than ever before. If we don't constantly evolve as a great place to work, we won't retain or attract the talent we need to realize our tremendous potential. As a company, we have more opportunities ahead of us than I've seen in almost all the years I've led the company. The success we've achieved thus far is the result of an overwhelmingly large number of extraordinarily talented people with high integrity and good values focused on delivering great games to our players, which has resulted in superior shareholder returns. This company and many of its leaders and so many of our talented employees, past and present, have shown strength of will, dedicated to the achievement of bold aspirations. Our commitment to make Activision Blizzard the most welcoming and inclusive company in the world will be accomplished the same way our industry leadership has been accomplished, focusing commitment, persistence, strength of will, the unwavering ambition of truly talented people with equally unwavering integrity and the continuous commitments to improvement. In September, we announced a comprehensive agreement with the U.S. Equal Opportunity Commission, which is subject to court approval to strengthen policies and programs intended to further improve the prevention of harassment, discrimination and related conduct. As part of this agreement, we'll establish an $18 million fund to compensate those who have experienced such behavior at our company. With respect to pay equity, another critically important issue that we have always worked hard to ensure we achieve we recently disclosed to employees the results of a review of 2020 pay equity in our company, which was conducted by an independent research firm. The U.S. analysis showed that women on average earned slightly more than men for comparable work in 2020. And we're committed to compensation remaining equitable for men and women performing comparable work always. 
Last week, we also announced a number of important new workplace initiatives. We announced a zero-tolerance harassment policy company-wide. This includes tougher rules and greater consistency across the organization to make certain reports are always properly and promptly handled. Now any Activision Blizzard employee found through our new investigative processes and resources to have retaliated against anyone for making a compliance complaint will be terminated immediately. In many other instances of workplace misconduct, we will no longer rely on written warnings. Terminations will be the outcome, including in most cases of harassment based on any legally protected category. Future employment contracts and equity awards will state that termination for these reasons will result in immediate forfeiture of future compensation. Another is our pledge to increase the percentage of women and nonbinary people in our workforce by 50%. Today, approximately 23% of our global employee population identifies as women or nonbinary. So within the next 5 years and hopefully faster, we will seek to increase our percentage of women and nonbinary professionals to more than 1/3 across the entire company. To further this commitment, we'll be investing an additional $250 million over the next 10 years in initiatives that foster expanded opportunities in gaming and technology for underrepresented communities. Additionally, based on feedback from many employees, we are waiving required arbitration of future individual sexual harassment and discrimination claims. That means for any employee who chooses not to arbitrate an individual claim of sexual harassment, unlawful discrimination or related retaliation arising in the future, the company will waive any obligation to do so. 
As we report regularly on our progress in our financial results, you will continue to hear more about our workplace initiatives which we firmly believe will help us remain one of the world's most successful entertainment companies. I want to thank our employees for their continued commitment to each other, the company and our players. For those employees past and present who have been brave enough to step forward and share their stories, we continue to be committed to investigating all claims thoroughly and holding people accountable. For those employees who have shared feedback, thoughts, suggestions, concerns and complaints and there are many of you, we hope you can see from our actions that we are listening. We are evolving our organization through your ideas and active participation in their execution. And for those employees who have worked tirelessly to deliver great experiences to our players, your resilience in these challenging times is inspiring. We expect that we'll continue to face challenging and negative media attention regardless of our progress, but we are determined to stay focused on providing great opportunities in the very best work environment for our talented employees to deliver the very best games for our players and to continue to provide superior returns for our shareholders. 
Thank you for your participation today. And now I'll turn the call over to Daniel to share the results of our operations for the last quarter."

Before I discuss our operating results, I want to take this opportunity to thank our incredibly talented teams across the entire company who share the passion to make exciting and groundbreaking experiences for our players all around t",2067,"Thank you, Bobby. 
Before I discuss our operating results, I want to take this opportunity to thank our incredibly talented teams across the entire company who share the passion to make exciting and groundbreaking experiences for our players all around the world. Activision Blizzard's third quarter results were above our outlook. Our monthly active users and time spent in our content were consistent with the year ago level, even as regions continue to reopen while net bookings and operating income grew year-over-year. This performance again, illustrates the structural expansion in our largest franchises as we execute our strategy of delivering gaming experiences across new platforms with more regular content and leveraging multiple commercialization models, including free-to-play. Execution against this strategy enables us to grow our community, including in geographies outside of our traditional regions, to deepen engagement and to create more opportunities for player investment. Critical to this is a continued investment in creative talent. We continued to grow our developer headcount in the third quarter and have increased our development organization by hundreds of talented professionals year-to-date, including announcing new studios and expansions in multiple new cities globally. This geographic diversification strategy is paying dividends, allowing us to tap into critical talent pools in all corners of the world. As we grow our teams with new hires, we are keenly aware of the importance and responsibility we have to ensure a safe working environment for our people. This is our #1 priority. 
Specifically, in recent months, we have taken actions that resulted in the departure of a number of individuals across the company. Additionally, we have seen increased competition in the market for our talent and higher voluntary turnover that has partly offset our success in hiring. As we have worked with new leadership in Blizzard and within the franchises themselves, particularly in certain key creative roles, it's become apparent that some of the Blizzard content plan for next year will benefit from more development time to reach its full potential. While we are still planning to deliver a substantial amount of content from Blizzard next year, we are now planning for a later launch for Overwatch 2 and Diablo IV than originally envisaged. These are 2 of the most eagerly anticipated titles in the industry, and our teams have made great strides towards completion in recent quarters. But we believe giving the team some extra time to complete production and continue growing their creative resources to support the titles after launch, we'll ensure that these releases delight and engage their communities for many years into the future. These decisions will push out the financial uplift that we had expected to see next year, but we are confident that this is the right course of action for our people, our players and the long-term success of our franchises. 
Now I will cover our third quarter franchise and operational highlights across our business units. Starting with Activision, where, on average, 119 million people engage in our content monthly in the third quarter, Call of Duty continues to sustain reach, engagement and player investment well above levels seen prior to our introduction of free-to-play experiences across console, PC and mobile. Monthly active users in the franchise were consistent year-over-year on console, PC and grew our mobile. Console and PC engagement trends were consistent with typical trends as we moved away from the premium launch even as regions continue to reopen through the quarter. Console and PC MAUs and time spent exhibited very similar retention from Q2 to Q3 as our experiences in prior years. In-game player investment on console and PC remained well above pre-Warzone levels at approximately 3x the level of Q3 2019. And strong conversion from free-to-play drove premium sales higher than in any third quarter prior the launch of Warzone. 
And our teams are all set to launch the next phase of exciting new Call of Duty content for players worldwide. This Friday sees the release of Call of Duty: Vanguard. And on December 2, we will roll out Call of Duty: Warzone Pacific, the biggest update to the Warzone experience since launch. As we've demonstrated with Modern Warfare and Black Ops: Cold War, the release of Vanguard is just the first step in delivering the community an incredible amount of ongoing content, live engagements and much more. Across Campaign, Zombies, Multiplayer and War Zone, there's no bigger experience or better value over the duration of the game's life cycle across our premium and free-to-play business. And then we expect Warzone Pacific and its new Caldera map to take the free-to-play experience to another level. The premium and free-to-play experiences are more integrated than ever before sharing the same engine, weapon integration and content integration as well as Call of Duty standards of cross-play, cross-progression and more. Both titles are set to benefit from Ricochet, a new anti-cheat technology aimed at addressing one of the key improvements requested by the community. We are confident that our players are in store for an incredible set of experiences this holiday season and beyond. 
On mobile, Call of Duty net bookings grew over 40% year-over-year in the third quarter, driven by double-digit growth in the West and a continued contribution from the game in China. The team continues to refine the player experience, building on learnings from the title's first 2 years to optimize content, events and features our communities around the world. And at the same time, we continue to ramp our teams working on new mobile title within the Call of Duty universe. 
In addition to hiring a substantial number of developers over the last quarter, we were pleased to announce last week the acquisition of Digital Legends, a Barcelona-based mobile game developer that will further bolster the world-class team we are assembling. 
Turning to Blizzard. Monthly active users were 26 million in the third quarter. For Diablo, our plan to deliver an era of unprecedented levels of content for the franchise has experienced a strong start with the September release of  Diablo II: Resurrected, the return of one of the most acclaimed titles in PC gaming history. First week of sales of the title were the highest recorded for a Remaster from our company, and we have seen strong ongoing demand, particularly in Korea, where the game is proving one of the most popular titles in Internet game rooms. 
With such strong engagement, the team is now working hard to ensure that players have the smoothest possible experience as they explore the world of Sanctuary. This is just the first step in Blizzard's plans for the franchise. On mobile, Diablo Immortal is in public testing and remains on track for release in the first half of next year. And with Diablo IV set to be the foundation for great experiences for PC and console fans over many years, we believe the pieces are in place to expand and serve the Diablo community better than ever before. 
Turning to Overwatch, where millions of people continue to engage in both the game and esport. September saw the grand finals of the Overwatch League become the most watched in the league's history. Starting in the spring, the next season of Overwatch League will run on an early build of Overwatch 2's new 5v5 competitive multiplayer mode, giving the community a fantastic view into the development team's strong work of a next iteration in the franchise, and the team plans to follow this with new content and initiatives to engage existing, returning and new Overwatch players next year. 
Within the Warcraft franchise, World of Warcraft reach and engagement continues to benefit from the combination of the Modern game and Classic under a single subscription. The 2 games offer players more ways to engage and create more opportunities for our teams to deliver compelling experiences to fans of the franchise. With deep engagement across both Classic and Modern, WOW!'s overall subscriber base is stronger than we typically see at this point after a Modern expansion launch. And for 2021, World of Warcraft is on track to deliver its strongest engagement in net bookings outside of a Modern expansion year in a decade. Our WoW team has been rolling out numerous quality of life improvements across the Modern and Classic games franchise in response to player feedback. And today, the Modern game released its latest content update with Classic soon-to-launch fresh servers, with greater challenges to engage the passionate community. Hearthstone net bookings were stable year-over-year in the third quarter. And in October, the team launched Mercenaries, an innovative role-playing mode that gives the Hearthstone community an entirely new way to play the game. Initial results from Mercenaries have been very encouraging, and we believe Hearthstone is positioned for a return to year-over-year growth in net bookings in the fourth quarter. Across the Warcraft franchise, our teams are working on a substantial pipeline of content planned for next year, including new experiences in Classic and Modern WoW, more innovations in Hearthstone and getting all new mobile Warcraft content into players hands for the first time. Blizzard cannot wait to share more details on their plans.
The King business continues to deliver fantastic results with very strong year-over-year trends for both in-app purchases and advertising. MAUs were 245 million in the third quarter. King's deep capabilities in live operations are driving engagement for both existing and new players. Hours played across the King portfolio grew year-over-year in the third quarter, with players responding positively to a more frequent cadence of compelling in-game content and events for key titles. The team's prior actions to grow payer conversion alongside ongoing strong execution and user acquisition, saw payer numbers growing by a double-digit percentage versus the year ago quarter. These initiatives drove over 20% year-over-year growth in in-game net bookings for Candy Crush with Candy once again the top grossing game franchise in the U.S. app stores.
Additionally, at the end of the third quarter, King launched the All Stars U.S. tournament, a competitive event that saw Candy Crush Saga players battle to be crowned the Ultimate Candy Crush Allstar. The event has driven meaningful increases in installs, game rounds played and in-app purchases in recent weeks, highlighting competitive gameplay is another opportunity for franchise growth and our investment in the Candy Crush brand.
In addition to this innovation and success at Candy, for several quarters now, King has been accelerating and refining content delivery in Farm Heroes, its second largest franchise. This work continued to bear fruit in Q3 and year-to-date in-game net bookings have grown around 20% year-over-year. And finally, King's advertising business again grew robustly, with quarterly revenue growing sequentially and year-over-year to a new high. Both volume and pricing grew strongly year-over-year, benefiting from the team's growing relationships with demand partners and the ongoing ramp of new categories of advertisers. In summary, Q3 saw solid year-over-year growth in the business, and we see substantial growth ahead for our portfolio of internally owned IP. While we have seen some slippage in the release schedule for specific titles at Blizzard, we could not be more excited about our plans to unlock the full potential of our largest franchises and to drive meaningful expansion in our reach, engagement and operating performance. This is only possible because of our teams. I want to share an announcement about the leadership of one of those teams. Jen Oneal, who has been co-lead of Blizzard has been a passionate advocate for bringing positive changes to the video gaming industry and has been doing so as Board member of Women in Gaming International, or WIGI, a nonprofit organization that cultivates and advances equality and diversity in the global games industry. Jen has decided to leave the company at the end of the year, and we have agreed to support Jen in her involvement with WIGI by making a donation to WIGI in honor of Jen. In her remaining months with the company, given her commitment to this work, Jen will build the foundation of programs funded by the grant. As such, Mike Ybarra will take on Jen's leadership responsibilities. It is great to see how employees at our company are committed to bring about the positive changes in our industry and beyond, and our leadership team stands behind these efforts. Now I will hand over to Armin, who will provide more color on our financial results and outlook, Armin?"
4222231,1683581348,2422203,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Daniel. First, I'd like to reiterate that ensuring a workplace that provides opportunity for all in the most welcome an inclusive way is our top priority. Today, I'll review our third quarter results as well as outlook for the fourth quarter and",1442,"Thanks, Daniel. 
First, I'd like to reiterate that ensuring a workplace that provides opportunity for all in the most welcome an inclusive way is our top priority. Today, I'll review our third quarter results as well as outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2021. Our third quarter results were ahead of our prior outlook, with year-over-year growth in net bookings, revenue, operating income and EPS against difficult year ago comparables. Importantly, each of these metrics has also grown year-over-year on a year-to-date basis. So even as regions continue to reopen, our business is operating at significantly greater scale and that is prior to our successful growth initiatives across our largest franchises. 
Let me start with our consolidated financial results. Unless otherwise indicated, I'll be referencing non-GAAP figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation. Now for the quarter, we generated quarter 3 GAAP revenues of $2.07 billion, $100 million above our August outlook. This includes the net recognition of deferrals of $190 million. Net bookings of $1.88 billion were $30 million above our August outlook. And we generated growth with GAAP EPS of $0.82 and quarter 3 non-GAAP EPS of $0.89, which was $0.14 above our guidance. 
These figures include the net recognition of deferral of $0.17. Quarter 3 EPS included $0.03 from an unrealized loss on an investment as well as the benefit from a lower-than-anticipated tax rate in the quarter. 
Now turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Quarter 3 operating cash flow was $521 million, more than double the year ago level, driven by lower cash taxes and favorable working capital movements. Our cash and investments at the end of September were approximately $10 billion, and we ended the quarter with a net cash position of approximately $6.4 billion. Growing shareholder value through capital allocation is a key focus for us. And over the long term, investors should expect a balanced approach across investing in creative talent in our own business, strategic M&A and returning cash to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. 
Now let me turn to our segment results. Activision revenue was $641 million. Segment revenue was lower year-over-year as expected in our outlook. This was due to the launch of Tony Hawk in the year ago quarter and declines in Call of Duty upfront and in-game net bookings against a quarter that benefited from shelter-at-home
mandates and the early ramp of
Warzone. Year-to-date, net bookings for the Activision segment and the Call of Duty franchise were higher year-over-year with the franchise now consistently operating at greater scale than before our free-to-play and mobile initiatives. Activision's third quarter operating income was $244 million and operating margin was 38%. Blizzard revenue of $493 million grew 20% year-over-year, driven by the successful launch of Diablo II: Resurrected. Year-to-date, net bookings for Blizzard and for World of Warcraft its largest franchise were higher year-over-year. Blizzard's third quarter operating income was $188 million with an operating margin of 38%. King delivered another record quarter. Revenue grew 22% year-over-year to $652 million. That's a new high. Third quarter in-game net bookings grew in the mid-teens year-over-year, while advertising grew approximately 60%. King's third quarter operating income was a record $303 million with an operating margin of 46%. The team's strong execution across live operations, marketing and advertising drove records for both revenue and operating income for the third quarter and year-to-date. King's ability to delight and engage players with robust life operation provides a lot of learnings that we tend to apply to both activity and business and not just in mobile. Looking across our segments, in-game net bookings were $1.2 billion, roughly flat year-over-year and approximately $500 million higher than the level of quarter 3 of 2019. And during the third quarter, mobile net bookings grew over 20% year-over-year, driven by the strength of both Activision and King. Consumer spending and advertising within our mobile content was almost $1 billion in the quarter. And we see substantial room for further growth as we take each of our key franchises to the largest and fastest-growing platform, leveraging our creative and life operation capabilities of Activision, Blizzard and King. 
Now let me turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year. With regard to our slate, in addition to ongoing life op and in-game content across the portfolio, the fourth quarter will see active release Call of Duty: Vanguard this Friday, November 5, followed by the biggest Warzone update yet, Warzone Pacific, on December 2. Blizzard launched a new Mercenaries mode in Hearthstone in mid-October, and we released the next Hearthstone expansion later this quarter. And King continues to support Candy Crush and other games across the portfolio with numerous seasonal events and new features. Our team has done a phenomenal job building this content, even if many of them continue to work from home, and we can't wait for our players to get their hands on this experience. With that said, we remain prudent in our revenue assumptions for the fourth quarter. And regarding costs, we have decided to further step up investment in mobile marketing given the strong returns we are currently seeing and into compliance in [indiscernible]. We expect the earnings impact of these investments to be affected by a lower tax rate, and we continue to expect full year earnings per share to be up strongly year-over-year and comfortably ahead of the outlook provided at the beginning of the year. 
Now let me get into the specifics. For quarter 4, on a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $2.02 billion, including net deferrals of $763 million. We expect net bookings of $2.78 billion. We expect GAAP operating margin of 30%, a tax rate of 26%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of $785 million and EPS of $0.54. For quarter 4 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect a tax rate of 25% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.62, including net deferrals of $0.67. This means that on a GAAP basis for 2021, we now expect revenues of $8.66 billion, including the net recognition of deferrals of $10 million. We now expect net bookings of $8.65 billion. We expect GAAP operating margin of 37%, a GAAP tax rate of 18%; GAAP and non-GAAP share count of $784 million and GAAP EPS of $3.27. For 2021, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect a tax rate of 17% and non-GAAP EPS of $3.70, including net deferrals of $0.06. 
With respect to risks, as you've heard, we're taking action to the stakeholder concerns and the adverse consequences to our business from workplace issues. If we experience further adverse publicity regarding our company and executives, increased competition for talent, higher voluntary turnover, significantly reduced productivity or other negative consequences relating to these issues, our business likely would be adversely impacted. We're therefore, carefully monitoring all aspects of our business for such impacts, and we're taking action to help address them. 
Now I'd also like to provide an update on how we are planning for next year specifically. At the starting point, our business continues to operate at much greater scale. And we have clear line of sight to expanding the reach, engagement and financial performance of our business further in the coming years as we have had a framework that has worked so well for collocating Candy Crush to other franchisees in our portfolio. 
At the same time, as Daniel described, we've taken a decision to give the Overwatch and Diablo teams the extra time they need to deliver the experiences that their communities deserve and to set the franchises up for maximum success over a multiyear period. We, therefore, are currently not planning for material contribution from Overwatch 2 and Diablo IV in 2022. While this development will push out the financial uplift that we had expected to see next year, we firmly believe that this is the right course of action for our people, for the long-term success of these franchises and for our shareholders. We still have a lot of content in the pipeline for next year for our largest franchises that we can't wait to unveil and we'll provide more color on that when we provide our full year outlook in early February. 
In conclusion, we see substantial opportunity for shareholder value creation ahead through unlocking the full potential of our portfolio. This will only be possible because of our people, and we'll remain focused on ensuring a safe working environment that is essential to enable creativity and professional growth for all employees.

I feel very good about the progress actually. Right now, workplace leadership is my focus. Our opportunities for growth, as we've talked about, have never been better, but we won't be able to realize all that growth potential without talent. And to retain and attract the talent we need, we obviously have to be recognized as the very best place to work. This means we have to be the most welcoming, inclusive environment. And we've got to have the best industry-leading programs for growth and development, we've got to have the best recruiting capabilities for the diverse talent we need to create the very best games, and we have to have competitive compensation that is aligned with performance. If you think about it, over the last 30 years, we've shown that we can consistently create the very best games, and that has always translated into long-term shareholder returns that are far greater than the S&P 500 and compared to most companies. And we believe that superior shareholder returns will continue to be delivered through our franchise strategies, the operational excellence that we're recognized for. And we also recognize that to achieve the same level of shareholder returns we have historically and to ensure continued excellence in execution, we believe we and all great companies need to deliver workplace excellence. This means some of the things that we've discussed over the last few weeks about harassment and discrimination free work environments, recruiting excellence to ensure we have diverse skills, abilities and talents and a culture that celebrates and rewards commitment to these principles, I couldn't be more passionate and committed to being the most performance-focused, welcoming and inclusive company in entertainment. What you heard me discuss earlier is just the beginning of the actions that we intend to take to achieve that objective. And of course, we need accountability. So we'll continue to provide regular progress in updates both quarterly to our shareholders as well as annually in our ESG reports and we'll be monitoring the progress of our business units, our franchise teams and our functional leaders with respect to workplace initiatives, and that status will also be reported to our employees quarterly. Right now and going forward, communicating with our employees and getting feedback has been a crucial part of the process. We'll obviously continue to keep our investors informed, but the work that we've done with our employees has resulted in very constructive new initiatives, more that we'll continue to announce over the next few months. But the long answer to your question is I feel good about the progress that we're making. But thanks for the question."

Though we will all miss her greatly, we wish her all the best as we work with her on a plan to make an industry-wide impact through the WIGI grant. I personally want to thank her for her leadership. Since becoming the co-leader of Blizzard 3 months ago and meeting with teams around the company, I have been impressed by their passion for what they are creating and their drive to build a more inclusive culture. Looking at our upcoming releases across all of our teams here at Blizzard, we have a deep bench of veteran development talent, and we have new leadership on both Overwatch 2 and Diablo IV, both our seasoned Blizzard developers with over 30 years experience at the company between them. The teams have made great progress and passed important milestones recently, and we expect these to be fantastic releases. But there's obviously been a change in leadership. We looked at what was left in the final phases of production with fresh eyes, and we saw that allowing the teams more time would enable both great experiences at launch and also help ensure that everything will be in place to engage the communities for many years to come. This extra time will also help us continue significantly increasing the size of our development teams ahead of the launch. Again, to ensure we are following up the releases of substantial content to continue delighting the community. We're not sharing release dates at this time, but I have absolute confidence in these new leaders and their teams to deliver. They care deeply about creating high-quality products and allowing everyone on their teams to bring their best selves to their projects."

As you can see from the Q3 results, had a terrific quarter and Candy achieved its highest revenue quarter since the acquisition. So let me focus in on that and that performance specifically. There are a number of initiatives that have really been contributing to the success over the recent quarters and will carry us into the future. We've increased the optimizations that we put in the game. So we think about this as a player journey and we've continued to improve that player journey with strong live op execution. This benefits across cohorts of players. So we've delivered compelling content and events more frequently across all of our key titles. So to give you an example, in Candy, we've increased that engagement by further developing the content space into monthly seasonal events that really draw in new and existing players and provides fun experience across the board. With this quarter, we've complemented that with the launch of the Candy All Stars competition in the U.S. and we've seen some very strong initial results across reach, engagement and player investment. We feel -- we also found a successful formula over the past 12 months to invest and grow live ops and we're now applying that with great results, not just in Candy, but across other games too. So our second biggest franchise, for example,  Farm Heroes over the past few quarters, we've been delivering this content cadence and great events and the farm season pass. And we've seen the results from that as well. Our in-app growth in  Farm Heroes have been up 20% year-to-date as a result. With that, we've continued to reinvest into the network and in our brands as well. So we've seen that our payer numbers have grown double-digit percentage year-on-year versus the year ago quarter. And this is, again, down to the strong execution that we have in our teams around user acquisition. And when you combine with the features and events that are happening in the game, it's really an application of all these great trends that we are seeing. So that's also allowed us to maximize our success in more marketing investment and continuing to broaden our player base. So overall, I feel like we've demonstrated that ability to grow both revenue and operating income at the same time. We feel there's still quite a bit of runway ahead of us."

It really has just been an exceptional performance and journey. And just from an Activision, Blizzard, King perspective, there are a lot of learnings that we really want to apply across both Activision and Blizzard. And it's not just in mobile from the King team's operations. For instance, King's live operation capabilities, their deeply analytical approach to creating amazing experiences that truly engage the players and the disciplined data-driven approach to marketing is just very applicable across the rest of the business. So we're already making sure that these performance marketing learnings are being applied to our work on Call of Duty Mobile and to Diablo Immortal and other mobile initiatives that will be coming in the not-too-distant future across the company. So similar to how we are looking to apply the Call of Duty framework to our other franchises, it's another example of how Activision Blizzard is really leveraging the best of each of our businesses to truly maximize the potential of our portfolio."

So to start, we're obviously excited about both the launch of Vanguard this week and also Warzone's new Pacific map called Caldera, which is releasing early in December. The new map represents really the first built from the ground up new experience for War Zone since the launch of Warzone basically in March of 2020. So we think the community is going to be really excited to get in and play that and experience the entire Vanguard universe. Coming with that, of course, there are a lot of things, some of which were mentioned. I'll just briefly cover them, one of which was Warzone shares the same tech as Vanguard. So what does that mean? This is the same tech that debuted with Modern Warfare. And so from a player perspective, you get a lot more seamless weapon and play balance experience across both experiences. And what's become a staple for us now is really, a game that's fully optimized for cross-play, cross-progression and cross-gen support. We've seen that the last couple of years, and that carries forward. And I think importantly, for our community, we're also going to be launching RICOCHET, that's our new anti-cheat system across Vanguard and Warzone so that our players have the best possible experience as we move forward here in the future. Now specifically, as to the integration, we're going to continue to have the shared progression across Vanguard and Warzone just like we had against Modern Warfare and Black Ops Cold War previously. So all the great weapons, operators, unlocks and everything that you get on the Vanguard premium experience will also be usable in Warzone. So how the 2 work together is absolutely intact and better than ever. Battle Pass and Stormfront and storm content, of course, will also go back and forth for players to use and have fun with. Now there is a new component for us here. And the new Warzone experience is going to offer some new dedicated playlists that are very specific to the Vanguard theme that we think is going to be really fun for the community. And of course, to honor the players' investment, we'll also have unique playlists that are more of the combined arms Battle Royale experience we achieve slowdowns across Modern Warfare, Black Ops or Vanguard. So I think that will be really fun for the community to choose how they want to experience the new map and the new content. And also, I think what's become a staple for us as we move forward, our players can expect a ton of free post-launch content and updates from Vanguard and from Warzone to keep them having fun for the long haul. So both games are really just going to get bigger and better as they evolve over time for the community. 
Now going back to your question on the impact of Black Ops last December, so we certainly saw an uptick last December. I believe we talked about that in the previous earnings call. And similarly, we expect another uptick this fourth quarter for our premium sales as we go through that cycle, launch the new map and see how the community engages more broadly, both within Warzone and within our premium experience. Thank you, Alexia, for the question."

As you heard Daniel mention first week sales were the highest recorded for a remaster from Activision Blizzard as a whole. This, alongside the continued engagement with Diablo III really is confirmation that our plan for the Diablo franchise as a whole is the right one. There's a huge appetite from our player community for more content from the Stark Gothic universe, and it's our job to exceed player expectations. Diablo II: Resurrected is an early step towards meeting this demand. We have ignited nostology in players who experienced the original way back in 2000 as well as brought all new players into the fold. Diablo Immortal being in its next stage of testing is incredibly exciting, and we'll give players another window into the world of Sanctuary. They'll be able to take part in an all-new narrative in a persistent free-to-play social experience all from their mobile devices. Immortal provides an even easier entry point for players into a game broader in scope and scale than Diablo III. Then Diablo IV, which will be the darkest expression of the universe yet is an immersive world, players can dive into together on PC and console. This is one of the most highly anticipated games in the industry, and we are confident we are building something incredible. These experiences combined, create an ecosystem where players of all types can feel at home, and it doesn't stop there. Diablo will always be living and breathing with broad content updates over time to continue to delight our players. Seeing the first step of this plan executed with the release of Diablo II: Resurrected off to such a strong start is invigorating to the teams across Blizzard and we can't wait to get more into the hands of our players. Thanks for the question."

And so when we see changes in dynamism in the industry because of IDFA, they've created market opportunities that we've been able to capitalize on. And the tailwinds that we are seeing in our payer conversion and spending gives us a lot of flexibility to invest in these ROI positive opportunities. So much of our UA is aimed at win back. So over 1 billion people with the way have downloaded Candy in the past. And so this gives us also a very great brand advantage.

Looking ahead, we see significant opportunities across gameplay expansion, platform expansion and geographic expansion to take this ecosystem to an entirely new level for our players around the world. I'd say put another way, we feel there's more opportunity in front of the franchise than at any point in our history. And that's a pretty incredible thing to be able to say given the success that we've seen to date. Of course, the next phase begins in the coming days and weeks with Vanguard and the new map, Caldera and Warzone. But really, there's so much more as we look ahead in the future, both near and long term. Driving this ambition for us, of course, is our talented development teams and the resources we have there, which we're committed to greatly expanding both at our existing studios but also geographically to find new talent around the globe. So we're expanding in locations like Austin, Gilford, Krakow, Melbourne, Mexico City and Toronto to augment our teams. And you may already know, we recently acquired Digital Legends in Barcelona. They joined our mobile development roster, which now includes our new internal team, solid state as well as the mobile teams at Beenox and Shanghai, who are all coming together on an unannounced project in the Call of Duty universe that's very exciting. So I'd say, overall, we feel really good about our plans, our outlook, our teams, and our gameplay innovation as we look out over the next few years and beyond."

You heard today, we continue to have a very, very strong pipeline. So investing in our business and in our development teams remains our key priority. And as Humam mentioned, we'll continue to look to accelerate organic hiring in this area with acqui-hiring, just to us announced Digital Legends versus last week, but these type of transactions are typically small in nature. Now with regards to larger M&A, we're always going to look out for large established franchises that have potential for global scale and with strong management teams with a track record of profitability and of course, an attractive valuation that hits our returns threshold. Now as you know, we have been very disciplined and patient in this area. But the longer-term opportunity for M&A means that we place significant option value on having a strong and flexible balance sheet. Now at the same time, with respect to buybacks, to come to the core of your question, we do have a $4 billion authorization. And while you haven't seen us do anything in a long time here, we do evaluate our position with respect to buyback frequently. Now obviously, the increasing cash generation from the company gives us more and more flexibility over time. But just bear in mind, though, that we don't announce when we're buying back stock ahead of time. And sometimes there may be restrictions in our ability to commence the buyback. So in summary, expect us to be -- continue to be balanced and disciplined in how we allocate capital, always with a view to the long-term shareholder value question. Thank you for your question."

As I said during our last earnings call, I want Activision Blizzard to be the leader in our industry for workplace culture. Since then, the leadership team and I have been hard at work listening",975,"Thank you, Chris, and thank you all for joining us today. 
As I said during our last earnings call, I want Activision Blizzard to be the leader in our industry for workplace culture. Since then, the leadership team and I have been hard at work listening to employees and implementing meaningful changes. I'd like to review the actions we've taken over the past few months with you today. As we've made clear in certain instances relating to workplace culture, we should have done a better job ensuring our values were embraced across all parts of the company. Over the last few years, we've been focused on the improvements that are necessary to become a model workplace. We are, of course, taking these actions because any single instance of wrongful conduct at our company is unacceptable. But these actions we're taking are also the right ones for our business success. We can't achieve our business ambitions without the very best talent. People with the talents we need have more alternatives for highly paid work opportunities than ever before. If we don't constantly evolve as a great place to work, we won't retain or attract the talent we need to realize our tremendous potential. As a company, we have more opportunities ahead of us than I've seen in almost all the years I've led the company. The success we've achieved thus far is the result of an overwhelmingly large number of extraordinarily talented people with high integrity and good values focused on delivering great games to our players, which has resulted in superior shareholder returns. This company and many of its leaders and so many of our talented employees, past and present, have shown strength of will, dedicated to the achievement of bold aspirations. Our commitment to make Activision Blizzard the most welcoming and inclusive company in the world will be accomplished the same way our industry leadership has been accomplished, focusing commitment, persistence, strength of will, the unwavering ambition of truly talented people with equally unwavering integrity and the continuous commitments to improvement. In September, we announced a comprehensive agreement with the U.S. Equal Opportunity Commission, which is subject to court approval to strengthen policies and programs intended to further improve the prevention of harassment, discrimination and related conduct. As part of this agreement, we'll establish an $18 million fund to compensate those who have experienced such behavior at our company. With respect to pay equity, another critically important issue that we have always worked hard to ensure we achieve we recently disclosed to employees the results of a review of 2020 pay equity in our company, which was conducted by an independent research firm. The U.S. analysis showed that women on average earned slightly more than men for comparable work in 2020. And we're committed to compensation remaining equitable for men and women performing comparable work always. 
Last week, we also announced a number of important new workplace initiatives. We announced a zero-tolerance harassment policy company-wide. This includes tougher rules and greater consistency across the organization to make certain reports are always properly and promptly handled. Now any Activision Blizzard employee found through our new investigative processes and resources to have retaliated against anyone for making a compliance complaint will be terminated immediately. In many other instances of workplace misconduct, we will no longer rely on written warnings. Terminations will be the outcome, including in most cases of harassment based on any legally protected category. Future employment contracts and equity awards will state that termination for these reasons will result in immediate forfeiture of future compensation. Another is our pledge to increase the percentage of women and nonbinary people in our workforce by 50%. Today, approximately 23% of our global employee population identifies as women or nonbinary. So within the next 5 years and hopefully faster, we will seek to increase our percentage of women and nonbinary professionals to more than 1/3 across the entire company. To further this commitment, we'll be investing an additional $250 million over the next 10 years in initiatives that foster expanded opportunities in gaming and technology for underrepresented communities. Additionally, based on feedback from many employees, we are waiving required arbitration of future individual sexual harassment and discrimination claims. That means for any employee who chooses not to arbitrate an individual claim of sexual harassment, unlawful discrimination or related retaliation arising in the future, the company will waive any obligation to do so. 
As we report regularly on our progress in our financial results, you will continue to hear more about our workplace initiatives which we firmly believe will help us remain one of the world's most successful entertainment companies. I want to thank our employees for their continued commitment to each other, the company and our players. For those employees past and present who have been brave enough to step forward and share their stories, we continue to be committed to investigating all claims thoroughly and holding people accountable. For those employees who have shared feedback, thoughts, suggestions, concerns and complaints and there are many of you, we hope you can see from our actions that we are listening. We are evolving our organization through your ideas and active participation in their execution. And for those employees who have worked tirelessly to deliver great experiences to our players, your resilience in these challenging times is inspiring. We expect that we'll continue to face challenging and negative media attention regardless of our progress, but we are determined to stay focused on providing great opportunities in the very best work environment for our talented employees to deliver the very best games for our players and to continue to provide superior returns for our shareholders. 
Thank you for your participation today. And now I'll turn the call over to Daniel to share the results of our operations for the last quarter."

Before I discuss our operating results, I want to take this opportunity to thank our incredibly talented teams across the entire company who share the passion to make exciting and groundbreaking experiences for our players all around t",2067,"Thank you, Bobby. 
Before I discuss our operating results, I want to take this opportunity to thank our incredibly talented teams across the entire company who share the passion to make exciting and groundbreaking experiences for our players all around the world. Activision Blizzard's third quarter results were above our outlook. Our monthly active users and time spent in our content were consistent with the year ago level, even as regions continue to reopen while net bookings and operating income grew year-over-year. This performance again, illustrates the structural expansion in our largest franchises as we execute our strategy of delivering gaming experiences across new platforms with more regular content and leveraging multiple commercialization models, including free-to-play. Execution against this strategy enables us to grow our community, including in geographies outside of our traditional regions, to deepen engagement and to create more opportunities for player investment. Critical to this is a continued investment in creative talent. We continued to grow our developer headcount in the third quarter and have increased our development organization by hundreds of talented professionals year-to-date, including announcing new studios and expansions in multiple new cities globally. This geographic diversification strategy is paying dividends, allowing us to tap into critical talent pools in all corners of the world. As we grow our teams with new hires, we are keenly aware of the importance and responsibility we have to ensure a safe working environment for our people. This is our #1 priority. 
Specifically, in recent months, we have taken actions that resulted in the departure of a number of individuals across the company. Additionally, we have seen increased competition in the market for our talent and higher voluntary turnover that has partly offset our success in hiring. As we have worked with new leadership in Blizzard and within the franchises themselves, particularly in certain key creative roles, it's become apparent that some of the Blizzard content plan for next year will benefit from more development time to reach its full potential. While we are still planning to deliver a substantial amount of content from Blizzard next year, we are now planning for a later launch for Overwatch 2 and Diablo IV than originally envisaged. These are 2 of the most eagerly anticipated titles in the industry, and our teams have made great strides towards completion in recent quarters. But we believe giving the team some extra time to complete production and continue growing their creative resources to support the titles after launch, we'll ensure that these releases delight and engage their communities for many years into the future. These decisions will push out the financial uplift that we had expected to see next year, but we are confident that this is the right course of action for our people, our players and the long-term success of our franchises. 
Now I will cover our third quarter franchise and operational highlights across our business units. Starting with Activision, where, on average, 119 million people engage in our content monthly in the third quarter, Call of Duty continues to sustain reach, engagement and player investment well above levels seen prior to our introduction of free-to-play experiences across console, PC and mobile. Monthly active users in the franchise were consistent year-over-year on console, PC and grew our mobile. Console and PC engagement trends were consistent with typical trends as we moved away from the premium launch even as regions continue to reopen through the quarter. Console and PC MAUs and time spent exhibited very similar retention from Q2 to Q3 as our experiences in prior years. In-game player investment on console and PC remained well above pre-Warzone levels at approximately 3x the level of Q3 2019. And strong conversion from free-to-play drove premium sales higher than in any third quarter prior the launch of Warzone. 
And our teams are all set to launch the next phase of exciting new Call of Duty content for players worldwide. This Friday sees the release of Call of Duty: Vanguard. And on December 2, we will roll out Call of Duty: Warzone Pacific, the biggest update to the Warzone experience since launch. As we've demonstrated with Modern Warfare and Black Ops: Cold War, the release of Vanguard is just the first step in delivering the community an incredible amount of ongoing content, live engagements and much more. Across Campaign, Zombies, Multiplayer and War Zone, there's no bigger experience or better value over the duration of the game's life cycle across our premium and free-to-play business. And then we expect Warzone Pacific and its new Caldera map to take the free-to-play experience to another level. The premium and free-to-play experiences are more integrated than ever before sharing the same engine, weapon integration and content integration as well as Call of Duty standards of cross-play, cross-progression and more. Both titles are set to benefit from Ricochet, a new anti-cheat technology aimed at addressing one of the key improvements requested by the community. We are confident that our players are in store for an incredible set of experiences this holiday season and beyond. 
On mobile, Call of Duty net bookings grew over 40% year-over-year in the third quarter, driven by double-digit growth in the West and a continued contribution from the game in China. The team continues to refine the player experience, building on learnings from the title's first 2 years to optimize content, events and features our communities around the world. And at the same time, we continue to ramp our teams working on new mobile title within the Call of Duty universe. 
In addition to hiring a substantial number of developers over the last quarter, we were pleased to announce last week the acquisition of Digital Legends, a Barcelona-based mobile game developer that will further bolster the world-class team we are assembling. 
Turning to Blizzard. Monthly active users were 26 million in the third quarter. For Diablo, our plan to deliver an era of unprecedented levels of content for the franchise has experienced a strong start with the September release of  Diablo II: Resurrected, the return of one of the most acclaimed titles in PC gaming history. First week of sales of the title were the highest recorded for a Remaster from our company, and we have seen strong ongoing demand, particularly in Korea, where the game is proving one of the most popular titles in Internet game rooms. 
With such strong engagement, the team is now working hard to ensure that players have the smoothest possible experience as they explore the world of Sanctuary. This is just the first step in Blizzard's plans for the franchise. On mobile, Diablo Immortal is in public testing and remains on track for release in the first half of next year. And with Diablo IV set to be the foundation for great experiences for PC and console fans over many years, we believe the pieces are in place to expand and serve the Diablo community better than ever before. 
Turning to Overwatch, where millions of people continue to engage in both the game and esport. September saw the grand finals of the Overwatch League become the most watched in the league's history. Starting in the spring, the next season of Overwatch League will run on an early build of Overwatch 2's new 5v5 competitive multiplayer mode, giving the community a fantastic view into the development team's strong work of a next iteration in the franchise, and the team plans to follow this with new content and initiatives to engage existing, returning and new Overwatch players next year. 
Within the Warcraft franchise, World of Warcraft reach and engagement continues to benefit from the combination of the Modern game and Classic under a single subscription. The 2 games offer players more ways to engage and create more opportunities for our teams to deliver compelling experiences to fans of the franchise. With deep engagement across both Classic and Modern, WOW!'s overall subscriber base is stronger than we typically see at this point after a Modern expansion launch. And for 2021, World of Warcraft is on track to deliver its strongest engagement in net bookings outside of a Modern expansion year in a decade. Our WoW team has been rolling out numerous quality of life improvements across the Modern and Classic games franchise in response to player feedback. And today, the Modern game released its latest content update with Classic soon-to-launch fresh servers, with greater challenges to engage the passionate community. Hearthstone net bookings were stable year-over-year in the third quarter. And in October, the team launched Mercenaries, an innovative role-playing mode that gives the Hearthstone community an entirely new way to play the game. Initial results from Mercenaries have been very encouraging, and we believe Hearthstone is positioned for a return to year-over-year growth in net bookings in the fourth quarter. Across the Warcraft franchise, our teams are working on a substantial pipeline of content planned for next year, including new experiences in Classic and Modern WoW, more innovations in Hearthstone and getting all new mobile Warcraft content into players hands for the first time. Blizzard cannot wait to share more details on their plans.
The King business continues to deliver fantastic results with very strong year-over-year trends for both in-app purchases and advertising. MAUs were 245 million in the third quarter. King's deep capabilities in live operations are driving engagement for both existing and new players. Hours played across the King portfolio grew year-over-year in the third quarter, with players responding positively to a more frequent cadence of compelling in-game content and events for key titles. The team's prior actions to grow payer conversion alongside ongoing strong execution and user acquisition, saw payer numbers growing by a double-digit percentage versus the year ago quarter. These initiatives drove over 20% year-over-year growth in in-game net bookings for Candy Crush with Candy once again the top grossing game franchise in the U.S. app stores.
Additionally, at the end of the third quarter, King launched the All Stars U.S. tournament, a competitive event that saw Candy Crush Saga players battle to be crowned the Ultimate Candy Crush Allstar. The event has driven meaningful increases in installs, game rounds played and in-app purchases in recent weeks, highlighting competitive gameplay is another opportunity for franchise growth and our investment in the Candy Crush brand.
In addition to this innovation and success at Candy, for several quarters now, King has been accelerating and refining content delivery in Farm Heroes, its second largest franchise. This work continued to bear fruit in Q3 and year-to-date in-game net bookings have grown around 20% year-over-year. And finally, King's advertising business again grew robustly, with quarterly revenue growing sequentially and year-over-year to a new high. Both volume and pricing grew strongly year-over-year, benefiting from the team's growing relationships with demand partners and the ongoing ramp of new categories of advertisers. In summary, Q3 saw solid year-over-year growth in the business, and we see substantial growth ahead for our portfolio of internally owned IP. While we have seen some slippage in the release schedule for specific titles at Blizzard, we could not be more excited about our plans to unlock the full potential of our largest franchises and to drive meaningful expansion in our reach, engagement and operating performance. This is only possible because of our teams. I want to share an announcement about the leadership of one of those teams. Jen Oneal, who has been co-lead of Blizzard has been a passionate advocate for bringing positive changes to the video gaming industry and has been doing so as Board member of Women in Gaming International, or WIGI, a nonprofit organization that cultivates and advances equality and diversity in the global games industry. Jen has decided to leave the company at the end of the year, and we have agreed to support Jen in her involvement with WIGI by making a donation to WIGI in honor of Jen. In her remaining months with the company, given her commitment to this work, Jen will build the foundation of programs funded by the grant. As such, Mike Ybarra will take on Jen's leadership responsibilities. It is great to see how employees at our company are committed to bring about the positive changes in our industry and beyond, and our leadership team stands behind these efforts. Now I will hand over to Armin, who will provide more color on our financial results and outlook, Armin?"
4222231,1683581348,2422207,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Daniel. First, I'd like to reiterate that ensuring a workplace that provides opportunity for all in the most welcome an inclusive way is our top priority. Today, I'll review our third quarter results as well as outlook for the fourth quarter and",1442,"Thanks, Daniel. 
First, I'd like to reiterate that ensuring a workplace that provides opportunity for all in the most welcome an inclusive way is our top priority. Today, I'll review our third quarter results as well as outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2021. Our third quarter results were ahead of our prior outlook, with year-over-year growth in net bookings, revenue, operating income and EPS against difficult year ago comparables. Importantly, each of these metrics has also grown year-over-year on a year-to-date basis. So even as regions continue to reopen, our business is operating at significantly greater scale and that is prior to our successful growth initiatives across our largest franchises. 
Let me start with our consolidated financial results. Unless otherwise indicated, I'll be referencing non-GAAP figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation. Now for the quarter, we generated quarter 3 GAAP revenues of $2.07 billion, $100 million above our August outlook. This includes the net recognition of deferrals of $190 million. Net bookings of $1.88 billion were $30 million above our August outlook. And we generated growth with GAAP EPS of $0.82 and quarter 3 non-GAAP EPS of $0.89, which was $0.14 above our guidance. 
These figures include the net recognition of deferral of $0.17. Quarter 3 EPS included $0.03 from an unrealized loss on an investment as well as the benefit from a lower-than-anticipated tax rate in the quarter. 
Now turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Quarter 3 operating cash flow was $521 million, more than double the year ago level, driven by lower cash taxes and favorable working capital movements. Our cash and investments at the end of September were approximately $10 billion, and we ended the quarter with a net cash position of approximately $6.4 billion. Growing shareholder value through capital allocation is a key focus for us. And over the long term, investors should expect a balanced approach across investing in creative talent in our own business, strategic M&A and returning cash to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. 
Now let me turn to our segment results. Activision revenue was $641 million. Segment revenue was lower year-over-year as expected in our outlook. This was due to the launch of Tony Hawk in the year ago quarter and declines in Call of Duty upfront and in-game net bookings against a quarter that benefited from shelter-at-home
mandates and the early ramp of
Warzone. Year-to-date, net bookings for the Activision segment and the Call of Duty franchise were higher year-over-year with the franchise now consistently operating at greater scale than before our free-to-play and mobile initiatives. Activision's third quarter operating income was $244 million and operating margin was 38%. Blizzard revenue of $493 million grew 20% year-over-year, driven by the successful launch of Diablo II: Resurrected. Year-to-date, net bookings for Blizzard and for World of Warcraft its largest franchise were higher year-over-year. Blizzard's third quarter operating income was $188 million with an operating margin of 38%. King delivered another record quarter. Revenue grew 22% year-over-year to $652 million. That's a new high. Third quarter in-game net bookings grew in the mid-teens year-over-year, while advertising grew approximately 60%. King's third quarter operating income was a record $303 million with an operating margin of 46%. The team's strong execution across live operations, marketing and advertising drove records for both revenue and operating income for the third quarter and year-to-date. King's ability to delight and engage players with robust life operation provides a lot of learnings that we tend to apply to both activity and business and not just in mobile. Looking across our segments, in-game net bookings were $1.2 billion, roughly flat year-over-year and approximately $500 million higher than the level of quarter 3 of 2019. And during the third quarter, mobile net bookings grew over 20% year-over-year, driven by the strength of both Activision and King. Consumer spending and advertising within our mobile content was almost $1 billion in the quarter. And we see substantial room for further growth as we take each of our key franchises to the largest and fastest-growing platform, leveraging our creative and life operation capabilities of Activision, Blizzard and King. 
Now let me turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year. With regard to our slate, in addition to ongoing life op and in-game content across the portfolio, the fourth quarter will see active release Call of Duty: Vanguard this Friday, November 5, followed by the biggest Warzone update yet, Warzone Pacific, on December 2. Blizzard launched a new Mercenaries mode in Hearthstone in mid-October, and we released the next Hearthstone expansion later this quarter. And King continues to support Candy Crush and other games across the portfolio with numerous seasonal events and new features. Our team has done a phenomenal job building this content, even if many of them continue to work from home, and we can't wait for our players to get their hands on this experience. With that said, we remain prudent in our revenue assumptions for the fourth quarter. And regarding costs, we have decided to further step up investment in mobile marketing given the strong returns we are currently seeing and into compliance in [indiscernible]. We expect the earnings impact of these investments to be affected by a lower tax rate, and we continue to expect full year earnings per share to be up strongly year-over-year and comfortably ahead of the outlook provided at the beginning of the year. 
Now let me get into the specifics. For quarter 4, on a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $2.02 billion, including net deferrals of $763 million. We expect net bookings of $2.78 billion. We expect GAAP operating margin of 30%, a tax rate of 26%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of $785 million and EPS of $0.54. For quarter 4 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect a tax rate of 25% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.62, including net deferrals of $0.67. This means that on a GAAP basis for 2021, we now expect revenues of $8.66 billion, including the net recognition of deferrals of $10 million. We now expect net bookings of $8.65 billion. We expect GAAP operating margin of 37%, a GAAP tax rate of 18%; GAAP and non-GAAP share count of $784 million and GAAP EPS of $3.27. For 2021, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect a tax rate of 17% and non-GAAP EPS of $3.70, including net deferrals of $0.06. 
With respect to risks, as you've heard, we're taking action to the stakeholder concerns and the adverse consequences to our business from workplace issues. If we experience further adverse publicity regarding our company and executives, increased competition for talent, higher voluntary turnover, significantly reduced productivity or other negative consequences relating to these issues, our business likely would be adversely impacted. We're therefore, carefully monitoring all aspects of our business for such impacts, and we're taking action to help address them. 
Now I'd also like to provide an update on how we are planning for next year specifically. At the starting point, our business continues to operate at much greater scale. And we have clear line of sight to expanding the reach, engagement and financial performance of our business further in the coming years as we have had a framework that has worked so well for collocating Candy Crush to other franchisees in our portfolio. 
At the same time, as Daniel described, we've taken a decision to give the Overwatch and Diablo teams the extra time they need to deliver the experiences that their communities deserve and to set the franchises up for maximum success over a multiyear period. We, therefore, are currently not planning for material contribution from Overwatch 2 and Diablo IV in 2022. While this development will push out the financial uplift that we had expected to see next year, we firmly believe that this is the right course of action for our people, for the long-term success of these franchises and for our shareholders. We still have a lot of content in the pipeline for next year for our largest franchises that we can't wait to unveil and we'll provide more color on that when we provide our full year outlook in early February. 
In conclusion, we see substantial opportunity for shareholder value creation ahead through unlocking the full potential of our portfolio. This will only be possible because of our people, and we'll remain focused on ensuring a safe working environment that is essential to enable creativity and professional growth for all employees.

I feel very good about the progress actually. Right now, workplace leadership is my focus. Our opportunities for growth, as we've talked about, have never been better, but we won't be able to realize all that growth potential without talent. And to retain and attract the talent we need, we obviously have to be recognized as the very best place to work. This means we have to be the most welcoming, inclusive environment. And we've got to have the best industry-leading programs for growth and development, we've got to have the best recruiting capabilities for the diverse talent we need to create the very best games, and we have to have competitive compensation that is aligned with performance. If you think about it, over the last 30 years, we've shown that we can consistently create the very best games, and that has always translated into long-term shareholder returns that are far greater than the S&P 500 and compared to most companies. And we believe that superior shareholder returns will continue to be delivered through our franchise strategies, the operational excellence that we're recognized for. And we also recognize that to achieve the same level of shareholder returns we have historically and to ensure continued excellence in execution, we believe we and all great companies need to deliver workplace excellence. This means some of the things that we've discussed over the last few weeks about harassment and discrimination free work environments, recruiting excellence to ensure we have diverse skills, abilities and talents and a culture that celebrates and rewards commitment to these principles, I couldn't be more passionate and committed to being the most performance-focused, welcoming and inclusive company in entertainment. What you heard me discuss earlier is just the beginning of the actions that we intend to take to achieve that objective. And of course, we need accountability. So we'll continue to provide regular progress in updates both quarterly to our shareholders as well as annually in our ESG reports and we'll be monitoring the progress of our business units, our franchise teams and our functional leaders with respect to workplace initiatives, and that status will also be reported to our employees quarterly. Right now and going forward, communicating with our employees and getting feedback has been a crucial part of the process. We'll obviously continue to keep our investors informed, but the work that we've done with our employees has resulted in very constructive new initiatives, more that we'll continue to announce over the next few months. But the long answer to your question is I feel good about the progress that we're making. But thanks for the question."

I'd like to first recognize Jen Oneal, who has been an incredible partner here at Blizzard. Though we will all miss her greatly, we wish her all the best as we work with her on a plan to make an industry-wide impact through the WIGI grant. I personally want to thank her for her leadership. Since becoming the co-leader of Blizzard 3 months ago and meeting with teams around the company, I have been impressed by their passion for what they are creating and their drive to build a more inclusive culture. Looking at our upcoming releases across all of our teams here at Blizzard, we have a deep bench of veteran development talent, and we have new leadership on both Overwatch 2 and Diablo IV, both our seasoned Blizzard developers with over 30 years experience at the company between them. The teams have made great progress and passed important milestones recently, and we expect these to be fantastic releases. But there's obviously been a change in leadership. We looked at what was left in the final phases of production with fresh eyes, and we saw that allowing the teams more time would enable both great experiences at launch and also help ensure that everything will be in place to engage the communities for many years to come. This extra time will also help us continue significantly increasing the size of our development teams ahead of the launch. Again, to ensure we are following up the releases of substantial content to continue delighting the community. We're not sharing release dates at this time, but I have absolute confidence in these new leaders and their teams to deliver. They care deeply about creating high-quality products and allowing everyone on their teams to bring their best selves to their projects."

As you can see from the Q3 results, had a terrific quarter and Candy achieved its highest revenue quarter since the acquisition. So let me focus in on that and that performance specifically. There are a number of initiatives that have really been contributing to the success over the recent quarters and will carry us into the future. We've increased the optimizations that we put in the game. So we think about this as a player journey and we've continued to improve that player journey with strong live op execution. This benefits across cohorts of players. So we've delivered compelling content and events more frequently across all of our key titles. So to give you an example, in Candy, we've increased that engagement by further developing the content space into monthly seasonal events that really draw in new and existing players and provides fun experience across the board. With this quarter, we've complemented that with the launch of the Candy All Stars competition in the U.S. and we've seen some very strong initial results across reach, engagement and player investment. We feel -- we also found a successful formula over the past 12 months to invest and grow live ops and we're now applying that with great results, not just in Candy, but across other games too. So our second biggest franchise, for example,  Farm Heroes over the past few quarters, we've been delivering this content cadence and great events and the farm season pass. And we've seen the results from that as well. Our in-app growth in  Farm Heroes have been up 20% year-to-date as a result. With that, we've continued to reinvest into the network and in our brands as well. So we've seen that our payer numbers have grown double-digit percentage year-on-year versus the year ago quarter. And this is, again, down to the strong execution that we have in our teams around user acquisition. And when you combine with the features and events that are happening in the game, it's really an application of all these great trends that we are seeing. So that's also allowed us to maximize our success in more marketing investment and continuing to broaden our player base. So overall, I feel like we've demonstrated that ability to grow both revenue and operating income at the same time. We feel there's still quite a bit of runway ahead of us."

It really has just been an exceptional performance and journey. And just from an Activision, Blizzard, King perspective, there are a lot of learnings that we really want to apply across both Activision and Blizzard. And it's not just in mobile from the King team's operations. For instance, King's live operation capabilities, their deeply analytical approach to creating amazing experiences that truly engage the players and the disciplined data-driven approach to marketing is just very applicable across the rest of the business. So we're already making sure that these performance marketing learnings are being applied to our work on Call of Duty Mobile and to Diablo Immortal and other mobile initiatives that will be coming in the not-too-distant future across the company. So similar to how we are looking to apply the Call of Duty framework to our other franchises, it's another example of how Activision Blizzard is really leveraging the best of each of our businesses to truly maximize the potential of our portfolio."

So to start, we're obviously excited about both the launch of Vanguard this week and also Warzone's new Pacific map called Caldera, which is releasing early in December. The new map represents really the first built from the ground up new experience for War Zone since the launch of Warzone basically in March of 2020. So we think the community is going to be really excited to get in and play that and experience the entire Vanguard universe. Coming with that, of course, there are a lot of things, some of which were mentioned. I'll just briefly cover them, one of which was Warzone shares the same tech as Vanguard. So what does that mean? This is the same tech that debuted with Modern Warfare. And so from a player perspective, you get a lot more seamless weapon and play balance experience across both experiences. And what's become a staple for us now is really, a game that's fully optimized for cross-play, cross-progression and cross-gen support. We've seen that the last couple of years, and that carries forward. And I think importantly, for our community, we're also going to be launching RICOCHET, that's our new anti-cheat system across Vanguard and Warzone so that our players have the best possible experience as we move forward here in the future. Now specifically, as to the integration, we're going to continue to have the shared progression across Vanguard and Warzone just like we had against Modern Warfare and Black Ops Cold War previously. So all the great weapons, operators, unlocks and everything that you get on the Vanguard premium experience will also be usable in Warzone. So how the 2 work together is absolutely intact and better than ever. Battle Pass and Stormfront and storm content, of course, will also go back and forth for players to use and have fun with. Now there is a new component for us here. And the new Warzone experience is going to offer some new dedicated playlists that are very specific to the Vanguard theme that we think is going to be really fun for the community. And of course, to honor the players' investment, we'll also have unique playlists that are more of the combined arms Battle Royale experience we achieve slowdowns across Modern Warfare, Black Ops or Vanguard. So I think that will be really fun for the community to choose how they want to experience the new map and the new content. And also, I think what's become a staple for us as we move forward, our players can expect a ton of free post-launch content and updates from Vanguard and from Warzone to keep them having fun for the long haul. So both games are really just going to get bigger and better as they evolve over time for the community. 
Now going back to your question on the impact of Black Ops last December, so we certainly saw an uptick last December. I believe we talked about that in the previous earnings call. And similarly, we expect another uptick this fourth quarter for our premium sales as we go through that cycle, launch the new map and see how the community engages more broadly, both within Warzone and within our premium experience. Thank you, Alexia, for the question."

As you heard Daniel mention first week sales were the highest recorded for a remaster from Activision Blizzard as a whole. This, alongside the continued engagement with Diablo III really is confirmation that our plan for the Diablo franchise as a whole is the right one. There's a huge appetite from our player community for more content from the Stark Gothic universe, and it's our job to exceed player expectations. Diablo II: Resurrected is an early step towards meeting this demand. We have ignited nostology in players who experienced the original way back in 2000 as well as brought all new players into the fold. Diablo Immortal being in its next stage of testing is incredibly exciting, and we'll give players another window into the world of Sanctuary. They'll be able to take part in an all-new narrative in a persistent free-to-play social experience all from their mobile devices. Immortal provides an even easier entry point for players into a game broader in scope and scale than Diablo III. Then Diablo IV, which will be the darkest expression of the universe yet is an immersive world, players can dive into together on PC and console. This is one of the most highly anticipated games in the industry, and we are confident we are building something incredible. These experiences combined, create an ecosystem where players of all types can feel at home, and it doesn't stop there. Diablo will always be living and breathing with broad content updates over time to continue to delight our players. Seeing the first step of this plan executed with the release of Diablo II: Resurrected off to such a strong start is invigorating to the teams across Blizzard and we can't wait to get more into the hands of our players. Thanks for the question."

And so when we see changes in dynamism in the industry because of IDFA, they've created market opportunities that we've been able to capitalize on. And the tailwinds that we are seeing in our payer conversion and spending gives us a lot of flexibility to invest in these ROI positive opportunities. So much of our UA is aimed at win back. So over 1 billion people with the way have downloaded Candy in the past. And so this gives us also a very great brand advantage.

Looking ahead, we see significant opportunities across gameplay expansion, platform expansion and geographic expansion to take this ecosystem to an entirely new level for our players around the world. I'd say put another way, we feel there's more opportunity in front of the franchise than at any point in our history. And that's a pretty incredible thing to be able to say given the success that we've seen to date. Of course, the next phase begins in the coming days and weeks with Vanguard and the new map, Caldera and Warzone. But really, there's so much more as we look ahead in the future, both near and long term. Driving this ambition for us, of course, is our talented development teams and the resources we have there, which we're committed to greatly expanding both at our existing studios but also geographically to find new talent around the globe. So we're expanding in locations like Austin, Gilford, Krakow, Melbourne, Mexico City and Toronto to augment our teams. And you may already know, we recently acquired Digital Legends in Barcelona. They joined our mobile development roster, which now includes our new internal team, solid state as well as the mobile teams at Beenox and Shanghai, who are all coming together on an unannounced project in the Call of Duty universe that's very exciting.

You heard today, we continue to have a very, very strong pipeline. So investing in our business and in our development teams remains our key priority. And as Humam mentioned, we'll continue to look to accelerate organic hiring in this area with acqui-hiring, just to us announced Digital Legends versus last week, but these type of transactions are typically small in nature. Now with regards to larger M&A, we're always going to look out for large established franchises that have potential for global scale and with strong management teams with a track record of profitability and of course, an attractive valuation that hits our returns threshold. Now as you know, we have been very disciplined and patient in this area. But the longer-term opportunity for M&A means that we place significant option value on having a strong and flexible balance sheet. Now at the same time, with respect to buybacks, to come to the core of your question, we do have a $4 billion authorization. And while you haven't seen us do anything in a long time here, we do evaluate our position with respect to buyback frequently. Now obviously, the increasing cash generation from the company gives us more and more flexibility over time. But just bear in mind, though, that we don't announce when we're buying back stock ahead of time. And sometimes there may be restrictions in our ability to commence the buyback. So in summary, expect us to be -- continue to be balanced and disciplined in how we allocate capital, always with a view to the long-term shareholder value question. Thank you for your question."

And we have also been investing in studios, as Rob mentioned, in many locations that are new for us, including Krakow, Melbourne, Toronto, and Mexico City, where I'm from. We've had a lot of success in hiring in recent months in those franchises that were earliest in embracing this geographic expansion and flexibility, particularly for Call of Duty and for Candy Crush, and we've already started to pursue that same approach for Blizzard and Blizzard's franchises.

As I said during our last earnings call, I want Activision Blizzard to be the leader in our industry for workplace culture. Since then, the leadership team and I have been hard at work listening to",976,"Thank you, Chris, and thank you all for joining us today. As I said during our last earnings call, I want Activision Blizzard to be the leader in our industry for workplace culture. Since then, the leadership team and I have been hard at work listening to employees and implementing meaningful changes. I'd like to review the actions we've taken over the past few months with you today. 
As we've made clear in certain instances relating to workplace culture, we should have done a better job ensuring our values were embraced across all parts of the company. Over the last few years, we've been focused on the improvements that are necessary to become a model workplace. We are, of course, taking these actions because any single instance of wrongful conduct at our company is unacceptable. But these actions we're taking are also the right ones for our business success. We can't achieve our business ambitions without the very best talent. People with the talents we need have more alternatives for highly paid work opportunities than ever before. If we don't constantly evolve as a great place to work, we won't retain or attract the talent we need to realize our tremendous potential. 
As a company, we have more opportunities ahead of us than I've seen in almost all the years I've led the company. The success we've achieved thus far is the result of an overwhelmingly large number of extraordinarily talented people with high integrity and good values focused on delivering great games to our players, which has resulted in superior shareholder returns. This company and many of its leaders and so many of our talented employees, past and present, have shown strength of will, dedicated to the achievement of bold aspiration. Our commitment to make Activision Blizzard the most welcoming and inclusive company in the world will be accomplished the same way our industry leadership has been accomplished, focusing commitment, persistence, strength of will, the unwavering ambition of truly talented people with equally unwavering integrity and the continuous commitments to improvement. 
In September, we announced a comprehensive agreement with the U.S. Equal Opportunity Commission, which is subject to court approval to strengthen policies and programs intended to further improve the prevention of harassment, discrimination and related content. And as part of this agreement, we'll establish an $18 million fund to compensate those who have experienced such behavior at our company. 
With respect to pay equity, another critically important issue that we have always worked hard to ensure we achieve, we recently disclosed to employees the results of our review of 2020 pay equity at our company, which was conducted by an independent research firm. The U.S. analysis showed that women on average earned slightly more than men for comparable work in 2020. And we're committed to compensation remaining equitable for men and women performing comparable work always. 
Last week, we also announced a number of important new workplace initiatives. We announced a zero-tolerance harassment policy company-wide. This includes tougher rules and greater consistency across the organization to make certain reports are always properly and promptly handled. Now any Activision Blizzard employee found through our new investigative processes and resources to have retaliated against anyone for making a compliance complaint will be terminated immediately. In many other instances of workplace misconduct, we will no longer rely on written warnings. Terminations will be the outcome, including in most cases of harassment based on any legally protected category. Future employment contracts and equity awards will state that termination for these reasons will result in immediate forfeiture of future compensation. 
Another is our pledge to increase the percentage of women and nonbinary people in our workforce by 50%. Today, approximately 23% of our global employee population identifies as women or nonbinary. So within the next 5 years and hopefully faster, we will seek to increase our percentage of women and nonbinary professionals to more than 1/3 across the entire company. To further this commitment, we'll be investing an additional $250 million over the next 10 years in initiatives that foster expanded opportunities in gaming and technology for underrepresented communities. 
Additionally, based on feedback from many employees, we are waiving required arbitration of future individual sexual harassment and discrimination claim. That means for any employee who chooses not to arbitrate an individual claim of sexual harassment, unlawful discrimination or related retaliation arising in the future, the company will waive any obligation to do so. 
As we report regularly on our progress and our financial results, you will continue to hear more about our workplace initiatives which we firmly believe will help us remain one of the world's most successful entertainment company. I want to thank our employees for their continued commitment to each other, the company and our player. For those employees past and present who have been brave enough to step forward and share their stories, we continue to be committed to investigating all claims thoroughly and holding people accountable. For those employees who have shared feedback, thought, suggestion, concerns and complaint and there are many of you, we hope you can see from our actions that we are listening. We are evolving our organization through your ideas and active participation in their execution. 
And for those employees who have worked tirelessly to deliver great experiences to our players, your resilience in these challenging times is inspiring. We expect that we'll continue to face challenging and negative media attention regardless of our progress, but we are determined to stay focused on providing great opportunities and the very best work environment for our talented employees to deliver the very best games for our players and to continue to provide superior returns for our shareholders. Thank you for your participation today. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Daniel to share the results of our operations for the last quarter."
4222231,1683581348,2454787,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bobby. Before I discuss our operating results, I want to take this opportunity to thank our incredibly talented teams across the entire company who share the passion to make exciting and groundbreaking experiences for our players all around the",2078,"Thank you, Bobby. Before I discuss our operating results, I want to take this opportunity to thank our incredibly talented teams across the entire company who share the passion to make exciting and groundbreaking experiences for our players all around the world. Activision Blizzard's third quarter results were above our outlook. Our monthly active users and time spent in our content were consistent with the year ago level, even as regions continued to reopen, while net bookings and operating income grew year-over-year. This performance again illustrates the structural expansion in our largest franchises as we execute our strategy of delivering gaming experiences across new platforms with more regular content and leveraging multiple commercialization models including free-to-play. 
Execution against this strategy enables us to grow our community, including in geographies outside of our traditional regions, to deepen engagement and to create more opportunities for player investment. Critical to this is a continued investment in creative talent. We continued to grow our developer head count in the third quarter and have increased our development organization by hundreds of talented professionals year-to-date, including announcing new studios and expansions in multiple new cities globally. This geographic diversification strategy is paying dividends, allowing us to tap into critical talent pools in all corners of the world. 
As we grow our teams with new hires, we are keenly aware of the importance and responsibility we have to ensure a safe working environment for our people. This is our #1 priority. Specifically, in recent months, we have taken actions that resulted in the departure of a number of individuals across the company. Additionally, we have seen increased competition in the market for our talent and higher voluntary turnover that has partly offset our success in hiring. 
As we have worked with new leadership in Blizzard and within the franchises themselves, particularly in certain key creative roles, it's become apparent that some of the Blizzard content plan for next year will benefit from more development time to reach its full potential. While we are still planning to deliver a substantial amount of content from Blizzard next year, we are now planning for a later launch for Overwatch 2 and Diablo IV than originally envisaged. 
These are 2 of the most eagerly anticipated titles in the industry, and our teams have made great strides towards completion in recent quarters. But we believe giving the teams some extra time to complete production and continue growing their creative resources to support the titles after launch will ensure that these releases delight and engage their communities for many years into the future. These decisions will push out the financial uplift that we had expected to see next year. But we are confident that this is the right course of action for our people, our players and the long-term success of our franchises. 
Now I will cover our third quarter franchise and operational highlights across our business units. Starting with Activision, where, on average, 119 million people engage in our content monthly in the third quarter. Call of Duty continues to sustain reach, engagement and player investment well above levels seen prior to our introduction of free-to-play experiences across console, PC and mobile. 
Monthly active users in the franchise were consistent year-over-year on console, PC and grew our mobile. Console and PC engagement trends were consistent with typical trends as we moved away from the premium launch even as regions continue to reopen through the quarter. Console and PC MAUs and time spent exhibited very similar retention from Q2 to Q3 as our experiences in prior years. In-game player investment on console and PC remained well above pre-Warzone levels at approximately 3x the level of Q3 2019. And strong conversion from free-to-play drove premium sales higher than in any third quarter prior the launch of Warzone. 
And our teams are all set to launch the next phase of exciting new Call of Duty content for players worldwide. This Friday sees the release of Call of Duty: Vanguard. And on December 2, we will roll out Call of Duty: Warzone Pacific, the biggest update to the Warzone experience since launch. As we've demonstrated with Modern Warfare and Black Ops: Cold War, the release of Vanguard is just the first step in delivering the community an incredible amount of ongoing content, live engagement and much more. 
Across campaign, zombies, multiplayer and War Zone, there's no bigger experience or better value over the duration of the game's life cycle across our premium and free-to-play business. And then we expect Warzone Pacific and its new Caldera map to take the free-to-play experience to another level. The premium and free-to-play experiences are more integrated than ever before sharing the same engine, weapon integration and content integration as well as Call of Duty standards of cross-play, cross-progression and more. Both titles are set to benefit from RICOCHET, a new anti-cheat technology aimed at addressing one of the key improvements requested by the community. We are confident that our players are in store for an incredible set of experiences this holiday season and beyond. 
On mobile, Call of Duty net bookings grew over 40% year-over-year in the third quarter driven by double-digit growth in the West and a continued contribution from the game in China. The team continues to refine the player experience, building on learnings from the title's first 2 years to optimize content, events and features for our communities around the world. And at the same time, we continue to ramp our teams working on new mobile title within the Call of Duty universe. In addition to hiring a substantial number of developers over the last quarter, we are pleased to announce last week the acquisition of Digital Legends, a Barcelona-based mobile game developer that will further bolster the world-class team we are assembling. 
Turning to Blizzard. Monthly active users were 26 million in the third quarter. For Diablo, our plan to deliver an era of unprecedented levels of content for the franchise has experienced a strong start with the September release of Diablo II: Resurrected, the return of one of the most acclaimed titles in PC gaming history. First week of sales of the title were the highest recorded for a remaster from our company, and we have seen strong ongoing demand, particularly in Korea, where the game is proving one of the most popular titles in Internet game rooms. 
With such strong engagement, the team is now working hard to ensure that players have the smoothest possible experience as they explore the world of Sanctuary. This is just the first step in Blizzard's plans for the franchise. On mobile, Diablo Immortal is in public testing and remains on track for release in the first half of next year. And with Diablo IV set to be the foundation for great experiences for PC and console fans over many years, we believe the pieces are in place to expand and serve the Diablo community better than ever before. 
Turning to Overwatch, where millions of people continue to engage in both the game and esport. September saw the grand finals of the Overwatch League become the most watched in the league's history. Starting in the spring, the next season of Overwatch League will run on an early build of Overwatch 2's new 5v5 competitive multiplayer mode, giving the community a fantastic view into the development team's strong work on the next iteration in the franchise. And the team plans to follow this with new content and initiatives to engage existing, returning and new Overwatch players next year. 
Within the Warcraft franchise, World of Warcraft reach and engagement continues to benefit from the combination of the Modern game and Classic under a single subscription. The 2 games offer players more ways to engage and create more opportunities for our teams to deliver compelling experiences to fans of the franchise. With deep engagement across both Classic and Modern, WoW's overall subscriber base is stronger than we typically see at this point after a Modern expansion launch. And for 2021, World of Warcraft is on track to deliver its strongest engagement and net bookings outside of a Modern expansion year in a decade. 
Our WoW team has been rolling out numerous quality of life improvement across the Modern and Classic games franchise in response to player feedback. And today, the Modern game released its latest content update with Classic soon to launch fresh servers, with greater challenges to engage the passionate community. 
Hearthstone net bookings were stable year-over-year in the third quarter. And in October, the team launched Mercenaries, an innovative role-playing mode that gives the Hearthstone community an entirely new way to play the game. Initial results for Mercenaries have been very encouraging, and we believe Hearthstone is positioned for a return to year-over-year growth in net bookings in the fourth quarter. 
Across the Warcraft franchise, our teams are working on a substantial pipeline of content planned for next year, including new experiences in Classic and Modern WoW, more innovations in Hearthstone and getting all new mobile Warcraft content into players hands for the first time. Blizzard cannot wait to share more details on their plans.
The King business continues to deliver fantastic results with very strong year-over-year trends for both in-app purchases and advertising. MAUs were 245 million in the third quarter. King's deep capabilities in live operations are driving engagement for both existing and new players. Hours played across the King portfolio grew year-over-year in the third quarter, with players responding positively to a more frequent cadence of compelling in-game content and events for key titles. The team's prior actions to grow payer conversion alongside ongoing strong execution in user acquisition saw payer numbers growing by double-digit percentage versus the year ago quarter. 
These initiatives drove over 20% year-over-year growth in in-game net bookings for Candy Crush with Candy once again the top grossing game franchise in the U.S. app stores. Additionally, at the end of the third quarter, King launched the All Stars U.S. tournament, a competitive event that saw Candy Crush Saga players battle to be crowned the ultimate Candy Crush All Star. The event has driven meaningful increases in installs, game rounds played and in-app purchases in recent weeks, highlighting competitive gameplay as another opportunity for franchise growth and our investment in the Candy Crush brand.
In addition to this innovation and success at Candy, for several quarters now, King has been accelerating and refining content delivery in Farm Heroes, its second largest franchise. This work continued to bear fruit in Q3 and year-to-date in-game net bookings have grown around 20% year-over-year. And finally, King's advertising business again grew robustly, with quarterly revenue growing sequentially and year-over-year to a new high. Both volume and pricing grew strongly year-over-year, benefiting from the team's growing relationships with demand partners and the ongoing ramp of new categories of advertisers. 
In summary, Q3 saw solid year-over-year growth in the business, and we see substantial growth ahead for our portfolio of internally owned IP. While we have seen some slippage in the release schedule for specific titles at Blizzard, we could not be more excited about our plans to unlock the full potential of our largest franchises and to drive meaningful expansion in our reach, engagement and operating performance. This is only possible because of our teams. 
I want to share an announcement about the leadership of one of those team. Jen Oneal, who has been co-lead of Blizzard, has been a passionate advocate for bringing positive changes to the video gaming industry and has been doing so as Board member of Women in Gaming International (sic) [ Women in Games International ], or WIGI, a nonprofit organization that cultivate and advances equality and diversity in the global games industry. Jen has decided to leave the company at the end of the year, and we have agreed to support Jen in her involvement with WIGI by making a donation to WIGI in honor of Jen. In her remaining months with the company, given her commitment to this work, Jen will build the foundation of programs funded by the grant. As such, Mike Ybarra will take on Jen's leadership responsibility. It is great to see how employees at our company are committed to bring about the positive changes in our industry and beyond, and our leadership team stands behind these effort. 
Now I will hand over to Armin, who will provide more color on our financial result and outlook, Armin?"
4222231,1683581348,2454787,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Daniel.

First, I'd like to reiterate that ensuring a workplace that provides opportunity for all in the most welcoming and inclusive way is our top priority. Today, I'll review our third quarter results as well as outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2021. Our third quarter results were ahead of our prior outlook, with year-over-year growth in net bookings, revenue, operating income and EPS against difficult year ago comparables. 
Importantly, each of these metrics has also grown year-over-year on a year-to-date basis. So even as regions continues to reopen, our business is operating at significantly greater scale than that seen prior to our successful growth initiatives across our largest franchises. Let me start with our consolidated financial results. Unless otherwise indicated, I'll be referencing non-GAAP figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation. 
Now for the quarter, we generated quarter 3 GAAP revenues of $2.07 billion, $100 million above our August outlook. This includes net recognition of deferrals of $190 million. Net bookings of $1.88 billion, that’s $30 million above our August outlook. And we generated quarter 3 GAAP EPS of $0.82 and quarter 3 non-GAAP EPS of $0.89 which was $0.14 above our guidance. These figures include the net recognition of deferrals of $0.17. Quarter 3 EPS included $0.03 [ churn ] from an unrealized loss on investment as well as a benefit from a lower-than-anticipated tax rate in the quarter. 
Now turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Quarter 3 operating cash flow was $521 million, more than double the year ago level, driven by lower cash taxes and favorable working capital movements. Our cash and investments at the end of September were approximately $10 billion, and we ended the quarter with a net cash position of approximately $6.4 billion. Growing shareholder value through capital allocation is a key focus for us. And over the long term, investors should expect a balanced approach across investing in creative talent in our own business, strategic M&A and returning cash to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. 
Now let me turn to our segment results. Activision revenue was $641 million. Segment revenue was lower year-over-year as expected in our outlook. This was due to the launch of Tony Hawk's in the year ago quarter and declines in Call of Duty upfront and in-game net bookings against a quarter that benefited from shelter-at-home mandates and the early ramp of Warzone. Year-to-date, net bookings for the Activision segment and the Call of Duty franchise were higher year-over-year with the franchise now consistently operating at greater scale than before our free-to-play and mobile initiatives. Activision's third quarter operating income was $244 million and operating margin was 38%. 
Blizzard revenue of $493 million grew 20% year-over-year driven by the successful launch of Diablo II: Resurrected. Year-to-date, net bookings for Blizzard and for World of Warcraft, its largest franchise, were higher year-over-year. Blizzard's third quarter operating income was $188 million with an operating margin of 38%. 
King delivered another record quarter. Revenue grew 22% year-over-year to $652 million. That's a new high. Third quarter in-game net bookings grew in the mid-teens year-over-year while advertising grew approximately 60%. King's third quarter operating income was a record $303 million with an operating margin of 46%. The team's strong execution across live operations, marketing and advertising drove records for both revenue and operating income for the third quarter and year-to-date. King's ability to delight and engage players with robust live operation provides a lot of learning that we’re trying to apply to both Activision and Blizzard and not just in mobile. 
Looking across our segments, in-game net bookings were $1.2 billion, roughly flat year-over-year and approximately $500 million higher than the level of quarter 3 of 2019. And during the third quarter, mobile net bookings grew over 20% year-over-year driven by the strength of both Activision and King. Consumer spending and advertising within our mobile content was almost $1 billion in the quarter. And we see substantial room for further growth as we take each of our key franchises to the largest and fastest-growing platform, leveraging our creative and live operation capabilities of Activision, Blizzard and King. 
Now let me turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year. With regard to our slate, in addition to ongoing live op and in-game content across the portfolio, the fourth quarter will see Activision release Call of Duty: Vanguard this Friday, November 5, followed by the biggest Warzone update yet, Warzone Pacific, on December 2. Blizzard launched a new Mercenaries mode in Hearthstone in mid-October and will release the next Hearthstone expansion later this quarter. And King continues to support Candy Crush and other games across its portfolio with numerous seasonal events and new features. 
Our team has done a phenomenal job building this content, even if many of them continue to work from home, and we can't wait for our players to get their hands on this experience. With that said, we remain prudent in our revenue assumption for the fourth quarter. And regarding costs, we have decided to further step up investment in mobile marketing given the strong returns we are currently seeing and into compliance and employee relation. We expect the earnings impact of these investments to be offset by lower tax rate, and we continue to expect full year earnings per share to be up strongly year-over-year and comfortably ahead of the outlook provided at the beginning of the year. 
Now let me get into the specifics. For quarter 4, on a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $2.02 billion, including net deferrals of $763 million. We expect net bookings of $2.78 billion. We expect GAAP operating margin of 30%, a tax rate of 26%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 785 million and EPS of $0.54. For quarter 4 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect a tax rate of 25% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.62, including net deferrals of $0.67. This means that on a GAAP basis for 2021, we now expect revenues of $8.66 billion, including the net recognition of deferrals of $10 million. We now expect net bookings of $8.65 billion. We expect GAAP operating margin of 37%, a GAAP tax rate of 18%; GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 784 million and GAAP EPS of $3.27. For 2021, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect a tax rate of 17% and non-GAAP EPS of $3.70 including net deferrals of $0.06. 
With respect to risk, as you've heard, we're taking action to address stakeholder concern and the adverse consequences to our business from workplace issues. If we experience further adverse publicity regarding our company and executive, increased competition for talent, higher voluntary turnover, significantly reduced productivity or other negative consequences relating to these issues, our business likely would be adversely impacted. We're, therefore, carefully monitoring all aspects of our business by any such impacts, and we're taking action to help address them. 
Now I'd also like to provide some update on how we are planning for next year specifically. As a starting point, our business continues to operate at much greater scale, and we have clear line of sight to expanding the reach, engagement and financial performance of our business further in the coming years as we apply the framework that has worked so well for Call of Duty, Candy Crush to other franchises in our portfolio. 
At the same time, as Daniel described, we've taken the decision to give the Overwatch and Diablo team the extra time they need to deliver the experiences that their communities deserve and to set the franchises up for maximum success over a multiyear period. We are, therefore, currently not planning for material contribution from Overwatch 2 and Diablo IV in 2022. While this development will push out the financial uplift that we have expected to see next year, we firmly believe that this is the right course of action for our people, for the long-term success of these franchises and for our shareholders. We still have a lot of content in the pipeline for next year for our largest franchises that we can't wait to unveil and we'll provide more color on that when we provide our full year outlook in early February. 
In conclusion, we see substantial opportunity for shareholder value creation ahead to unlocking the full potential of our portfolio. This will only be possible because of our people, and we'll remain focused on ensuring a safe working environment that is essential to enable creativity and professional growth for all employees.

I feel very good about the progress actually. Right now, workplace leadership is my focus. Our opportunities for growth, as we've talked about, have never been better, but we won't be able to realize all that growth potential without talent. And to retain and attract the talent we need, we obviously have to be recognized as the very best place to work. This means we have to be the most welcoming inclusive environment and we've got to have the best industry-leading programs for growth and development. We've got to have the best recruiting capabilities for the diverse talent we need to create the very best games, and we have to have competitive compensation that is aligned with performance. 
If you think about it, over the last 30 years, we've shown that we can consistently create the very best games, and that has always translated into long-term shareholder returns that are far greater than the S&P 500 and compared to most companies. And we believe that superior shareholder returns will continue to be delivered through our franchise strategies, the operational excellence that we're recognized for. And we also recognize that to achieve the same level of shareholder returns we have historically and to ensure continued excellence in execution, we believe we and all great companies need to deliver workplace excellence. 
This means some of the things that we've discussed over the last few weeks about harassment and discrimination-free work environments, recruiting excellence to ensure we have diverse skills, abilities and talents and a culture that celebrates and rewards commitment to these principles. I couldn't be more passionate and committed to being the most performance-focused, welcoming and inclusive company in entertainment. What you heard me discuss earlier is just the beginning of the actions that we intend to take to achieve that objective. And of course, we need accountability. So we'll continue to provide regular progress in updates both quarterly to our shareholders as well as annually in our ESG reports, and we'll be monitoring the progress of our business units, our franchise teams and our functional leaders with respect to workplace initiatives, and that status will also be reported to our employees quarterly. 
Right now and going forward, communicating with our employees and getting feedback has been a crucial part of the process. We'll obviously continue to keep our investors informed, but the work that we've done with our employees has resulted in very constructive new initiatives, more that we'll continue to announce over the next few months.

I'd like to first recognize Jen Oneal, who has been an incredible partner here at Blizzard. Though we will all miss her greatly, we wish her all the best as we work with her on a plan to make an industry-wide impact through the WIGI grant. I personally want to thank her for her leadership. 
Since becoming the co-leader of Blizzard 3 months ago and meeting with teams around the company, I have been impressed by their passion for what they are creating and their drive to build a more inclusive culture. Looking at our upcoming releases across all of our teams here at Blizzard, we have a deep bench of veteran development talent, and we have new leadership on both Overwatch 2 and Diablo IV. Both are seasoned Blizzard developers with over 30 years’ experience at the company between them. The teams have made great progress and passed important milestones recently, and we expect these to be fantastic releases. But there's obviously been a change in leadership. 
We looked at what was left in the final phases of production with fresh eyes, and we saw that allowing the teams more time would enable both great experiences at launch and also help ensure that everything will be in place to engage the communities for many years to come. This extra time will also help us continue significantly increasing the size of our development teams ahead of the launch, again to ensure we are following up the releases with substantial content to continue delighting the community. We're not sharing release dates at this time, but I have absolute confidence in these new leaders and their teams to deliver. They care deeply about creating high-quality products and allowing everyone on their teams to bring their best selves to their projects. Thanks for the question."

As you can see from the Q3 results, had a terrific quarter and Candy achieved its highest in-app revenue quarter since the acquisition. So let me focus in on that in-app performance specifically. There are a number of initiatives that are really been contributing to the success over the recent quarters and will carry us into the future. We've increased the optimizations that we put in the game. So we think about this as a player journey and we've continued to improve that player journey with strong live op execution. This benefits across cohorts of players. So we've delivered compelling content and events more frequently across all of our key titles. 
So to give you an example, in Candy, we've increased that engagement by further developing the content slate into monthly seasonal events that really draw in new and existing players and provides fun experience across the board. With this quarter, we've complemented that with the launch of the Candy All Stars (sic) [ Candy Crush All Stars ] competition in the U.S. and we've seen some very strong initial results across reach, engagement and player investment. 
We feel -- we also found a successful formula over the past 12 months to invest and grow live ops, and we're now applying that with great results, not just in Candy, but across other games too. So our second biggest franchise, for example, Farm Heroes, over the past few quarters, we've been delivering this content cadence and great events and the farm season pass. And we've seen the results from that as well. Our in-app growth in Farm Heroes has been up 20% year-to-date as a result. 
With that, we've continued to reinvest into the network and in our brands as well. So we've seen that our payer numbers have grown double-digit percentage year-on-year versus the year ago quarter. And this is, again, down to the strong execution that we have in our teams around user acquisition. And when you combine with the features and events that are happening in the game, really an amplification of all these great trends that we are seeing. So that's also allowed us to maximize our success in more marketing investments and continuing to broaden our player base. So overall, I feel like we've demonstrated that ability to grow both revenue and operating income at the same time. We feel there's still quite a bit of runway ahead of us."

It really has just been an exceptional performance and journey. And just from an Activision, Blizzard, King perspective, just there are a lot of learnings that we really want to apply across both Activision and Blizzard and it's not just in mobile from the King team's operations. For instance, King's live operation capabilities, their deeply analytical approach to creating amazing experiences that truly engage the players and the disciplined data-driven approach to marketing is just very applicable across the rest of the business. 
So we're already making sure that these performance marketing learnings are being applied to our work on Call of Duty Mobile and to Diablo Immortal and other mobile initiatives that will be coming in the not-too-distant future across the company. So similar to how we are looking to apply the Call of Duty framework to our other franchises, it's another example of how Activision Blizzard is really leveraging the best of each of our businesses to truly maximize the potential of our portfolio.

So to start, we're obviously excited about both the launch of Vanguard this week and also Warzone's new Pacific map called Caldera, which is releasing early in December. The new map represents really the first built from the ground up new experience for Warzone since the launch of Warzone basically in March of 2020. So we think the community is going to be really excited to get in and play that and experience the entire Vanguard universe. 
Coming with that, of course, there are a lot of things, some of which were mentioned. I'll just briefly cover them. One of which was Warzone shares the same tech as Vanguard. And so what does that mean? This is the same tech that debuted with Modern Warfare. And so from a player perspective, you can get a lot more seamless weapon and play balance experience across both experiences. And what's become a staple for us now is really a game that's fully optimized for cross-play, cross-progression and cross-gen support. We've seen that the last couple of years, and that carries forward. I think importantly, for our community, we're also going to be launching RICOCHET, it's our new anti-cheat system, across Vanguard and Warzone so that our players have the best possible experience as we move forward here in the future. 
Now specifically, as to the integration, we're going to continue to have the shared progression across Vanguard and Warzone just like we had against Modern Warfare and Black Ops Cold War previously. So all the great weapons, operators, unlocks and everything that you get on the Vanguard premium experience will also be usable in Warzone. So how the 2 work together is absolutely intact and better than ever. Battle Pass and Stormfront and storm content, of course, will also go back and forth for players to use and have fun with. 
Now there is a new component for us here. And the new Warzone experience is going to offer some new dedicated playlists that are very specific to the Vanguard theme that we think is going to be really fun for the community. And of course, to honor the players' investment, we'll also have unique playlists that are more of a combined arms Battle Royale experience [ we achieve slowdowns ] across Modern Warfare, Black Ops or Vanguard. So I think that will be really fun for the community to choose how they want to experience the new map and the new content. 
And also, I think what's become a staple for us as we move forward, our players can expect a ton of free post-launch content and updates from Vanguard and from Warzone to keep them having fun for the long haul. So both games are really just going to get bigger and better as they evolve over time for the community. 
Now going back to your question on the impact of Black Ops last December, so we certainly saw an uptick last December. I believe we talked about that in the previous earnings call. And similarly, we expect another uptick this fourth quarter for our premium sales as we go through that cycle, launch the new map and see how the community engages more broadly, both within Warzone and within our premium experience. Thank you, Alexia, for the questions."

As you heard Daniel mention, first week sales were the highest recorded for a remaster from Activision Blizzard as a whole. This, alongside the continued engagement with Diablo III, really is confirmation that our plan for the Diablo franchise as a whole is the right one. There's a huge appetite from our player community for more content from this dark gothic universe, and it's our job to exceed player expectations. 
Diablo II: Resurrected is an early step towards meeting this demand. We have ignited nostalgia in players who experienced the original way back in 2000 as well as brought all new players into the fold. Diablo Immortal being in its next stage of testing is incredibly exciting, and we'll give players another window into the world of Sanctuary. They'll be able to take part in an all-new narrative in a persistent free-to-play social experience, all from their mobile devices. Immortal provides an even easier entry point for players into a game broader in scope and scale than Diablo III. 
Then Diablo IV, which will be the darkest expression of the universe yet is an immersive world, players can dive into together on PC and console. This is one of the most highly anticipated games in the industry, and we are confident that we are building something incredible. These experiences combined create an ecosystem where our players of all types can feel at home, and it doesn't stop there. Diablo will always be living and breathing with broad content updates over time to continue to delight our players. Seeing the first step of this plan executed with the release of Diablo II: Resurrected off to such a strong start is invigorating to the teams across Blizzard and we can't wait to get more into the hands of our players.

But so far, we're seeing this create opportunities for us on the user acquisition side. And as you would have seen on the advertising side, we are continuing to grow quite robustly. So on the user acquisition side, we have a very large and sophisticated user acquisition team, and they've been really hands-on and granular when they run our campaigns. 
And so when we see changes and dynamism in the industry because of IDFA, this created market opportunities that we've been able to capitalize on. And the tailwinds that we are seeing in our payer conversion and spending gives us a lot of flexibility to invest in these ROI positive opportunities. So much of our UA is aimed at win back. So over 1 billion people, we believe, have downloaded Candy in the past. And so this gives us also a very great brand advantage. 
Now on the advertising side of the house, we've seen 60% year-on-year growth, which points to our ongoing strength. We believe we have a very differentiated product there. It's a premium position with advertisers and we're still early in building our ad business.

Looking ahead, we see significant opportunities across gameplay expansion, platform expansion and geographic expansion to take this ecosystem to an entirely new level for our players around the world. I'd say put another way, we feel there's more opportunity in front of the franchise than at any point in our history. And that's a pretty incredible thing to be able to say given the success that we've seen to date. 
Of course, the next phase begins in the coming days and weeks with Vanguard and the new map, Caldera in Warzone, but really, there's so much more as we look ahead in the future, both near and long term. Driving this ambition for us, of course, is our talented development teams and the resources we have there, which we're committed to greatly expanding both at our existing studios but also geographically to find new talent around the globe. So we're expanding in locations like Austin, Guildford, Krakow, Melbourne, Mexico City and Toronto to augment our teams. 
And you may already know, we recently acquired Digital Legends in Barcelona. They joined our mobile development roster, which now includes our new internal team, Solid State as well as the mobile teams at Beenox and Shanghai were all coming together on an unannounced project in the Call of Duty universe that's very exciting.

You’ve heard today, we continue to have a very, very strong pipeline. So investing in our business and in our development teams remains our key priority. 
And as Daniel mentioned, we'll continue to look to accelerate organic hiring in this area with acqui-hiring. This was announced with Digital Legends purchase last week, but these type of transactions are typically smaller in nature. Now with regards to larger M&A, we're always on the lookout for large established franchises that have potential for global scale and strong management teams with a track record of profitability and, of course, an attractive valuation that hits our return threshold. 
Now as you know, we have been very disciplined and patient in this area. But the longer-term opportunity for M&A means that we place significant option value on having a strong and flexible balance sheet. Now at the same time, with respect to buybacks, to come to the core of your question, we do have a $4 billion authorization. And while you haven't seen us do anything in a long time here, we do evaluate our position with respect to buyback frequently. 
Now obviously, the increase in cash generation from the company gives us more and more flexibility over time. But just bear in mind, though, that we don't announce when we're buying back stock ahead of time and that sometimes there may be restrictions in our ability to comment on the buyback. So in summary, expect us to be -- continue to be balanced and disciplined in how we allocate capital, always with a view to the long-term shareholder value creation. Thank you for your question."

4222231,1683581348,2454789,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chris, and thank you all for joining us today. As I said during our last earnings call, I want Activision Blizzard to be the leader in our industry for workplace culture. Since then, the leadership team and I have been hard at work listening to",976,"Thank you, Chris, and thank you all for joining us today. As I said during our last earnings call, I want Activision Blizzard to be the leader in our industry for workplace culture. Since then, the leadership team and I have been hard at work listening to employees and implementing meaningful changes. I'd like to review the actions we've taken over the past few months with you today. 
As we've made clear in certain instances relating to workplace culture, we should have done a better job ensuring our values were embraced across all parts of the company. Over the last few years, we've been focused on the improvements that are necessary to become a model workplace. We are, of course, taking these actions because any single instance of wrongful conduct at our company is unacceptable. But these actions we're taking are also the right ones for our business success. We can't achieve our business ambitions without the very best talent. People with the talents we need have more alternatives for highly paid work opportunities than ever before. If we don't constantly evolve as a great place to work, we won't retain or attract the talent we need to realize our tremendous potential. 
As a company, we have more opportunities ahead of us than I've seen in almost all the years I've led the company. The success we've achieved thus far is the result of an overwhelmingly large number of extraordinarily talented people with high integrity and good values focused on delivering great games to our players, which has resulted in superior shareholder returns. This company and many of its leaders and so many of our talented employees, past and present, have shown strength of will, dedicated to the achievement of bold aspiration. Our commitment to make Activision Blizzard the most welcoming and inclusive company in the world will be accomplished the same way our industry leadership has been accomplished, focusing commitment, persistence, strength of will, the unwavering ambition of truly talented people with equally unwavering integrity and the continuous commitments to improvement. 
In September, we announced a comprehensive agreement with the U.S. Equal Opportunity Commission, which is subject to court approval to strengthen policies and programs intended to further improve the prevention of harassment, discrimination and related content. And as part of this agreement, we'll establish an $18 million fund to compensate those who have experienced such behavior at our company. 
With respect to pay equity, another critically important issue that we have always worked hard to ensure we achieve, we recently disclosed to employees the results of our review of 2020 pay equity at our company, which was conducted by an independent research firm. The U.S. analysis showed that women on average earned slightly more than men for comparable work in 2020. And we're committed to compensation remaining equitable for men and women performing comparable work always. 
Last week, we also announced a number of important new workplace initiatives. We announced a zero-tolerance harassment policy company-wide. This includes tougher rules and greater consistency across the organization to make certain reports are always properly and promptly handled. Now any Activision Blizzard employee found through our new investigative processes and resources to have retaliated against anyone for making a compliance complaint will be terminated immediately. In many other instances of workplace misconduct, we will no longer rely on written warnings. Terminations will be the outcome, including in most cases of harassment based on any legally protected category. Future employment contracts and equity awards will state that termination for these reasons will result in immediate forfeiture of future compensation. 
Another is our pledge to increase the percentage of women and nonbinary people in our workforce by 50%. Today, approximately 23% of our global employee population identifies as women or nonbinary. So within the next 5 years and hopefully faster, we will seek to increase our percentage of women and nonbinary professionals to more than 1/3 across the entire company. To further this commitment, we'll be investing an additional $250 million over the next 10 years in initiatives that foster expanded opportunities in gaming and technology for underrepresented communities. 
Additionally, based on feedback from many employees, we are waiving required arbitration of future individual sexual harassment and discrimination claim. That means for any employee who chooses not to arbitrate an individual claim of sexual harassment, unlawful discrimination or related retaliation arising in the future, the company will waive any obligation to do so. 
As we report regularly on our progress and our financial results, you will continue to hear more about our workplace initiatives which we firmly believe will help us remain one of the world's most successful entertainment company. I want to thank our employees for their continued commitment to each other, the company and our player. For those employees past and present who have been brave enough to step forward and share their stories, we continue to be committed to investigating all claims thoroughly and holding people accountable. For those employees who have shared feedback, thought, suggestion, concerns and complaint and there are many of you, we hope you can see from our actions that we are listening. We are evolving our organization through your ideas and active participation in their execution. 
And for those employees who have worked tirelessly to deliver great experiences to our players, your resilience in these challenging times is inspiring. We expect that we'll continue to face challenging and negative media attention regardless of our progress, but we are determined to stay focused on providing great opportunities and the very best work environment for our talented employees to deliver the very best games for our players and to continue to provide superior returns for our shareholders. Thank you for your participation today. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Daniel to share the results of our operations for the last quarter."

Before I discuss our operating results, I want to take this opportunity to thank our incredibly talented teams across the entire company who share the passion to make exciting and groundbreaking experiences for our players all around the",2078,"Thank you, Bobby. Before I discuss our operating results, I want to take this opportunity to thank our incredibly talented teams across the entire company who share the passion to make exciting and groundbreaking experiences for our players all around the world. Activision Blizzard's third quarter results were above our outlook. Our monthly active users and time spent in our content were consistent with the year ago level, even as regions continued to reopen, while net bookings and operating income grew year-over-year. This performance again illustrates the structural expansion in our largest franchises as we execute our strategy of delivering gaming experiences across new platforms with more regular content and leveraging multiple commercialization models including free-to-play. 
Execution against this strategy enables us to grow our community, including in geographies outside of our traditional regions, to deepen engagement and to create more opportunities for player investment. Critical to this is a continued investment in creative talent. We continued to grow our developer head count in the third quarter and have increased our development organization by hundreds of talented professionals year-to-date, including announcing new studios and expansions in multiple new cities globally. This geographic diversification strategy is paying dividends, allowing us to tap into critical talent pools in all corners of the world. 
As we grow our teams with new hires, we are keenly aware of the importance and responsibility we have to ensure a safe working environment for our people. This is our #1 priority. Specifically, in recent months, we have taken actions that resulted in the departure of a number of individuals across the company. Additionally, we have seen increased competition in the market for our talent and higher voluntary turnover that has partly offset our success in hiring. 
As we have worked with new leadership in Blizzard and within the franchises themselves, particularly in certain key creative roles, it's become apparent that some of the Blizzard content plan for next year will benefit from more development time to reach its full potential. While we are still planning to deliver a substantial amount of content from Blizzard next year, we are now planning for a later launch for Overwatch 2 and Diablo IV than originally envisaged. 
These are 2 of the most eagerly anticipated titles in the industry, and our teams have made great strides towards completion in recent quarters. But we believe giving the teams some extra time to complete production and continue growing their creative resources to support the titles after launch will ensure that these releases delight and engage their communities for many years into the future. These decisions will push out the financial uplift that we had expected to see next year. But we are confident that this is the right course of action for our people, our players and the long-term success of our franchises. 
Now I will cover our third quarter franchise and operational highlights across our business units. Starting with Activision, where, on average, 119 million people engage in our content monthly in the third quarter. Call of Duty continues to sustain reach, engagement and player investment well above levels seen prior to our introduction of free-to-play experiences across console, PC and mobile. 
Monthly active users in the franchise were consistent year-over-year on console, PC and grew our mobile. Console and PC engagement trends were consistent with typical trends as we moved away from the premium launch even as regions continue to reopen through the quarter. Console and PC MAUs and time spent exhibited very similar retention from Q2 to Q3 as our experiences in prior years. In-game player investment on console and PC remained well above pre-Warzone levels at approximately 3x the level of Q3 2019. And strong conversion from free-to-play drove premium sales higher than in any third quarter prior the launch of Warzone. 
And our teams are all set to launch the next phase of exciting new Call of Duty content for players worldwide. This Friday sees the release of Call of Duty: Vanguard. And on December 2, we will roll out Call of Duty: Warzone Pacific, the biggest update to the Warzone experience since launch. As we've demonstrated with Modern Warfare and Black Ops: Cold War, the release of Vanguard is just the first step in delivering the community an incredible amount of ongoing content, live engagement and much more. 
Across campaign, zombies, multiplayer and War Zone, there's no bigger experience or better value over the duration of the game's life cycle across our premium and free-to-play business. And then we expect Warzone Pacific and its new Caldera map to take the free-to-play experience to another level. The premium and free-to-play experiences are more integrated than ever before sharing the same engine, weapon integration and content integration as well as Call of Duty standards of cross-play, cross-progression and more. Both titles are set to benefit from RICOCHET, a new anti-cheat technology aimed at addressing one of the key improvements requested by the community. We are confident that our players are in store for an incredible set of experiences this holiday season and beyond. 
On mobile, Call of Duty net bookings grew over 40% year-over-year in the third quarter driven by double-digit growth in the West and a continued contribution from the game in China. The team continues to refine the player experience, building on learnings from the title's first 2 years to optimize content, events and features for our communities around the world. And at the same time, we continue to ramp our teams working on new mobile title within the Call of Duty universe. In addition to hiring a substantial number of developers over the last quarter, we are pleased to announce last week the acquisition of Digital Legends, a Barcelona-based mobile game developer that will further bolster the world-class team we are assembling. 
Turning to Blizzard. Monthly active users were 26 million in the third quarter. For Diablo, our plan to deliver an era of unprecedented levels of content for the franchise has experienced a strong start with the September release of Diablo II: Resurrected, the return of one of the most acclaimed titles in PC gaming history. First week of sales of the title were the highest recorded for a remaster from our company, and we have seen strong ongoing demand, particularly in Korea, where the game is proving one of the most popular titles in Internet game rooms. 
With such strong engagement, the team is now working hard to ensure that players have the smoothest possible experience as they explore the world of Sanctuary. This is just the first step in Blizzard's plans for the franchise. On mobile, Diablo Immortal is in public testing and remains on track for release in the first half of next year. And with Diablo IV set to be the foundation for great experiences for PC and console fans over many years, we believe the pieces are in place to expand and serve the Diablo community better than ever before. 
Turning to Overwatch, where millions of people continue to engage in both the game and esport. September saw the grand finals of the Overwatch League become the most watched in the league's history. Starting in the spring, the next season of Overwatch League will run on an early build of Overwatch 2's new 5v5 competitive multiplayer mode, giving the community a fantastic view into the development team's strong work on the next iteration in the franchise. And the team plans to follow this with new content and initiatives to engage existing, returning and new Overwatch players next year. 
Within the Warcraft franchise, World of Warcraft reach and engagement continues to benefit from the combination of the Modern game and Classic under a single subscription. The 2 games offer players more ways to engage and create more opportunities for our teams to deliver compelling experiences to fans of the franchise. With deep engagement across both Classic and Modern, WoW's overall subscriber base is stronger than we typically see at this point after a Modern expansion launch. And for 2021, World of Warcraft is on track to deliver its strongest engagement and net bookings outside of a Modern expansion year in a decade. 
Our WoW team has been rolling out numerous quality of life improvement across the Modern and Classic games franchise in response to player feedback. And today, the Modern game released its latest content update with Classic soon to launch fresh servers, with greater challenges to engage the passionate community. 
Hearthstone net bookings were stable year-over-year in the third quarter. And in October, the team launched Mercenaries, an innovative role-playing mode that gives the Hearthstone community an entirely new way to play the game. Initial results for Mercenaries have been very encouraging, and we believe Hearthstone is positioned for a return to year-over-year growth in net bookings in the fourth quarter. 
Across the Warcraft franchise, our teams are working on a substantial pipeline of content planned for next year, including new experiences in Classic and Modern WoW, more innovations in Hearthstone and getting all new mobile Warcraft content into players hands for the first time. Blizzard cannot wait to share more details on their plans.
The King business continues to deliver fantastic results with very strong year-over-year trends for both in-app purchases and advertising. MAUs were 245 million in the third quarter. King's deep capabilities in live operations are driving engagement for both existing and new players. Hours played across the King portfolio grew year-over-year in the third quarter, with players responding positively to a more frequent cadence of compelling in-game content and events for key titles. The team's prior actions to grow payer conversion alongside ongoing strong execution in user acquisition saw payer numbers growing by double-digit percentage versus the year ago quarter. 
These initiatives drove over 20% year-over-year growth in in-game net bookings for Candy Crush with Candy once again the top grossing game franchise in the U.S. app stores. Additionally, at the end of the third quarter, King launched the All Stars U.S. tournament, a competitive event that saw Candy Crush Saga players battle to be crowned the ultimate Candy Crush All Star. The event has driven meaningful increases in installs, game rounds played and in-app purchases in recent weeks, highlighting competitive gameplay as another opportunity for franchise growth and our investment in the Candy Crush brand.
In addition to this innovation and success at Candy, for several quarters now, King has been accelerating and refining content delivery in Farm Heroes, its second largest franchise. This work continued to bear fruit in Q3 and year-to-date in-game net bookings have grown around 20% year-over-year. And finally, King's advertising business again grew robustly, with quarterly revenue growing sequentially and year-over-year to a new high. Both volume and pricing grew strongly year-over-year, benefiting from the team's growing relationships with demand partners and the ongoing ramp of new categories of advertisers. 
In summary, Q3 saw solid year-over-year growth in the business, and we see substantial growth ahead for our portfolio of internally owned IP. While we have seen some slippage in the release schedule for specific titles at Blizzard, we could not be more excited about our plans to unlock the full potential of our largest franchises and to drive meaningful expansion in our reach, engagement and operating performance. This is only possible because of our teams. 
I want to share an announcement about the leadership of one of those team. Jen Oneal, who has been co-lead of Blizzard, has been a passionate advocate for bringing positive changes to the video gaming industry and has been doing so as Board member of Women in Gaming International (sic) [ Women in Games International ], or WIGI, a nonprofit organization that cultivate and advances equality and diversity in the global games industry. Jen has decided to leave the company at the end of the year, and we have agreed to support Jen in her involvement with WIGI by making a donation to WIGI in honor of Jen. In her remaining months with the company, given her commitment to this work, Jen will build the foundation of programs funded by the grant. As such, Mike Ybarra will take on Jen's leadership responsibility. It is great to see how employees at our company are committed to bring about the positive changes in our industry and beyond, and our leadership team stands behind these effort. 
Now I will hand over to Armin, who will provide more color on our financial result and outlook, Armin?"
4222231,1683581348,2454789,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Daniel.

First, I'd like to reiterate that ensuring a workplace that provides opportunity for all in the most welcoming and inclusive way is our top priority. Today, I'll review our third quarter results as well as outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2021. Our third quarter results were ahead of our prior outlook, with year-over-year growth in net bookings, revenue, operating income and EPS against difficult year ago comparables. 
Importantly, each of these metrics has also grown year-over-year on a year-to-date basis. So even as regions continues to reopen, our business is operating at significantly greater scale than that seen prior to our successful growth initiatives across our largest franchises. Let me start with our consolidated financial results. Unless otherwise indicated, I'll be referencing non-GAAP figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation. 
Now for the quarter, we generated quarter 3 GAAP revenues of $2.07 billion, $100 million above our August outlook. This includes net recognition of deferrals of $190 million. Net bookings of $1.88 billion, that’s $30 million above our August outlook. And we generated quarter 3 GAAP EPS of $0.82 and quarter 3 non-GAAP EPS of $0.89 which was $0.14 above our guidance. These figures include the net recognition of deferrals of $0.17. Quarter 3 EPS included $0.03 [ churn ] from an unrealized loss on investment as well as a benefit from a lower-than-anticipated tax rate in the quarter. 
Now turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Quarter 3 operating cash flow was $521 million, more than double the year ago level, driven by lower cash taxes and favorable working capital movements. Our cash and investments at the end of September were approximately $10 billion, and we ended the quarter with a net cash position of approximately $6.4 billion. Growing shareholder value through capital allocation is a key focus for us. And over the long term, investors should expect a balanced approach across investing in creative talent in our own business, strategic M&A and returning cash to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. 
Now let me turn to our segment results. Activision revenue was $641 million. Segment revenue was lower year-over-year as expected in our outlook. This was due to the launch of Tony Hawk's in the year ago quarter and declines in Call of Duty upfront and in-game net bookings against a quarter that benefited from shelter-at-home mandates and the early ramp of Warzone. Year-to-date, net bookings for the Activision segment and the Call of Duty franchise were higher year-over-year with the franchise now consistently operating at greater scale than before our free-to-play and mobile initiatives. Activision's third quarter operating income was $244 million and operating margin was 38%. 
Blizzard revenue of $493 million grew 20% year-over-year driven by the successful launch of Diablo II: Resurrected. Year-to-date, net bookings for Blizzard and for World of Warcraft, its largest franchise, were higher year-over-year. Blizzard's third quarter operating income was $188 million with an operating margin of 38%. 
King delivered another record quarter. Revenue grew 22% year-over-year to $652 million. That's a new high. Third quarter in-game net bookings grew in the mid-teens year-over-year while advertising grew approximately 60%. King's third quarter operating income was a record $303 million with an operating margin of 46%. The team's strong execution across live operations, marketing and advertising drove records for both revenue and operating income for the third quarter and year-to-date. King's ability to delight and engage players with robust live operation provides a lot of learning that we’re trying to apply to both Activision and Blizzard and not just in mobile. 
Looking across our segments, in-game net bookings were $1.2 billion, roughly flat year-over-year and approximately $500 million higher than the level of quarter 3 of 2019. And during the third quarter, mobile net bookings grew over 20% year-over-year driven by the strength of both Activision and King. Consumer spending and advertising within our mobile content was almost $1 billion in the quarter. And we see substantial room for further growth as we take each of our key franchises to the largest and fastest-growing platform, leveraging our creative and live operation capabilities of Activision, Blizzard and King. 
Now let me turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year. With regard to our slate, in addition to ongoing live op and in-game content across the portfolio, the fourth quarter will see Activision release Call of Duty: Vanguard this Friday, November 5, followed by the biggest Warzone update yet, Warzone Pacific, on December 2. Blizzard launched a new Mercenaries mode in Hearthstone in mid-October and will release the next Hearthstone expansion later this quarter. And King continues to support Candy Crush and other games across its portfolio with numerous seasonal events and new features. 
Our team has done a phenomenal job building this content, even if many of them continue to work from home, and we can't wait for our players to get their hands on this experience. With that said, we remain prudent in our revenue assumption for the fourth quarter. And regarding costs, we have decided to further step up investment in mobile marketing given the strong returns we are currently seeing and into compliance and employee relation. We expect the earnings impact of these investments to be offset by lower tax rate, and we continue to expect full year earnings per share to be up strongly year-over-year and comfortably ahead of the outlook provided at the beginning of the year. 
Now let me get into the specifics. For quarter 4, on a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $2.02 billion, including net deferrals of $763 million. We expect net bookings of $2.78 billion. We expect GAAP operating margin of 30%, a tax rate of 26%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 785 million and EPS of $0.54. For quarter 4 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect a tax rate of 25% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.62, including net deferrals of $0.67. This means that on a GAAP basis for 2021, we now expect revenues of $8.66 billion, including the net recognition of deferrals of $10 million. We now expect net bookings of $8.65 billion. We expect GAAP operating margin of 37%, a GAAP tax rate of 18%; GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 784 million and GAAP EPS of $3.27. For 2021, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect a tax rate of 17% and non-GAAP EPS of $3.70 including net deferrals of $0.06. 
With respect to risk, as you've heard, we're taking action to address stakeholder concern and the adverse consequences to our business from workplace issues. If we experience further adverse publicity regarding our company and executive, increased competition for talent, higher voluntary turnover, significantly reduced productivity or other negative consequences relating to these issues, our business likely would be adversely impacted. We're, therefore, carefully monitoring all aspects of our business by any such impacts, and we're taking action to help address them. 
Now I'd also like to provide some update on how we are planning for next year specifically. As a starting point, our business continues to operate at much greater scale, and we have clear line of sight to expanding the reach, engagement and financial performance of our business further in the coming years as we apply the framework that has worked so well for Call of Duty, Candy Crush to other franchises in our portfolio. 
At the same time, as Daniel described, we've taken the decision to give the Overwatch and Diablo team the extra time they need to deliver the experiences that their communities deserve and to set the franchises up for maximum success over a multiyear period. We are, therefore, currently not planning for material contribution from Overwatch 2 and Diablo IV in 2022. While this development will push out the financial uplift that we have expected to see next year, we firmly believe that this is the right course of action for our people, for the long-term success of these franchises and for our shareholders. We still have a lot of content in the pipeline for next year for our largest franchises that we can't wait to unveil and we'll provide more color on that when we provide our full year outlook in early February. 
In conclusion, we see substantial opportunity for shareholder value creation ahead to unlocking the full potential of our portfolio. This will only be possible because of our people, and we'll remain focused on ensuring a safe working environment that is essential to enable creativity and professional growth for all employees.

I feel very good about the progress actually. Right now, workplace leadership is my focus. Our opportunities for growth, as we've talked about, have never been better, but we won't be able to realize all that growth potential without talent. And to retain and attract the talent we need, we obviously have to be recognized as the very best place to work. This means we have to be the most welcoming inclusive environment and we've got to have the best industry-leading programs for growth and development. We've got to have the best recruiting capabilities for the diverse talent we need to create the very best games, and we have to have competitive compensation that is aligned with performance. 
If you think about it, over the last 30 years, we've shown that we can consistently create the very best games, and that has always translated into long-term shareholder returns that are far greater than the S&P 500 and compared to most companies. And we believe that superior shareholder returns will continue to be delivered through our franchise strategies, the operational excellence that we're recognized for. And we also recognize that to achieve the same level of shareholder returns we have historically and to ensure continued excellence in execution, we believe we and all great companies need to deliver workplace excellence. 
This means some of the things that we've discussed over the last few weeks about harassment and discrimination-free work environments, recruiting excellence to ensure we have diverse skills, abilities and talents and a culture that celebrates and rewards commitment to these principles. I couldn't be more passionate and committed to being the most performance-focused, welcoming and inclusive company in entertainment. What you heard me discuss earlier is just the beginning of the actions that we intend to take to achieve that objective. And of course, we need accountability. So we'll continue to provide regular progress in updates both quarterly to our shareholders as well as annually in our ESG reports, and we'll be monitoring the progress of our business units, our franchise teams and our functional leaders with respect to workplace initiatives, and that status will also be reported to our employees quarterly. 
Right now and going forward, communicating with our employees and getting feedback has been a crucial part of the process. We'll obviously continue to keep our investors informed, but the work that we've done with our employees has resulted in very constructive new initiatives, more that we'll continue to announce over the next few months. But the long answer to your question is I feel good about the progress that we're making. But thanks for the question."

I'd like to first recognize Jen Oneal, who has been an incredible partner here at Blizzard. Though we will all miss her greatly, we wish her all the best as we work with her on a plan to make an industry-wide impact through the WIGI grant. I personally want to thank her for her leadership. 
Since becoming the co-leader of Blizzard 3 months ago and meeting with teams around the company, I have been impressed by their passion for what they are creating and their drive to build a more inclusive culture. Looking at our upcoming releases across all of our teams here at Blizzard, we have a deep bench of veteran development talent, and we have new leadership on both Overwatch 2 and Diablo IV. Both are seasoned Blizzard developers with over 30 years’ experience at the company between them. The teams have made great progress and passed important milestones recently, and we expect these to be fantastic releases. But there's obviously been a change in leadership. 
We looked at what was left in the final phases of production with fresh eyes, and we saw that allowing the teams more time would enable both great experiences at launch and also help ensure that everything will be in place to engage the communities for many years to come. This extra time will also help us continue significantly increasing the size of our development teams ahead of the launch, again to ensure we are following up the releases with substantial content to continue delighting the community. We're not sharing release dates at this time, but I have absolute confidence in these new leaders and their teams to deliver. They care deeply about creating high-quality products and allowing everyone on their teams to bring their best selves to their projects. Thanks for the question."

As you can see from the Q3 results, had a terrific quarter and Candy achieved its highest in-app revenue quarter since the acquisition. So let me focus in on that in-app performance specifically. There are a number of initiatives that are really been contributing to the success over the recent quarters and will carry us into the future. We've increased the optimizations that we put in the game. So we think about this as a player journey and we've continued to improve that player journey with strong live op execution. This benefits across cohorts of players. So we've delivered compelling content and events more frequently across all of our key titles. 
So to give you an example, in Candy, we've increased that engagement by further developing the content slate into monthly seasonal events that really draw in new and existing players and provides fun experience across the board. With this quarter, we've complemented that with the launch of the Candy All Stars (sic) [ Candy Crush All Stars ] competition in the U.S. and we've seen some very strong initial results across reach, engagement and player investment. 
We feel -- we also found a successful formula over the past 12 months to invest and grow live ops, and we're now applying that with great results, not just in Candy, but across other games too. So our second biggest franchise, for example, Farm Heroes, over the past few quarters, we've been delivering this content cadence and great events and the farm season pass. And we've seen the results from that as well. Our in-app growth in Farm Heroes has been up 20% year-to-date as a result. 
With that, we've continued to reinvest into the network and in our brands as well. So we've seen that our payer numbers have grown double-digit percentage year-on-year versus the year ago quarter. And this is, again, down to the strong execution that we have in our teams around user acquisition. And when you combine with the features and events that are happening in the game, really an amplification of all these great trends that we are seeing. So that's also allowed us to maximize our success in more marketing investments and continuing to broaden our player base. So overall, I feel like we've demonstrated that ability to grow both revenue and operating income at the same time. We feel there's still quite a bit of runway ahead of us."

It really has just been an exceptional performance and journey. And just from an Activision, Blizzard, King perspective, just there are a lot of learnings that we really want to apply across both Activision and Blizzard and it's not just in mobile from the King team's operations. For instance, King's live operation capabilities, their deeply analytical approach to creating amazing experiences that truly engage the players and the disciplined data-driven approach to marketing is just very applicable across the rest of the business. 
So we're already making sure that these performance marketing learnings are being applied to our work on Call of Duty Mobile and to Diablo Immortal and other mobile initiatives that will be coming in the not-too-distant future across the company. So similar to how we are looking to apply the Call of Duty framework to our other franchises, it's another example of how Activision Blizzard is really leveraging the best of each of our businesses to truly maximize the potential of our portfolio.

So to start, we're obviously excited about both the launch of Vanguard this week and also Warzone's new Pacific map called Caldera, which is releasing early in December. The new map represents really the first built from the ground up new experience for Warzone since the launch of Warzone basically in March of 2020. So we think the community is going to be really excited to get in and play that and experience the entire Vanguard universe. 
Coming with that, of course, there are a lot of things, some of which were mentioned. I'll just briefly cover them. One of which was Warzone shares the same tech as Vanguard. And so what does that mean? This is the same tech that debuted with Modern Warfare. And so from a player perspective, you can get a lot more seamless weapon and play balance experience across both experiences. And what's become a staple for us now is really a game that's fully optimized for cross-play, cross-progression and cross-gen support. We've seen that the last couple of years, and that carries forward. I think importantly, for our community, we're also going to be launching RICOCHET, it's our new anti-cheat system, across Vanguard and Warzone so that our players have the best possible experience as we move forward here in the future. 
Now specifically, as to the integration, we're going to continue to have the shared progression across Vanguard and Warzone just like we had against Modern Warfare and Black Ops Cold War previously. So all the great weapons, operators, unlocks and everything that you get on the Vanguard premium experience will also be usable in Warzone. So how the 2 work together is absolutely intact and better than ever. Battle Pass and Stormfront and storm content, of course, will also go back and forth for players to use and have fun with. 
Now there is a new component for us here. And the new Warzone experience is going to offer some new dedicated playlists that are very specific to the Vanguard theme that we think is going to be really fun for the community. And of course, to honor the players' investment, we'll also have unique playlists that are more of a combined arms Battle Royale experience [ we achieve slowdowns ] across Modern Warfare, Black Ops or Vanguard. So I think that will be really fun for the community to choose how they want to experience the new map and the new content. 
And also, I think what's become a staple for us as we move forward, our players can expect a ton of free post-launch content and updates from Vanguard and from Warzone to keep them having fun for the long haul. So both games are really just going to get bigger and better as they evolve over time for the community. 
Now going back to your question on the impact of Black Ops last December, so we certainly saw an uptick last December. I believe we talked about that in the previous earnings call. And similarly, we expect another uptick this fourth quarter for our premium sales as we go through that cycle, launch the new map and see how the community engages more broadly, both within Warzone and within our premium experience. Thank you, Alexia, for the questions."

As you heard Daniel mention, first week sales were the highest recorded for a remaster from Activision Blizzard as a whole. This, alongside the continued engagement with Diablo III, really is confirmation that our plan for the Diablo franchise as a whole is the right one. There's a huge appetite from our player community for more content from this dark gothic universe, and it's our job to exceed player expectations. 
Diablo II: Resurrected is an early step towards meeting this demand. We have ignited nostalgia in players who experienced the original way back in 2000 as well as brought all new players into the fold. Diablo Immortal being in its next stage of testing is incredibly exciting, and we'll give players another window into the world of Sanctuary. They'll be able to take part in an all-new narrative in a persistent free-to-play social experience, all from their mobile devices. Immortal provides an even easier entry point for players into a game broader in scope and scale than Diablo III. 
Then Diablo IV, which will be the darkest expression of the universe yet is an immersive world, players can dive into together on PC and console. This is one of the most highly anticipated games in the industry, and we are confident that we are building something incredible. These experiences combined create an ecosystem where our players of all types can feel at home, and it doesn't stop there. Diablo will always be living and breathing with broad content updates over time to continue to delight our players. Seeing the first step of this plan executed with the release of Diablo II: Resurrected off to such a strong start is invigorating to the teams across Blizzard and we can't wait to get more into the hands of our players.

But so far, we're seeing this create opportunities for us on the user acquisition side. And as you would have seen on the advertising side, we are continuing to grow quite robustly. So on the user acquisition side, we have a very large and sophisticated user acquisition team, and they've been really hands-on and granular when they run our campaigns. 
And so when we see changes and dynamism in the industry because of IDFA, this created market opportunities that we've been able to capitalize on. And the tailwinds that we are seeing in our payer conversion and spending gives us a lot of flexibility to invest in these ROI positive opportunities. So much of our UA is aimed at win back. So over 1 billion people, we believe, have downloaded Candy in the past. And so this gives us also a very great brand advantage. 
Now on the advertising side of the house, we've seen 60% year-on-year growth, which points to our ongoing strength. We believe we have a very differentiated product there. It's a premium position with advertisers and we're still early in building our ad business.

Looking ahead, we see significant opportunities across gameplay expansion, platform expansion and geographic expansion to take this ecosystem to an entirely new level for our players around the world. I'd say put another way, we feel there's more opportunity in front of the franchise than at any point in our history. And that's a pretty incredible thing to be able to say given the success that we've seen to date. 
Of course, the next phase begins in the coming days and weeks with Vanguard and the new map, Caldera in Warzone, but really, there's so much more as we look ahead in the future, both near and long term. Driving this ambition for us, of course, is our talented development teams and the resources we have there, which we're committed to greatly expanding both at our existing studios but also geographically to find new talent around the globe. So we're expanding in locations like Austin, Guildford, Krakow, Melbourne, Mexico City and Toronto to augment our teams. 
And you may already know, we recently acquired Digital Legends in Barcelona. They joined our mobile development roster, which now includes our new internal team, Solid State as well as the mobile teams at Beenox and Shanghai were all coming together on an unannounced project in the Call of Duty universe that's very exciting.

You’ve heard today, we continue to have a very, very strong pipeline. So investing in our business and in our development teams remains our key priority. 
And as Daniel mentioned, we'll continue to look to accelerate organic hiring in this area with acqui-hiring. This was announced with Digital Legends purchase last week, but these type of transactions are typically smaller in nature. Now with regards to larger M&A, we're always on the lookout for large established franchises that have potential for global scale and strong management teams with a track record of profitability and, of course, an attractive valuation that hits our return threshold. 
Now as you know, we have been very disciplined and patient in this area. But the longer-term opportunity for M&A means that we place significant option value on having a strong and flexible balance sheet. Now at the same time, with respect to buybacks, to come to the core of your question, we do have a $4 billion authorization. And while you haven't seen us do anything in a long time here, we do evaluate our position with respect to buyback frequently. 
Now obviously, the increase in cash generation from the company gives us more and more flexibility over time. But just bear in mind, though, that we don't announce when we're buying back stock ahead of time and that sometimes there may be restrictions in our ability to comment on the buyback. So in summary, expect us to be -- continue to be balanced and disciplined in how we allocate capital, always with a view to the long-term shareholder value creation. Thank you for your question."

4222231,1683581348,2454791,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chris, and thank you all for joining us today. As I said during our last earnings call, I want Activision Blizzard to be the leader in our industry for workplace culture. Since then, the leadership team and I have been hard at work listening to",976,"Thank you, Chris, and thank you all for joining us today. As I said during our last earnings call, I want Activision Blizzard to be the leader in our industry for workplace culture. Since then, the leadership team and I have been hard at work listening to employees and implementing meaningful changes. I'd like to review the actions we've taken over the past few months with you today. 
As we've made clear in certain instances relating to workplace culture, we should have done a better job ensuring our values were embraced across all parts of the company. Over the last few years, we've been focused on the improvements that are necessary to become a model workplace. We are, of course, taking these actions because any single instance of wrongful conduct at our company is unacceptable. But these actions we're taking are also the right ones for our business success. We can't achieve our business ambitions without the very best talent. People with the talents we need have more alternatives for highly paid work opportunities than ever before. If we don't constantly evolve as a great place to work, we won't retain or attract the talent we need to realize our tremendous potential. 
As a company, we have more opportunities ahead of us than I've seen in almost all the years I've led the company. The success we've achieved thus far is the result of an overwhelmingly large number of extraordinarily talented people with high integrity and good values focused on delivering great games to our players, which has resulted in superior shareholder returns. This company and many of its leaders and so many of our talented employees, past and present, have shown strength of will, dedicated to the achievement of bold aspiration. Our commitment to make Activision Blizzard the most welcoming and inclusive company in the world will be accomplished the same way our industry leadership has been accomplished, focusing commitment, persistence, strength of will, the unwavering ambition of truly talented people with equally unwavering integrity and the continuous commitments to improvement. 
In September, we announced a comprehensive agreement with the U.S. Equal Opportunity Commission, which is subject to court approval to strengthen policies and programs intended to further improve the prevention of harassment, discrimination and related content. And as part of this agreement, we'll establish an $18 million fund to compensate those who have experienced such behavior at our company. 
With respect to pay equity, another critically important issue that we have always worked hard to ensure we achieve, we recently disclosed to employees the results of our review of 2020 pay equity at our company, which was conducted by an independent research firm. The U.S. analysis showed that women on average earned slightly more than men for comparable work in 2020. And we're committed to compensation remaining equitable for men and women performing comparable work always. 
Last week, we also announced a number of important new workplace initiatives. We announced a zero-tolerance harassment policy company-wide. This includes tougher rules and greater consistency across the organization to make certain reports are always properly and promptly handled. Now any Activision Blizzard employee found through our new investigative processes and resources to have retaliated against anyone for making a compliance complaint will be terminated immediately. In many other instances of workplace misconduct, we will no longer rely on written warnings. Terminations will be the outcome, including in most cases of harassment based on any legally protected category. Future employment contracts and equity awards will state that termination for these reasons will result in immediate forfeiture of future compensation. 
Another is our pledge to increase the percentage of women and nonbinary people in our workforce by 50%. Today, approximately 23% of our global employee population identifies as women or nonbinary. So within the next 5 years and hopefully faster, we will seek to increase our percentage of women and nonbinary professionals to more than 1/3 across the entire company. To further this commitment, we'll be investing an additional $250 million over the next 10 years in initiatives that foster expanded opportunities in gaming and technology for underrepresented communities. 
Additionally, based on feedback from many employees, we are waiving required arbitration of future individual sexual harassment and discrimination claim. That means for any employee who chooses not to arbitrate an individual claim of sexual harassment, unlawful discrimination or related retaliation arising in the future, the company will waive any obligation to do so. 
As we report regularly on our progress and our financial results, you will continue to hear more about our workplace initiatives which we firmly believe will help us remain one of the world's most successful entertainment company. I want to thank our employees for their continued commitment to each other, the company and our player. For those employees past and present who have been brave enough to step forward and share their stories, we continue to be committed to investigating all claims thoroughly and holding people accountable. For those employees who have shared feedback, thought, suggestion, concerns and complaint and there are many of you, we hope you can see from our actions that we are listening. We are evolving our organization through your ideas and active participation in their execution. 
And for those employees who have worked tirelessly to deliver great experiences to our players, your resilience in these challenging times is inspiring. We expect that we'll continue to face challenging and negative media attention regardless of our progress, but we are determined to stay focused on providing great opportunities and the very best work environment for our talented employees to deliver the very best games for our players and to continue to provide superior returns for our shareholders. Thank you for your participation today. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Daniel to share the results of our operations for the last quarter."

Before I discuss our operating results, I want to take this opportunity to thank our incredibly talented teams across the entire company who share the passion to make exciting and groundbreaking experiences for our players all around the",2078,"Thank you, Bobby. Before I discuss our operating results, I want to take this opportunity to thank our incredibly talented teams across the entire company who share the passion to make exciting and groundbreaking experiences for our players all around the world. Activision Blizzard's third quarter results were above our outlook. Our monthly active users and time spent in our content were consistent with the year ago level, even as regions continued to reopen, while net bookings and operating income grew year-over-year. This performance again illustrates the structural expansion in our largest franchises as we execute our strategy of delivering gaming experiences across new platforms with more regular content and leveraging multiple commercialization models including free-to-play. 
Execution against this strategy enables us to grow our community, including in geographies outside of our traditional regions, to deepen engagement and to create more opportunities for player investment. Critical to this is a continued investment in creative talent. We continued to grow our developer head count in the third quarter and have increased our development organization by hundreds of talented professionals year-to-date, including announcing new studios and expansions in multiple new cities globally. This geographic diversification strategy is paying dividends, allowing us to tap into critical talent pools in all corners of the world. 
As we grow our teams with new hires, we are keenly aware of the importance and responsibility we have to ensure a safe working environment for our people. This is our #1 priority. Specifically, in recent months, we have taken actions that resulted in the departure of a number of individuals across the company. Additionally, we have seen increased competition in the market for our talent and higher voluntary turnover that has partly offset our success in hiring. 
As we have worked with new leadership in Blizzard and within the franchises themselves, particularly in certain key creative roles, it's become apparent that some of the Blizzard content plan for next year will benefit from more development time to reach its full potential. While we are still planning to deliver a substantial amount of content from Blizzard next year, we are now planning for a later launch for Overwatch 2 and Diablo IV than originally envisaged. 
These are 2 of the most eagerly anticipated titles in the industry, and our teams have made great strides towards completion in recent quarters. But we believe giving the teams some extra time to complete production and continue growing their creative resources to support the titles after launch will ensure that these releases delight and engage their communities for many years into the future. These decisions will push out the financial uplift that we had expected to see next year. But we are confident that this is the right course of action for our people, our players and the long-term success of our franchises. 
Now I will cover our third quarter franchise and operational highlights across our business units. Starting with Activision, where, on average, 119 million people engage in our content monthly in the third quarter. Call of Duty continues to sustain reach, engagement and player investment well above levels seen prior to our introduction of free-to-play experiences across console, PC and mobile. 
Monthly active users in the franchise were consistent year-over-year on console, PC and grew our mobile. Console and PC engagement trends were consistent with typical trends as we moved away from the premium launch even as regions continue to reopen through the quarter. Console and PC MAUs and time spent exhibited very similar retention from Q2 to Q3 as our experiences in prior years. In-game player investment on console and PC remained well above pre-Warzone levels at approximately 3x the level of Q3 2019. And strong conversion from free-to-play drove premium sales higher than in any third quarter prior the launch of Warzone. 
And our teams are all set to launch the next phase of exciting new Call of Duty content for players worldwide. This Friday sees the release of Call of Duty: Vanguard. And on December 2, we will roll out Call of Duty: Warzone Pacific, the biggest update to the Warzone experience since launch. As we've demonstrated with Modern Warfare and Black Ops: Cold War, the release of Vanguard is just the first step in delivering the community an incredible amount of ongoing content, live engagement and much more. 
Across campaign, zombies, multiplayer and War Zone, there's no bigger experience or better value over the duration of the game's life cycle across our premium and free-to-play business. And then we expect Warzone Pacific and its new Caldera map to take the free-to-play experience to another level. The premium and free-to-play experiences are more integrated than ever before sharing the same engine, weapon integration and content integration as well as Call of Duty standards of cross-play, cross-progression and more. Both titles are set to benefit from RICOCHET, a new anti-cheat technology aimed at addressing one of the key improvements requested by the community. We are confident that our players are in store for an incredible set of experiences this holiday season and beyond. 
On mobile, Call of Duty net bookings grew over 40% year-over-year in the third quarter driven by double-digit growth in the West and a continued contribution from the game in China. The team continues to refine the player experience, building on learnings from the title's first 2 years to optimize content, events and features for our communities around the world. And at the same time, we continue to ramp our teams working on new mobile title within the Call of Duty universe. In addition to hiring a substantial number of developers over the last quarter, we are pleased to announce last week the acquisition of Digital Legends, a Barcelona-based mobile game developer that will further bolster the world-class team we are assembling. 
Turning to Blizzard. Monthly active users were 26 million in the third quarter. For Diablo, our plan to deliver an era of unprecedented levels of content for the franchise has experienced a strong start with the September release of Diablo II: Resurrected, the return of one of the most acclaimed titles in PC gaming history. First week of sales of the title were the highest recorded for a remaster from our company, and we have seen strong ongoing demand, particularly in Korea, where the game is proving one of the most popular titles in Internet game rooms. 
With such strong engagement, the team is now working hard to ensure that players have the smoothest possible experience as they explore the world of Sanctuary. This is just the first step in Blizzard's plans for the franchise. On mobile, Diablo Immortal is in public testing and remains on track for release in the first half of next year. And with Diablo IV set to be the foundation for great experiences for PC and console fans over many years, we believe the pieces are in place to expand and serve the Diablo community better than ever before. 
Turning to Overwatch, where millions of people continue to engage in both the game and esport. September saw the grand finals of the Overwatch League become the most watched in the league's history. Starting in the spring, the next season of Overwatch League will run on an early build of Overwatch 2's new 5v5 competitive multiplayer mode, giving the community a fantastic view into the development team's strong work on the next iteration in the franchise. And the team plans to follow this with new content and initiatives to engage existing, returning and new Overwatch players next year. 
Within the Warcraft franchise, World of Warcraft reach and engagement continues to benefit from the combination of the Modern game and Classic under a single subscription. The 2 games offer players more ways to engage and create more opportunities for our teams to deliver compelling experiences to fans of the franchise. With deep engagement across both Classic and Modern, WoW's overall subscriber base is stronger than we typically see at this point after a Modern expansion launch. And for 2021, World of Warcraft is on track to deliver its strongest engagement and net bookings outside of a Modern expansion year in a decade. 
Our WoW team has been rolling out numerous quality of life improvement across the Modern and Classic games franchise in response to player feedback. And today, the Modern game released its latest content update with Classic soon to launch fresh servers, with greater challenges to engage the passionate community. 
Hearthstone net bookings were stable year-over-year in the third quarter. And in October, the team launched Mercenaries, an innovative role-playing mode that gives the Hearthstone community an entirely new way to play the game. Initial results for Mercenaries have been very encouraging, and we believe Hearthstone is positioned for a return to year-over-year growth in net bookings in the fourth quarter. 
Across the Warcraft franchise, our teams are working on a substantial pipeline of content planned for next year, including new experiences in Classic and Modern WoW, more innovations in Hearthstone and getting all new mobile Warcraft content into players hands for the first time. Blizzard cannot wait to share more details on their plans.
The King business continues to deliver fantastic results with very strong year-over-year trends for both in-app purchases and advertising. MAUs were 245 million in the third quarter. King's deep capabilities in live operations are driving engagement for both existing and new players. Hours played across the King portfolio grew year-over-year in the third quarter, with players responding positively to a more frequent cadence of compelling in-game content and events for key titles. The team's prior actions to grow payer conversion alongside ongoing strong execution in user acquisition saw payer numbers growing by double-digit percentage versus the year ago quarter. 
These initiatives drove over 20% year-over-year growth in in-game net bookings for Candy Crush with Candy once again the top grossing game franchise in the U.S. app stores. Additionally, at the end of the third quarter, King launched the All Stars U.S. tournament, a competitive event that saw Candy Crush Saga players battle to be crowned the ultimate Candy Crush All Star. The event has driven meaningful increases in installs, game rounds played and in-app purchases in recent weeks, highlighting competitive gameplay as another opportunity for franchise growth and our investment in the Candy Crush brand.
In addition to this innovation and success at Candy, for several quarters now, King has been accelerating and refining content delivery in Farm Heroes, its second largest franchise. This work continued to bear fruit in Q3 and year-to-date in-game net bookings have grown around 20% year-over-year. And finally, King's advertising business again grew robustly, with quarterly revenue growing sequentially and year-over-year to a new high. Both volume and pricing grew strongly year-over-year, benefiting from the team's growing relationships with demand partners and the ongoing ramp of new categories of advertisers. 
In summary, Q3 saw solid year-over-year growth in the business, and we see substantial growth ahead for our portfolio of internally owned IP. While we have seen some slippage in the release schedule for specific titles at Blizzard, we could not be more excited about our plans to unlock the full potential of our largest franchises and to drive meaningful expansion in our reach, engagement and operating performance. This is only possible because of our teams. 
I want to share an announcement about the leadership of one of those team. Jen Oneal, who has been co-lead of Blizzard, has been a passionate advocate for bringing positive changes to the video gaming industry and has been doing so as Board member of Women in Gaming International (sic) [ Women in Games International ], or WIGI, a nonprofit organization that cultivate and advances equality and diversity in the global games industry. Jen has decided to leave the company at the end of the year, and we have agreed to support Jen in her involvement with WIGI by making a donation to WIGI in honor of Jen. In her remaining months with the company, given her commitment to this work, Jen will build the foundation of programs funded by the grant. As such, Mike Ybarra will take on Jen's leadership responsibility. It is great to see how employees at our company are committed to bring about the positive changes in our industry and beyond, and our leadership team stands behind these effort. 
Now I will hand over to Armin, who will provide more color on our financial result and outlook, Armin?"
4222231,1683581348,2454791,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Daniel.

First, I'd like to reiterate that ensuring a workplace that provides opportunity for all in the most welcoming and inclusive way is our top priority. Today, I'll review our third quarter results as well as outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2021. Our third quarter results were ahead of our prior outlook, with year-over-year growth in net bookings, revenue, operating income and EPS against difficult year ago comparables. 
Importantly, each of these metrics has also grown year-over-year on a year-to-date basis. So even as regions continues to reopen, our business is operating at significantly greater scale than that seen prior to our successful growth initiatives across our largest franchises. Let me start with our consolidated financial results. Unless otherwise indicated, I'll be referencing non-GAAP figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation. 
Now for the quarter, we generated quarter 3 GAAP revenues of $2.07 billion, $100 million above our August outlook. This includes net recognition of deferrals of $190 million. Net bookings of $1.88 billion, that’s $30 million above our August outlook. And we generated quarter 3 GAAP EPS of $0.82 and quarter 3 non-GAAP EPS of $0.89 which was $0.14 above our guidance. These figures include the net recognition of deferrals of $0.17. Quarter 3 EPS included $0.03 [ churn ] from an unrealized loss on investment as well as a benefit from a lower-than-anticipated tax rate in the quarter. 
Now turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Quarter 3 operating cash flow was $521 million, more than double the year ago level, driven by lower cash taxes and favorable working capital movements. Our cash and investments at the end of September were approximately $10 billion, and we ended the quarter with a net cash position of approximately $6.4 billion. Growing shareholder value through capital allocation is a key focus for us. And over the long term, investors should expect a balanced approach across investing in creative talent in our own business, strategic M&A and returning cash to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. 
Now let me turn to our segment results. Activision revenue was $641 million. Segment revenue was lower year-over-year as expected in our outlook. This was due to the launch of Tony Hawk's in the year ago quarter and declines in Call of Duty upfront and in-game net bookings against a quarter that benefited from shelter-at-home mandates and the early ramp of Warzone. Year-to-date, net bookings for the Activision segment and the Call of Duty franchise were higher year-over-year with the franchise now consistently operating at greater scale than before our free-to-play and mobile initiatives. Activision's third quarter operating income was $244 million and operating margin was 38%. 
Blizzard revenue of $493 million grew 20% year-over-year driven by the successful launch of Diablo II: Resurrected. Year-to-date, net bookings for Blizzard and for World of Warcraft, its largest franchise, were higher year-over-year. Blizzard's third quarter operating income was $188 million with an operating margin of 38%. 
King delivered another record quarter. Revenue grew 22% year-over-year to $652 million. That's a new high. Third quarter in-game net bookings grew in the mid-teens year-over-year while advertising grew approximately 60%. King's third quarter operating income was a record $303 million with an operating margin of 46%. The team's strong execution across live operations, marketing and advertising drove records for both revenue and operating income for the third quarter and year-to-date. King's ability to delight and engage players with robust live operation provides a lot of learning that we’re trying to apply to both Activision and Blizzard and not just in mobile. 
Looking across our segments, in-game net bookings were $1.2 billion, roughly flat year-over-year and approximately $500 million higher than the level of quarter 3 of 2019. And during the third quarter, mobile net bookings grew over 20% year-over-year driven by the strength of both Activision and King. Consumer spending and advertising within our mobile content was almost $1 billion in the quarter. And we see substantial room for further growth as we take each of our key franchises to the largest and fastest-growing platform, leveraging our creative and live operation capabilities of Activision, Blizzard and King. 
Now let me turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year. With regard to our slate, in addition to ongoing live op and in-game content across the portfolio, the fourth quarter will see Activision release Call of Duty: Vanguard this Friday, November 5, followed by the biggest Warzone update yet, Warzone Pacific, on December 2. Blizzard launched a new Mercenaries mode in Hearthstone in mid-October and will release the next Hearthstone expansion later this quarter. And King continues to support Candy Crush and other games across its portfolio with numerous seasonal events and new features. 
Our team has done a phenomenal job building this content, even if many of them continue to work from home, and we can't wait for our players to get their hands on this experience. With that said, we remain prudent in our revenue assumption for the fourth quarter. And regarding costs, we have decided to further step up investment in mobile marketing given the strong returns we are currently seeing and into compliance and employee relation. We expect the earnings impact of these investments to be offset by lower tax rate, and we continue to expect full year earnings per share to be up strongly year-over-year and comfortably ahead of the outlook provided at the beginning of the year. 
Now let me get into the specifics. For quarter 4, on a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $2.02 billion, including net deferrals of $763 million. We expect net bookings of $2.78 billion. We expect GAAP operating margin of 30%, a tax rate of 26%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 785 million and EPS of $0.54. For quarter 4 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect a tax rate of 25% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.62, including net deferrals of $0.67. This means that on a GAAP basis for 2021, we now expect revenues of $8.66 billion, including the net recognition of deferrals of $10 million. We now expect net bookings of $8.65 billion. We expect GAAP operating margin of 37%, a GAAP tax rate of 18%; GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 784 million and GAAP EPS of $3.27. For 2021, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect a tax rate of 17% and non-GAAP EPS of $3.70 including net deferrals of $0.06. 
With respect to risk, as you've heard, we're taking action to address stakeholder concern and the adverse consequences to our business from workplace issues. If we experience further adverse publicity regarding our company and executive, increased competition for talent, higher voluntary turnover, significantly reduced productivity or other negative consequences relating to these issues, our business likely would be adversely impacted. We're, therefore, carefully monitoring all aspects of our business by any such impacts, and we're taking action to help address them. 
Now I'd also like to provide some update on how we are planning for next year specifically. As a starting point, our business continues to operate at much greater scale, and we have clear line of sight to expanding the reach, engagement and financial performance of our business further in the coming years as we apply the framework that has worked so well for Call of Duty, Candy Crush to other franchises in our portfolio. 
At the same time, as Daniel described, we've taken the decision to give the Overwatch and Diablo team the extra time they need to deliver the experiences that their communities deserve and to set the franchises up for maximum success over a multiyear period. We are, therefore, currently not planning for material contribution from Overwatch 2 and Diablo IV in 2022. While this development will push out the financial uplift that we have expected to see next year, we firmly believe that this is the right course of action for our people, for the long-term success of these franchises and for our shareholders. We still have a lot of content in the pipeline for next year for our largest franchises that we can't wait to unveil and we'll provide more color on that when we provide our full year outlook in early February. 
In conclusion, we see substantial opportunity for shareholder value creation ahead to unlocking the full potential of our portfolio. This will only be possible because of our people, and we'll remain focused on ensuring a safe working environment that is essential to enable creativity and professional growth for all employees.

I feel very good about the progress actually. Right now, workplace leadership is my focus. Our opportunities for growth, as we've talked about, have never been better, but we won't be able to realize all that growth potential without talent. And to retain and attract the talent we need, we obviously have to be recognized as the very best place to work. This means we have to be the most welcoming inclusive environment and we've got to have the best industry-leading programs for growth and development. We've got to have the best recruiting capabilities for the diverse talent we need to create the very best games, and we have to have competitive compensation that is aligned with performance. 
If you think about it, over the last 30 years, we've shown that we can consistently create the very best games, and that has always translated into long-term shareholder returns that are far greater than the S&P 500 and compared to most companies. And we believe that superior shareholder returns will continue to be delivered through our franchise strategies, the operational excellence that we're recognized for. And we also recognize that to achieve the same level of shareholder returns we have historically and to ensure continued excellence in execution, we believe we and all great companies need to deliver workplace excellence. 
This means some of the things that we've discussed over the last few weeks about harassment and discrimination-free work environments, recruiting excellence to ensure we have diverse skills, abilities and talents and a culture that celebrates and rewards commitment to these principles. I couldn't be more passionate and committed to being the most performance-focused, welcoming and inclusive company in entertainment. What you heard me discuss earlier is just the beginning of the actions that we intend to take to achieve that objective. And of course, we need accountability. So we'll continue to provide regular progress in updates both quarterly to our shareholders as well as annually in our ESG reports, and we'll be monitoring the progress of our business units, our franchise teams and our functional leaders with respect to workplace initiatives, and that status will also be reported to our employees quarterly. 
Right now and going forward, communicating with our employees and getting feedback has been a crucial part of the process. We'll obviously continue to keep our investors informed, but the work that we've done with our employees has resulted in very constructive new initiatives, more that we'll continue to announce over the next few months. But the long answer to your question is I feel good about the progress that we're making. But thanks for the question."

I'd like to first recognize Jen Oneal, who has been an incredible partner here at Blizzard. Though we will all miss her greatly, we wish her all the best as we work with her on a plan to make an industry-wide impact through the WIGI grant. I personally want to thank her for her leadership. 
Since becoming the co-leader of Blizzard 3 months ago and meeting with teams around the company, I have been impressed by their passion for what they are creating and their drive to build a more inclusive culture. Looking at our upcoming releases across all of our teams here at Blizzard, we have a deep bench of veteran development talent, and we have new leadership on both Overwatch 2 and Diablo IV. Both are seasoned Blizzard developers with over 30 years’ experience at the company between them. The teams have made great progress and passed important milestones recently, and we expect these to be fantastic releases. But there's obviously been a change in leadership. 
We looked at what was left in the final phases of production with fresh eyes, and we saw that allowing the teams more time would enable both great experiences at launch and also help ensure that everything will be in place to engage the communities for many years to come. This extra time will also help us continue significantly increasing the size of our development teams ahead of the launch, again to ensure we are following up the releases with substantial content to continue delighting the community. We're not sharing release dates at this time, but I have absolute confidence in these new leaders and their teams to deliver. They care deeply about creating high-quality products and allowing everyone on their teams to bring their best selves to their projects. Thanks for the question."

As you can see from the Q3 results, had a terrific quarter and Candy achieved its highest in-app revenue quarter since the acquisition. So let me focus in on that in-app performance specifically. There are a number of initiatives that are really been contributing to the success over the recent quarters and will carry us into the future. We've increased the optimizations that we put in the game. So we think about this as a player journey and we've continued to improve that player journey with strong live op execution. This benefits across cohorts of players. So we've delivered compelling content and events more frequently across all of our key titles. 
So to give you an example, in Candy, we've increased that engagement by further developing the content slate into monthly seasonal events that really draw in new and existing players and provides fun experience across the board. With this quarter, we've complemented that with the launch of the Candy All Stars (sic) [ Candy Crush All Stars ] competition in the U.S. and we've seen some very strong initial results across reach, engagement and player investment. 
We feel -- we also found a successful formula over the past 12 months to invest and grow live ops, and we're now applying that with great results, not just in Candy, but across other games too. So our second biggest franchise, for example, Farm Heroes, over the past few quarters, we've been delivering this content cadence and great events and the farm season pass. And we've seen the results from that as well. Our in-app growth in Farm Heroes has been up 20% year-to-date as a result. 
With that, we've continued to reinvest into the network and in our brands as well. So we've seen that our payer numbers have grown double-digit percentage year-on-year versus the year ago quarter. And this is, again, down to the strong execution that we have in our teams around user acquisition. And when you combine with the features and events that are happening in the game, really an amplification of all these great trends that we are seeing. So that's also allowed us to maximize our success in more marketing investments and continuing to broaden our player base. So overall, I feel like we've demonstrated that ability to grow both revenue and operating income at the same time. We feel there's still quite a bit of runway ahead of us."

It really has just been an exceptional performance and journey. And just from an Activision, Blizzard, King perspective, just there are a lot of learnings that we really want to apply across both Activision and Blizzard and it's not just in mobile from the King team's operations. For instance, King's live operation capabilities, their deeply analytical approach to creating amazing experiences that truly engage the players and the disciplined data-driven approach to marketing is just very applicable across the rest of the business. 
So we're already making sure that these performance marketing learnings are being applied to our work on Call of Duty Mobile and to Diablo Immortal and other mobile initiatives that will be coming in the not-too-distant future across the company. So similar to how we are looking to apply the Call of Duty framework to our other franchises, it's another example of how Activision Blizzard is really leveraging the best of each of our businesses to truly maximize the potential of our portfolio.

So to start, we're obviously excited about both the launch of Vanguard this week and also Warzone's new Pacific map called Caldera, which is releasing early in December. The new map represents really the first built from the ground up new experience for Warzone since the launch of Warzone basically in March of 2020. So we think the community is going to be really excited to get in and play that and experience the entire Vanguard universe. 
Coming with that, of course, there are a lot of things, some of which were mentioned. I'll just briefly cover them. One of which was Warzone shares the same tech as Vanguard. And so what does that mean? This is the same tech that debuted with Modern Warfare. And so from a player perspective, you can get a lot more seamless weapon and play balance experience across both experiences. And what's become a staple for us now is really a game that's fully optimized for cross-play, cross-progression and cross-gen support. We've seen that the last couple of years, and that carries forward. I think importantly, for our community, we're also going to be launching RICOCHET, it's our new anti-cheat system, across Vanguard and Warzone so that our players have the best possible experience as we move forward here in the future. 
Now specifically, as to the integration, we're going to continue to have the shared progression across Vanguard and Warzone just like we had against Modern Warfare and Black Ops Cold War previously. So all the great weapons, operators, unlocks and everything that you get on the Vanguard premium experience will also be usable in Warzone. So how the 2 work together is absolutely intact and better than ever. Battle Pass and Stormfront and storm content, of course, will also go back and forth for players to use and have fun with. 
Now there is a new component for us here. And the new Warzone experience is going to offer some new dedicated playlists that are very specific to the Vanguard theme that we think is going to be really fun for the community. And of course, to honor the players' investment, we'll also have unique playlists that are more of a combined arms Battle Royale experience [ we achieve slowdowns ] across Modern Warfare, Black Ops or Vanguard. So I think that will be really fun for the community to choose how they want to experience the new map and the new content. 
And also, I think what's become a staple for us as we move forward, our players can expect a ton of free post-launch content and updates from Vanguard and from Warzone to keep them having fun for the long haul. So both games are really just going to get bigger and better as they evolve over time for the community. 
Now going back to your question on the impact of Black Ops last December, so we certainly saw an uptick last December. I believe we talked about that in the previous earnings call. And similarly, we expect another uptick this fourth quarter for our premium sales as we go through that cycle, launch the new map and see how the community engages more broadly, both within Warzone and within our premium experience. Thank you, Alexia, for the questions."

As you heard Daniel mention, first week sales were the highest recorded for a remaster from Activision Blizzard as a whole. This, alongside the continued engagement with Diablo III, really is confirmation that our plan for the Diablo franchise as a whole is the right one. There's a huge appetite from our player community for more content from this dark gothic universe, and it's our job to exceed player expectations. 
Diablo II: Resurrected is an early step towards meeting this demand. We have ignited nostalgia in players who experienced the original way back in 2000 as well as brought all new players into the fold. Diablo Immortal being in its next stage of testing is incredibly exciting, and we'll give players another window into the world of Sanctuary. They'll be able to take part in an all-new narrative in a persistent free-to-play social experience, all from their mobile devices. Immortal provides an even easier entry point for players into a game broader in scope and scale than Diablo III. 
Then Diablo IV, which will be the darkest expression of the universe yet is an immersive world, players can dive into together on PC and console. This is one of the most highly anticipated games in the industry, and we are confident that we are building something incredible. These experiences combined create an ecosystem where our players of all types can feel at home, and it doesn't stop there. Diablo will always be living and breathing with broad content updates over time to continue to delight our players. Seeing the first step of this plan executed with the release of Diablo II: Resurrected off to such a strong start is invigorating to the teams across Blizzard and we can't wait to get more into the hands of our players.

So on the user acquisition side, we have a very large and sophisticated user acquisition team, and they've been really hands-on and granular when they run our campaigns. 
And so when we see changes and dynamism in the industry because of IDFA, this created market opportunities that we've been able to capitalize on. And the tailwinds that we are seeing in our payer conversion and spending gives us a lot of flexibility to invest in these ROI positive opportunities. So much of our UA is aimed at win back. So over 1 billion people, we believe, have downloaded Candy in the past. And so this gives us also a very great brand advantage.

Looking ahead, we see significant opportunities across gameplay expansion, platform expansion and geographic expansion to take this ecosystem to an entirely new level for our players around the world. I'd say put another way, we feel there's more opportunity in front of the franchise than at any point in our history. And that's a pretty incredible thing to be able to say given the success that we've seen to date. 
Of course, the next phase begins in the coming days and weeks with Vanguard and the new map, Caldera in Warzone, but really, there's so much more as we look ahead in the future, both near and long term. Driving this ambition for us, of course, is our talented development teams and the resources we have there, which we're committed to greatly expanding both at our existing studios but also geographically to find new talent around the globe. So we're expanding in locations like Austin, Guildford, Krakow, Melbourne, Mexico City and Toronto to augment our teams.

They joined our mobile development roster, which now includes our new internal team, Solid State as well as the mobile teams at Beenox and Shanghai were all coming together on an unannounced project in the Call of Duty universe that's very exciting.

You’ve heard today, we continue to have a very, very strong pipeline. So investing in our business and in our development teams remains our key priority. 
And as Daniel mentioned, we'll continue to look to accelerate organic hiring in this area with acqui-hiring. This was announced with Digital Legends purchase last week, but these type of transactions are typically smaller in nature. Now with regards to larger M&A, we're always on the lookout for large established franchises that have potential for global scale and strong management teams with a track record of profitability and, of course, an attractive valuation that hits our return threshold. 
Now as you know, we have been very disciplined and patient in this area. But the longer-term opportunity for M&A means that we place significant option value on having a strong and flexible balance sheet. Now at the same time, with respect to buybacks, to come to the core of your question, we do have a $4 billion authorization. And while you haven't seen us do anything in a long time here, we do evaluate our position with respect to buyback frequently. 
Now obviously, the increase in cash generation from the company gives us more and more flexibility over time. But just bear in mind, though, that we don't announce when we're buying back stock ahead of time and that sometimes there may be restrictions in our ability to comment on the buyback. So in summary, expect us to be -- continue to be balanced and disciplined in how we allocate capital, always with a view to the long-term shareholder value creation. Thank you for your question."

And it's also setting -- a setting that fosters creative excellence, and importantly, fantastic career opportunities where people are willing to invest their time and their careers at our company. You've heard from us today some of the measures that we're taking to ensure that, and we will continue to make significant progress. 
And when it comes to hiring, we're really fortunate that many individuals want to work on our franchises for which they have just tremendous affinity. They've played it for a very long time, oftentimes since they were little. And we can offer that with some of the biggest franchises in the world. We also have the financial scale that enables us to compete for that talent. But I know that's not enough. And especially with many people's attitudes to where and how they want to work changing during the pandemic, we have to keep that in mind. And we're giving our teams the flexibility that they need. 
And we have also been investing in studios, as Rob mentioned, in many locations that are new for us, including Krakow, Melbourne, Toronto and Mexico City, where I'm from. We've had a lot of success in hiring in recent months in those franchises that were earliest in embracing this geographic expansion and flexibility, particularly for Call of Duty and for Candy Crush, and we've already started to pursue that same approach for Blizzard and Blizzard's franchises. And Mike, he is completely on board with this as we continue to invest and grow our teams in multiple locations. So thank you for the question."

4222231,1683581348,2467459,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chris, and thank you all for joining us today. As I said during our last earnings call, I want Activision Blizzard to be the leader in our industry for workplace culture. Since then, the leadership team and I have been hard at work listening to",976,"Thank you, Chris, and thank you all for joining us today. As I said during our last earnings call, I want Activision Blizzard to be the leader in our industry for workplace culture. Since then, the leadership team and I have been hard at work listening to employees and implementing meaningful changes. I'd like to review the actions we've taken over the past few months with you today. 
As we've made clear in certain instances relating to workplace culture, we should have done a better job ensuring our values were embraced across all parts of the company. Over the last few years, we've been focused on the improvements that are necessary to become a model workplace. We are, of course, taking these actions because any single instance of wrongful conduct at our company is unacceptable. But these actions we're taking are also the right ones for our business success. We can't achieve our business ambitions without the very best talent. People with the talents we need have more alternatives for highly paid work opportunities than ever before. If we don't constantly evolve as a great place to work, we won't retain or attract the talent we need to realize our tremendous potential. 
As a company, we have more opportunities ahead of us than I've seen in almost all the years I've led the company. The success we've achieved thus far is the result of an overwhelmingly large number of extraordinarily talented people with high integrity and good values focused on delivering great games to our players, which has resulted in superior shareholder returns. This company and many of its leaders and so many of our talented employees, past and present, have shown strength of will, dedicated to the achievement of bold aspiration. Our commitment to make Activision Blizzard the most welcoming and inclusive company in the world will be accomplished the same way our industry leadership has been accomplished, focusing commitment, persistence, strength of will, the unwavering ambition of truly talented people with equally unwavering integrity and the continuous commitments to improvement. 
In September, we announced a comprehensive agreement with the U.S. Equal Opportunity Commission, which is subject to court approval to strengthen policies and programs intended to further improve the prevention of harassment, discrimination and related content. And as part of this agreement, we'll establish an $18 million fund to compensate those who have experienced such behavior at our company. 
With respect to pay equity, another critically important issue that we have always worked hard to ensure we achieve, we recently disclosed to employees the results of our review of 2020 pay equity at our company, which was conducted by an independent research firm. The U.S. analysis showed that women on average earned slightly more than men for comparable work in 2020. And we're committed to compensation remaining equitable for men and women performing comparable work always. 
Last week, we also announced a number of important new workplace initiatives. We announced a zero-tolerance harassment policy company-wide. This includes tougher rules and greater consistency across the organization to make certain reports are always properly and promptly handled. Now any Activision Blizzard employee found through our new investigative processes and resources to have retaliated against anyone for making a compliance complaint will be terminated immediately. In many other instances of workplace misconduct, we will no longer rely on written warnings. Terminations will be the outcome, including in most cases of harassment based on any legally protected category. Future employment contracts and equity awards will state that termination for these reasons will result in immediate forfeiture of future compensation. 
Another is our pledge to increase the percentage of women and nonbinary people in our workforce by 50%. Today, approximately 23% of our global employee population identifies as women or nonbinary. So within the next 5 years and hopefully faster, we will seek to increase our percentage of women and nonbinary professionals to more than 1/3 across the entire company. To further this commitment, we'll be investing an additional $250 million over the next 10 years in initiatives that foster expanded opportunities in gaming and technology for underrepresented communities. 
Additionally, based on feedback from many employees, we are waiving required arbitration of future individual sexual harassment and discrimination claim. That means for any employee who chooses not to arbitrate an individual claim of sexual harassment, unlawful discrimination or related retaliation arising in the future, the company will waive any obligation to do so. 
As we report regularly on our progress and our financial results, you will continue to hear more about our workplace initiatives which we firmly believe will help us remain one of the world's most successful entertainment company. I want to thank our employees for their continued commitment to each other, the company and our player. For those employees past and present who have been brave enough to step forward and share their stories, we continue to be committed to investigating all claims thoroughly and holding people accountable. For those employees who have shared feedback, thought, suggestion, concerns and complaint and there are many of you, we hope you can see from our actions that we are listening. We are evolving our organization through your ideas and active participation in their execution. 
And for those employees who have worked tirelessly to deliver great experiences to our players, your resilience in these challenging times is inspiring. We expect that we'll continue to face challenging and negative media attention regardless of our progress, but we are determined to stay focused on providing great opportunities and the very best work environment for our talented employees to deliver the very best games for our players and to continue to provide superior returns for our shareholders. Thank you for your participation today. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Daniel to share the results of our operations for the last quarter."

Before I discuss our operating results, I want to take this opportunity to thank our incredibly talented teams across the entire company who share the passion to make exciting and groundbreaking experiences for our players all around the",2078,"Thank you, Bobby. Before I discuss our operating results, I want to take this opportunity to thank our incredibly talented teams across the entire company who share the passion to make exciting and groundbreaking experiences for our players all around the world. Activision Blizzard's third quarter results were above our outlook. Our monthly active users and time spent in our content were consistent with the year ago level, even as regions continued to reopen, while net bookings and operating income grew year-over-year. This performance again illustrates the structural expansion in our largest franchises as we execute our strategy of delivering gaming experiences across new platforms with more regular content and leveraging multiple commercialization models including free-to-play. 
Execution against this strategy enables us to grow our community, including in geographies outside of our traditional regions, to deepen engagement and to create more opportunities for player investment. Critical to this is a continued investment in creative talent. We continued to grow our developer head count in the third quarter and have increased our development organization by hundreds of talented professionals year-to-date, including announcing new studios and expansions in multiple new cities globally. This geographic diversification strategy is paying dividends, allowing us to tap into critical talent pools in all corners of the world. 
As we grow our teams with new hires, we are keenly aware of the importance and responsibility we have to ensure a safe working environment for our people. This is our #1 priority. Specifically, in recent months, we have taken actions that resulted in the departure of a number of individuals across the company. Additionally, we have seen increased competition in the market for our talent and higher voluntary turnover that has partly offset our success in hiring. 
As we have worked with new leadership in Blizzard and within the franchises themselves, particularly in certain key creative roles, it's become apparent that some of the Blizzard content plan for next year will benefit from more development time to reach its full potential. While we are still planning to deliver a substantial amount of content from Blizzard next year, we are now planning for a later launch for Overwatch 2 and Diablo IV than originally envisaged. 
These are 2 of the most eagerly anticipated titles in the industry, and our teams have made great strides towards completion in recent quarters. But we believe giving the teams some extra time to complete production and continue growing their creative resources to support the titles after launch will ensure that these releases delight and engage their communities for many years into the future. These decisions will push out the financial uplift that we had expected to see next year. But we are confident that this is the right course of action for our people, our players and the long-term success of our franchises. 
Now I will cover our third quarter franchise and operational highlights across our business units. Starting with Activision, where, on average, 119 million people engage in our content monthly in the third quarter. Call of Duty continues to sustain reach, engagement and player investment well above levels seen prior to our introduction of free-to-play experiences across console, PC and mobile. 
Monthly active users in the franchise were consistent year-over-year on console, PC and grew our mobile. Console and PC engagement trends were consistent with typical trends as we moved away from the premium launch even as regions continue to reopen through the quarter. Console and PC MAUs and time spent exhibited very similar retention from Q2 to Q3 as our experiences in prior years. In-game player investment on console and PC remained well above pre-Warzone levels at approximately 3x the level of Q3 2019. And strong conversion from free-to-play drove premium sales higher than in any third quarter prior the launch of Warzone. 
And our teams are all set to launch the next phase of exciting new Call of Duty content for players worldwide. This Friday sees the release of Call of Duty: Vanguard. And on December 2, we will roll out Call of Duty: Warzone Pacific, the biggest update to the Warzone experience since launch. As we've demonstrated with Modern Warfare and Black Ops: Cold War, the release of Vanguard is just the first step in delivering the community an incredible amount of ongoing content, live engagement and much more. 
Across campaign, zombies, multiplayer and War Zone, there's no bigger experience or better value over the duration of the game's life cycle across our premium and free-to-play business. And then we expect Warzone Pacific and its new Caldera map to take the free-to-play experience to another level. The premium and free-to-play experiences are more integrated than ever before sharing the same engine, weapon integration and content integration as well as Call of Duty standards of cross-play, cross-progression and more. Both titles are set to benefit from RICOCHET, a new anti-cheat technology aimed at addressing one of the key improvements requested by the community. We are confident that our players are in store for an incredible set of experiences this holiday season and beyond. 
On mobile, Call of Duty net bookings grew over 40% year-over-year in the third quarter driven by double-digit growth in the West and a continued contribution from the game in China. The team continues to refine the player experience, building on learnings from the title's first 2 years to optimize content, events and features for our communities around the world. And at the same time, we continue to ramp our teams working on new mobile title within the Call of Duty universe. In addition to hiring a substantial number of developers over the last quarter, we are pleased to announce last week the acquisition of Digital Legends, a Barcelona-based mobile game developer that will further bolster the world-class team we are assembling. 
Turning to Blizzard. Monthly active users were 26 million in the third quarter. For Diablo, our plan to deliver an era of unprecedented levels of content for the franchise has experienced a strong start with the September release of Diablo II: Resurrected, the return of one of the most acclaimed titles in PC gaming history. First week of sales of the title were the highest recorded for a remaster from our company, and we have seen strong ongoing demand, particularly in Korea, where the game is proving one of the most popular titles in Internet game rooms. 
With such strong engagement, the team is now working hard to ensure that players have the smoothest possible experience as they explore the world of Sanctuary. This is just the first step in Blizzard's plans for the franchise. On mobile, Diablo Immortal is in public testing and remains on track for release in the first half of next year. And with Diablo IV set to be the foundation for great experiences for PC and console fans over many years, we believe the pieces are in place to expand and serve the Diablo community better than ever before. 
Turning to Overwatch, where millions of people continue to engage in both the game and esport. September saw the grand finals of the Overwatch League become the most watched in the league's history. Starting in the spring, the next season of Overwatch League will run on an early build of Overwatch 2's new 5v5 competitive multiplayer mode, giving the community a fantastic view into the development team's strong work on the next iteration in the franchise. And the team plans to follow this with new content and initiatives to engage existing, returning and new Overwatch players next year. 
Within the Warcraft franchise, World of Warcraft reach and engagement continues to benefit from the combination of the Modern game and Classic under a single subscription. The 2 games offer players more ways to engage and create more opportunities for our teams to deliver compelling experiences to fans of the franchise. With deep engagement across both Classic and Modern, WoW's overall subscriber base is stronger than we typically see at this point after a Modern expansion launch. And for 2021, World of Warcraft is on track to deliver its strongest engagement and net bookings outside of a Modern expansion year in a decade. 
Our WoW team has been rolling out numerous quality of life improvement across the Modern and Classic games franchise in response to player feedback. And today, the Modern game released its latest content update with Classic soon to launch fresh servers, with greater challenges to engage the passionate community. 
Hearthstone net bookings were stable year-over-year in the third quarter. And in October, the team launched Mercenaries, an innovative role-playing mode that gives the Hearthstone community an entirely new way to play the game. Initial results for Mercenaries have been very encouraging, and we believe Hearthstone is positioned for a return to year-over-year growth in net bookings in the fourth quarter. 
Across the Warcraft franchise, our teams are working on a substantial pipeline of content planned for next year, including new experiences in Classic and Modern WoW, more innovations in Hearthstone and getting all new mobile Warcraft content into players hands for the first time. Blizzard cannot wait to share more details on their plans.
The King business continues to deliver fantastic results with very strong year-over-year trends for both in-app purchases and advertising. MAUs were 245 million in the third quarter. King's deep capabilities in live operations are driving engagement for both existing and new players. Hours played across the King portfolio grew year-over-year in the third quarter, with players responding positively to a more frequent cadence of compelling in-game content and events for key titles. The team's prior actions to grow payer conversion alongside ongoing strong execution in user acquisition saw payer numbers growing by double-digit percentage versus the year ago quarter. 
These initiatives drove over 20% year-over-year growth in in-game net bookings for Candy Crush with Candy once again the top grossing game franchise in the U.S. app stores. Additionally, at the end of the third quarter, King launched the All Stars U.S. tournament, a competitive event that saw Candy Crush Saga players battle to be crowned the ultimate Candy Crush All Star. The event has driven meaningful increases in installs, game rounds played and in-app purchases in recent weeks, highlighting competitive gameplay as another opportunity for franchise growth and our investment in the Candy Crush brand.
In addition to this innovation and success at Candy, for several quarters now, King has been accelerating and refining content delivery in Farm Heroes, its second largest franchise. This work continued to bear fruit in Q3 and year-to-date in-game net bookings have grown around 20% year-over-year. And finally, King's advertising business again grew robustly, with quarterly revenue growing sequentially and year-over-year to a new high. Both volume and pricing grew strongly year-over-year, benefiting from the team's growing relationships with demand partners and the ongoing ramp of new categories of advertisers. 
In summary, Q3 saw solid year-over-year growth in the business, and we see substantial growth ahead for our portfolio of internally owned IP. While we have seen some slippage in the release schedule for specific titles at Blizzard, we could not be more excited about our plans to unlock the full potential of our largest franchises and to drive meaningful expansion in our reach, engagement and operating performance. This is only possible because of our teams. 
I want to share an announcement about the leadership of one of those team. Jen Oneal, who has been co-lead of Blizzard, has been a passionate advocate for bringing positive changes to the video gaming industry and has been doing so as Board member of Women in Gaming International (sic) [ Women in Games International ], or WIGI, a nonprofit organization that cultivate and advances equality and diversity in the global games industry. Jen has decided to leave the company at the end of the year, and we have agreed to support Jen in her involvement with WIGI by making a donation to WIGI in honor of Jen. In her remaining months with the company, given her commitment to this work, Jen will build the foundation of programs funded by the grant. As such, Mike Ybarra will take on Jen's leadership responsibility. It is great to see how employees at our company are committed to bring about the positive changes in our industry and beyond, and our leadership team stands behind these effort. 
Now I will hand over to Armin, who will provide more color on our financial result and outlook, Armin?"
4222231,1683581348,2467459,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Daniel. First, I'd like to reiterate that ensuring a workplace that provides opportunity for all in the most welcoming and inclusive way is our top priority.

First, I'd like to reiterate that ensuring a workplace that provides opportunity for all in the most welcoming and inclusive way is our top priority. Today, I'll review our third quarter results as well as outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2021. Our third quarter results were ahead of our prior outlook, with year-over-year growth in net bookings, revenue, operating income and EPS against difficult year ago comparables. 
Importantly, each of these metrics has also grown year-over-year on a year-to-date basis. So even as regions continues to reopen, our business is operating at significantly greater scale than that seen prior to our successful growth initiatives across our largest franchises. Let me start with our consolidated financial results. Unless otherwise indicated, I'll be referencing non-GAAP figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation. 
Now for the quarter, we generated quarter 3 GAAP revenues of $2.07 billion, $100 million above our August outlook. This includes net recognition of deferrals of $190 million. Net bookings of $1.88 billion, that’s $30 million above our August outlook. And we generated quarter 3 GAAP EPS of $0.82 and quarter 3 non-GAAP EPS of $0.89 which was $0.14 above our guidance. These figures include the net recognition of deferrals of $0.17. Quarter 3 EPS included $0.03 [ churn ] from an unrealized loss on investment as well as a benefit from a lower-than-anticipated tax rate in the quarter. 
Now turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Quarter 3 operating cash flow was $521 million, more than double the year ago level, driven by lower cash taxes and favorable working capital movements. Our cash and investments at the end of September were approximately $10 billion, and we ended the quarter with a net cash position of approximately $6.4 billion. Growing shareholder value through capital allocation is a key focus for us. And over the long term, investors should expect a balanced approach across investing in creative talent in our own business, strategic M&A and returning cash to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. 
Now let me turn to our segment results. Activision revenue was $641 million. Segment revenue was lower year-over-year as expected in our outlook. This was due to the launch of Tony Hawk's in the year ago quarter and declines in Call of Duty upfront and in-game net bookings against a quarter that benefited from shelter-at-home mandates and the early ramp of Warzone. Year-to-date, net bookings for the Activision segment and the Call of Duty franchise were higher year-over-year with the franchise now consistently operating at greater scale than before our free-to-play and mobile initiatives. Activision's third quarter operating income was $244 million and operating margin was 38%. 
Blizzard revenue of $493 million grew 20% year-over-year driven by the successful launch of Diablo II: Resurrected. Year-to-date, net bookings for Blizzard and for World of Warcraft, its largest franchise, were higher year-over-year. Blizzard's third quarter operating income was $188 million with an operating margin of 38%. 
King delivered another record quarter. Revenue grew 22% year-over-year to $652 million. That's a new high. Third quarter in-game net bookings grew in the mid-teens year-over-year while advertising grew approximately 60%. King's third quarter operating income was a record $303 million with an operating margin of 46%. The team's strong execution across live operations, marketing and advertising drove records for both revenue and operating income for the third quarter and year-to-date. King's ability to delight and engage players with robust live operation provides a lot of learning that we’re trying to apply to both Activision and Blizzard and not just in mobile. 
Looking across our segments, in-game net bookings were $1.2 billion, roughly flat year-over-year and approximately $500 million higher than the level of quarter 3 of 2019. And during the third quarter, mobile net bookings grew over 20% year-over-year driven by the strength of both Activision and King. Consumer spending and advertising within our mobile content was almost $1 billion in the quarter. And we see substantial room for further growth as we take each of our key franchises to the largest and fastest-growing platform, leveraging our creative and live operation capabilities of Activision, Blizzard and King. 
Now let me turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year. With regard to our slate, in addition to ongoing live op and in-game content across the portfolio, the fourth quarter will see Activision release Call of Duty: Vanguard this Friday, November 5, followed by the biggest Warzone update yet, Warzone Pacific, on December 2. Blizzard launched a new Mercenaries mode in Hearthstone in mid-October and will release the next Hearthstone expansion later this quarter. And King continues to support Candy Crush and other games across its portfolio with numerous seasonal events and new features. 
Our team has done a phenomenal job building this content, even if many of them continue to work from home, and we can't wait for our players to get their hands on this experience. With that said, we remain prudent in our revenue assumption for the fourth quarter. And regarding costs, we have decided to further step up investment in mobile marketing given the strong returns we are currently seeing and into compliance and employee relation. We expect the earnings impact of these investments to be offset by lower tax rate, and we continue to expect full year earnings per share to be up strongly year-over-year and comfortably ahead of the outlook provided at the beginning of the year. 
Now let me get into the specifics. For quarter 4, on a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $2.02 billion, including net deferrals of $763 million. We expect net bookings of $2.78 billion. We expect GAAP operating margin of 30%, a tax rate of 26%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 785 million and EPS of $0.54. For quarter 4 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect a tax rate of 25% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.62, including net deferrals of $0.67. This means that on a GAAP basis for 2021, we now expect revenues of $8.66 billion, including the net recognition of deferrals of $10 million. We now expect net bookings of $8.65 billion. We expect GAAP operating margin of 37%, a GAAP tax rate of 18%; GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 784 million and GAAP EPS of $3.27. For 2021, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect a tax rate of 17% and non-GAAP EPS of $3.70 including net deferrals of $0.06. 
With respect to risk, as you've heard, we're taking action to address stakeholder concern and the adverse consequences to our business from workplace issues. If we experience further adverse publicity regarding our company and executive, increased competition for talent, higher voluntary turnover, significantly reduced productivity or other negative consequences relating to these issues, our business likely would be adversely impacted. We're, therefore, carefully monitoring all aspects of our business by any such impacts, and we're taking action to help address them. 
Now I'd also like to provide some update on how we are planning for next year specifically. As a starting point, our business continues to operate at much greater scale, and we have clear line of sight to expanding the reach, engagement and financial performance of our business further in the coming years as we apply the framework that has worked so well for Call of Duty, Candy Crush to other franchises in our portfolio. 
At the same time, as Daniel described, we've taken the decision to give the Overwatch and Diablo team the extra time they need to deliver the experiences that their communities deserve and to set the franchises up for maximum success over a multiyear period. We are, therefore, currently not planning for material contribution from Overwatch 2 and Diablo IV in 2022. While this development will push out the financial uplift that we have expected to see next year, we firmly believe that this is the right course of action for our people, for the long-term success of these franchises and for our shareholders. We still have a lot of content in the pipeline for next year for our largest franchises that we can't wait to unveil and we'll provide more color on that when we provide our full year outlook in early February. 
In conclusion, we see substantial opportunity for shareholder value creation ahead to unlocking the full potential of our portfolio. This will only be possible because of our people, and we'll remain focused on ensuring a safe working environment that is essential to enable creativity and professional growth for all employees.

I feel very good about the progress actually. Right now, workplace leadership is my focus. Our opportunities for growth, as we've talked about, have never been better, but we won't be able to realize all that growth potential without talent. And to retain and attract the talent we need, we obviously have to be recognized as the very best place to work. This means we have to be the most welcoming inclusive environment and we've got to have the best industry-leading programs for growth and development. We've got to have the best recruiting capabilities for the diverse talent we need to create the very best games, and we have to have competitive compensation that is aligned with performance. 
If you think about it, over the last 30 years, we've shown that we can consistently create the very best games, and that has always translated into long-term shareholder returns that are far greater than the S&P 500 and compared to most companies. And we believe that superior shareholder returns will continue to be delivered through our franchise strategies, the operational excellence that we're recognized for. And we also recognize that to achieve the same level of shareholder returns we have historically and to ensure continued excellence in execution, we believe we and all great companies need to deliver workplace excellence. 
This means some of the things that we've discussed over the last few weeks about harassment and discrimination-free work environments, recruiting excellence to ensure we have diverse skills, abilities and talents and a culture that celebrates and rewards commitment to these principles. I couldn't be more passionate and committed to being the most performance-focused, welcoming and inclusive company in entertainment. What you heard me discuss earlier is just the beginning of the actions that we intend to take to achieve that objective. And of course, we need accountability. So we'll continue to provide regular progress in updates both quarterly to our shareholders as well as annually in our ESG reports, and we'll be monitoring the progress of our business units, our franchise teams and our functional leaders with respect to workplace initiatives, and that status will also be reported to our employees quarterly. 
Right now and going forward, communicating with our employees and getting feedback has been a crucial part of the process. We'll obviously continue to keep our investors informed, but the work that we've done with our employees has resulted in very constructive new initiatives, more that we'll continue to announce over the next few months. But the long answer to your question is I feel good about the progress that we're making. But thanks for the question."

I'd like to first recognize Jen Oneal, who has been an incredible partner here at Blizzard. Though we will all miss her greatly, we wish her all the best as we work with her on a plan to make an industry-wide impact through the WIGI grant. I personally want to thank her for her leadership. 
Since becoming the co-leader of Blizzard 3 months ago and meeting with teams around the company, I have been impressed by their passion for what they are creating and their drive to build a more inclusive culture. Looking at our upcoming releases across all of our teams here at Blizzard, we have a deep bench of veteran development talent, and we have new leadership on both Overwatch 2 and Diablo IV. Both are seasoned Blizzard developers with over 30 years’ experience at the company between them. The teams have made great progress and passed important milestones recently, and we expect these to be fantastic releases. But there's obviously been a change in leadership. 
We looked at what was left in the final phases of production with fresh eyes, and we saw that allowing the teams more time would enable both great experiences at launch and also help ensure that everything will be in place to engage the communities for many years to come. This extra time will also help us continue significantly increasing the size of our development teams ahead of the launch, again to ensure we are following up the releases with substantial content to continue delighting the community. We're not sharing release dates at this time, but I have absolute confidence in these new leaders and their teams to deliver. They care deeply about creating high-quality products and allowing everyone on their teams to bring their best selves to their projects. Thanks for the question."

As you can see from the Q3 results, had a terrific quarter and Candy achieved its highest in-app revenue quarter since the acquisition. So let me focus in on that in-app performance specifically. There are a number of initiatives that are really been contributing to the success over the recent quarters and will carry us into the future. We've increased the optimizations that we put in the game. So we think about this as a player journey and we've continued to improve that player journey with strong live op execution. This benefits across cohorts of players. So we've delivered compelling content and events more frequently across all of our key titles. 
So to give you an example, in Candy, we've increased that engagement by further developing the content slate into monthly seasonal events that really draw in new and existing players and provides fun experience across the board. With this quarter, we've complemented that with the launch of the Candy All Stars (sic) [ Candy Crush All Stars ] competition in the U.S. and we've seen some very strong initial results across reach, engagement and player investment. 
We feel -- we also found a successful formula over the past 12 months to invest and grow live ops, and we're now applying that with great results, not just in Candy, but across other games too. So our second biggest franchise, for example, Farm Heroes, over the past few quarters, we've been delivering this content cadence and great events and the farm season pass. And we've seen the results from that as well. Our in-app growth in Farm Heroes has been up 20% year-to-date as a result. 
With that, we've continued to reinvest into the network and in our brands as well. So we've seen that our payer numbers have grown double-digit percentage year-on-year versus the year ago quarter. And this is, again, down to the strong execution that we have in our teams around user acquisition. And when you combine with the features and events that are happening in the game, really an amplification of all these great trends that we are seeing. So that's also allowed us to maximize our success in more marketing investments and continuing to broaden our player base. So overall, I feel like we've demonstrated that ability to grow both revenue and operating income at the same time. We feel there's still quite a bit of runway ahead of us."

And just from an Activision, Blizzard, King perspective, just there are a lot of learnings that we really want to apply across both Activision and Blizzard and it's not just in mobile from the King team's operations. For instance, King's live operation capabilities, their deeply analytical approach to creating amazing experiences that truly engage the players and the disciplined data-driven approach to marketing is just very applicable across the rest of the business. 
So we're already making sure that these performance marketing learnings are being applied to our work on Call of Duty Mobile and to Diablo Immortal and other mobile initiatives that will be coming in the not-too-distant future across the company. So similar to how we are looking to apply the Call of Duty framework to our other franchises, it's another example of how Activision Blizzard is really leveraging the best of each of our businesses to truly maximize the potential of our portfolio.

So to start, we're obviously excited about both the launch of Vanguard this week and also Warzone's new Pacific map called Caldera, which is releasing early in December. The new map represents really the first built from the ground up new experience for Warzone since the launch of Warzone basically in March of 2020. So we think the community is going to be really excited to get in and play that and experience the entire Vanguard universe. 
Coming with that, of course, there are a lot of things, some of which were mentioned. I'll just briefly cover them. One of which was Warzone shares the same tech as Vanguard. And so what does that mean? This is the same tech that debuted with Modern Warfare. And so from a player perspective, you can get a lot more seamless weapon and play balance experience across both experiences. And what's become a staple for us now is really a game that's fully optimized for cross-play, cross-progression and cross-gen support. We've seen that the last couple of years, and that carries forward. I think importantly, for our community, we're also going to be launching RICOCHET, it's our new anti-cheat system, across Vanguard and Warzone so that our players have the best possible experience as we move forward here in the future. 
Now specifically, as to the integration, we're going to continue to have the shared progression across Vanguard and Warzone just like we had against Modern Warfare and Black Ops Cold War previously. So all the great weapons, operators, unlocks and everything that you get on the Vanguard premium experience will also be usable in Warzone. So how the 2 work together is absolutely intact and better than ever. Battle Pass and Stormfront and storm content, of course, will also go back and forth for players to use and have fun with. 
Now there is a new component for us here. And the new Warzone experience is going to offer some new dedicated playlists that are very specific to the Vanguard theme that we think is going to be really fun for the community. And of course, to honor the players' investment, we'll also have unique playlists that are more of a combined arms Battle Royale experience [ we achieve slowdowns ] across Modern Warfare, Black Ops or Vanguard. So I think that will be really fun for the community to choose how they want to experience the new map and the new content. 
And also, I think what's become a staple for us as we move forward, our players can expect a ton of free post-launch content and updates from Vanguard and from Warzone to keep them having fun for the long haul. So both games are really just going to get bigger and better as they evolve over time for the community. 
Now going back to your question on the impact of Black Ops last December, so we certainly saw an uptick last December. I believe we talked about that in the previous earnings call. And similarly, we expect another uptick this fourth quarter for our premium sales as we go through that cycle, launch the new map and see how the community engages more broadly, both within Warzone and within our premium experience. Thank you, Alexia, for the questions."

As you heard Daniel mention, first week sales were the highest recorded for a remaster from Activision Blizzard as a whole. This, alongside the continued engagement with Diablo III, really is confirmation that our plan for the Diablo franchise as a whole is the right one. There's a huge appetite from our player community for more content from this dark gothic universe, and it's our job to exceed player expectations. 
Diablo II: Resurrected is an early step towards meeting this demand. We have ignited nostalgia in players who experienced the original way back in 2000 as well as brought all new players into the fold. Diablo Immortal being in its next stage of testing is incredibly exciting, and we'll give players another window into the world of Sanctuary. They'll be able to take part in an all-new narrative in a persistent free-to-play social experience, all from their mobile devices. Immortal provides an even easier entry point for players into a game broader in scope and scale than Diablo III. 
Then Diablo IV, which will be the darkest expression of the universe yet is an immersive world, players can dive into together on PC and console. This is one of the most highly anticipated games in the industry, and we are confident that we are building something incredible. These experiences combined create an ecosystem where our players of all types can feel at home, and it doesn't stop there. Diablo will always be living and breathing with broad content updates over time to continue to delight our players. Seeing the first step of this plan executed with the release of Diablo II: Resurrected off to such a strong start is invigorating to the teams across Blizzard and we can't wait to get more into the hands of our players.

So on the user acquisition side, we have a very large and sophisticated user acquisition team, and they've been really hands-on and granular when they run our campaigns. 
And so when we see changes and dynamism in the industry because of IDFA, this created market opportunities that we've been able to capitalize on. And the tailwinds that we are seeing in our payer conversion and spending gives us a lot of flexibility to invest in these ROI positive opportunities. So much of our UA is aimed at win back.

Looking ahead, we see significant opportunities across gameplay expansion, platform expansion and geographic expansion to take this ecosystem to an entirely new level for our players around the world. I'd say put another way, we feel there's more opportunity in front of the franchise than at any point in our history. And that's a pretty incredible thing to be able to say given the success that we've seen to date. 
Of course, the next phase begins in the coming days and weeks with Vanguard and the new map, Caldera in Warzone, but really, there's so much more as we look ahead in the future, both near and long term. Driving this ambition for us, of course, is our talented development teams and the resources we have there, which we're committed to greatly expanding both at our existing studios but also geographically to find new talent around the globe. So we're expanding in locations like Austin, Guildford, Krakow, Melbourne, Mexico City and Toronto to augment our teams.

You’ve heard today, we continue to have a very, very strong pipeline. So investing in our business and in our development teams remains our key priority. 
And as Daniel mentioned, we'll continue to look to accelerate organic hiring in this area with acqui-hiring. This was announced with Digital Legends purchase last week, but these type of transactions are typically smaller in nature. Now with regards to larger M&A, we're always on the lookout for large established franchises that have potential for global scale and strong management teams with a track record of profitability and, of course, an attractive valuation that hits our return threshold. 
Now as you know, we have been very disciplined and patient in this area. But the longer-term opportunity for M&A means that we place significant option value on having a strong and flexible balance sheet. Now at the same time, with respect to buybacks, to come to the core of your question, we do have a $4 billion authorization. And while you haven't seen us do anything in a long time here, we do evaluate our position with respect to buyback frequently. 
Now obviously, the increase in cash generation from the company gives us more and more flexibility over time. But just bear in mind, though, that we don't announce when we're buying back stock ahead of time and that sometimes there may be restrictions in our ability to comment on the buyback. So in summary, expect us to be -- continue to be balanced and disciplined in how we allocate capital, always with a view to the long-term shareholder value creation. Thank you for your question."

This is obviously something extraordinarily important, and we're putting a tremendous amount of effort into. And we've made some very substantial progress in this area particularly over the last year. Retaining and attracting our top talent, as Bobby has mentioned, is critical to us being able to meet the needs of our players, of our communities and of our growing our business. 
And this is -- there's really nothing more important to the company than our talent. And it really starts with making sure that our existing teams have the best possible working environment. It's an imperative. And it's also setting -- a setting that fosters creative excellence, and importantly, fantastic career opportunities where people are willing to invest their time and their careers at our company. You've heard from us today some of the measures that we're taking to ensure that, and we will continue to make significant progress. 
And when it comes to hiring, we're really fortunate that many individuals want to work on our franchises for which they have just tremendous affinity. They've played it for a very long time, oftentimes since they were little. And we can offer that with some of the biggest franchises in the world. We also have the financial scale that enables us to compete for that talent. But I know that's not enough. And especially with many people's attitudes to where and how they want to work changing during the pandemic, we have to keep that in mind. And we're giving our teams the flexibility that they need. 
And we have also been investing in studios, as Rob mentioned, in many locations that are new for us, including Krakow, Melbourne, Toronto and Mexico City, where I'm from. We've had a lot of success in hiring in recent months in those franchises that were earliest in embracing this geographic expansion and flexibility, particularly for Call of Duty and for Candy Crush, and we've already started to pursue that same approach for Blizzard and Blizzard's franchises. And Mike, he is completely on board with this as we continue to invest and grow our teams in multiple locations. So thank you for the question."
