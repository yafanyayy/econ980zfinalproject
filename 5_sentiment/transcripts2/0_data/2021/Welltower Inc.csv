First and foremost, I hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy during these extraordinary times. In the spirit of this year-end call, I would like to review year 2020, the most challenging in our history and discuss different paths of growth, long-term value creation for our continuing shareholders on per share basis. 
We came into 2020 prepared for perhaps a plain vanilla business cycle downturn. We pushed out our maturities in Q4 of 2019, sold a lot of short duration assets, bought a lot of longer duration assets and continue to upgrade our portfolio, operators, management contract and talent. We are hopeful that with the continued decline in seniors housing deliveries and start, on one hand, and the aging of the population finally picking up, on the other hand, that 2020 would serve an inflection point in the -- for the fundamentals after decades of weak demographics, resulting from the aiding of the [indiscernible] generation. Then the once-a-century pandemic happened, that would turn out to be particularly devastating for our business. The back half of first quarter, second and third quarter were all about long-term value preservation. We enhanced our liquidity profile dramatically by selling assets in record time at or near pre-COVID pricing, more importantly, avoided mistakes or raising long-term dilutive capital, a consistent theme for managing the company for continuing shareholder on a per share basis. 
We started during the dark days of March and April by selling $1 billion of assets at a great price in record 43 days, from signing a confidentiality agreement to receiving cash. We continued this journey during Q2 and Q3, and eventually executed on $3.7 billion of disposition at extraordinary prices to build an unprecedented war chest. Two things particularly surprised me during this time. The resilience of our team during our -- including our extended team of operating partners and the liquidity of our assets. Not that we didn't have doubts or failures, but we continue to move forward in spite of them with a steady hand on the will and an unwavering belief that will get to the other side. 
Our teams, stoic resilient, reminded me every day of Winston Churchill's famous quote that, ""Success is not final. Failure is not final. It is the courage to continue that counts."" In those moments of reckoning, I realized how privileged I was to be part of this team that didn't miss a beat and blazed new trails. 
For a year, I have heard that healthcare-oriented real estate deserves a discount to the -- too, say, shiny tower in middle of a large gateway city due to the lack of liquidity and smaller ticket size, especially during down cycles. I hope that during the worst down cycle of our asset class, this debate has been finally settled as demonstrated by our execution and that of our colleagues that helped. In the fall, we pivoted again from defense to offense as we started underwriting and shaking hands on new acquisition. It is important for you to understand that we don't shake hands and find excuses to walk or chip away, which if we shake hands, we close. Our handshake in this business is worth called, and we only enhanced our long-term reputation during this pandemic. 
During last quarter's call, I discussed $1 billion of deep value opportunity. I'm delighted to report that we have closed roughly $700 million of acquisitions since the start of fourth quarter at a significant discount to replacement cost. Our acquisition pipeline has grown meaningfully. And as I sit here today, I'm optimistic this year is shaping up to be a year of net acquisition, perhaps significantly so. At the time -- at the same time, I will remind you that we're not driven and incentivized by volume up acquisition, but the value of it. Asset price is the ultimate determinant of how we'll behave. 
In this moment of confusion and ambiguity, I indulge you to focus on 4 distinct pillars of long-term value creation for Welltower. One, operating fundamentals. Tim will get into the details of what happened last quarter and what might happen next quarter. While operating fundamentals is awful right now, with little near term visibility, we are optimistic about the vaccine rollout as 90% of our assisted living and memory care facilities have conducted their first vaccination clinic with virtually all residents taking a shot. While I would not expect this to be a source of value creation in the very near term, I'm hopeful about the second half of the year. 
Normalization of operating performance remains the largest source of value creation for our shareholders. It is too early to comment on exact timing of the trough and the shape of the recovery, but we'll keep you posted frequently intra-quarter so that you can see what we see. Our focus remains on upholding the reputation of our communities and maintaining the safety of our operator staff and residents. We spared no expenses and have already spent in excess of $80 million on COVID-related expenses to date, doing everything we can within our control to support their well-being. Due to the great reputation of our operators and the extraordinary value they provide, rates are holding out. In 2020, REVPOR was up 2% in AL memory care, 1% in independent living and 4.4% in our seniors apartment business. This growth occurred despite the headwind resulting from lower community fees, driven by a decline in moving activity. 
Number two, operator platform enhancement, management contracts, leadership and system enhancements and building local scale are some of the examples of this. Let me highlight 2 specifics here. A, Sunrise. We're delighted by the appointment of Jack Callison as the CEO of Sunrise Living, our largest operating partner. Jack will bring much needed attention to operating excellence with an operations first culture. We are also negotiating a new management contract that will align the interest of Sunrise and Welltower as the owner of the assets. We're diligently working with the management of Revera, Sunrise's majority owner, to enhance Sunrise's position so that it can emerge from this pandemic as the leading operator poised for excellence and growth. B, building local scale. If I can put [indiscernible], the advantage of local scale are of ungodly important to this business. We have and will continue to scale our most important strategic partner as we expand our senior housing footprint. 
To name a few in alphabetical order, Balfour, Brandywine, Clover, Cogir, Frontier, [indiscernible], Oakmont, StoryPoint are just some of the examples of the partners we have grown significantly during this pandemic. What is common amongst them? They're excellent operators in their markets. They have great leadership. They're disciplined yet courageous. And they have an aligned relationship with Welltower. We rise and fall together. This list is expanding with a significant opportunity set that I mentioned a few moments ago. 
Number three, capital deployment opportunity. I have already commented on the acquisition opportunity on the deep value side. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I would remind you that we're an IRR buyer with an incredible focus on basis, operators and structure. Our opportunity set is rising rapidly, and I hope to provide you with more specific color in next 60 to 90 days. This comment is obviously focused on the current opportunities. Let me provide you some color on a related topic, but on future opportunities. 
We, at Welltower, have never been in a more advantageous position as a partner of choice. For years, we have focused on growth strategy driven by our relationship-based and a land win-focused structure and data analytics platform rather than prioritize on cost and access to capital advantage. After all, not all capital is equal. We never imagine that we've encountered today's extreme stress. But as you can see, we stood by our operators during this difficult time, not only to preserve their businesses, but also to grow it significantly. Talk is cheap, but action is not. For this reason, we are inundated with requests as a partner of choice from all asset classes we play in. As much as they like to call, we have been on-road throughout this pandemic meeting with prospective partners. This is bearing meaningful fruit. We have executed more partnership and pipeline deals in last 9 months than over 5 preceding years combined. We expect to deploy $10-plus billion of capital in these opportunities in the next few years. In other words, we are not only executing on deep value early cycle opportunities, but also laying a strong foundation of growth to the entire cycle when inevitably the significant price discrepancies of today will be gone. 
To give you an example, we recently reupped our master development agreement for 5 years with [indiscernible], our largest MOB tenant. We're looking to start approximately 600,000 square feet of 100% pre-lease development in 2021 and 2022. 
Number four, talent opportunity. I touched on this last call, but let me elaborate for those of you who are focused on long term. We're seeing an incredible interest in our platform from seasoned professionals to early carrier applicants. We have taken advantage of recent disruption and brought in 41 new professionals in 2020. We expect at least as many, if not more, to join our team in 2021. In addition to new talent, our existing talent pool is taking on more responsibilities and reaching new heights. As a result, we had 50 new promotions at Welltower. Through this, some -- though this puts early pressure on G&A, which is partially offset by lower executive comp, we think this is -- this incredible talent pool is the equivalent of a coiled spring, which will manifest itself in a meaningful growth for the firm. 
Speaking of talent pool, how is the mood inside today inside Welltower? What I described to you as the stoic resilience last year has transformed into an environment of optimism and unbridled passion this year. I want to make it abundantly clear, we have no crystal ball about the near-term operating fundamentals. But we are doing meaningful work that matters. We have meaningful relationship, and we're seeing a new level of positive energy of people who want to be part of this team internally and externally to create meaningful value and make a disproportionate impact. 
With that, I'll pass it over to -- the microphone to Tim. Tim?"
277914,701993370,2202405,"Welltower Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2021",2021-02-10,"Earnings Calls","Welltower Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Shankh. My comments today will focus on our fourth quarter 2020 results. The performance of all of our investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity and finally, a balance sheet and liquidity update and our first quarter outlook. T",2495,"Thank you, Shankh. My comments today will focus on our fourth quarter 2020 results. The performance of all of our investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity and finally, a balance sheet and liquidity update and our first quarter outlook. 
The fourth quarter was a tough end to a very challenging year. And the ongoing impact of coronavirus accelerated meaningfully in the back half of the fourth quarter and into the beginning of 2021. The visibility for large parts of our business beyond the next 90 days remain very limited and very dependent on buyers-related variables, such as unpredictable group path of growth, the rollout and efficacy of the vaccine, the continuation of population lockdown mandates. As a result of this uncertainty, we decided to provide a first quarter outlook this morning in place of the full year outlook we would normally provide in our fourth quarter call. 
As we have done over the last year, we will continue to disclose and update information on a frequent basis, with the intention of providing a more complete outlook as soon as the variance, the virus-related variables moderate to a level that allows for reliable forecasting. 
Now turning to the quarter. Welltower reported net income attributable to common shareholders of $0.39 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $0.84 per diluted share. Normalized FFO was sequentially flat in the third quarter and the decline in seniors housing operating earnings and dilution from dispositions to close over the last 2 quarters was offset by recognition of HHS funds, lower G&A, lower interest expense and initial returns on reinvested capital. 
Now turning to our individual portfolio components. First, with our triple-net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats are reported a quarter in arrears. So these statistics reflect a trailing 12-month ending 9/30/2020, and therefore, only reflects the partial impact from COVID-19. Importantly, our collection rate remained high in the fourth quarter, having collected 97% of triple-net contractual rent due in the period. 
Starting with our senior housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI declined 2.7% year-over-year, as leases that were removed to cash recognition in prior quarters continue to comp against prior full year contractual rent received. Occupancy was down 260 basis points sequentially, consistent with the average occupancy drop from 2Q to 3Q in our RIDEA portfolio, and EBITDAR coverage decreased 0.01x on a sequential basis in this portfolio from 1.01x. 
During the quarter, we transitioned a U.K. development portfolio from triple-net RIDEA, transitioned 14 former triple-net capital senior assets to new operators and RIDEA structures and disposed of one asset, which is the net impact of increasing coverage by 0.03x. Consistent with my comments in the past, our senior housing triple-net lease operators experienced similar headwinds and our RIDEA operators over the past 9 months, and we expect reported lease coverage stats to continue to reflect these challenges as more of the pandemic period is reflected in EBITDAR going forward. That being said, the resilience of this portfolio is reflected by the continued high cash collection rate is encouraging. 
As I described last quarter, we entered into an agreement with Capital Senior beginning of 2020, which allowed for an early termination of CSU leases on 24 Welltower-owned assets, exchange for full rent being paid in 2020 in cooperation with transitioning the operations of these assets. We transitioned 14 properties operated by CSU to new operators in the fourth quarter, in addition to 5 that were transitioned during the third quarter. We anticipate the remaining assets to be transitioned to new operators in the first half of 2021. As a result of the continued COVID backdrop, the initial expected dilution from these conversion is expected to be approximately $0.04 per share in 2021. Additionally, the conversion of a development portfolio in the U.K. from triple-net to RIDEA is also expected to be negatively impact normalized FFO by $0.04 per share in 2021. 
The combination of these 2 transitions is expected to result in the sequential roll down of a little over $0.02 per share of normalized FFO from Q4 to Q1. 
Next, our long-term post-acute portfolio generated 2% year-over-year same-store growth. However, EBITDAR coverage declined by 0.012x sequentially to 1.0x, which was almost entirely due to deterioration in our largest long-term post-acute tenant, Genesis Healthcare. As we noted last quarter, Genesis Healthcare, which makes up approximately half of our long-term post-acute exposure, raised concerns around its ability to continue as a going concern in second quarter financials filed on August 10. As a result of this concern, Welltower began recording revenue and cash basis in the third quarter. Furthermore, we wrote down our unsecured loan exposure to them by $80 million in the fourth quarter. Similar to our Genesis lease income, we've been recognizing all interest on our unsecured loans on a cash basis. So this impairment does not change income recognition on these loans. Genesis remains current on all financial obligations to Welltower through January. 
And lastly, health systems, which is comprised of our ProMedica senior care joint venture with the ProMedica system. We had same-store NOI growth of positive 2.7% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was 2.27x.
Turning to medical office. Our outpatient medical office portfolio delivered positive 2.1% year-over-year same-store growth, modestly below long-term trends. Growth continues to be negatively impacted by reserves for uncollected rent. The large majority of which is resulting from lease before moratoriums in several California jurisdictions, in which we have a sizable footprint, as I described last quarter. As these moratoriums expire, we expect rent collection to improve from a 98.5% received in the fourth quarter. 
Looking back at 2020, our outpatient medical platform displayed incredible resilience in a truly challenging year, which include periods of time which basic medical appointments and procedures were flat out not permitted. Yet, we still managed to grow same-store NOI an average of positive 1.7%. During the fourth quarter, we continued to observe improvements in several key operating trends as business continue to normalize. Notably a pickup in our leasing pipeline, which would start to reflect in occupancy -- positive occupancy pickup towards the back half of 2021. 
Now turning to our senior housing operating portfolio. Before getting into this quarter's results, I want to point out that we received approximately $9 million from the Department of Health and Human Services CARES Act provider Release fund. And post quarter, we received another $34 million, delivering $8 million and $31 million of [indiscernible] expected proceeds at our share. We are recognizing these funds on a cash basis until they will flow through financials in the quarter in which they are received. We are normalizing these HHS funds out of same-store metrics, however, along with any other government funds received that are not matched to expenses incurred in the period they receive. 
In the fourth quarter, there are approximately $11.8 million of reimbursement normalized out of our same-store senior housing operating results, mainly tied to the HHS program in the U.S. 
Now turning to results in the quarter. Same-store NOI decreased 33.8% as compared to fourth quarter 2019, and decreased 11.3% actually from the third quarter. Starting with revenue. Sequential same-store revenue was down 2.4% in Q4, driven primarily by 160 basis point drop in average occupancy. As a reminder, we started the fourth quarter with relative optimism on the occupancy front, with improving year-over-year move in volumes and relatively low prevalence of COVID within our communities. However, these positive trends rapidly reversed as the exponential rise in global COVID cases in November and December, by the city and statewide lockdowns and missions bands across many of our key MSAs, particularly in the U.K. and California, which together comprised 34% of of our SHO portfolio NOI. The result of this was 180 basis points of occupancy loss from November through year-end. 
As I started -- as I stated on our third quarter call, the path of COVID will dictate our business trends from the fourth quarter, not seasonality and not the seasonal flu, and that has proved quite true over the past 3.5 months. 
Turning to REVPOR in the quarter. Total SHO portfolio REVPOR was down 1.2% year-over-year and flat sequentially. But as I described last quarter, mix shift is distorting the true picture of rent growth metrics. As stand-alone year-over-year REVPOR growth for our active adult, independent living and assisted living segments were positive 3.7%, 0.5% and 1.1%, respectively. The combined total portfolio metric is being impacted by considerable changes in composition of occupied units in the year-over-year portfolio as lower acuity properties, independent living and senior departments have held up considerably better on the occupancy front since the start of COVID. We've had a mathematical impact of having a higher portion of our total portfolio occupied units being lower acuity and therefore, lower rent paying units. The point being, rental rates are proving more resilient across our portfolio than would appear in our aggregate reported statistics. 
And lastly, expenses. Total same-store expenses declined 2.1% year-over-year and increased 50 basis points sequentially. I'll focus on the sequential since the changes are more relevant to trends in the current operating environment. The 50 basis point increase in operating costs was driven mainly by higher sequential COVID costs as a result of the surge in cases in the fourth quarter. The decline in top line, combined with these expense pressures, had a meaningful impact on our operating margins, which declined 220 basis points sequentially to 22.3%. As I noted earlier in the call, we did not include government reimbursement that was not tied to period expenses -- in period expenses in our same-store results. And therefore, COVID expenses negatively impact same-store by $18.9 million in the quarter. 
We will stay consistent with this treatment in Q1. We've -- where we've already received a net $31 million HHS fund. That will likely turn COVID expenses into a net benefit, if included in our same-stores and offset. 
Looking forward to the first quarter, and starting with 2021 year-to-date data we have already reserved, we've experienced 180 basis point decline in occupancy through February 5. Given the still heightened presence of COVID, we expect average occupancy to be down 275 to 375 basis points from fourth quarter to first quarter. Note that we are providing the average occupancy as opposed to spot occupancy as the former better ties to our reported financials. And therefore, 260 basis points of our expected 275 to 375 basis point decline is already baked, given the swift drop for mid-November to date in occupancy. We expect monthly REVPOR to be down 20 basis points sequentially, although it should be noted that actual rent per unit is up 2.1% sequentially. With mix shift, which I mentioned earlier and 2 fewer days in the quarter, skewing reported REVPOR versus actual rent growth. 
Lastly, we expect total expenses to be effectively flat as higher sequential COVID costs are offset by less labor utilization due to lower occupancy levels. 
Turning to capital markets activity. Throughout 2020, we took a series of actions that were difficult result in our ability to retain significant cash flow and ultimately gave us greater control to navigate through the pandemic. It's worth highlighting that despite the stress endured by our business, we've avoided the destabilization of the balance sheet by borrowing to pay the dividend or being forced in raising equity or selling assets at unattractive valuations. Given where we sit today, the $2.1 billion of cash and over $5.1 billion of available liquidity, we are pleased with our course of actions being the most prudent way to maximize balance sheet stability and positioning us to take advantage of attractive capital deployment opportunities. 
In addition to showing up the balance sheet, we undertook a series of actions to optimize spend and maximize retained cash flow by reducing our corporate overhead through tighter cost controls and fine-tuning of capital expenditure plans. We also made the decision in May to reduce our quarterly dividend by 30%, given the uncertainties around the pandemic's timeline and severity. Despite the pandemic, substantial negative impact on our business, our actions throughout 2020 removed any dependence on a quick recovery. And also afforded us the opportunity to be patient with respect to the transaction market and take advantage of attractive private market valuations relative to public markets, while also highlighting the institutional demand for our high-quality portfolio. 
Over the course of the year, we sold $3.7 billion of pro rata assets at a blended 5.4% yield, including $1.3 billion of senior housing operating assets at a price per unit of $332,000 per bed. Most recently, during the fourth quarter, we sold a portfolio of senior housing operating properties operated by Northbridge for $200 million, representing a 4.9% cap rate on March trailing 12-month NOI and $395,000 per unit. Also in the fourth quarter, we announced a new joint venture partnership with certain investment vehicles managed by Wafra. The joint venture comprised a portfolio of 24 outpatient medical properties previously majority-owned by Welltower. 
Many of these transactions were completed in the midst of significant disruption in real estate and capital markets from the long-term viability of our senior housing assets, in particular, were being called into question. While we are pleased with execution on the disposition front, we're excited to now be executing on the acquisition side with financial flexibility and ample liquidity. On our third quarter earnings call, Shankh described a $1 billion acquisition pipeline. And since the start of the fourth quarter, we've closed on $657 million at a blended initial yield of 4.5% With an expected stabilized yield over 7.5%. 
Lastly, moving to our first quarter outlook. Last night, we provided an outlook for the first quarter of net income attributable to common stockholders per diluted share of $0.24 to $0.29 and normalized cents per diluted share of $0.71 to $0.76 per share. The midpoint of our guidance, $0.735 per share, represents a sequential decline of approximately $0.105 per share from the fourth quarter. The $0.105 decline is composed of an $0.08 decline in senior housing operating results, driven by $0.06 of fundamental declines and $0.02 of increased COVID costs. A $0.03 per share sequential decline in triple-net senior housing NOI. A little over $0.02 of which is related to the capital senior and signature U.K. transitions mentioned earlier, with the remainder due to fundamental declines on cash recognition leases. A $0.02 per share decline related to net investment activity in Q4 and Q1 and $0.03 related to a combination of other items, mainly made up of increased G&A, income tax and a slight decline in interest income. These declines are offset by a 5.5% increase in pro rata HHS funds received to date in the first quarter. As a reminder, we're only guiding HHS funds we already -- that have already been received as of today's call. 
And with that, I will hand the call back over to Shankh."

We're very focused on is significant discount to replacement cost for that very reason. But again, we need more time to give you a general sense of what that looks like, but it depends on assets to assets. We're buying assets that are 82% occupied. We're buying assets at a 22% occupied.

But we've seen both the negative and positive case counts rise and fall, start to impact our business, 30 to 45 days afterwards. And that makes sense given thinking about kind of the sales cycle and an average kind of 30 days of a kind of start of a lead to a close. So what we need to see is the direction we're seeing right now in case counts to continue. We need to see likely the vaccinations that are going on a national level in our buildings to then allow for that to be kind of held at a low level. And we're seeing those things take place now. But as of today's call, we're still very much at an elevated level of cases nationally in our building. So I think what we need to see is for this current level to distract to continue at the low level to sustain itself, and we'll start to see some early indicators of that if that direction continues over the next month or so. And the fundamental impact on our business would come, I said, kind of 30, 45 days after that. So I think it comes down to simply the path of COVID, and it's a big reason of kind of the outlook being 1 quarter here, not the full year because I think any full year outlook would essentially be just a -- more of a guidance on where the path of the virus goes, which is something that we don't think we've got a better view on than those of you in the market. So it really comes down and just COVID."

We've talked a bit this year of looking at movements as a percentage of pre-COVID levels and to give an idea of not only how much they decline at the start of COVID to kind of where they sit relative to levels in 2019. If you were to look at kind of move in levels from April to September 2019 and compare that to move out levels we saw in the fourth quarter of this year. So just the most recent experience, which is a bit heightened relative to historical. But as you can see in our stats, it certainly is not spiking. You would see at a 100% to back to -- back at pre0COVID demand levels, 90 to 110 basis points of occupancy increases on a monthly basis. And that's really a product of, again, demand coming back quite a bit. You look at January of 2021, and we're at 50% of prior year move-ins, so thinking about that 50% to back the pre-COVID levels, that's quite a climb from here. 
But another way to look at it is we likely have to get back to kind of 65% of pre-COVID demand levels to get to breakeven on occupancy. And then from there, build to start to gain. And just putting that in context, when COVID did come down in late summer, early fall 2020, we did see demand as measured by move-ins move back to kind of 70% prior year. So we've seen demand move back in that range during COVID pre-vaccine, but certainly, we're well below that now. So current trends on the move-in side have gotten worse. But hopefully, that gives you an idea of where that could move to if demand really comes back to pre-COVID levels in the short-term and also where we kind of need them to get to just see some stabilization of the portfolio."

It is purely dependent on what it takes to build a building. And if you can buy at a significant discount, the 2 things will happen, right? You can wait for that demand to come back. And if you can't make money at a -- obviously, at a 50% to 60% discount replacement cost, then no one will build a new building at the replacement cost because they have to charge a lot more than you. So ultimately, any capital-heavy asset class like real estate, assuming your overall demand is increasing, ultimately, that demand/supply will balance. If I can't make money at discount replacement cost, you will not be able to make money by building a new 1 at replacement cost. This is a particularly interesting phenomena in this cycle, in most cycles, what you see is replacement -- I mean, the cost to build goes down when a recession hits because housing is white hard, replacement cost is actually spiking through this particular cycle. That keeps you even a bigger gap as we think through a cycle."

I don't believe that I've ever been critical of our peer companies. What led to the collaboration is that I restart to my fellow CEOs, and we absolutely agree that we need to work on these industry issues and operator issues together, and I got a very warm reception.

And there is a power in bigger numbers and we have very smart companies in our space, run by very competent and smart management team. It is only in our interest to work together to solve these bigger issues than work alone. So that's a simple one. 
I'm not going to get into the first question. I will tell you that we are creating, as I said, we're very much focused on from an acquisition side on 2 things, right? Early cycle opportunities that, obviously, we're executing and we will be very pleased as the year progress where that will shake out. But we're very much cognizant of the fact that are cycle opportunities. Eventually, that will be gone. So if we start working on then what will eventually become is the normal cycle opportunity is too late. So we have never stopped, and it is also pretty much to be a very advantageous position. To be a large company in our space, the largest company in our space, which we're expanding pretty rapidly and we didn't bat an eyelid and stopped. And because we believe in the business, as I laid out. We are -- you have to think about it. This is a very interesting business where you have to work with other people, and you have to work with operators, you have to work with developers. In many cases, they are one and the same. And to grow, create value together, not at the expense of each other, that alignment is extremely important. And this last 9, 10 months has given us the opportunity to work with more of our operators. 
And frankly speaking, as you can see, being aligned with Welltower has created significant and is continue to create significant value for our our operators whose -- if you think about if you're not aligned with a capital source that has the capability and the fierce resolve to deploy capital through this kind of disruption then ultimately, as I said, you'll come to that end of the cycle, and it's too late. So I'm not going to get into what that looks like. I'll just give you one example. 600,000 square feet of 100% pre-leased MOBs. Michael, you can do the math and think about how much value creation.

It depends, obviously, every asset is different, where you buy the asset, what basis you buy the assets is completely different. When we made that presentation, we never thought we'll be able to buy assets that a meaningful discount to replacement cost. If we look at pre-pandemic, health care real estate, particularly on the senior housing, usually traded at a mild to modest premium to replacement cost because the health care income has a multiple, not a real estate multiple, but it's still a multiple, right? So in asset class where you're starting above some level of replacement costs you're going to keep your pricing power really strong to the whole cycle and the next buyer analysis, you have to think about your next buyer analysis, and the next buyer has to also believe that will continue. That so -- that by implication, you are buying above replacement cost and you're selling above replacement cost or you're making it bet that the NOI growth -- if you're not -- NOI growth will meaningfully outstrip the cost of construction increase, right? 
So in both sides, you are at some form of above replacement costs. That equation changes completely when you can buy at a significant discount replacement cost. So if you buy $0.50 on the dollar, and at some period of normalization, you sell it at $0.100 on the dollar, you are still at a significant discount to the previous case when you make buyer analysis, it's much, much easier. Nothing has changed, except the price. And that price tells you why we're so excited about it today."

I think I'll answer in 2 ways. The first is on the lessons learned. Absolutely, this has made our operators look at their cost constructs in a more critical way than they probably ever could imagine, just given the pressure on occupancy and getting back to levels that for a lot of them look like they having been in since they leased up some of these assets years ago. We've had feedback from operators and large platforms saying they've found ways to do things on the labor front, just a lot more efficiently. And given the feedback ahead of time to what you're speaking to, that when you start to see the business come back, do they think there is significant cost savings in the -- particularly, the labor model as far as getting a bit more leverage off it. 
I think on the margin side, I would hesitate to kind of speak to that from a margin expansion story just driven purely by that as of yet. As you know, there's cost in the structure right now that are being added because of covet. We feel pretty confident a lot of these things are temporary. But given that there's 2 things to speak now, kind of a margin expansion story we're having those costs in in the current business and having an unclear picture of when and how the kind of the virus moves away from our business, and it could be a bit aggressive. But I do think the margin expansion story, thinking about it relative to even where we were pre pandemic we think there's an occupancy lift story in this space, just given the demand story. And I think the mass still keeps us very positive in the space that long-term demand story hasn't changed in the pandemic. And certainly has been a very impactful last 9 months, 12 months to continue to be in the near future, but in the long-term, demand story stands. And that's going to lift occupancy, and there's a lot of operating leverage in this business even without changes to the structure. So you're going to see as kind of industry occupancies lift up over the next 3 to 5 years think you are going to see margins move above where they were pre-pandemic even without those operating efficiencies being put in the model."

One is that we obviously -- I would encourage you and our team would be happy to set it up to talk to Mark Shaver and our team with what we're doing on the payer provider side and -- which should help margin as well. The second lessons learned, I would say, not a margin point, but a separate point is one of the lessons learned, SHOP through, not just this pandemic, but through the last few years, is that you should not lend money to an entity or any type of entity where you are not willing to take the keys, right? As a REIT, we're not allowed to obviously own an operating company more than 35%. And so we should not lend money to operating companies where we're not able to take over the asset. Today, we're only focused, obviously, in last few years and through this cycle through the pandemic. We're only focused on, if we write a credit check, we only write. If we are completely able to take over the asset, and we're very happy owner of the asset on the last dollar exposure that we have. That is a big lessons learned inside our SHOP and a good one for the long-term valuation of our shareholders."

Our REVPOR is",270,"Yes. That's a good question, Steve. So when you think about on a sequential basis, that $0.06 that moves from 4Q to 1Q, effectively, if you think about like REVPOR and occupancy decline combined, you get to your revenue change sequentially. Our REVPOR is down 20 basis points. But that's driven by 2 things. 40% of our senior housing revenue in the fourth quarter is actually from operators that receive rent on a daily basis, which is pretty common in the higher acuity side of senior living. And so just moving from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, you lose 2 days, you go from 92 days to 90 days. So with REVPOR being an approximation of monthly rent, your rent would go down 2.2% just from that. So there's a headwind from that on a sequential REVPOR basis. And then you've got this continued mix shift where the occupancy, the mix shift, the makeup of revenue in the fourth quarter versus first quarter, again, you're seeing a higher occupancy fall off in the higher acuity segments of our portfolio, which pay higher rent. So in combination of those 2 things is the REVPOR from how that impacts kind of total revenue is down 20 basis points. But if you look at on a per day per unit rent, we're up 2.1% in the fourth quarter relative to the first quarter, and it's actually pretty strong sequential growth. And it's driven mainly by roughly half of our operators also have Gen 1 increasers. So there was increases pushed through on Gen 1, and that's helped kind of run growth."

I'm assuming you're asking about the difference between senior housing triple-net versus senior housing operating. So look, given where the cycle is, I want to be a majority being the equity position or in the RIDEA side. But there are opportunities to strip by capital in the senior housing triple-net side. If you have assets that are stabilized and you can buy it cheap enough that the last dollar of the lease is still in a place where the operators can make money and we can make money. There, obviously, you can create a lot of bells and whistles and for the operators have a second bit of the apple. So there's ways you can create that alignment. But remember, if you simplistically think about idea is an equity exposure and a lease is more of a credit exposure, you can't create value, if, a, from our side, if the buildings have stabilized or near stabilization, and you buy it cheap enough that your last dollar is still a pretty low rent relative to what the cash flow of the buildings look like, then you can create value. But that's how we think about it. That's how our operators think about it. And so we have found 2 opportunities to do leases. 
If we do find more opportunities, we'll do it. But I can tell you that the industry is moving away, at least we are moving away from very tightly covered leases today, we're thinking about there should be even more marginal safety. And when we find opportunities where we're buying so cheap that we can, that's when we're going forward."

You've seen that kind of lag cases in that kind of 30- or 45-day range. So what we've seen in cases, the fact that they're still very high, it may make this time a bit different as far as how much time it takes post it. But just thinking about it mid-January kind of peak in cases, you would likely -- if things continue on this trend, the positive trend we're seeing think you start to see towards the middle to the end of the month, maybe some of those first indicators move in a more portfolio-wide basis. And so we can provide some more color on that as we update the market over the next month or 2. But right now, it's a little too early to speak to it."

First and foremost, I hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy during these extraordinary times. In the spirit of this year-end call, I would like to review year 2020, the most challenging in our history and discuss different paths of growth, long-term value creation for our continuing shareholders on part share basis.  
We came into 2020 prepared for perhaps a plain vanilla business cycle downturn. We pushed out our maturities in Q4 of 2019, sold a lot of short duration assets, bought a lot of longer duration assets and continue to upgrade our portfolio, operators, management contract and talent. We were hopeful that with the continued decline in seniors housing deliveries and start, on one hand, and the aging of the population finally picking up, on the other hand, that 2020 would serve an inflection point in the -- for the fundamentals after decades of weak demographics, resulting from the aging of the Baby Boomers generation. Then the once-a-century pandemic happened, that would turn out to be particularly devastating for our business. The back half of first quarter, second and third quarter were all about long-term value preservation. We enhanced our liquidity profile dramatically by selling assets in record time at or near pre-COVID pricing, more importantly, avoided mistakes of raising long-term dilutive capital, a consistent theme for managing the company for continuing shareholder on a part share basis.  
We started during the dark days of March and April by selling $1 billion of assets at a great prices in record 43 days from signing a confidentiality agreement to receiving cash. We continued this journey during Q2 and Q3, and eventually executed on $3.7 billion of disposition at extraordinary prices to build an unprecedented war chest. Two things particularly surprised me during this time: The resilience of our team during our -- including our extended team of operating partners; and the liquidity of our assets. Not that we didn't have doubts or failures, but we continue to move forward in spite of them with a steady hand on the wheel and an unwavering belief that we'll get to the other side.  
Our team's stoic resilient, reminded me every day of Winston Churchill's famous quote that, ""success is not final. Failure is not final. It is the courage to continue that counts."" In those moments of reckoning, I realized how privileged I was to be part of this team that didn't miss a beat and blazed new trails.  
For years, I have heard that healthcare-oriented real estate deserves a discount to the -- too, say, shiny tower in middle of a large gateway city due to the lack of liquidity and smaller ticket size, especially during down cycles. I hope that during the worst down cycle of our asset class, this debate has been finally settled as demonstrated by our execution and that of our colleagues that helped. In the fall, we pivoted again from defense to offense as we started underwriting and shaking hands on new acquisition. It is important for you to understand that we don't shake hands and find excuses to walk or chip away, which if we shake hands, we close. Our handshake in this business is worth gold, and we only enhanced our long-term reputation during this pandemic.  
During last quarter's call, I discussed $1 billion of deep value opportunity. I'm delighted to report that we have closed roughly $700 million of acquisitions since the start of fourth quarter at a significant discount or replacement cost. Our acquisition pipeline has grown meaningfully. And as I sit here today, I'm optimistic this year is shaping up to be a year of net acquisition, perhaps significantly so. At that time -- at the same time, I will remind you that we're not driven and incentivized by volume up acquisition, but the value of it. Asset price is the ultimate determinant of how we'll behave.  
In this moment of confusion and ambiguity, I indulge you to focus on 4 distinct pillars of long-term value creation for Welltower. One, operating fundamentals. Tim will get into the details of what happened last quarter and what might happen next quarter. While operating fundamentals is awful right now, with little near term visibility, we're optimistic about the vaccine rollout as 90% of our assisted living and memory care facilities have conducted their first vaccination clinic with virtually all residents taking the shot. While I would not expect this to be a source of value creation in the very near term, I'm hopeful about the second half of the year.  
Normalization of operating performance remains the largest source of value creation for our shareholders. It is too early to comment on exact timing of the trough and the shape of the recovery, but we'll keep you posted frequently intra-quarter so that you can see what we see. Our focus remains on upholding the reputation of our communities and maintaining the safety of our operator staff and residents. We spared no expenses and have already spent in excess of $80 million on COVID-related expenses to date, doing everything we can within our control to support their well-being. Due to the great reputation of our operators and the extraordinary value they provide, rates are holding out. In 2020, REVPOR was up 2% in AL memory care, 1% in independent living and 4.4% in our seniors apartment business. This growth occurred despite the headwind resulting from lower community fees, driven by a decline in move-in activity.  
Number two, operator platform enhancement, management contracts, leadership and system enhancements and building local scale are some of the examples of this. Let me highlight 2 specifics here. A, Sunrise. We're delighted by the appointment of Jack Callison, as the CEO of Sunrise Living, our largest operating partner. Jack will bring much needed attention to operating excellence with an operations first culture. We are also negotiating a new management contract that will align the interest of Sunrise and Welltower as the owner of the assets. We're diligently working with the management of Revera, Sunrise's majority owner, to enhance Sunrise's position so that it can emerge from this pandemic as the leading operator poised for excellence and growth. B, building local scale. If I can put [child mother ], the advantage of local scales are of ungodly important to this business. We have and will continue to scale our most important strategic partner as we expand our senior housing footprint.  
To name a few in alphabetical order, Balfour, Brandywine, Clover, Cogir, Frontier, Kelsey-Seybold , Kisco, Oakmont, StoryPoint are just some of the examples of the partners we have grown significantly during this pandemic. What is common amongst them? They're excellent operators in their markets. Their great leadership. They're disciplined yet courageous. And they have an aligned relationship with Welltower. We rise and fall together. This list is expanding with a significant opportunity set that I mentioned a few moments ago.  
Number three, capital deployment opportunity. I have already commented on the acquisition opportunity on the deep value side. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I would remind you that we're an IRR buyer with an incredible focus on basis, operators and structure. Our opportunity set is rising rapidly, and I hope to provide you with more specific color in next 60 to 90 days. This comment is obviously focused on the current opportunities. Let me provide you some color on a related topic, but on future opportunities.  
We, at Welltower, have never been in a more advantageous position as a partner of choice. For years, we have focused on growth strategy driven by our relationship-based and alignment focused structure and data analytics platform rather than prioritize on cost and access to capital advantage. After all, not all capital is equal. We never imagine that we've encountered today's extreme stress. But as you can see, we stood by our operators during this difficult time, not only to preserve their businesses, but also to grow it significantly. Talk is cheap, but action is not. For this reason, we are inundated with requests as a partner of choice from all asset classes we play in. As much as I like to do call, we have been on-road throughout this pandemic meeting with prospective partners. This is bearing meaningful fruits. We have executed more partnership and pipeline deals in last 9 months than over 5 preceding years combined. We expect to deploy $10-plus billion of capital in these opportunities in the next few years. In other words, we are not only executing on deep value early cycle opportunities, but also laying a strong foundation of growth to the entire cycle when inevitably the significant price discrepancies of today will be gone.  
To give you an example, we recently reupped our master development agreement for 5 years with Kelsey-Seybold, our largest MOB tenant. We're looking to start approximately 600,000 square feet of 100% pre-lease development in 2021 and 2022.  
Number four, talents opportunity. I touched on this last call but let me elaborate for those of you who are focused on long term. We're seeing an incredible interest in our platform from seasoned professionals to early carrier applicants. We have taken advantage of recent disruption and brought in 41 new professionals in 2020. We expect at least as many, if not more, to join our team in 2021. In addition to new talent, our existing talent pool is taking on more responsibilities and reaching new heights. As a result, we had 50 new promotions at Welltower. Through this some -- though this puts early pressure on G&A, which is partially offset by lower executive comp, we think this is -- this incredible talent pool is the equivalent of a coiled spring, which will manifest itself in a meaningful growth for the firm. 
Speaking of talent pool, how is the mood inside today, inside Welltower? What I described to you as the stoic resilience last year has transformed into an environment of optimism and unbridled passion this year. I want to make it abundantly clear, we have no crystal ball about the near-term operating fundamentals, but we are doing meaningful work that matters. We have meaningful relationship, and we're seeing a new level of positive energy of people who want to be part of this team internally and externally to create meaningful value and make a disproportionate impact.  
With that, I'll pass it over -- the microphone to Tim. Tim?"

My comments today will focus on our fourth quarter 2020 results.

My comments today will focus on our fourth quarter 2020 results. The performance of all of our investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity and finally, a balance sheet and liquidity update and our first quarter outlook.  
The fourth quarter was a tough end to a very challenging year. And the ongoing impact of coronavirus accelerated meaningfully in the back half of the fourth quarter and into the beginning of 2021. The visibility for large parts of our business beyond the next 90 days remain very limited and very dependent on virus related variables, such as unpredictable group path of growth, the rollout and efficacy of the vaccine, the continuation of population lockdown mandates. As a result of this uncertainty, we decided to provide our first quarter outlook this morning in place of the full year outlook we would normally provide in our fourth quarter call.  
As we have done over the last year, we'll continue to disclose and update information on frequent basis, with the intention of providing a more complete outlook as soon as the variance, the virus-related variables moderate to a level that allows for reliable forecasting.  
Now turning to the quarter. Welltower reported net income attributable to common shareholders of $0.39 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $0.84 per diluted share. Normalized FFO was sequentially flat in the third quarter and the decline in seniors housing operating earnings and dilution from dispositions to close over the last 2 quarters was offset by recognition of HHS funds, lower G&A, lower interest expense and initial returns on reinvested capital.  
Now turning to our individual portfolio components. First, with our triple-net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats are reported a quarter in arrears. So these statistics reflect a trailing 12-month ending 9/30/2020, and therefore, only reflects the partial impact from COVID-19. Importantly, our collection rate remained high in the fourth quarter, having collected 97% of triple-net contractual rent due in the period.  
Starting with our senior housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI declined 2.7% year-over-year, as leases that were removed to cash recognition in prior quarters continue to comp against prior full year contractual rent received. Occupancy was down 260 basis points sequentially, consistent with the average occupancy drop from 2Q to 3Q in our RIDEA portfolio, and EBITDAR coverage decreased 0.01x on a sequential basis in this portfolio from 1.01x.  
During the quarter, we transitioned a U.K. development portfolio from triple-net to RIDEA, transitioned 14 former triple-net capital senior assets to new operators and RIDEA structures and disposed of one asset, which has a net impact of increasing coverage by 0.03x. 
Consistent with my comments in the past, our senior housing triple-net lease operators experienced similar headwinds as our RIDEA operators over the past 9 months, and we expect reported lease coverage stats to continue to reflect these challenges as more of the pandemic period is reflected in EBITDAR going forward. That being said, the resilience of this portfolio is reflected by the continued high cash collection rate is encouraging.  
As I described last quarter, we entered into an agreement with Capital Senior beginning of 2020, which allowed for an early termination of CSU leases on 24 Welltower-owned assets, in exchange for full rent being paid in 2020 in cooperation with transitioning the operations of these assets. We transitioned 14 properties operated by CSU to new operators in the fourth quarter, in addition to 5 that were transitioned during the third quarter. We anticipate the remaining assets to be transitioned to new operators in the first half of 2021. As a result of the continued COVID backdrop, the initial expected dilution from these conversion are expected to be approximately $0.04 per share in 2021. 
Additionally, the conversion of a development portfolio in the U.K. from triple-net to RIDEA is also expected to be negatively impact normalized FFO by $0.04 per share in 2021.  
The combination of these 2 transitions is expected to result in the sequential roll down of a little over $0.02 per share of normalized FFO from Q4 to Q1.  
Next, our long-term post-acute portfolio generate  2% year-over-year same-store growth. However, EBITDAR coverage declined by 0.012x sequentially to 1.0x, which was almost entirely due to deterioration in our largest long-term post-acute tenant, Genesis Healthcare. As we noted last quarter, Genesis Healthcare, which makes up approximately half of our long-term post-acute exposure, raised concerns around its ability to continue as a going concern in second quarter financials filed on August 10. As a result of this concern, Welltower began recording revenue and cash basis in the third quarter. Furthermore, we wrote down our unsecured loan exposure to them by $80 million in the fourth quarter. Similar to our Genesis lease income, we've been recognizing all interest on our unsecured loans on a cash basis. So this impairment does not change income recognition on these loans. Genesis remains current on all financial obligations to Welltower through January.  
And lastly, health systems, which is comprised of our ProMedica senior care joint venture with the ProMedica Health System. We had same-store NOI growth of positive 2.7% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was 2.27x. 
Turning to medical office. Our outpatient medical office portfolio delivered positive 2.1% year-over-year same-store growth, modestly below long-term trends. Growth continues to be negatively impacted by reserves for uncollected rent. The large majority of which is resulting from lease enforcement moratoriums in several California jurisdictions, in which we have a sizable footprint, as I described last quarter. As these moratoriums expire, we expect rent collection to improve from a 98.5% received in the fourth quarter.  
Looking back to 2020, our outpatient medical platform displayed incredible resilience in a truly challenging year, which include periods of time which basic medical appointments and procedures were flat out not permitted. Yet, we still managed to grow same-store NOI an average of positive 1.7%. During the fourth quarter, we continued to observe improvements in several key operating trends as business continue to normalize. Notably a pickup in our leasing pipeline, which would start to reflect in occupancy -- positive occupancy pickup towards the back half of 2021.  
Now turning to our senior housing operating portfolio. Before getting into this quarter's results, I want to point out that we received approximately $9 million from the Department of Health and Human Services CARES Act provider release fund. And post quarter, we received another $34 million, delivering $8 million and $31 million of net expected proceeds at our share. We are recognizing these funds on a cash basis until they will flow through financials in the quarter in which they're received. We are normalizing these HHS funds at a same-store metrics, however, along with any other government funds received that are not matched to expenses incurred in the period they were receive.  
In the fourth quarter, there're approximately $11.8 million of reimbursement normalized out of our same-store senior housing operating results, mainly tied to the HHS program in the U.S.  
Now turning to results of the quarter. Same-store NOI decreased 33.8% as compared to fourth quarter 2019 and decreased 11.3% sequentially from the third quarter. Starting with revenue. Sequential same-store revenue was down 2.4% in Q4, driven primarily by 160 basis point drop in average occupancy. As a reminder, we started the fourth quarter with relative optimism on the occupancy front, with improving year-over-year move in volumes and relatively low prevalence of COVID within our communities. However, these positive trends rapidly reversed as the exponential rise in global COVID cases in November and December, by the city and statewide lockdowns and missions bans across many of our key MSAs, particularly in the U.K. and California, which together comprise 34% of our portfolio NOI. The result of this was 180 basis points of occupancy loss from November through year-end.  
As I started -- as I stated on our third quarter call, the path of COVID will dictate our business trends from the fourth quarter, not seasonality and not the seasonal flu, and that has proved quite true over the past 3.5 months.  
Turning to REVPOR in the quarter. Total show of REVPOR -- total show of portfolio REVPOR was down 1.2% year-over-year and flat sequentially. But as I described last quarter, mix shift is distorting the true picture of rent growth metrics. As stand-alone year-over-year REVPOR growth for our active adult, independent living and assisted living segments were positive 3.7%, 0.5% and 1.1%, respectively. The combined total portfolio metric is being impacted by considerable changes in composition of occupied units in the year-over-year portfolio. As lower acuity properties, independent living and senior departments have held up considerably better on the occupancy front since the start of COVID. We just had a mathematical impact of having a higher portion of our total portfolio occupied units being lower acuity and therefore, lower rent paying units. The point being, rental rates are proving more resilient across our portfolio than would appear in our aggregate reported statistics.  
And lastly, expenses. Total same-store expenses declined 2.1% year-over-year and increased 50 basis points sequentially. I'll focus on the sequential since the changes are more relevant to trends in the current operating environment. The 50 basis point increase in operating costs was driven mainly by higher sequential COVID costs as a result of the surge in cases in the fourth quarter. The decline in top line, combined with these expenses -- expense pressures, had a meaningful impact on our operating margins, which declined 220 basis points sequentially to 22.3%. As I noted earlier in the call, we did not include government reimbursement that was not tied to period expenses -- in period expenses in our same-store results. And therefore, COVID expenses negatively impact same-store by $18.9 million in the quarter.  
We will stay consistent with this treatment in Q1. We've -- where we've already received a net $31 million in HHS fund. That will likely turn COVID expenses into a net benefit, if included in our same-stores and offset.  
Looking forward to the first quarter and starting with 2021 year-to-date data we have already reserved, we've experienced 180 basis point decline in occupancy through February 5. Given the still heightened presence of COVID, we expect average occupancy to be down 275 to 375 basis points from fourth quarter to first quarter. Note that we are providing the average occupancy as opposed to spot occupancy as the former better ties to our reported financials. And therefore, 260 basis points of our expected 275 to 375 basis point decline is already baked, given the swift drop for mid-November to date in occupancy. We expect monthly REVPOR to be down 20 basis points sequentially, although it should be noted that actual rent per unit is up 2.1% sequentially. With mix shift, which I mentioned earlier and 2 fewer days in the quarter, skewing reported REVPOR versus actual rent growth.  
Lastly, we expect total expenses to be effectively flat as higher sequential COVID costs are offset by less labor utilization due to lower occupancy levels.  
Turning to capital markets activity. Throughout 2020, we took a series of actions that were difficult, result in our ability to retain significant cash flow and ultimately, gave us greater control to navigate through the pandemic. It's worth highlighting that despite the stress endured by our business, we've avoided the destabilization of the balance sheet by borrowing to pay the dividend or being forced in raising equity or selling assets at unattractive valuations. Given where we sit today, the $2.1 billion of cash and over $5.1 billion of available liquidity, we are pleased with our course of actions being the most prudent way to maximize balance sheet stability and positioning us to take advantage of attractive capital deployment opportunities.  
In addition to showing up the balance sheet, we undertook a series of actions to optimize spend and maximize retained cash flow by reducing our corporate overhead through tighter cost controls and fine-tuning of capital expenditure plans. We also made the decision in May to reduce our quarterly dividend by 30%, given the uncertainties around the pandemic's timeline and severity. Despite the pandemic, substantial negative impact on our business, our actions throughout 2020 removed any dependence on a quick recovery. And also afforded us the opportunity to be patient with respect to the transaction market and take advantage of attractive private market valuations relative to public markets, while also highlighting the institutional demand for our high-quality portfolio.  
Over the course of the year, we sold $3.7 billion of pro rata assets at a blended 5.4% yield, including $1.3 billion of senior housing operating assets at a price per unit of $332,000 per bed. Most recently, during the fourth quarter, we sold a portfolio of senior housing operating properties operated by Northbridge for $200 million, representing a 4.9% cap rate on March trailing 12-month NOI and $395,000 per unit. Also in the fourth quarter, we announced a new joint venture partnership with certain investment vehicles managed by Wafra. The joint venture comprised a portfolio of 24 outpatient medical properties previously majority-owned by Welltower.  
Many of these transactions were completed in the midst of significant disruption in real estate and capital markets from the long-term viability of our senior housing assets, in particular, were being called into question. While we are pleased with execution on the disposition front, we're excited to now be executing on the acquisition side with financial flexibility and ample liquidity. On our third quarter earnings call, Shankh described a $1 billion acquisition pipeline. And since the start of the fourth quarter, we've closed on $657 million at a blended initial yield of 4.5% With an expected stabilized yield over 7.5%.  
Lastly, moving to our first quarter outlook. Last night, we provided an outlook for the first quarter of net income attributable to common stockholders per diluted share of $0.24 to $0.29 and normalized cents per diluted share of $0.71 to $0.76 per share. The midpoint of our guidance, $0.735 per share, represents a sequential decline of approximately $0.105 per share from the fourth quarter. The $0.105 decline is composed of an $0.08 decline in senior housing operating results, driven by $0.06 of fundamental declines and $0.02 of increased COVID costs. A $0.03 per share sequential decline in triple-net senior housing NOI. A little over $0.02 of which is related to the capital senior and signature U.K. transitions mentioned earlier, with the remainder due to fundamental declines on cash recognition leases. A $0.02 per share decline related to net investment activity in Q4 and Q1. And $0.03 related to a combination of other items, mainly made up of increased G&A, income tax and a slight decline in interest income. These declines are offset by a 5.5% increase in pro rata HHS funds received to date in the first quarter. As a reminder, we're only guiding HHS funds we already -- that have already been received as of today's call.  
And with that, I will hand the call back over to Shankh."

We have worked diligently with Healthpeak, Ventas and Omega to address operator and industry issues and towards mutually beneficial transactions. For example, it was our absolute pleasure to work with Tom Herzog and his team on 2 separate transactions, totaling $170 million. I am positive we are embarking on a new era of collaboration amongst the public companies in our space.  
Second, in spite of our challenges being faced by our industry today, our confidence in our business has not changed, and I'm hopeful that my comments this morning have provided you with a framework for how we intend to create long-term value for all of our stakeholders. We're grateful to be part of your portfolio as our shareholders. Personally, this management team has established a highly concentrated position in Welltower. In fact, neither Tim nor I, have sold a single share of the stock that we have received on a post-tax basis since we have come on Board a few years ago, which should be an indication to you, our fellow shareholders, of our conviction and personal stake we have in this business.  
As Buffett taught us, diversification may preserve well, but concentration builds well. This does not mean the path forward will be without challenges, but it is clear that we're all in on this company and that our alignment with you, our shareholders, is strong and significant.  
With that, we'll open the call up for questions."

That's just a coincidence. We're not focused on that. We're focused very much on basis, structure and operators, and I expect that our blended yield of the opportunities when we talk about next quarter will actually be dragged up overall by this set of opportunities.

So I think the first and foremost, what we've seen and learned over the last 10 months is that one, cases naturally and cases in our buildings have very much married each other. The virus has presented itself is -- it's pretty challenging to kind of keep out of anywhere. So I think when you talk about the macro and being cases, we're kind of speaking to both those at the same time. But we've seen both the negative and positive case counts rise and fall, start to impact our business, 30 to 45 days afterwards. And that makes sense given thinking about kind of the sales cycle and an average kind of 30 days of a kind of start of a lead to a close. So what we need to see is the direction we're seeing right now in case counts to continue. We need to see likely the vaccinations that are going on at national level and in our buildings to then allow for that to be kind of held at a low level. And we're seeing those things take place now. But as of today's call, we're still very much at an elevated level of cases nationally in our building. So I think what we need to see is for this current level to drastically continue at the low level to sustain itself, and we'll start to see some early indicators of that if that direction continues over the next month or so. 
And the fundamental impact on our business would come, as I said, kind of 30, 45 days after that. So I think it comes down to simply the path of COVID, and it's a big reason of kind of the outlook being 1 quarter here and not full year because I think any full year outlook would essentially be just a -- more of a guidance on where the path of the virus goes, which is something that we don't think we've got a better view on than those of you in the market. So it really comes down and just COVID."

So I can put some brackets around it, just thinking through kind of pre-COVID occupancy levels. We've talked a bit this year of looking at move-ins as a percentage of pre-COVID levels and to give an idea of not only how much they decline since the start of COVID, but kind of where they sit relative to levels in 2019. If you were to look at kind of move in levels from April to September 2019 and compare that to move out levels we saw in the fourth quarter of this year. So just the most recent experience, which is a bit heightened relative to historical. But as you can see in our stats, it certainly is not spiking. You would see at a 100% to back to pre-COVID with demand levels, 90 to 110 basis points of occupancy increases on a monthly basis. And that's really a product of, again, demand coming back quite a bit. You look at January of 2021, and we're at 50% of prior year move-ins, so thinking about that 50% to back to pre-COVID levels, that's quite a climb from here. 
But another way to look at it is we likely have to get back to kind of 65% of pre-COVID demand levels to get to breakeven on occupancy. And then from there, build to start to gain. And just putting that in context, when COVID did come down in late summer, early fall 2020, we did see demand as measured by move-ins move back to kind of 70% prior year. So we've seen demand move back in that range during COVID and pre-vaccine, but certainly, we're well below that now. So current trends on the move-in side have gotten worse. But hopefully, that gives you an idea of where that could move to if demand really comes back to pre-COVID levels in the short-term and also where we kind of need them to get to just see some stabilization of the portfolio."

So I want to remind you that what we are not -- we're focused on basis so that our value creation is not dependent on our ability to pinpoint the shape of the recovery. It is purely dependent on what it takes to build a building. And if you can buy at a significant discount, the 2 things will happen, right? You can wait for that demand to come back. And if you can't make money at a -- obviously, at a 50% to 60% discount replacement cost, then no one will build a new building at the replacement cost because they have to charge a lot more than you. So ultimately, in any capital-heavy asset class like real estate, assuming your overall demand is increasing, ultimately, that demand/supply will balance. 
If I can't make money at discount replacement cost, you will not be able to make money by building a new one at replacement cost. This is a particularly interesting phenomena in this cycle, in most cycles, what you see is replacement -- I mean, the cost to build goes down when a recession hits because housing is white hard, replacement cost is actually spiking through this particular cycle. That keeps you even a bigger gap as we think through a cycle."

And there is a power in bigger numbers and we have very smart companies in our space, runed by very competent and smart management team. It is only in our interest to work together to solve these bigger issues than work alone. So that's a simple one. 
I'm not going to get into the first question. I will tell you that we are creating, as I said, we're very much focused on from an acquisition side on 2 things, right? Early cycle opportunities that, obviously, we're executing and we'll be very pleased as the year progress where that will shake out. But we're very much cognizant of the fact that early cycle opportunities, eventually, that will be gone. So if we start working on then what will eventually become is the normal cycle opportunity is too late. 
So we have never stopped, and it is also pretty much to be a very advantageous position. To be a large company in our space, the largest company in our space, which we're expanding pretty rapidly and we didn't bat an eyelid and stopped.

This is a very interesting business where you have to work with other people, and you have to work with operators, you have to work with developers. In many cases, they are one and the same.

And frankly speaking, as you can see, being aligned with Welltower has created significant and is continue to create significant value for our operators whose -- if you think about if you're not aligned with a capital source that has the capability and the fierce resolve to deploy capital through this kind of disruption then ultimately, as I said, you'll come to the other end of the cycle, and it's too late. So I'm not going to get into what that looks like. I'll just give you one example. 600,000 square feet of 100% pre-leased MOBs. Michael, you can do the math and think about how much value creation. And that is not a pipeline that is just the start that we're sitting here today between 2021 and 2022."

It depends, obviously, every asset is different, where you buy the asset, what basis you buy the assets is completely different. When we made that presentation, we never thought we'll be able to buy assets at a meaningful discount to replacement cost. If we look at pre-pandemic, health care real estate, particularly on the senior housing, usually traded at a mild to modest premium to replacement cost because the health care income has a multiple, not a real estate multiple, but it's still a multiple, right? So in asset class where you're starting above some level of replacement costs you're going to keep your pricing power really strong through the whole cycle and the next buyer analysis, you have to think about your next buyer analysis, and the next buyer has to also believe that will continue. That so -- that by implication, you are buying above replacement cost and you're selling above replacement cost or you're making it bet that the NOI growth -- if you're not -- NOI growth will meaningfully outstrip the cost of construction increase, right? 
So in both sides, you are at some form of above replacement costs. That equation changes completely when you can buy at a significant discount replacement cost. So if you buy $0.50 on the dollar, and at some period of normalization, you send it -- sell it at $0.100 on the dollar, you are still at a significant discount to the previous case when you make buyer analysis, it's much, much easier. Nothing has changed, except the price. And that price tells you why we're so excited about it today."

But do you envision that there will be some positive lessons learned from all this and that, ultimately, part of your interest in senior housing and SHOP specifically is that there is a margin expansion sort of thesis down the road here, maybe 2, 3 years down the road, perhaps that will come out of this?

I think I'll answer in 2 ways. The first is on the lessons learned. Absolutely, this has made our operators look at their cost constructs in a more critical way than they probably ever could imagine, just given the pressure on occupancy and getting back to levels that for a lot of them look like they haven't been in since they leased up some of these assets years ago. We've had feedback from operators and large platforms saying they've found ways to do things on the labor front, just a lot more efficiently. And given the feedback ahead of time to what you're speaking to, that when you start to see the business come back, they think there is significant cost savings is in the -- particularly, the labor model as far as getting a bit more leverage off it. 
I think on the margin side, I would hesitate to kind of speak to that from a margin expansion story just driven purely by that as of yet. As you know, there's cost in the structure right now that are being added because of COVID. We feel pretty confident a lot of these things are temporary. But given that there's 2 things to speak now, kind of a margin expansion story. We're having those costs in in the current business and having an unclear picture of when and how the kind of the virus moves away from our business, I think would be a bit aggressive. But I do think the margin expansion story, I'm thinking about it relative to even where we were pre pandemic. We think there's an occupancy lift story in this space, just given the demand story. And that -- the thing that makes us -- still keeps us very positive in the space that long-term demand story hasn't changed in the pandemic. And certainly has been a very impactful last 9 months, 12 months to continue to be in the near future, but in the long-term, demand story stands. And that's going to lift occupancy, and there's a lot of operating leverage in this business even without changes to the structure. So you're going to see as kind of industry occupancies lift up over the next 3 to 5 years. I think you are going to see margins move above where they were pre-pandemic even without those operating efficiencies being put in the model."

One is that we obviously -- I would encourage you and our team would be happy to set it up to talk to Mark Shaver and our team with what we're doing on the payer provider side and -- which should help margin as well. The second lessons learned, I would say, not a margin point, but a separate point is one of the lessons learned, SHOP through, not just this pandemic, but through the last few years, is that you should not lend money to an entity or any type of entity where you are not willing to take the keys, right? As a REIT, we're not allowed to obviously own an operating company more than 35%. so we should not lend money to operating companies where we're not able to take over the asset. 
Today, we're only focused, obviously, in last few years and through this cycle, through the pandemic. We're only focused on, if we write a credit check, we only write. If we are completely able to take over the asset, and we're very happy owner of the asset on the last dollar exposure that we have.

Our REVPOR is",270,"Yes. That's a good question, Steve. So when you think about on a sequential basis, that $0.06 that moves from 4Q to 1Q, effectively, if you think about like REVPOR and occupancy decline combined, you get to your revenue change sequentially. Our REVPOR is down 20 basis points. But that's driven by 2 things. 40% of our senior housing revenue in the fourth quarter is actually from operators that receive rent on a daily basis, which is pretty common in the higher acuity side of senior living. And so just moving from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, you lose 2 days, you go from 92 days to 90 days. So with REVPOR being an approximation of monthly rent, your rent would go down 2.2% just from that. So there's a headwind from that on a sequential REVPOR basis. And then you've got this continued mix shift where the occupancy, the mix shift, the makeup of revenue in the fourth quarter versus first quarter, again, you're seeing a higher occupancy fall off in the higher acuity segments of our portfolio, which pay higher rent. 
So in combination of those 2 things is the REVPOR from how that impacts kind of total revenue is down 20 basis points. But if you look at on a per day, per unit rent, we're up 2.1% in the fourth quarter relative to the first quarter, and it's actually pretty strong sequential growth. And it's driven mainly by roughly half of our operators also have Gen 1 increasers. So there was increases pushed through on Gen 1, and that's helped kind of run growth."

I'm assuming you're asking about the difference between senior housing triple-net versus senior housing operating. So look, given where the cycle is, I want to be a majority being the equity position or in the RIDEA side. But there are opportunities to strip white capital in the senior housing -- in a triple-net side. If you have assets that are stabilized and you can buy it cheap enough that the last dollar of the lease is still in a place where the operators can make money and we can make money. There, obviously, you can create a lot of bells and whistles and for the operators have a second bit of the apple. So there's ways you can create that alignment. But remember, if you simplistically think about RIDEA as an equity exposure and a lease is more of a credit exposure, you can't create value, if, a, from our side, if the buildings have stabilized or near stabilization. And you buy it cheap enough that your last dollar is still a pretty low rent relative to what the cash flow of the buildings look like, then you can create value. But that's how we think about it. That's how our operators think about it. And so we have found 2 opportunities to do leases. 
If we do find more opportunities, we'll do it. But I can tell you that the industry is moving away, at least we are moving away from very tightly covered leases. Today, we're thinking about there should be even more marginal safety. And when we find opportunities where we're buying so cheap that we can, that's when we're going forward."

We had a lot of hiring people on our infrastructure teams, our accounting, tax. I can't -- I don't have the background. I can tell you that we have seen an incredible resurgence of interest in our asset -- in our company today, from both sort of externally and internally. And what I mean externally as an operator developers and internally as prospective employees, both experienced employees that we're hiring, there's a lot of talent in the market for obvious disruption. Also a lot of early carrier employees that we are seeing. I'll just tell you, just one small step, an interesting one, doesn't change really for anything we do. We hire East Coast, West Coast and Midwest, we hired the top 7 schools for MBA candidates. This year, we got more than 1,400 applications for really 4, 5 positions we hire. So that sort of tells you the interest in our business. And the amount of incredible talent we're seeing, both on the early career side as well as super experience side, and we'll see some really good hires this year as well. This year, I expect that we'll add 40 to 50 professionals across the board in the company. 
Acquisition is not just, as I said, I want you to think about Josh acquisition in this kind of market, which is so disruptive in 3 ways: one, obvious one, right, we're doing value opportunities that we can add at a discount to replacement cost; b, acquisition of partnership, an operator relationship and developer relationship, that's b; c is employees, we're in a business of talent. And given the amount of disruption that's in the marketplace that we see, and what we think this business will become as we think about 3 years, 5 years, 10 years from now, we're very much adding an incredible level of talent that we have sort of never seen in the marketplace."

If you don't think that's a devalue opportunity, I really don't know how to answer to that. So I guess we just have to obviously think about it different way. We are -- if you just always remember, price relative to what it takes to build, that gap is what creates distress. If you just want to look at purely on a price per pound and does it look cheap. Just wait for a few -- as I said, 60 to 90 days, I can tell you more about some of those opportunities that we are seeing. But I think we're executing on some very significant sort of discount to replacement cost opportunities. Some we have reported. And if you look at what those assets are and dig into what it takes to build it, you'll understand that.

I do think part of what I was getting at earlier is what we've seen in the past, you follow some of the first indicators being inquiries and request for tours, et cetera. You've seen that kind of lag cases in that kind of 30- or 45-day range. So what we've seen in cases, the fact that they're still very high, it may make this time a bit different as far as how much time it takes to post it.

It's -- even today, despite where we've come off of, case counts in every way, shape or form or higher than any point we've given a forward look in the past 9 months.

First and foremost, I hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy during these extraordinary times. In the spirit of this year-end call, I would like to review year 2020, the most challenging in",1748,"Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. First and foremost, I hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy during these extraordinary times. In the spirit of this year-end call, I would like to review year 2020, the most challenging in our history and discuss different paths of growth, long-term value creation for our continuing shareholders on part share basis.  
We came into 2020 prepared for perhaps a plain vanilla business cycle downturn. We pushed out our maturities in Q4 of 2019, sold a lot of short duration assets, bought a lot of longer duration assets and continue to upgrade our portfolio, operators, management contract and talent. We were hopeful that with the continued decline in seniors housing deliveries and starts, on one hand, and the aging of the population finally picking up, on the other hand, that 2020 would serve an inflection point in the -- for the fundamentals after decades of weak demographics, resulting from the aging of the Baby Boomers generation. 
Then the once-a-century pandemic happened, that would turn out to be particularly devastating for our business. The back half of first quarter, second and third quarter were all about long-term value preservation. We enhanced our liquidity profile dramatically by selling assets in record time at or near pre-COVID pricing, more importantly, avoided mistakes of raising long-term dilutive capital, a consistent theme for managing the company for continuing shareholder on a part share basis.  
We started during the dark days of March and April by selling $1 billion of assets at a great prices in record 43 days, from signing a confidentiality agreement to receiving cash. We continued this journey during Q2 and Q3, and eventually executed on $3.7 billion of disposition at extraordinary prices to build an unprecedented war chest. 
Two things particularly surprised me during this time: The resilience of our team during our -- including our extended team of operating partners; and the liquidity of our assets, not that we didn't have doubts or failures, but we continue to move forward in spite of them with a steady hand on the wheel and an unwavering belief that we'll get to the other side.  
Our team's stoic resilient, reminded me every day of Winston Churchill's famous quote that, ""Success is not final. Failure is not final. It is the courage to continue that counts."" In those moments of reckoning, I realized how privileged I was to be part of this team that didn't miss a beat and blazed new trails.  
For years, I have heard that healthcare-oriented real estate deserves a discount to the -- too, say, shiny tower in middle of a large gateway city due to the lack of liquidity and smaller ticket size, especially during down cycles. I hope that during the worst down cycle of our asset class, this debate has been finally settled as demonstrated by our execution and that of our colleagues that helped. 
In the fall, we pivoted again from defense to offense as we started underwriting and shaking hands on new acquisition. It is important for you to understand that we don't shake hands and find excuses to walk or chip away, which if we shake hands, we close. Our handshake in this business is worth gold, and we only enhanced our long-term reputation during this pandemic.  
During last quarter's call, I discussed $1 billion of deep value opportunity. I'm delighted to report that we have closed roughly $700 million of acquisitions since the start of fourth quarter at a significant discount or replacement cost. Our acquisition pipeline has grown meaningfully, and as I sit here today, I'm optimistic this year is shaping up to be a year of net acquisition, perhaps significantly so. 
At that time -- at the same time, I will remind you that we're not driven and incentivized by volume up acquisition, but the value of it. Asset price is the ultimate determinant of how we'll behave.  
In this moment of confusion and ambiguity, I indulge you to focus on 4 distinct pillars of long-term value creation for Welltower. One, operating fundamentals. Tim will get into the details of what happened last quarter and what might happen next quarter. While operating fundamentals is awful right now, with little near term visibility, we're optimistic about the vaccine rollout as 90% of our assisted living and memory care facilities have conducted their first vaccination clinic with virtually all residents taking the shot. While I would not expect this to be a source of value creation in the very near term, I'm hopeful about the second half of the year.  
Normalization of operating performance remains the largest source of value creation for our shareholders. It is too early to comment on exact timing of the trough and the shape of the recovery, but we'll keep you posted frequently intra-quarter so that you can see what we see. Our focus remains on upholding the reputation of our communities and maintaining the safety of our operator staff and residents. 
We spared no expenses and have already spent in excess of $80 million on COVID-related expenses to date, doing everything we can within our control to support their well-being. Due to the great reputation of our operators and the extraordinary value they provide, rates are holding up. In 2020, REVPOR was up 2% in AL memory care, 1% in independent living and 4.4% in our seniors apartment business. This growth occurred despite the headwind resulting from lower community fees, driven by a decline in move-in activity.  
Number two, operator platform enhancement, management contracts, leadership and system enhancements and building local scale are some of the examples of this. Let me highlight 2 specifics here. A, Sunrise. We're delighted by the appointment of Jack Callison, as the CEO of Sunrise Living, our largest operating partner. Jack will bring much needed attention to operating excellence with an operations first culture. We are also negotiating a new management contract that will align the interest of Sunrise and Welltower as the owner of the assets. 
We're diligently working with the management of Revera, Sunrise's majority owner, to enhance Sunrise's position so that it can emerge from this pandemic as the leading operator, poised for excellence and growth. B, building local scale. If I can put [ charge further ], the advantage of local scales are of ungodly important to this business. We have and will continue to scale our most important strategic partner as we expand our senior housing footprint.  
To name a few in alphabetical order, Balfour, Brandywine, Clover, Cogir, Frontier, Kelsey-Seybold , Kisco, Oakmont, StoryPoint are just some of the examples of the partners we have grown significantly during this pandemic. What is common amongst them? They're excellent operators in their markets. Their great leadership. They're disciplined yet courageous and they have an aligned relationship with Welltower. We rise and fall together. This list is expanding with a significant opportunity set that I mentioned a few moments ago.  
Number three, capital deployment opportunity. I have already commented on the acquisition opportunity on the deep value side. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I would remind you that we're an IRR buyer with an incredible focus on basis, operators and structure. Our opportunity set is rising rapidly, and I hope to provide you with more specific color in next 60 to 90 days. This comment is obviously focused on the current opportunities. Let me provide you some color on a related topic, but on future opportunities.  
We, at Welltower, have never been in a more advantageous position as a partner of choice. For years, we have focused on growth strategy, driven by our relationship-based and alignment focused structure and data analytics platform rather than prioritize on cost and access to capital advantage. After all, not all capital is equal. We never imagined that we've encountered today's extreme stress. But as you can see, we stood by our operators during this difficult time, not only to preserve their businesses, but also to grow it significantly. 
Talk is cheap, but action is not. For this reason, we are inundated with requests as a partner of choice from all asset classes we play in. As much as I like to Zoom calls, we have been on-road throughout this pandemic meeting with prospective partners. This is bearing meaningful fruits. We have executed more partnership and pipeline deals in last 9 months than over 5 preceding years combined. 
We expect to deploy $10-plus billion of capital in these opportunities in the next few years. In other words, we are not only executing on deep value early cycle opportunities, but also laying a strong foundation of growth to the entire cycle when inevitably the significant price discrepancies of today will be gone. To give you an example, we recently re-upped our master development agreement for 5 years with Kelsey-Seybold, our largest MOB tenant. We're looking to start approximately 600,000 square feet of 100% pre-lease development in 2021 and 2022.  
Number four, talents opportunity. I touched on this last call but let me elaborate for those of you who are focused on long term. We're seeing an incredible interest in our platform from seasoned professionals to early carrier applicants. We have taken advantage of recent disruption and brought in 41 new professionals in 2020. We expect at least as many, if not more, to join our team in 2021. 
In addition to new talent, our existing talent pool is taking on more responsibilities and reaching new heights. As a result, we had 50 new promotions at Welltower. Through this some -- though this puts early pressure on G&A, which is partially offset by lower executed comp, we think this is -- this incredible talent pool is the equivalent of a coiled spring, which will manifest itself in a meaningful growth for the firm. 
Speaking of talent pool, how is the mood inside today, inside Welltower? What I described to you as the stoic resilience last year has transformed into an environment of optimism and unbridled passion this year. I want to make it abundantly clear, we have no crystal ball about the near-term operating fundamentals, but we are doing meaningful work that matters. We have meaningful relationship, and we're seeing a new level of positive energy of people who want to be part of this team internally and externally to create meaningful value and make a disproportionate impact.  
With that, I'll pass it over -- the microphone to Tim. Tim?"

My comments today will focus on our fourth quarter 2020 results, the performance of all of our investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity and finally, a balance sheet and liquidity update and our first quarter outlook.",2509,"Thank you, Shankh. My comments today will focus on our fourth quarter 2020 results, the performance of all of our investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity and finally, a balance sheet and liquidity update and our first quarter outlook.  
The fourth quarter was a tough end to a very challenging year and the ongoing impact of coronavirus accelerated meaningfully in the back half of the fourth quarter and into the beginning of 2021. The visibility for large parts of our business beyond the next 90 days remain very limited and very dependent on virus related variables, such as unpredictable group path of growth, the rollout and efficacy of the vaccine, and the continuation of population lockdown mandates. 
As a result of this uncertainty, we decided to provide our first quarter outlook this morning in place of the full year outlook we would normally provide in our fourth quarter call. As we have done over the last year, we'll continue to disclose and update information on a frequent basis, with the intention of providing a more complete outlook as soon as the variance of the virus-related variables moderate to a level that allows for reliable forecasting.  
Now turning to the quarter. Welltower reported net income attributable to common shareholders of $0.39 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $0.84 per diluted share. Normalized FFO was sequentially flat in the third quarter and the decline in seniors housing operating earnings and dilution from dispositions to close over the last 2 quarters was offset by recognition of HHS funds, lower G&A, lower interest expense and initial returns on reinvested capital.  
Now turning to our individual portfolio components. First, with our triple-net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats are reported a quarter in arrears. So these statistics reflect a trailing 12-month ending 9/30/2020, and therefore, only reflects the partial impact from COVID-19. Importantly, our collection rate remained high in the fourth quarter, having collected 97% of triple-net contractual rent due in the period.  
Starting with our senior housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI declined 2.7% year-over-year, as leases that were removed to cash recognition in prior quarters continue to comp against prior full year contractual rent received. Occupancy was down 260 basis points sequentially, consistent with the average occupancy drop from 2Q to 3Q in our RIDEA portfolio, and EBITDAR coverage decreased 0.01x on a sequential basis in this portfolio from 1.01x.  
During the quarter, we transitioned a U.K. development portfolio from triple-net to RIDEA, transitioned 14 former triple-net capital senior assets to new operators and RIDEA structures and disposed of one asset, which has a net impact of increasing coverage by 0.03x. 
Consistent with my comments in the past, our senior housing triple-net lease operators experienced similar headwinds as our RIDEA operators over the past 9 months, and we expect reported lease coverage stats to continue to reflect these challenges as more of the pandemic period is reflected in EBITDAR going forward. That being said, the resilience of this portfolio is reflected by the continued high cash collection rate is encouraging.  
As I described last quarter, we entered into an agreement with Capital Senior beginning of 2020, which allowed for an early termination of CSU leases on 24 Welltower-owned assets, in exchange for full rent being paid in 2020 in cooperation with transitioning the operations of these assets. 
We transitioned 14 properties operated by CSU to new operators in the fourth quarter, in addition to 5 that were transitioned during the third quarter. We anticipate the remaining assets to be transitioned to new operators in the first half of 2021. As a result of the continued COVID backdrop, the initial expected dilution from these conversion is expected to be approximately $0.04 per share in 2021. 
Additionally, the conversion of a development portfolio in the U.K. from triple-net to RIDEA is also expected to be negatively impact normalized FFO by $0.04 per share in 2021. The combination of these 2 transitions is expected to result in the sequential roll down of a little over $0.02 per share of normalized FFO from Q4 to Q1.  
Next, our long-term post-acute portfolio generate 2% year-over-year same-store growth. However, EBITDAR coverage declined by 0.012x sequentially to 1.0x, which was almost entirely due to deterioration in our largest long-term post-acute tenant, Genesis Healthcare. As we noted last quarter, Genesis Healthcare, which makes up approximately half of our long-term post-acute exposure, raised concerns around its ability to continue as a going concern in second quarter financials filed on August 10. 
As a result of this concern, Welltower began recording revenue and cash basis in the third quarter. Furthermore, we wrote down our unsecured loan exposure to them by $80 million in the fourth quarter. Similar to our Genesis lease income, we've been recognizing all interest on our unsecured loans on a cash basis. So this impairment does not change income recognition on these loans. Genesis remains current on all financial obligations to Welltower through January.  
And lastly, health systems, which is comprised of our ProMedica senior care joint venture with the ProMedica Health System. We had same-store NOI growth of positive 2.7% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was 2.27x. 
Turning to medical office. Our outpatient medical office portfolio delivered positive 2.1% year-over-year same-store growth, modestly below long-term trends. Growth continues to be negatively impacted by reserves for uncollected rent, the large majority of which is resulting from lease enforcement moratoriums in several California jurisdictions in which we have a sizable footprint, as I described last quarter. As these moratoriums expire, we expect rent collection to improve from the 98.5% received in the fourth quarter.  
Looking back to 2020, our outpatient medical platform displayed incredible resilience in a truly challenging year, which include periods of time which basic medical appointments and procedures were flat out not permitted. Yet, we still managed to grow same-store NOI an average of positive 1.7%. During the fourth quarter, we continued to observe improvements in several key operating trends as business continue to normalize, notably a pickup in our leasing pipeline, which would start to reflect in occupancy -- positive occupancy pickup towards the back half of 2021.  
Now turning to our senior housing operating portfolio. Before getting into this quarter's results, I want to point out that we received approximately $9 million from the Department of Health and Human Services CARES Act Provider Relief Fund and post quarter, we received another $34 million, delivering $8 million and $31 million of net expected proceeds at our share. 
We are recognizing these funds on a cash basis until they will flow through financials in the quarter in which they're received. We are normalizing these HHS funds at a same-store metrics, however, along with any other government funds received that are not matched to expenses incurred in the period they were received. In the fourth quarter, there were approximately $11.8 million of reimbursement normalized out of our same-store senior housing operating results, mainly tied to the HHS program in the U.S.  
Now turning to results of the quarter. Same-store NOI decreased 33.8% as compared to fourth quarter 2019 and decreased 11.3% sequentially from the third quarter. Starting with revenue. Sequential same-store revenue was down 2.4% in Q4, driven primarily by 160 basis point drop in average occupancy. As a reminder, we started the fourth quarter with relative optimism on the occupancy front, with improving year-over-year move in volumes and relatively low prevalence of COVID within our communities.
However, these positive trends rapidly reversed as the exponential rise in global COVID cases in November and December, by the city and statewide lockdowns and admissions bans across many of our key MSAs, particularly in the U.K. and California, which together comprise 34% of our SHO portfolio NOI. The result of this was 180 basis points of occupancy loss from November through year-end.  
As I started -- as I stated on our third quarter call, the path of COVID will dictate our business trends from the fourth quarter, not seasonality and not the seasonal flu, and that has proved quite true over the past 3.5 months.  
Turning to REVPOR in the quarter. Total show of REVPOR -- total show of portfolio REVPOR was down 1.2% year-over-year and flat sequentially. But as I described last quarter, mix shift is distorting the true picture of rent growth metrics as stand-alone year-over-year REVPOR growth for our active adult, independent living and assisted living segments were positive 3.7%, 0.5% and 1.1%, respectively. 
The combined total portfolio metric is being impacted by considerable changes in composition of occupied units in the year-over-year portfolio as lower acuity properties, independent living and senior departments have held up considerably better on the occupancy front since the start of COVID, which has had a mathematical impact of having a higher portion of our total portfolio occupied units being lower acuity and therefore, lower rent paying units, the point being, rental rates are proving more resilient across our portfolio than would appear in our aggregate reported statistics.  
And lastly, expenses. Total same-store expenses declined 2.1% year-over-year and increased 50 basis points sequentially. I'll focus on the sequential since the changes are more relevant to trends in the current operating environment. The 50 basis point increase in operating costs was driven mainly by higher sequential COVID costs as a result of the surge in cases in the fourth quarter. 
The decline in top line, combined with these expenses -- expense pressures, had a meaningful impact on our operating margins, which declined 220 basis points sequentially to 22.3%. As I noted earlier in the call, we did not include government reimbursement that was not tied to period expenses -- in period expenses in our same-store results and, therefore, COVID expenses negatively impact same-store by $18.9 million in the quarter.  
We will stay consistent with this treatment in Q1 where -- where we've already received a net $31 million in HHS fund that will likely turn COVID expenses into a net benefit, if included in our same-stores and offset.  
Looking forward to the first quarter and starting with 2021 year-to-date data we have already observed, we've experienced 180 basis point decline in occupancy through February 5. Given the still heightened presence of COVID, we expect average occupancy to be down 275 to 375 basis points from fourth quarter to first quarter. 
Note that we are providing the average occupancy as opposed to spot occupancy as the former better ties to our reported financials and therefore, 260 basis points of our expected 275 to 375 basis point decline is already baked, given the swift drop for mid-November to date in occupancy. 
We expect monthly REVPOR to be down 20 basis points sequentially, although it should be noted that actual rent per unit is up 2.1% sequentially, with mix shift, which I mentioned earlier, and 2 fewer days in the quarter, skewing reported REVPOR versus actual rent growth. Lastly, we expect total expenses to be effectively flat as higher sequential COVID costs are offset by less labor utilization due to lower occupancy levels.  
Turning to capital markets activity. Throughout 2020, we took a series of actions that were difficult, result in our ability to retain significant cash flow and ultimately, gave us greater control to navigate through the pandemic. It's worth highlighting that despite the stress endured by our business, we've avoided the destabilization of the balance sheet by borrowing to pay the dividend or being forced into raising equity or selling assets at unattractive valuations. 
Given where we sit today, the $2.1 billion of cash and over $5.1 billion of available liquidity, we are pleased with our course of actions being the most prudent way to maximize balance sheet stability and positioning us to take advantage of attractive capital deployment opportunities.  
In addition to shoring up the balance sheet, we undertook a series of actions to optimize spend and maximize retained cash flow by reducing our corporate overhead through tighter cost controls and fine-tuning of capital expenditure plans. We also made the decision in May to reduce our quarterly dividend by 30%, given the uncertainties around the pandemic's timeline and severity. 
Despite the pandemic, substantial negative impact on our business, our actions throughout 2020 removed any dependence on a quick recovery and also afforded us the opportunity to be patient with respect to the transaction market and take advantage of attractive private market valuations relative to public markets, while also highlighting the institutional demand for our high-quality portfolio.  
Over the course of the year, we sold $3.7 billion of pro rata assets at a blended 5.4% yield, including $1.3 billion of senior housing operating assets at a price per unit of $332,000 per bed. Most recently, during the fourth quarter, we sold a portfolio of senior housing operating properties operated by Northbridge, for $200 million, representing a 4.9% cap rate on March trailing 12-month NOI and $395,000 per unit. 
Also in the fourth quarter, we announced a new joint venture partnership with certain investment vehicles managed by Wafra. The joint venture comprised a portfolio of 24 outpatient medical properties previously majority-owned by Welltower. Many of these transactions were completed in the midst of significant disruption in real estate and capital markets from the long-term viability of our senior housing assets, in particular, were being called into question. 
While we are pleased with execution on the disposition front, we're excited to now be executing on the acquisition side with financial flexibility and ample liquidity. On our third quarter earnings call, Shankh described a $1 billion acquisition pipeline. And since the start of the fourth quarter, we've closed on $657 million, at a blended initial yield of 4.5%, with an expected stabilized yield over 7.5%.  
Lastly, moving to our first quarter outlook. Last night, we provided an outlook for the first quarter of net income attributable to common stockholders per diluted share of $0.24 to $0.29 and normalized cents per diluted share of $0.71 to $0.76 per share. The midpoint of our guidance, $0.735 per share, represents a sequential decline of approximately $0.105 per share from the fourth quarter. 
The $0.105 decline is composed of an $0.08 decline in senior housing operating results, driven by $0.06 of fundamental declines and $0.02 of increased COVID costs, a $0.03 per share sequential decline in triple-net senior housing NOI, a little over $0.02 of which is related to the capital senior and signature U.K. transitions mentioned earlier, with the remainder due to fundamental declines on cash recognition leases, a $0.02 per share decline related to net investment activity in Q4 and Q1 and $0.03 related to a combination of other items, mainly made up of increased G&A, income tax and a slight decline in interest income. 
These declines are offset by a 5.5% increase in pro rata HHS funds received to date in the first quarter. As a reminder, we're only guiding HHS funds we already -- that have already been received as of today's call.  
And with that, I will hand the call back over to Shankh."

As Buffett taught us, diversification may preserve wealth, but concentration builds wealth. This does not mean the path forward will be without challenges, but it is clear that we're all in on this company and that our alignment with you, our shareholders, is strong and significant.

We're focused very much on basis, structure and operators, and I expect that our blended yield of the opportunities when we talk about next quarter will actually be dragged up overall by this set of opportunities.

So I think the first and foremost, what we've seen and learned over the last 10 months is that one, cases nationally and cases in our buildings have pretty much mirrored each other. The virus has presented itself is -- it's pretty challenging to kind of keep out of anywhere. 
So I think when you talk about the macro and being cases, we're kind of speaking to both those at the same time. But we've seen both the negative and positive case counts rise and fall, start to impact our business, 30 to 45 days afterwards. And that makes sense, given thinking about kind of the sales cycle and an average kind of 30 days of a kind of start of a lead to a close. 
So what we need to see is the direction we're seeing right now in case counts to continue. We need to see likely the vaccinations that are going on at national level and in our buildings to then allow for that to be kind of held at a low level and we're seeing those things take place now. But as of today's call, we're still very much at an elevated level of cases nationally and in our building. 
So I think what we need to see is for this current level to drastically continue at the low level to sustain itself, and we'll start to see some early indicators of that if that direction continues over the next month or so. And the fundamental impact on our business would come, as I said, kind of 30, 45 days after that. 
So I think it comes down to simply the path of COVID, and it's a big reason of kind of the outlook being 1 quarter here and not full year because I think any full year outlook would essentially be just a -- more of a guidance on where the path of the virus goes, which is something that we don't think we've got a better view on than those of you in the market. So it really comes down to just COVID."

So I can put some brackets around it, just thinking through kind of pre-COVID occupancy levels. We've talked a bit this year of looking at move-ins as a percentage of pre-COVID levels and to give an idea of not only how much they declined since the start of COVID, but kind of where they sit relative to levels in 2019. 
If you were to look at kind of move in levels from April to September 2019 and compare that to move out levels we saw in the fourth quarter of this year, so just the most recent experience, which is a bit heightened relative to historical, but as you can see in our stats, it certainly is not spiking, you would see at a 100% to back to pre-COVID with demand levels, 90 to 110 basis points of occupancy increases on a monthly basis. And that's really a product of, again, demand coming back quite a bit. You look at January of 2021, and we're at 50% of prior year move-ins, so thinking about that 50% to back to pre-COVID levels, that's quite a climb from here. 
But another way to look at it is, we likely have to get back to kind of 65% of pre-COVID demand levels to get to breakeven on occupancy and then from there, build to start to gain. And just putting that in context, when COVID did come down in late summer, early fall 2020, we did see demand, as measured by move-ins, move back to kind of 70% prior year. 
So we've seen demand move back in that range during COVID pre-vaccine, but certainly, we're well below that now. So current trends on the move-in side have gotten worse. But hopefully, that gives you an idea of where that could move to if demand really comes back to pre-COVID levels in the short-term and also where we kind of need them to get to just see some stabilization of the portfolio."

If we did that, we would buy every product that we can possibly buy in the market. So I want to remind you that what we are not -- we're focused on basis so that our value creation is not dependent on our ability to pinpoint the shape of the recovery. 
It is purely dependent on what it takes to build a building. And if you can buy at a significant discount, the 2 things will happen, right? You can wait for that demand to come back. And if you can't make money at a -- obviously, at a 50% to 60% discount replacement cost, then no one will build a new building at the replacement cost because they have to charge a lot more than you. So ultimately, in any capital-heavy asset class like real estate, assuming your overall demand is increasing, ultimately, that demand/supply will balance. 
If I can't make money at discount replacement cost, you will not be able to make money by building a new one at replacement cost. This is a particularly interesting phenomena in this cycle. In most cycles, what you see is replacement -- I mean, the cost to build goes down when a recession hits because housing is white hot, replacement cost is actually spiking through this particular cycle. That keeps you even a bigger gap as we think through a cycle."

I don't believe that I've ever been critical of our peer companies. What led to the collaboration is that I reached out to my fellow CEOs, and we absolutely agree that we need to work on these industry issues and operator issues together, and I got a very warm reception. 
So that's just very simple, right? I mean it's just -- it is true that we have to work on this and there is a power in bigger numbers and we have very smart companies in our space, runed by very competent and smart management team. It is only in our interest to work together to solve these bigger issues than work alone. So that's a simple one. 
I'm not going to get into the first question. I will tell you that we are creating, as I said, we're very much focused on from an acquisition side on 2 things, right? Early cycle opportunities that, obviously, we're executing and we'll be very pleased as the year progress where that will shake out. But we're very much cognizant of the fact that early cycle opportunities, eventually, that will be gone. So if we start working on then what will eventually become is the normal cycle opportunity, it's too late. 
So we have never stopped, and it is also pretty much to be a very advantageous position to be a large company in our space, the largest company in our space, which we're expanding pretty rapidly and we didn't bat an eyelid and stopped and because we believe in the business, as I laid out. 
We are -- you have to think about it. This is a very interesting business where you have to work with other people, and you have to work with operators, you have to work with developers. In many cases, they are one and the same. And to grow, create value together, not at the expense of each other, that alignment is extremely important. And this last 9, 10 months has given us the opportunity to work with more of our operators. 
And frankly speaking, as you can see, being aligned with Welltower has created significant and is continue to create significant value for our operators whose -- if you think about if you're not aligned with a capital source that has the capability and the fierce resolve to deploy capital through this kind of disruption, then ultimately, as I said, you'll come to the other end of the cycle, and it's too late.
So I'm not going to get into what that looks like. I'll just give you one example. 600,000 square feet of 100% pre-leased MOBs. Michael, you can do the math and think about how much value creation and that is not a pipeline. That is just the start that we're sitting here today, between 2021 and 2022."

It depends, obviously, every asset is different, where you buy the asset, what basis you buy the assets is completely different. When we made that presentation, we never thought we'll be able to buy assets at a meaningful discount to replacement cost. 
If we look at pre-pandemic, health care real estate, particularly on the senior housing, usually traded at a mild to modest premium to replacement cost because the health care income has a multiple, not a real estate multiple, but it's still a multiple, right? 
So in asset class, where you're starting above some level of replacement costs, you're going to keep your pricing power really strong through the whole cycle and the next buyer analysis, you have to think about your next buyer analysis, and the next buyer has to also believe that will continue. 
That so -- that by implication, you are buying above replacement cost and you're selling above replacement cost or you're making a bet that the NOI growth -- if you're not -- NOI growth will meaningfully outstrip the cost of construction increase, right? 
So in both sides, you are at some form of above replacement costs. That equation changes completely when you can buy at a significant discount replacement cost. So if you buy $0.50 on the dollar, and at some period of normalization, you send it -- sell it at $0.100 on the dollar, you are still at a significant discount to the previous case when you make buyer analysis, it's much, much easier. Nothing has changed, except the price. And that price tells you why we're so excited about it today."

I think I'll answer in 2 ways. 
The first is on the lessons learned. Absolutely, this has made our operators look at their cost constructs in a more critical way than they probably ever could imagine, just given the pressure on occupancy and getting back to levels that, for a lot of them, look like they haven't been in since they leased up some of these assets years ago. 
We've had feedback from operators and large platforms saying they've found ways to do things on the labor front, just a lot more efficiently. And given the feedback ahead of time to what you're speaking to, that when you start to see the business come back, they think there is significant cost savings in the -- particularly, the labor model as far as getting a bit more leverage off it. 
I think on the margin side, I would hesitate to kind of speak to that from a margin expansion story just driven purely by that as of yet. As you know, there's cost in the structure right now that are being added because of COVID. We feel pretty confident a lot of these things are temporary. But given that there's 2 things to speak now, kind of a margin expansion story. We're having those costs in in the current business and having an unclear picture of when and how the kind of the virus moves away from our business, I think would be a bit aggressive. 
But I do think the margin expansion story, I'm thinking about it relative to even where we were pre pandemic. We think there's an occupancy lift story in this space, just given the demand story. And that -- the thing that makes us -- still keeps us very positive in the space that long-term demand story hasn't changed in the pandemic and certainly has been a very impactful last 9 months, 12 months to continue to be in the near future, but in the long-term, demand story stands. .
And that's going to lift occupancy, and there's a lot of operating leverage in this business even without changes to the structure. So you're going to see as kind of industry occupancies lift up over the next 3 to 5 years, I think you are going to see margins move above where they were pre-pandemic even without those operating efficiencies being put in the model."

One is that we obviously -- I would encourage you and our team would be happy to set it up to talk to Mark Shaver and our team with what we're doing on the payer provider side and -- which should help margin as well. 
The second lessons learned, I would say, not a margin point, but a separate point is one of the lessons learned, SHOP through, not just this pandemic, but through the last few years, is that you should not lend money to an entity or any type of entity where you are not willing to take the keys, right? As a REIT, we're not allowed to, obviously, own an operating company more than 35%. So we should not lend money to operating companies where we're not able to take over the asset. 
Today, we're only focused, obviously, in last few years and through this cycle, through the pandemic, we're only focused on, if we write a credit check, we only write.

And it's definitely a big part of why we're seeing today, the attractiveness of us as the capital has enhanced in the last few months or 3 quarters because we're still standing here and taking advantage of the disruption in the marketplace but also that huge effective analytics platform that we have built over many years that our partners are attracted to."

I guess first regarding REVPOR, it was encouraging to see the positive year-over-year trends in 4Q '20 in AL, IL and senior apartments in that 1% to 4% range.

I guess first regarding REVPOR, it was encouraging to see the positive year-over-year trends in 4Q '20 in AL, IL and senior apartments in that 1% to 4% range. In your walk-through of the FFO sequentially into 1Q '21, you mentioned that $0.06 hit from a fundamental decline in senior housing. I guess, I'm curious what's the REVPOR assumption within that? Does that stay positive year-over-year? Or does that start to decline?"

So when you think about on a sequential basis, that $0.06 that moves from 4Q to 1Q, effectively, if you think about like REVPOR and occupancy decline combined, you get to your revenue change sequentially. Our REVPOR is",269,"Yes. That's a good question, Steve. So when you think about on a sequential basis, that $0.06 that moves from 4Q to 1Q, effectively, if you think about like REVPOR and occupancy decline combined, you get to your revenue change sequentially. Our REVPOR is down 20 basis points, but that's driven by 2 things. 
40% of our senior housing revenue in the fourth quarter is actually from operators that receive rent on a daily basis, which is pretty common in the higher acuity side of senior living. And so just moving from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, you lose 2 days, you go from 92 days to 90 days. 
So with REVPOR being an approximation of monthly rent, your rent would go down 2.2% just from that. So there's a headwind from that on a sequential REVPOR basis. And then you've got this continued mix shift, where the occupancy, the mix shift, the makeup of revenue in the fourth quarter versus first quarter, again, you're seeing a higher occupancy fall off in the higher acuity segments of our portfolio, which pay higher rent. 
So in combination of those 2 things is the REVPOR from how that impacts kind of total revenue is down 20 basis points. But if you look at on a per day, per unit rent, we're up 2.1% in the fourth quarter relative to the first quarter, and it's actually pretty strong sequential growth and it's driven mainly by roughly half of our operators also have Jan 1 increasers. So those increasers pushed through on Jan 1 and that's helped kind of rent growth."

I'm assuming you're asking about the difference between senior housing triple-net versus senior housing operating. So look, given where the cycle is, I want to be a majority being the equity position or in the RIDEA side, but there are opportunities to strip white capital in the senior housing -- in a triple-net side if you have assets that are stabilized and you can buy it cheap enough that the last dollar of the lease is still in a place where the operators can make money and we can make money. 
There, obviously, you can create a lot of bells and whistles and for the operators have a second bite of the apple. So there's ways you can create that alignment. But remember, if you simplistically think about RIDEA as an equity exposure and a lease is more of a credit exposure, you can create value, if, a, from our side, if the buildings have stabilized or near stabilization. 
And you buy it cheap enough that your last dollar is still a pretty low rent relative to what the cash flow of the buildings look like, then you can create value. But that's how we think about it. That's how our operators think about it and so we have found 2 opportunities to do leases. 
If we do find more opportunities, we'll do it. But I can tell you that the industry is moving away, at least we are moving away, from very tightly covered leases. Today, we're thinking about there should be even more marginal safety. And when we find opportunities where we're buying so cheap that we can, that's when we're going for it."

I hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy during these extraordinary times. I'll make some introductory comments on the state of senior housing business, our ongoing alignment efforts with our operating partners, and we will also provide a detailed perspective on our current thoughts related to capital allocation. Tim will then get into detailed operating and financial results. 
We are cautiously optimistic on the senior housing business with greenshoots emerging in U.S. and U.K. While it is too early to raise an all fear flag as another COVID resurgence can never be ruled out, we're delighted to report an occupancy increase of 120 bps in U.K. and 90 bps in U.S. over the past 6 weeks. Despite growing optimism in U.S. and U.K., performance in Canada has remained somewhat weak due to an increased COVID cases across many regions. PAUSE While most residents within our Canadian senior housing properties have been vaccinated, the rollout to the broader population has lagged meaningfully due to lockdown in certain areas within Ontario and Québec, move in stores and visitation have been highly restricted, which has ultimately led to an occupancy loss of 50 basis points since mid-March. This trend has improved in April. Despite the drag from Canada, the move in activity in March is higher than the last non-COVID impacted month of February of 2020. 
In addition, as I have described in past quarters, rates continue to hold. As adjusted for 2020 leap year, AL rates are up 1.6%, IL rates are up 0.7%, mostly dragged down by the Canadian business. Senior apartments and wellness housing rates are up 6.3%. Our operators across the board are seeing broad momentum that continued to build, irrespective type, geography, activity, this is the most optimistic tone I've heard from our operating partners in a long time. We're even seeing the lifestyle driven customers are starting to come back, which frankly surprised me in a positive way. 
Fundamental results have exceeded our expectations in Q1, and we're anticipating strong momentum in Q2. While we continue to avoid speculation on what the arc of the recovery may look like, we have provided additional disclosure on the additional LOI and earnings power of our portfolio assuming a return to 2019 level of NOI for our stable portfolio and adding incremental NOI from our filler portfolio. We believe this results in additional $480 million of NOI. And remember, this assumes a return to 2019 level of occupancy and margin, and it does not assume a return to frictional vacancy or any rate growth since Q4 of 2019. We're seeing something similar happening in the private market. While current cash flow multiples of what we are buying might be high as compared to what we're willing to pay 2 to 3 years ago, this is a moot point. We're paying a much lower multiple and a stabilized cash flow as evidenced by a much lower price per unit. While in most other asset classes, this could be a matter of opinion, I believe in real estate it is a simple business where you can obtain a very granular view of price per unit and how this compares to replacement cost. While we can sit here and debate how different assets and portfolio prices compared to prices per unit 2 to 3 years ago, replacement costs are shooting upwards With a white hot housing market driving construction costs exponentially higher in recent quarters. This phenomena is now spilling into other material costs due to a $2 trillion infrastructure plan announced by the Biden administration. As costs continue to rise, the market clearing rent to achieve minimum acceptable return is also ratcheting up. However, those returns are not going to be easy to achieve. 
Today, as much of the senior housing industry effectively remains a lease-up mode, given the impact of COVID on occupancy. If this was not enough, now the interest rate curve is backing up, creating further pressure on developers pro forma. This backdrop clearly is unique to the current cycle, which we believe will result in meaningfully lower new starts in near to medium term. The supply outlook, along with already rising demographic growth in the first half of the decade gives us confidence that we'll achieve the level of asset performance that we provided. Although I have nothing to add in terms of the timing and/or the trajectory of the recovery, our analysis was done one asset at a time, and I hope you will find this new disclosure useful. 
During the first quarter, we continued our effort to create greater alignment of interest with our operating partners by restructuring several relationship constructs. And as we mentioned on our last call, we have made structural changes to several senior housing agreements. I would also like to highlight some recently announced strategic transactions with Genesis and ProMedica, with elements of both deals reflects our approach to value creation for our shareholders. First, Genesis. As we announced last month, after 10 years, we have substantially exited our Genesis real estate relationship through a series of transactions, which meaningfully derisked our cash flow stream going forward. Effectuating this nearly $900 million a transaction wasn't easy. It involved a skilled nursing operator deeply impacted by COVID-19 pandemic, the transitional access to local and regional operators working through our outstanding loans to Genesis, at the same time, creating opportunity for Welltower to participate in the post COVID recovery in post acute fundamentals. 
Ultimately, we executed a mutually beneficial transaction for Genesis and Welltower shareholders. PAUSE For Genesis, the transaction resulted in a meaningful deleveraging of its balance sheet, which will help you to reposition the company post COVID-19. And for Welltower, we're able to execute the transaction at a par bid value of $144,000 and generated an 8.5% unlevered return over the full term of Genesis relationship. And upon the repayment of the outstanding debt, that return will rise to 9% with even further upside potential from participating preferred and the equity position. 
We believe that this represents a very favorable outcome for the shareholders, Welltower shareholders, particularly in light of challenging environment that we have faced in the post-acute sector and then COVID-related pandemic induced downside we have seen. While transactions will result in some near-term earnings dilution for Welltower, we expect to create significant value for our shareholders following the deployment of the $745 million of anticipated proceeds over a range of high-quality opportunity that I'll discuss shortly. 
Since our announcement last month, Genesis has received an infusion of equity capital and named a specialist in Harry Wilson as CEO. We wish the team of Genesis much success in the future as we have substantially exited a challenging legacy structure with Genesis, I hope our shareholders appreciate the favorable ultimate outcome. As we have done with several operating relationship over the last few years and discussed on various calls, our team embraced complexity, fixed creative solutions, doesn't run away from their problems and situations where the choices may be imperfect and ultimately work tirelessly to fulfill our commitment to our owners, operating partners and employees. 
Second, ProMedica. We announced 2 transactions to strengthen and expand our relationship with ProMedica, which will enhance the quality of our joint venture position and continued growth. The first transaction involved $265 million sale of 25 skilled nursing assets with an average age of 41 years, which will result in an immediate improvement to the quality of the portfolio. At the same time, we also crystallized a 22% unlevered IRR over 2.5 years of ownership of the asset, which is a true reflection of the power of our value-oriented investment philosophy. We at Welltower firmly believe that basis not yield or cap rates determines investment success. 
Through a separate transaction, we are pleased to maintain an 80% stake in our state of the art assets Which has been contributed to our 80/20 joint venture with ProMedica. ProMedica has already assumed the operations of these assets, which have been rebranded as ProMedica Senior Care. PAUSE This successful transaction is yet another example of our focus on improving quality and growth profile of our portfolio while doing so at favorable economic terms to all stakeholders. ProMedica team is making progress in developing new relationship with other health systems as a provider of choice as Promedica represents the premium not-for-profit provider at the leading age of health care evolution. We're hopeful that we'll be able to deploy far direct creative capital with this innovative partner of ours. 
Speaking of accretive capital deployment, we are pleased to share with you that we have closed in excess of $1.3 billion of acquisitions year-to-date with very -- with very attractive unlevered IRR, in particular, extremely happy to announce that we have partnered with a Safanad led investment group to recapitalize HC-One, the largest and most reputable operator of care homes communities in U.K. Our investment in excess of $800 million comes in form of first mortgage debt on HC-One's real estate and equity in recapitalization. We also received significant warrants that would further allow us to participate in the post COVID upside that we are confident that management in process of executing. HC-One will add a value option to our high-end focused U.K. platform. This is significant -- there is significant opportunity to upgrade the asset base, operating platform and people in this portfolio, and we have tremendous confidence in James and David to fulfill their mission to deliver the highest quality care, along with the residents and employee satisfaction. 
In recent weeks, HC-One has experienced the same positive occupancy momentum as our broader U.K. portfolio, gaining 90 bps of occupancy from the March 2021 trough. Our debt investment represents the last found exposure of just $40,000 far unit and important statistic given our unrelenting focus on basis. This basis also represents a significant discount to replacement costs, in addition to the upside from equity and warrants. We think this is an extraordinary risk-adjusted return story. We believe we'll be able to generate low to mid-teens on IRR from this transaction, while adding a highly [Audio Gap] to fill a gap that we have in our portfolio in the U.K. With acquisitions, patience is a virtue and so is occasional boldness. Since we mentioned in our October call, the moment of boldness is here, we have closed in excess of $1.8 billion of acquisitions. The initial yield of this whole tranche is 6.8%, but we expect it will stabilize at a significantly higher number. When while the environment was very uncertain then, and we didn't give into institutional imperative about headline pressures, and we relied on independent thinking and resilience of our team. 
We remain very bullish on acquisition opportunities and have several attractive deals under contract currently and a highly visible pipeline, which we think we'll be able to execute through year-end. 
While our focus continues to be on the right asset with the right basis and with the right operator, I'm hopeful that our 2021 class of acquisition will be immediately accretive to 2022 earnings and will be significantly accretive to 2023 and beyond. 
Lastly, I will address a very interesting question I have received from an investor post our last call. I was asked why we have such an emphasis on partner selection and whether it would be better off vertically integrating. We think this is an excellent question that deserves some reflecting for a moment. Notwithstanding with the RIDEA law in senior housing, we believe we're better off in the ecosystem of partners and implementing an industrial view of vertical integration. That view is rooted in our belief that the combination of centralized capital allocation and decentralized execution creates the best long-term return. PAUSE We believe this strategy of decentralized execution relates to energy and keeps politics and costs at bay. This is especially important in real estate, which is profoundly a local business. However, overall, we are happy with our execution so far in the year to create partial value for our shareholders, but by no means we are satisfied. We are cautiously optimistic about the fundamental environment and excited about our opportunity to acquire assets, create new relationships and attract quality challenges. 
With that, I'll pass it over to Tim. Tim?"

My comments today will focus on our first quarter 2021 results, the performance of our investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity, and finally, a balance sheet and liquidity update, in addition to an outlook for the second",2267,"Thank you, Shank. My comments today will focus on our first quarter 2021 results, the performance of our investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity, and finally, a balance sheet and liquidity update, in addition to an outlook for the second quarter. After a year defined by infection protocols, move in restrictions and incredible operating challenges for our partners, we started 2021 in arguably the most challenging environment yet. With case counts hitting new highs across all 3 of our geographies and operating restrictions moving up in lockstep. Towards the end of February, the vaccine rollout hit its stride and nearly 80% of our facilities had their second vaccine finished. Case counts across the portfolio dropped precipitously, and we started to see the early signs of stabilization. The effectiveness and rapid deployment of vaccines within our communities are just starting to be felt across our resident population. And while we are encouraged by the last 6 weeks of recovery in the U.S. and U.K., significant uncertainty remains with respect to the prevalence of the virus amongst the general population, the timing of the reopening of the economy, and the timing of further rollbacks of operating restrictions, especially with respect to our Canadian portfolio. The result is a near-term operating environment that, although notably improved, remains highly unpredictable in the short term. 
As a result of this uncertainty, like last quarter, we provided a 1 quarter outlook with our results last night. As we have done over the past 14-plus months, we will continue to disclose and update information on a frequent basis with the intention of providing a more complete outlook as soon as the virus-related variables moderate to a level that allows for more reliable forecasting. 
Now turning to the quarter. Welltower reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.17 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $0.80 per diluted share versus guidance of $0.71 to $0.76 per share. When providing guidance last quarter, we also provided expectations for $31 million of HHS provider relief funds we received in the quarter. We ended up recognizing approximately $34.7 million of HHS funds, along with $2.5 million of out-of-period payments for similar programs in Canada. Removing the impact of these funds, along with the $3.5 million termination fee that was received in 1 of our senior housing management company investments, which was not contemplating guidance, our normalized FFO moves to $0.70 per share. 
Therefore, on an apples-to-apples basis, we came out $0.01 above the top end of our HHS adjusted prior guidance of $0.64 to $0.69 per share. Now turning to our individual portfolio components. First, our triple-net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats reported 1 quarter in years. So these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 12/31?2020. Importantly, our collection rate for rent remained high in the first quarter, having collected 96% of triple net contractual rent due in the period. 
Starting with our senior housing triple-net portfolio. Same-store decline 2% year-over-year as leases that we moved the cash recognition in prior quarters continue to comp against the prior year full contractual rent received. EBITDAR coverage decreased 0.01 times on a sequential basis in the portfolio to 1.00. During the quarter, we transitioned the remaining 5 capital senior assets, moving one to triple-net structure under a new operator and the other 4 to various structure with CSU until transition. We also completed the transition of 4 properties leased by Hearth management to Storypoint under a new lease agreement. These transitions had a net positive impact of 0.02x in total portfolio coverage. 
Next, our long-term post new portfolio generated positive 0.2% year-over-year same-store growth and EBITDAR coverage increased 0.37x sequentially to 1.37x. As 51 of the 79 Genesis assets began operator transitions. 23 assets have already transitioned as of this call, including 9 former Powerback properties, which moved to ProMedica Senior Care. Pro forma for the already completed ProMedica JV, Genesis Healthcare represents less than 90 basis points of our total in place NOI. And long-term post-acute will be reduced to 6% of total NOI. 
And lastly, health systems, which is comprised by ProMedica Senior care joint venture with the ProMedica Health System. We had same-store NOI growth of positive 2.8% year-over-year and trailing 12 EBITDAR coverage was 1.9x. 
Before turning to outpatient medical, I want to highlight a disclosure change we made to our presentation of occupancy in our supplemental disclosure. Historically, we reported occupancy to 100% ownership. But going forward, we will present both at Welltower's pro rata share to better reflect Welltower's ownership economics. This has no impact on NOI, which has always been presented at Welltower share. We have footnoted the occupancy levels, if presented a 100% ownership in both the senior housing operating and medical office portion of our supplement. 
Now turning to our outpatient medical portfolio, which delivered positive 3.1% year-over-year same-store growth, as cash rent growth and higher platform profitability combined to producing acceleration in NOI growth. Tenant retention continued to be strong at 87.7% in the quarter, as we executed renewals on more than 540,000 square feet of space in the quarter, our highest amount ever reported. Additionally, we've also seen the length of term on executed renewal increases compared to last year. Also in the quarter, we completed our second joint venture with Invesco Real Estate for a portfolio of outpatient medical assets and completed our first with Wafra. Our ability to form joint ventures with best-in-class capital partners over the last 2 years has allowed us to maintain scale and more importantly, the tenant relationships generated from our in-house asset management platform. At the same time, we diversified our access to capital during a period of significant capital market turbulence. We look forward to growing these relationships further going forward. 
Now turning to our senior housing operating portfolio. Before getting into this quarter's results, I want to point out that we received approximately $35 million from our Department of Health and Human Services Cares Act provider relief fund. As we've done in the past quarters, the funds are recognized on a cash basis, and as such, will flow through financials in the quarter they are received. We're normalizing these HHS funds out of same store metrics, however, along with any other government funds received they're not matched expenses occur in the period they received. In the first quarter, there were approximately $33.8 million of reimbursement normalized out of our same-store senior housing operating results, mainly tied to the HHS program in the U.S. 
now turning to results for the quarter. Same-store NOI decreased 44% as compared to first quarter 2020 and decreased 15.6% sequentially from the fourth quarter. Sequential same-store revenue was down 3.6% in Q1, driven primarily by a 310 basis point drop in average occupancy versus our guidance midpoint of 325 basis points. 
Turning to REVPOR in the quarter. Show portfolio REVPOR was down 1.5% year-over-year, but mix shift and an extra day of rent in the comparable leap year quarter are distorting the true picture of rent growth metrics as over 40% of our revenue is derived on a per name basis. When adjusting for the leap year, total portfolio REVPOR growth moves to negative 1%. And breaking out our individual segments, our active adult independent Living and assisted living segments reported year-over-year growth of positive 6.3%, positive 0.7% and positive 1.6%, respectively. 
As I mentioned in the past few quarters, the combined total portfolio metric is being impacted by considerable change the composition of occupied units in the year-over-year portfolio. Our lower acuity properties comprised of independent living and senior departments held up considerably better on the occupancy front front since the start of COVID, which has the mathematical impact of having a higher portion of our total portfolio occupied units being lower acuity and therefore, lower rent paying units. Rental rates are proving resilient, more resilient across our portfolio than would appear in our aggregate reported statistics. 
Lastly, expenses. Total same-store expenses declined 2.6% year-over-year and decreased 20 basis points sequentially. I'll focus on sequential since the changes are more relevant to trends in the current operating environment. The 20 basis point sequential decline in operating costs was driven mainly by lower COVID cover cost as case counts dropped dramatically in March. The meaningful decline in our top line, combined with these expense pressures had a significant impact to our operating margins, which declined 280 basis points sequentially to 19.4%. As I noted earlier in the call, we not include government reimbursement that was not tied to parity expenses. And therefore, COVID expenses negatively impacted same-store by $14.8 million. We are not factoring any HHS funds into our second quarter outlook. 
Looking forward to the second quarter, and starting with the April quarter-to-date data we've already observed, we've experienced 20 basis point through April 23, with the U.S., U.K. up 40 and 90 basis points, respectively, while Canada is down 20 basis points. While we are encouraged by the recovery in the U.S. and U.K. and are hopeful that the effectiveness of the vaccines has put a floor underneath operating results, we remain cautious on projecting an acceleration in recent trends, given the lack of historical precedents and uncertainty of reopening trend, particularly in Canada. On a spot basis, we are currently projecting a 130 basis point increase in occupancy from March 31 through June 30. We expect monthly REVPOR to be plus 1.2% sequentially, although adjusting for the extra day in 2Q versus 1Q reduced to plus 70 basis points sequentially. Lastly, we expect total expenses to be effectively flat. As increases in operating costs from higher occupancy should be offset by a reduction in COVID related expenses. 
Turning to capital market activity. We continue to execute on our strategy of maximizing balance sheet stability. We're maintaining flexibility to position us to take advantage of attractive capital deployment opportunities. In March, we issued $750 million of senior unsecured notes due June 2031, bearing an interest rate of 2.8% and used these proceeds to redeem all remaining senior unsecured notes due 2023. 
As a result, we were able to extend all senior unsecured debt maturities to 2024 and beyond, extend our weighted average maturity profile for nearly 8 years. We also extinguished $42 million of secured debt at a blended average interest rate of 7.6% in the quarter. In February, we highlighted a robust pipeline of capital deployment opportunities. As these transactions materialize, and the pipeline has grown, we've utilized our forward ATM program, selling 3.7 million shares of common stock to date at an initial average weighted price of $73.43 per share. These shares will generate future gross proceeds of approximately $272 million, and along with $1 billion of cash from our balance sheet, will enable us to officially capitalize our highly visible pipeline of capital deployment opportunities. 
Moving on to leverage. We ended the quarter at 6.59x net debt to adjusted EBITDA, a 31 basis point increase over the previous quarter as underlying cash flows continue to be pressured by the impact of COVID. While transactions closed in the second quarter will result in a slight increase in leverage, after adjusting for expected proceeds from assets held for sale and $272 million proceeds from the forward sale of common stock, we expect leverage to settle in the high 6s before the ramp in senior housing cash flows begin to naturally drive leverage lower in the coming quarters. 
Speaking of recovery, Shankh spoke earlier about the magnitude of potential cash flow growth from just returning to pre COVID levels of margins and occupancy in our senior housing operating portfolio. This will have a significantly positive impact on cash flow based leverage metrics. And although the duration of this recovery remains highly uncertain, the inflection point this quarterly is optimistic that it has begun. And our demonstrated ability to access significant equity proceeds through asset sales, even in the most difficult times, along with our return the equity market since last quarter, leaves us confident that we'll be able to keep the balance sheet in a position of strength as a natural deleveraging when the senior housing recovery returns us to well within our historical target levels in the not-too-distant future. 
Lastly, moving to our second quarter outlook. Last night, we provided an outlook for the second quarter of net income attributable to common stockholders per diluted share of $0.31 to $0.36. And normalized FFO per diluted share of $0.72 to $0.77 per share. As I noted earlier, this guidance does not take into consideration any further HHS funds or similar government programs in the U.K. and Canada. So when comparing sequentially to our first quarter normalized FFO per share, use a $0.70 per share number I mentioned earlier in my comments, which excludes the benefits of these programs as well. On this comparison, the midpoint of our second quarter guidance of $0.745 per share represents a $0.045 sequential increase from 1Q. The $0.045 increase is composed of a $0.02 increase per share increase from our senior housing operating portfolio, driven by an increase in sequential average occupancy and expected reduction in COVID costs, a $0.025 per share increase in net investment activity as strong post quarter investments is offsetting the initial dilution from loan reductions and operator transitions related to Genesis. A $0.01 increase in NOI from triple-net and outpatient medical segments, and this is offset by the expected $0.01 increase in sequential G&A, driven mainly by new hires. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Shankh."

And so people want to know what the snapback is going to look like. 
My estimates are down 30% versus pre COVID because of all this noise. And so I guess the way I would ask the question is, if you can't give trajectory, what would disappoint you in terms of getting back to square one. Would you say, ""Boy, if we're not there in 2 years, that would be quite a disappointment."" Can you kind of triangulate at least a range of expectations as opposed to committing to one."

I hope you don't have to wake up at 6 a.m. to be first in ear. But I'll just address the question, is any definitive answer for our end is as much of a guess from us as it is from you, right?

But I'll just address the question, is any definitive answer for our end is as much of a guess from us as it is from you, right? So just understand there's no historical precedence to what's going on. We're simply telling you, if we go back asset by asset to where the NOI of these assets were, it's an important exercise because we have sold a lot of assets, bought a lot of assets, so it's very hard for you to figure out from our supplement what the number looks like. So we try to answer that question that if we just went back for the stabilized pool of assets to Q4 of '19, what will the NOI look like? 
And we add the filler portfolio and stabilize that, what does that combined look like. Now I cannot answer the question, whether it's 2 years or 4 years or it's -- you've got to really put that in the context and your expectation. However, I will say this, and it's a very important point. It is to a Q4 2019 rent level a.k.a. that if you assume that this we expanded out, let's just say it will take 4 years from today to get to that stabilized level of NOI. So it's going to stabilize in 2026. You have to assume the rent of the business remains flat to achieve that NOI, right, which we don't think obviously is happening. 
We have continued to say that we expect that rent growth will hold up. Right? So you might get it later, but you will get x number of years of rent growth to get added to that. Obviously, that rent growth has a contribution margin that's very high and it falls to the bottom line. On the other hand, if we say, okay, we're going to get that earlier, you are not going to get as much rent growth. You will only get, just say that you decide that you're going to get there in 2 years, right, I'm making this up. And 2 years up, so you will only get the rent growth from '19 to '23 instead of '19 to '26. So I'm pointing out that there are many levers here that you have to think through. 
The longer gestation period will bring you ultimately a higher number because of the rent growth aspect that I'm talking about versus the shorter. And that's all I'm willing to say right now. I can guess, but it is a guess. We're underwriting assets in a way that, frankly speaking, we don't need to know. That's why we're so focused on basis. If you look at our stock, it's a real estate company. You can look at what the basis looks like on a price per unit basis, and then go and think about what it takes to build that portfolio. You will see that portfolio trade had a significant discount to what it takes to build it today."

So right now, we're seeing 140 basis points below -- we were 1,400 basis points below where we were pre COVID on occupancy front. So you've just got substantially lower number of residents in the building. So if you run a kind of historical churn levels, it obviously changes occupancy builds and then move outs start to kind of match historical levels. But as historical churn levels, you should be running at around 80% of kind of indexed historical levels of move outs. If that gets elevated a bit, we've talked about this from a higher acuity resident moving in during COVID. That probably moves to mid to upper 80s. But that can stay, I think, pretty consistent through the recovery. It is tough looking at the last kind of 6 months ticking through what has been natural move-outs and what's been really -- certainly a spike we've seen from COVID in the December, January, February period. I think what you're starting to see in March is a return to that kind of 80% level that we would expect. 
Again, giving historical type of churn. But it's certainly something we're watching pretty closely. But from just a level of kind of the comment I made last quarter was from a level of occupancy in the buildings. That move out percentage, getting back to historical levels of 2019 levels of move-ins, you can drive 80, 90 basis points a month in occupancy by just getting back there because the move-outs are going to be lower, purely mathematically based off the occupancy level."

We also give you the basis which we invested a majority of that capital, the equity basis is slightly higher, but it's a substantial discount to replacement cost as well. So to hit those IRRS, you don't really need much of a expansion of multiple. What you need is the EBITDA to come back, which we think the management is already executing. And we've noted that the occupancy is already moving in the right direction. I'm not going to break out the specific part. You know that we do not believe in yields and cap rates determining investment success. We believe basis and IRRs get to the investment success and are consistent with that. 
And that's what we are willing to provide."

I think you referenced your underwriting, if I'm correct, differently or not to a set time and you don't need it because of the basis. But I just asked that because your math that you described here, obviously, talks about pre COVID levels.

First is the $10 billion number I mentioned, obviously, is a multiyear opportunity, not a 1-year opportunity, right? So I just want to clarify that. But you're right in that expansion with obviously expanding with HC-One, this transaction expands that opportunity. I want you to understand, as I've said in my prepared remarks, that this investment is not just a financial investment, it's a strategic investment. 
And we looked at the company, its footprint, its , and we see an opportunity that fills a big hole in our portfolio. Our portfolio in U.K. is very focused on high end, and we didn't have the value option. And there is a tremendous opportunity to grow in that value option, which we think we'll be able to execute through the HC-One platform. We structured the investment in the 3 tranches that we talked about. We don't go into an investment thinking we'll do debt, we'll do equity, we'll do MEZ or participating equity or. That's not how we think about it. We just look at an opportunity first. Think about what is the first asset opportunity and strategic opportunities, then think about how we get to invest capital so that we can be aligned with our partners. That's a very different approach than it's an asset, and we've got to buy it, are we going to lend to it. That's just not how we take. 
And it is the right risk-adjusted return. You look at an asset or a collection of assets or portfolio and you think about what -- where in the capital structure even the best risk of return for your investors. Remember, there are different investors in the, obviously, the spectrum of this transaction. There is $235 million of equity on top of us, which obviously Safanad led investment group that includes Spanning and others, they're obviously bringing in, and they think there's an extraordinary opportunity to create value for their capital, right? 
So that's a very important point. Now going back to the -- sort of the pipeline, the pipeline is primarily today is senior housing, and the pipeline is very much what we talked about. It's significant. It's very robust. It's large. And it reflects a very significant discount to replacement cost. We're not going to sit here and tell you that we believe that every deal we'll do, we'll have this kind of return that we have described in HC-One, but as said before, that we think we can hit high single-digit to low double-digit IRR, and that environment is still here. We don't necessarily, given our cost of capital, need to hit that. But we're still seeing many, many, many opportunities that we have under contract today, that will get to you to that kind of return, which is in the high single digit, low double-digit type of IRR. Hope that helps."

If you don't come in vaccinated, then you do have quarantining. But you've seen through the success of the vaccination of the over 65 population in the U.S. and largely majority of move-ins now that we're seeing come in vaccinated and you're eliminating that quarantine period.

So that's how we thought about it. This is not an opportunistic investment. This is a strategic investment. If you look at our portfolio, you will see majority of our U.K. portfolio is kind of in that GBP 1,400 -- GBP 1,350, GBP 1,400 per week to GBP 1,600 plus per week kind of. That's our sweet spot.

So it's a win at the end. I will tell you 1 thing, though. I would highly encourage you not to look at 1 quarter or 1 month of labor costs and projecting there. This is a lot of noise and volatility around the fact that a lot of people have received the stimulus check, and that has impacted short term. We do not believe that will be sustained as the sort of this dries up. However, you are right that labor cost inflation will remain, but it will not be what you see in other sectors, because what you are seeing in other sectors, such as lodging and all the sectors, they have laid off all their employees, they shutdown, right? That was the case. For us, our communities have never shut down. They continue to employ our -- obviously, because to take care of our residents, and that continues. Is it -- is there no issue? Absolutely not, will remain so. I would also encourage you to think about the potential immigration changes that is -- we're hearing about. Obviously, I know it less -- probably less than you do, but that also has an offsetting impact.

So I think the right way to think about it is, it has been a main focus win for us. And it seems to be for investors as well. But I think in the triple-net senior housing portfolio, around 20% of that in-place rent is now cash. So it pretty much reflects the underlying economics in those buildings. We have been pretty quick to move the cash when we have tenants that are not paying rent. So I think looking at our in-place, looking at our coverage metrics, those are tenants that are current on rent paying us and very much are doing so because of their long-term belief in their business. 
And if anything, I think what we've seen in the first quarter from the start of a recovery, enhances that belief that there will be -- there won't be much impairment here. I think the other thing here is, I think, the difference between cash flow and value. And the underlying assets, I think you're seeing this across the board, are holding value. So the impairment to cash flow, I think, is short term. That speaks to the view there's a recovery.

And we have to assume that people will do things that is economically beneficial to them. If you look at how much the costs have changed, let's just say -- let's just talk about cost in the last 3 years. You have places in the coast, costs are probably up 20-plus percent, low 20%. And if you look at some of the locations in Dallas, Charlotte, Nashville, cost is up between 30% and 35%. The housing market is very significantly impacting not just the cost of lumber, which is everybody is talking about, but the cost and availability of labor. Right? So if you -- that's sort of one big impact and a development model is a highly leveraged model, right? So if you thought you're going to make 7% yield on cost and suddenly now looks like 5%, you are in trouble. But on the other hand, if you see what's going on, interest rate is backing up in a highly leveraged model. But definition development is a high leveraged model, with construction loans, et cetera. What you have is now interest rates backing up. So it's farther eating into your pro forma. And those 2 combinations, assuming people don't develop for fun, they want to develop to make money, that proposition is increasingly becoming very difficult. This is an industry-wide comment. This is not -- I'm not suggesting, see if you can go and develop a building in a given location and can't make money. That's not the point. 
As an industry wide, it is becoming much more difficult. And assuming people who want to develop to make money, that proposition is getting much, much harder. I'm not even talking about availability of debt capital, et cetera. The attractiveness of the model has been meaningfully hit in last, call it, 3 years, particularly last 12 months, as housing has just gone parabolic. So in that context, we think there will be, obviously, a lot less supply than it has been in the, call it, between '15 to '19. Also the '15 to '19, sort of the supply boom was, frankly, was created by a lot of the players, including our company, was paid $1.20, $1.5 on the dollar on the basis. I do not see those participants in the industry anymore. People are very, very -- people who're involved in buying assets today, they're very focused on the right basis. And a lot of the sort of the take out premium is meaningfully gone from the industry as well. So if we put all of those things together, we think that it is reasonable to expect. You can never accurately forecast what the future will look like. It is reasonable to expect that supply in next 5 years will be a lot less than last 5 years, but it is yes, nonetheless. 
And we do think that will impact the rent growth, which is the point I was trying to make on the 480, is that is the beauty of basis. I highly encourage all of you to look at what is the in-flight per basis value of Welltower. And if you have to make at that basis a number, what rent do you need, versus what it takes to build and to make some minimum acceptable return, call it, 7%, whatever you think is the development yield should be and what is the rent. And you will see what it takes to build on our -- today in our company, there's a huge gap between the potential rent, what's potential to bring new supply versus what you can get?

So there are many ways you can do this. If you keep the assets under lease, you can give obviously short-term rate and -- but you can create 2 years out, 3 years out, depending on the level of EBITDA. You can do all bells",581,"Yes. That's a very good question. So there are many ways you can do this. If you keep the assets under lease, you can give obviously short-term rate and -- but you can create 2 years out, 3 years out, depending on the level of EBITDA. You can do all bells and vessels to recoup that rent as cash flow comes back. And that's the point we're trying to make. Remember this is -- cash flow is now starting to come back, right? So that's sort of if you retain it, obviously, in the lease. Remember, these leases are not -- there's nothing behind the leases. There's a propco interest sits behind the leases. So you have a value protection. If you go to RIDEA, right, we are not afraid just to get -- take a rent stance and if that is what, what is the sustainable level of rent from the sustainable level of production, right? You saw that we bought a new -- we did -- we bought a bunch of new assets in the quarter -- reported quarter where we did a triple-net. It was a highly respected operator. In that particular case, you would say, why didn't they do a RIDEA? Because if you look at in that portfolio, what we bought, the rent before us was substantially higher, right, 50% higher, that you are paying to the previous landlord. 
Our rent is much lower. We set it in a way. But then we have some sort of a catch-up. Our rent goes up, not by 3%, but as the EBITDA comes back significantly, and the EBITDA is already moving in that direction. We have a provision to get some more rent. It is also for the operator, at some point, they were paying 50% higher rent. And they will end up probably paying from the current rent level, 10% more, 15% more, but they will keep rest of the cash flow, right? So it works out on both sides. Why does it works out on both sides. Because the basis is lower. The issue is not -- a lease is fundamentally a form of a leverage and if you put a basis in the assets so much higher, and then you put a high LTV loan or high LTV credit for the lease, you are kind of creating problems from two ends. In this case, it's a very low basis that helps both parties, the owner as well as the operators to make money going forward. 
Going back to your specific question, there's a lot of collateral that sits behind these leases from this specific issue that Juan and Connor, and now you're asking about. This particular operator, which is one of the most respected operators in our space, has a substantial amount of propco interest that they have created through a very significant development machine through '90s. And that propco interest sits behind that lease. So let's just say, you can do it from a lease. This is just a statement or you can go to a RIDEA, right? If you go to a RIDEA, right. If you go to a RIDEA the ownership will change and will reflect the fact that their future liability is lower, a.k.a. we lost an asset. And we have acted that, backed lease, and we have an opportunity in that restructuring to own more of the real estate, not the same amount. That's the way to think about it."

So on one hand, you're implying a lot of optimism about getting back to an occupancy number, which is much higher than where you are right now. Yet you're not really willing to commit to an occupancy range on the year. 
And I guess I'm just wondering what is giving you confidence that you're going to get back to a higher occupancy level. I mean the 20 basis points of April occupancy benefit seems like it's a smaller number than what you were talking about with your weekly benefit when you put out a presentation earlier this month. So I'm just trying to -- I'm just wondering if there's something that you can point to, you have a backlog of pent-up demand that you're learning from prospective residents that going to increase move-ins as you get into the third quarter and beyond?

I hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy during these extraordinary times.

I hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy during these extraordinary times. I'll make some introductory comments on the state of senior housing business, our ongoing alignment efforts with our operating partners, and we will also provide a detailed perspective on our current thoughts related to capital allocation. Tim will then get into detailed operating and financial results. 
We are cautiously optimistic on the senior housing business, with green shoots emerging in U.S. and U.K. While it is too early to raise an all-clear flag as another COVID resurgence can never be ruled out, we're delighted to report an occupancy increase of 120 bps in U.K. and 90 bps in U.S. over the past 6 weeks. Despite growing optimism in U.S. and U.K., performance in Canada has remained somewhat weak due to an increased COVID cases across many regions. While most residents within our Canadian senior housing properties have been vaccinated, the rollout to the broader population has lagged meaningfully due to lockdown in certain areas within Ontario and Québec, move-ins, tours and visitation have been highly restricted, which has ultimately led to an occupancy loss of 50 basis points since mid-March. This trend has improved in April. Despite the drag from Canada, the move-in activity in March is higher than the last non-COVID impacted month of February of 2020. 
In addition, as I have described in past quarters, rates continue to hold. As adjusted for 2020 leap year, AL rates are up 1.6%, IL rates are up 0.7%, mostly dragged down by the Canadian business. Senior apartments and wellness housing rates are up 6.3%. Our operators across the board are seeing broad momentum that continued to build. Irrespective of product type, geography, activity, this is the most optimistic tone I've heard from our operating partners in a long time. We're even seeing the lifestyle-driven customers are starting to come back, which frankly surprised me in a positive way. 
Fundamental results have exceeded our expectations in Q1, and we're anticipating strong momentum in Q2. While we continue to avoid speculation on what the arc of the recovery may look like, we have provided additional disclosure on the additional LOI and earnings power of our portfolio assuming a return to 2019 level of NOI for our stable portfolio and adding incremental NOI from our filler portfolio. We believe this would result in additional $480 million of NOI. And remember, this assumes a return to 2019 level of occupancy and margin, and it does not assume a return to frictional vacancy or any rate growth since Q4 of 2019.
We're seeing something similar happening in the private markets. While current cash flow multiples of what we are buying might be high as compared to what we're willing to pay 2 to 3 years ago, this is a moot point. We're paying a much lower multiple and a stabilized cash flow as evidenced by a much lower price per unit. While in most other asset classes this could be a matter of opinion, I believe in real estate it is a simple business where you can obtain a very granular view of price per unit and how this compares to replacement cost. While we can sit here and debate how different assets and portfolio prices compare to prices per unit 2 to 3 years ago, replacement costs are shooting upwards, with a white hot housing market driving construction costs exponentially higher in recent quarters. This phenomena is now spilling into other material costs due to a $2 trillion infrastructure plan announced by the Biden administration. As costs continue to rise, the market clearing rent to achieve minimum acceptable return is also ratcheting up. However, those returns are not going to be easy to achieve today, as much of the senior housing industry effectively remains in lease-up mode, given the impact of COVID on occupancy.
If this was not enough, now the interest rate curve is backing up, creating further pressure on developers pro forma. This backdrop clearly is unique to the current cycle, which we believe will result in meaningfully lower new starts in near to medium term. The supply outlook, along with already rising demographic growth in the first half of the decade, gives us confidence that we'll achieve the level of asset performance that we provided. Although I have nothing to add in terms of the timing and/or the trajectory of the recovery, our analysis was done one asset at a time, and I hope you will find this new disclosure useful. 
During the first quarter, we continued our effort to create greater alignment of interest with our operating partners by restructuring several relationship constructs. And as we mentioned on our last call, we have made structural changes to several senior housing agreements. I would also like to highlight some recently announced strategic transactions with Genesis and ProMedica, with elements of both deals reflects our approach to value creation for our shareholders. First, Genesis. As we announced last month, after 10 years, we have substantially exited our Genesis real estate relationship through a series of transactions, which meaningfully derisked our cash flow stream going forward. Effectuating this nearly $900 million, the transaction wasn't easy. It involved a skilled nursing operator deeply impacted by COVID-19 pandemic, the transitional access to local and regional operators, working through our outstanding loans to Genesis, at the same time, creating opportunity for Welltower to participate in the post-COVID recovery in post-acute fundamentals. 
Ultimately, we executed a mutually beneficial transaction for Genesis and Welltower shareholders. For Genesis, the transaction resulted in a meaningful deleveraging of its balance sheet, which will help you to reposition the company post COVID-19. And for Welltower, we were able to execute the transaction at a par bid value of $144,000 and generated an 8.5% unlevered return over the full term of Genesis relationship. And upon the repayment of the outstanding debt, that return will rise to 9%, with even further upside potential from participating preferred and the equity position. 
We believe that this represents a very favorable outcome for the shareholders, Welltower shareholders, particularly in light of challenging environment that we have faced in the post-acute sector and then COVID-related pandemic-induced downside we have seen. While transactions will result in some near-term earnings dilution for Welltower, we expect to create significant value for our shareholders following the deployment of the $745 million of anticipated proceeds over a range of high-quality opportunity that I'll discuss shortly. 
Since our announcement last month, Genesis has received an infusion of equity capital and named a turnaround specialist in Harry Wilson as CEO. We wish the team of Genesis much success in the future. As we have substantially exited a challenging legacy structure with Genesis, I hope our shareholders appreciate the favorable ultimate outcome. As we have done with several operating relationship over the last few years and discussed on various calls, our team embrace complexity, fix creative solutions, doesn't run away from their problems and situations where the choices may be imperfect, and ultimately works tirelessly to fulfill our commitment to our owners, operating partners and employees. 
Second, ProMedica. We announced 2 transactions to strengthen and expand our relationship with ProMedica, which will enhance the quality of our joint venture position and continued growth. The first transaction involved $265 million sale of 25 skilled nursing assets with an average age of 41 years, which will result in an immediate improvement to the quality of the portfolio. At the same time, we also crystallized a 22% unlevered IRR over 2.5 years of ownership of the asset, which is a true reflection of the power of our value-oriented investment philosophy. We at Welltower firmly believe that basis, not yield or cap rates, determines investment success. 
Through a separate transaction, we are pleased to maintain an 80% stake in our state-of-the-art PowerBack assets which has been contributed to our 80/20 joint venture with ProMedica. ProMedica has already assumed the operations of these assets, which have been rebranded as ProMedica Senior Care. This successful transaction is yet another example of our focus on improving quality and growth profile of our portfolios while doing so at favorable economic terms to all stakeholders. ProMedica team is making progress in developing new relationships with other health systems as a provider of choice, as Promedica represents the premium not-for-profit provider at the leading edge of health care evolution. We're hopeful that we'll be able to deploy far direct accretive capital with this innovative partner of ours. 
Speaking of accretive capital deployment, we are pleased to share with you that we have closed in excess of $1.3 billion of acquisitions year-to-date with very attractive unlevered IRR. In particular, extremely happy to announce that we have partnered with a Safanad-led investment group to recapitalize HC-One, the largest and most reputable operator of care homes communities in the U.K. Our investment in excess of $800 million comes in form of first mortgage debt on HC-One's real estate and equity in recapitalization. We also received significant warrants that would further allow us to participate in the post-COVID upside that we are confident that management in process of executing. HC-One will add a value option to our high-end focused U.K. platform. This is significant -- there is significant opportunity to upgrade the asset base, operating platform and people in this portfolio, and we have tremendous confidence in James and David to fulfill their missions to deliver the highest quality care, along with the resident and employee satisfaction. 
In recent weeks, HC-One has experienced the same positive occupancy momentum as our broader U.K. portfolio, gaining 90 bps of occupancy from the March 2021 trough. Our debt investment represents the last found exposure of just $40,000 per unit, an important statistic given our unrelenting focus on basis. This basis also represents a significant discount to replacement cost. In addition to the upside from equity and warrants, we think this is an extraordinary risk-adjusted return story. We believe we'll be able to generate low to mid-teens unlevered IRR from this transaction, while adding a highly [indiscernible] partner to fill a gap that we have in our portfolio in the U.K.
With acquisitions, patience is a virtue and so is occasional boldness. Since we mentioned in our October call the moment of boldness is here, we have closed in excess of $1.8 billion of acquisitions. The initial yield of this whole tranche is 6.8%, but we expect it will stabilize at a significantly higher number. While the environment was very uncertain then and we didn't give into institutional imperative about headline pressures, and we relied on independent thinking and resilience of our team. 
We remain very bullish on acquisition opportunities and have several attractive deals under contract currently and a highly visible pipeline, which we think we'll be able to execute through year-end. While our focus continues to be on the right asset with the right basis and with the right operator, I'm hopeful that our 2021 class of acquisitions will be immediately accretive to 2022 earnings and will be significantly accretive to 2023 and beyond. 
Lastly, I will address a very interesting question I have received from an investor post our last call. I was asked why we have such an emphasis on partner selection and whether it would be better off vertically integrating. We think this is an excellent question that deserves some reflecting for a moment. Notwithstanding with the RIDEA law in senior housing, we believe we're better off in this ecosystem of partners and implementing an industrial view of vertical integration. That view is rooted in our belief that the combination of centralized capital allocation and decentralized execution creates the best long-term return. We believe this strategy of decentralized execution relates to entrepreneurial energy and keeps politics and costs at bay. This is especially important in real estate, which is profoundly a local business. However, overall, we are happy with our execution so far in the year to create partial value for our shareholders, but by no means we are satisfied. We are cautiously optimistic about the fundamental environment and excited about our opportunity to acquire assets, create new relationships and attract quality challenges. 
With that, I'll pass it over to Tim. Tim?"

My comments today will focus on our first quarter 2021 results, the performance of our investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity, and finally, a balance sheet and liquidity update, in addition to an outlook for the second",2276,"Thank you, Shankh. My comments today will focus on our first quarter 2021 results, the performance of our investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity, and finally, a balance sheet and liquidity update, in addition to an outlook for the second quarter.
After a year defined by infection protocols, move in restrictions and incredible operating challenges for our partners, we started 2021 in arguably the most challenging environment yet, with case counts hitting new highs across all 3 of our geographies and operating restrictions moving up in lockstep. Towards the end of February, the vaccine rollout hit its stride and nearly 80% of our facilities had their second vaccine clinic. Case counts across the portfolio dropped precipitously, and we started to see the early signs of stabilization. The effectiveness and rapid deployment of vaccines within our communities are just starting to be felt across our resident population. And while we are encouraged by the last 6 weeks of recovery in the U.S. and U.K., significant uncertainty remains with respect to the prevalence of the virus amongst the general population, the timing of the reopening of the economy, and the timing of further rollbacks of operating restrictions, especially with respect to our Canadian portfolio. The result is a near-term operating environment that, although notably improved, remains highly unpredictable in the short term. 
As a result of this uncertainty, like last quarter, we provided a 1 quarter outlook with our results last night. As we have done over the past 14-plus months, we will continue to disclose and update information on a frequent basis with the intention of providing a more complete outlook as soon as the virus-related variables moderate to a level that allows for more reliable forecasting. 
Now turning to the quarter. Welltower reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.17 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $0.80 per diluted share versus guidance of $0.71 to $0.76 per share. When providing guidance last quarter, we also provided expectations for $31 million of HHS provider relief funds we received in the quarter. We ended up recognizing approximately $34.7 million of HHS funds, along with $2.5 million of out-of-period payments for similar programs in Canada. Removing the impact of these funds, along with the $3.5 million termination fee that was received in one of our senior housing management company investments, which was not contemplating guidance, our normalized FFO moves to $0.70 per share. Therefore, on an apples-to-apples basis, we came out $0.01 above the top end of our HHS-adjusted prior guidance of $0.64 to $0.69 per share.
Now turning to our individual portfolio components. First, our triple-net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats reported 1 quarter in arrears. So these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 12/31/2020. Importantly, our collection rate for rent remained high in the first quarter, having collected 96% of triple-net contractual rent due in the period. 
Starting with our senior housing triple-net portfolio. Same-store declined 2% year-over-year as leases that were moved to cash recognition in prior quarters continue to comp against the prior year full contractual rent received. EBITDAR coverage decreased 0.01x on a sequential basis in the portfolio to 1.00. During the quarter, we transitioned the remaining 5 capital senior assets, moving one to triple-net structure under a new operator and the other 4 to a RIDEA structure with CSU until transition. We also completed the transition of 4 properties leased by Hearth Management to StoryPoint under a new lease agreement. These transitions had a net positive impact of 0.02x in total portfolio coverage. 
Next, our long-term/post-acute portfolio generated positive 0.2% year-over-year same-store growth and EBITDAR coverage increased 0.37x sequentially to 1.37x as 51 of the 79 Genesis assets began operator transitions. 23 assets have already transitioned as of this call, including 9 former PowerBack properties, which moved to ProMedica Senior Care. Pro forma for the already completed ProMedica JV, Genesis Healthcare represents less than 90 basis points of our total in-place NOI. And long-term post-acute will be reduced to 6% of total NOI. 
And lastly, health systems, which is comprised by ProMedica Senior care joint venture with the ProMedica Health System. We had same-store NOI growth of positive 2.8% year-over-year and trailing 12 EBITDAR coverage was 1.9x. 
Before turning to outpatient medical, I want to highlight a disclosure change we made to our presentation of occupancy in our supplemental disclosure. Historically, we reported occupancy to 100% ownership. But going forward, we will present both at Welltower's pro rata share to better reflect Welltower's ownership economics. This has no impact on NOI, which has always been presented at Welltower share. We have footnoted the occupancy levels if presented at 100% ownership in both the senior housing operating and medical office portion of our supplement. 
Now turning to our outpatient medical portfolio, which delivered positive 3.1% year-over-year same-store growth, as cash rent growth and higher platform profitability combined to producing acceleration in NOI growth. Tenant retention continued to be strong at 87.7% in the quarter, as we executed renewals on more than 540,000 square feet of space in the quarter, our highest amount ever reported. Additionally, we've also seen the length of term on executed renewals increase as compared to last year. Also in the quarter, we completed our second joint venture with Invesco Real Estate for a portfolio of outpatient medical assets and completed our first with Wafra. Our ability to form joint ventures with best-in-class capital partners over the last 2 years has allowed us to maintain scale, and more importantly, the tenant relationships generated from our in-house asset management platform. At the same time, we diversified our access to capital during a period of significant capital market turbulence. We look forward to growing these relationships further going forward. 
Now turning to our senior housing operating portfolio. Before getting into this quarter's results, I want to point out that we received approximately $35 million from our Department of Health and Human Services CARES Act provider relief fund. As we've done in the past quarters, the funds are recognized on a cash basis, and as such, will flow through financials in the quarter they are received. We're normalizing these HHS funds out of same store metrics, however, along with any other government funds received that are not matched to expenses incurred in the period they were received. In the first quarter, there were approximately $33.8 million of reimbursement normalized out of our same-store senior housing operating results, mainly tied to the HHS program in the U.S. 
Now turning to results for the quarter. Same-store NOI decreased 44% as compared to first quarter 2020 and decreased 15.6% sequentially from the fourth quarter. Sequential same-store revenue was down 3.6% in Q1, driven primarily by a 310 basis point drop in average occupancy versus our guidance midpoint of 325 basis points. 
Turning to REVPOR in the quarter. SHO portfolio REVPOR was down 1.5% year-over-year, but mix shift and an extra day of rent in the comparable leap year quarter are distorting the true picture of rent growth metrics, as over 40% of our revenue is derived on a per diem basis. When adjusting for the leap year, total portfolio REVPOR growth moves to negative 1%. And breaking out our individual segments, our active adult, independent living and assisted living segments reported year-over-year growth of positive 6.3%, positive 0.7% and positive 1.6%, respectively. 
As I mentioned in the past few quarters, the combined total portfolio metric is being impacted by considerable change in the composition of occupied units in the year-over-year portfolio. Our lower acuity properties, comprised of independent living and seniors apartments, held up considerably better on the occupancy front since the start of COVID, which has the mathematical impact of having a higher portion of our total portfolio occupied units being lower acuity, and therefore, lower rent paying units. So in conclusion, rental rates are proving resilient, more resilient across our portfolio than would appear in our aggregate reported statistics. 
Lastly, expenses. Total same-store expenses declined 2.6% year-over-year and decreased 20 basis points sequentially. I'll focus on sequential since the changes are more relevant to trends in the current operating environment. The 20 basis point sequential decline in operating costs was driven mainly by lower COVID cover cost as case counts dropped dramatically in March. The meaningful decline in our top line, combined with these expense pressures, had a significant impact to our operating margins, which declined 280 basis points sequentially to 19.4%. As I noted earlier in the call, we not include government reimbursement that was not tied to parity expenses. And therefore, COVID expenses negatively impacted same-store by $14.8 million. We are not factoring any HHS funds into our second quarter outlook. 
Looking forward to the second quarter, and starting with the April quarter-to-date data we've already observed, we've experienced a 20-basis-point increase in occupancy through April 23, with the U.S. and U.K. up 40 and 90 basis points, respectively, while Canada is down 20 basis points. While we are encouraged by the recovery in the U.S. and U.K. and are hopeful that the effectiveness of the vaccines has put a floor underneath operating results, we remain cautious on projecting an acceleration in recent trends, given the lack of historical precedents and uncertainty of reopening trend, particularly in Canada. On a spot basis, we are currently projecting a 130 basis point increase in occupancy from March 31 through June 30. We expect monthly REVPOR to be plus 1.2% sequentially, although adjusting for the extra day in 2Q versus 1Q reduced to plus 70 basis points sequentially. Lastly, we expect total expenses to be effectively flat, as increases in operating costs from higher occupancy should be offset by a reduction in COVID-related expenses. 
Turning to capital market activity. We continue to execute on our strategy of maximizing balance sheet stability. We're maintaining flexibility to position us to take advantage of attractive capital deployment opportunities. In March, we issued $750 million of senior unsecured notes due June 2031 bearing an interest rate of 2.8%, and used these proceeds to redeem all remaining senior unsecured notes due 2023. As a result, we were able to extend all senior unsecured debt maturities to 2024 and beyond, extend our weighted average maturity profile for nearly 8 years. We also extinguished $42 million of secured debt at a blended average interest rate of 7.6% in the quarter.
In February, we highlighted a robust pipeline of capital deployment opportunities. As these transactions materialize and the pipeline has grown, we've utilized our forward ATM program, selling 3.7 million shares of common stock to date at an initial average weighted price of $73.43 per share. These shares will generate future gross proceeds of approximately $272 million, and along with $1 billion of cash from our balance sheet, will enable us to officially capitalize our highly visible pipeline of capital deployment opportunities. 
Moving on to leverage. We ended the quarter at 6.59x net debt to adjusted EBITDA, a 31 basis point increase over the previous quarter as underlying cash flows continue to be pressured by the impact of COVID. While transactions closed in the second quarter will result in a slight increase in leverage, after adjusting for expected proceeds from assets held for sale and $272 million in proceeds from the forward sale of common stock, we expect leverage to settle in the high 6s before the ramp in senior housing cash flows begin to naturally drive leverage lower in the coming quarters. 
Speaking of recovery, Shankh spoke earlier about the magnitude of potential cash flow growth from just returning to pre-COVID levels of margins and occupancy in our senior housing operating portfolio. This will have a significantly positive impact on cash flow based leverage metrics. And although the duration of this recovery remains highly uncertain, the inflection point this quarter leaves us optimistic that it has begun. And our demonstrated ability to access significant equity proceeds through asset sales, even in the most difficult times, along with our return in the equity market since last quarter, leaves us confident that we'll be able to keep the balance sheet in a position of strength as a natural deleveraging when the senior housing recovery returns us to well within our historical target levels in the not-too-distant future. 
Lastly, moving to our second quarter outlook. Last night, we provided an outlook for the second quarter of net income attributable to common stockholders per diluted share of $0.31 to $0.36, and normalized FFO per diluted share of $0.72 to $0.77 per share. As I noted earlier, this guidance does not take into consideration any further HHS funds or similar government programs in the U.K. and Canada. So when comparing sequentially to our first quarter normalized FFO per share, it's better to use the $0.70 per share number I mentioned earlier in my comments, which excludes the benefits of these programs as well. On this comparison, the midpoint of our second quarter guidance of $0.745 per share represents a $0.045 sequential increase from 1Q. The $0.045 increase is composed of a $0.02 increase per share increase from our senior housing operating portfolio, driven by an increase in sequential average occupancy and expected reduction in COVID costs; a $0.025 per share increase in net investment activity, as strong post quarter investments is offsetting the initial dilution from loan reductions and operator transitions related to Genesis; a $0.01 increase in NOI from triple-net and outpatient medical segments; and this is offset by the expected $0.01 increase in sequential G&A, driven mainly by new hires. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Shankh."

And so people want to know what the snapback is going to look like. 
My estimates are down 30% versus pre COVID because of all this noise. And so I guess the way I would ask the question is, if you can't give trajectory, what would disappoint you in terms of getting back to square one? Would you say, ""Boy, if we're not there in 2 years, that would be quite a disappointment.""? Can you kind of triangulate at least a range of expectations as opposed to committing to one."

But I'll just address the question, is any definitive answer for our end is as much of a guess from us as it is from you, right? So just understand there's no historical precedence to what's going on. We're simply telling you, if we go back asset by asset to where the NOI of these assets were, I think it's an important exercise because we have sold a lot of assets, bought a lot of assets, so it's very hard for you to figure out from our supplement what the number looks like. So we try to answer that question that if we just went back for the stabilized pool of assets to Q4 of '19, what will the NOI look like? And we add the filler portfolio and stabilize that, what does that combined look like?
Now I cannot answer the question, whether it's 2 years or 4 years or -- you've got to really put that in the context and your expectation. However, I will say this, and it's a very important point. It is to a Q4 2019 rent level a.k.a. that if you assume that this will be expanded out, let's just say it will take 4 years from today to get to that stabilized level of NOI. So it's going to stabilize in 2026. You have to assume the rent of the business remains flat to achieve that NOI, right, which we don't think obviously is happening. 
We have continued to say that we expect that rent growth will hold up. Right? So you might get it later, but you will get x number of years of rent growth to get added to that. Obviously, that rent growth has a contribution margin that's very high and it falls to the bottom line. On the other hand, if we say, okay, we're going to get that earlier, you are not going to get as much rent growth. You will only get, just say that you decide that you're going to get there in 2 years, right, I'm making this up. And 2 years up, so you will only get the rent growth from '19 to '23 instead of '19 to '26.
So I'm pointing out that there are many levers here that you have to think through. The longer gestation period will bring you ultimately a higher number because of the rent growth aspect that I'm talking about versus the shorter. And that's all I'm willing to say right now. I can guess, but it is a guess. We're underwriting assets in a way that, frankly speaking, we don't need to know. That's why we're so focused on basis. If you look at our stock, it's a real estate company. You can look at what the basis looks like on a price per unit basis, and then go and think about what it takes to build that portfolio. You will see that portfolio trade had a significant discount to what it takes to build it today."

So right now, we're seeing 140 basis points below -- we were 1,400 basis points below where we were pre COVID on occupancy front. So you've just got substantially lower number of residents in the building. So if you run a kind of historical churn levels, it obviously changes occupancy builds and then move outs start to kind of match historical levels. But as historical churn levels, you should be running at around 80% of kind of indexed historical levels of move outs. If that gets elevated a bit, we've talked about this from a higher acuity resident moving in during COVID. That probably moves to mid to upper 80s. But that can stay, I think, pretty consistent through a recovery. It is tough looking at the last kind of 6 months ticking through what has been natural move-outs and what's been really -- certainly a spike we've seen from COVID in the December, January, February period. I think what you're starting to see in March is a return to that kind of 80% level that we would expect, again, giving historical type of churn. But it's certainly something we're watching pretty closely.But from just a level of kind of the comment I made last quarter was from a level of occupancy in the buildings. That move-out percentage, getting back to historical levels of 2019 levels of move-ins, you can drive 80, 90 basis points a month in occupancy by just getting back there because the move-outs are going to be lower, purely mathematically based off the occupancy level."

First is the $10 billion number I mentioned, obviously, is a multiyear opportunity, not a 1-year opportunity, right? So I just want to clarify that. But you're right in that expansion with obviously expanding with HC-One, this transaction expands that opportunity. I want you to understand, as I've said in my prepared remarks, that this investment is not just a financial investment, it's a strategic investment. 
And we looked at the company, its footprint, its management, and we see an opportunity that fills a big hole in our portfolio. Our portfolio in U.K. is very focused on high end, and we didn't have the value option. And there is a tremendous opportunity to grow in that value option, which we think we'll be able to execute through the HC-One platform. We structured the investment in the 3 tranches that we talked about. We don't go into an investment thinking we'll do debt, we'll do equity, we'll do mez or participating equity or cash. That's not how we think about it. We just look at an opportunity first. Think about what is the first asset opportunity and strategic opportunities, then think about how we get to invest capital so that we can be aligned with our partners. That's a very different approach than it's an asset and we've got to buy it, are we going to lend to it. That's just not how we think.
And it is the right risk-adjusted return. You look at an asset or a collection of assets or portfolio and you think about what -- where in the capital structure yields the best risk-adjusted return for your investors. Remember, there are different investors in the, obviously, the spectrum of this transaction. There is $235 million of equity on top of us, which obviously Safanad-led investment group, that includes [ Fanning ] and others, they're obviously bringing in, and they think there's an extraordinary opportunity to create value for their capital, right? 
So that's a very important point. Now going back to the -- sort of the pipeline, the pipeline is primarily today is senior housing, and the pipeline is very much what we talked about. It's significant. It's very robust. It's large. And it reflects a very significant discount to replacement cost. We're not going to sit here and tell you that we believe that every deal we'll do, we'll have this kind of return that we have described in HC-One, but as said before, that we think we can hit high single-digit to low double-digit IRR and that environment is still here. We don't necessarily, given our cost of capital, need to hit that. But we're still seeing many, many, many opportunities that we have under contract today that will get to you to that kind of return, which is in the high single digit, low double-digit type of IRR. Hope that helps."

If you don't come in vaccinated, then you do have a quarantining. But you've seen through the success of the vaccination of the over 65 population in the U.S., that largely a majority of move-ins now that we're seeing come in vaccinated and you're eliminating that quarantine period.

So that's how we thought about it. This is not an opportunistic investment. This is a strategic investment.

So this fills a true strategic hole that we have in our portfolio, which we have been looking for a long time, not just the last 12 months, to fill that hole. And we think this will be our platform.

I will tell you one thing, though. I would highly encourage you not to look at 1 quarter or 1 month of labor costs and projecting there. This is a lot of noise and volatility around the fact that a lot of people have received the stimulus check, and that has impacted short term. We do not believe that will be sustained as this sort of -- this dries up. However, you are right that labor cost inflation will remain, but it will not be what you see in other sectors, because what you are seeing in other sectors such as lodging and all the sectors, they have laid off all their employees, the shutdown, right? That was the case. For us, our communities have never shut down. They continue to employ our -- obviously, because to take care of our residents, and that continues. Is it -- is there no issues? Absolutely not, will remain so. I would also encourage you to think about the potential immigration changes that is -- we're hearing about. Obviously, I know it less -- probably less than you do, but that also has an offsetting impact.

So I think the right way to think about it is, it has been a main focus point for us. And it seems to be for investors as well.

We have been pretty quick to move to cash when we have tenants that are not paying rent. So I think looking at our in-place, looking at our coverage metrics, those are tenants that are current on rent paying us and very much are doing so because of their long-term belief in their business. 
And if anything, I think what we've seen in the first quarter from the start of a recovery, enhances that belief that there will be -- there won't be much impairment here. I think the other key here is, I think, the difference between cash flow and value. And the underlying assets, I think you're seeing this across the board, are holding value. So the impairment to cash flow, I think, is short term. That speaks to the view there's a recovery.

And we have to assume that people will do things that is economically beneficial to them. If you look at how much the costs have changed, let's just say -- let's just talk about cost in the last 3 years. You have places in the coast, costs are probably up 20-plus percent, low 20%. And if you look at some of the locations in, pick Dallas, Charlotte, Nashville, cost is up between 30% and 35%. The housing market is very significantly impacting not just the cost of lumber, which is everybody is talking about, but the cost and availability of labor. Right? So if you -- that's sort of one big impact and a development model is a highly leveraged model, right? So if you thought you're going to make 7% yield on cost and suddenly now looks like 5%, you are in trouble. But on the other hand, if you see what's going on, interest rate is backing up in a highly leveraged model. By definition level, development is a highly-leveraged model, with construction loans, et cetera. What you have is now interest rates backing up. So it's farther eating into your pro forma. And those 2 combinations, assuming people don't develop for fun, they want to develop to make money, that proposition is increasingly becoming very difficult. This is an industry-wide comment. This is not -- I'm not suggesting, see if you can go and develop a building in a given location and can't make money. That's not the point. 
As an industry-wide, it is becoming much more difficult. And assuming people who want to develop to make money, that proposition is getting much, much harder. I'm not even talking about availability of debt capital, et cetera. The attractiveness of the model has been meaningfully hit in last, call it, 3 years, particularly last 12 months, as housing has just gone parabolic. So in that context, we think there will be, obviously, a lot less supply than it has been in the, call it, between '15 to '19. Also the '15 to '19, sort of the supply boom was -- frankly, was created by a lot of the players, including our company, was paid $1.20, $1.5 on the dollar on the basis. I do not see those participants in the industry anymore. People are very, very -- people who are involved in buying assets today, they're very focused on the right basis. And a lot of the sort of the take out premium is meaningfully gone from the industry as well. So if we put all of those things together, we think that it is reasonable to expect. You can never accurately forecast what the future will look like. It is reasonable to expect that supply in next 5 years will be a lot less than last 5 years, but it is a guess, nonetheless. 
And we do think that will impact the rent growth, which is the point I was trying to make on the $480 million, is that is the beauty of basis. I highly encourage all of you to look at what is the implied per basis value of Welltower. And if you have to make that basis a number, what rent do you need, versus what it takes to build and to make some minimum acceptable return, call it, 7%, whatever you think is the development yield should be and what is the rent. And you will see what it takes to build on our -- today in our company, there's a huge gap between the potential reward -- rent, what's potential to bring new supply versus what you can get. That's not just a Welltower problem. I'm saying existing inventory versus the new inventory, and that will give you much more insight into what the rental may or may not be."

So there are many ways you can do this. If you keep the assets under lease, you can give obviously short-term rate and -- but you can create 2 years out, 3 years out, depending on the level of EBITDA. You can do all",579,"Yes. That's a very good question, Tayo. So there are many ways you can do this. If you keep the assets under lease, you can give obviously short-term rate and -- but you can create 2 years out, 3 years out, depending on the level of EBITDA. You can do all bells and whistles to recoup that rent as cash flow comes back. And that's the point we were trying to make. Remember this is -- cash flow is now starting to come back, right? So that's sort of if you retain it, obviously, in the lease. Remember, these leases are not -- there's nothing behind the leases. There's a propco interest sits behind the leases. So you have a value protection.
If you go to RIDEA, right, we are not afraid, Tayo, to get -- take a rent stance and if that is what, what is the sustainable level of rent from the sustainable level of production, right? You saw that we bought a new -- we did a -- we bought a bunch of new assets in the quarter -- reported quarter where we did a triple-net lease with a highly respected operator. In that particular case, you would say, why didn't they do a RIDEA? Because if you look at in that portfolio, what we bought, the rent before us was substantially higher, right, 50% higher that you are paying to the previous landlord. 
Our rent is much lower. We set it in our way. But then we have some sort of a catch-up. Our rent goes up, not by 3%, but as the EBITDA comes back significantly, and the EBITDA is already moving in that direction, we have a provision to get some more rent. It is also, for the operator, at some point, they were paying 50% higher rent. And they will end up probably paying from the current rent level, 10% more, 15% more, but they will keep rest of the cash flow, right? So it works out on both sides. Why does it work out on both sides? Because the basis is lower. The issue is not -- a lease is fundamentally a form of a leverage and if you put the basis in the assets so much higher, and then you put a high LTV loan or high LTV credit for the lease, you are kind of creating problems from two ends. In this case, it's a very low basis that helps both parties, the owner as well as the operators, to make money going forward. 
Going back to your specific question, there's a lot of collateral that sits behind these leases from this specific issue that Juan and Connor, and now you're asking about. This particular operator, which is one of the most respected operators in our space, has a substantial amount of propco interest that they have created through a very significant development machine through '90s. And that propco interest sits behind that lease. So let's just say, you can do it from a lease. This is just a general statement, or you can go to a RIDEA, right? If you go to a RIDEA the ownership will change and will reflect the fact that their future liability is lower, a.k.a. we lost an asset.

So you had this slide that's showing the future NOI potential getting back to pre-COVID occupancy. And yet at the same time, you're not providing full year guidance for this year. So on one hand, you're implying a lot of optimism about getting back to an occupancy number which is much higher than where you are right now. Yet you're not really willing to commit to an occupancy range on the year. 
And I guess I'm just wondering what is giving you confidence that you're going to get back to a higher occupancy level. I mean the 20 basis points of April occupancy benefit seems like it's a smaller number than what you were talking about with your weekly benefit when you put out a presentation earlier this month. So I'm just trying to -- I'm just wondering if there's something that you can point to. You have a backlog of pent-up demand that you're learning from prospective residents that's going to increase move-ins as you get into the third quarter and beyond.

I hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy during these extraordinary times.

I hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy during these extraordinary times. I'll make some introductory comments on the state of senior housing business, our ongoing alignment efforts with our operating partners, and we will also provide a detailed perspective on our current thoughts related to capital allocation. Tim will then get into detailed operating and financial results. 
We are cautiously optimistic on the senior housing business, with green shoots emerging in U.S. and U.K. While it is too early to raise an all-clear flag as another COVID resurgence can never be ruled out, we're delighted to report an occupancy increase of 120 bps in U.K. and 90 bps in U.S. over the past 6 weeks. Despite growing optimism in U.S. and U.K., performance in Canada has remained somewhat weak due to an increased COVID cases across many regions. While most residents within our Canadian senior housing properties have been vaccinated, the rollout to the broader population has lagged meaningfully due to lockdown in certain areas within Ontario and Québec, move-ins, tours and visitation have been highly restricted, which has ultimately led to an occupancy loss of 50 basis points since mid-March. This trend has improved in April. Despite the drag from Canada, the move-in activity in March is higher than the last non-COVID impacted month of February of 2020. 
In addition, as I have described in past quarters, rates continue to hold. As adjusted for 2020 leap year, AL rates are up 1.6%, IL rates are up 0.7%, mostly dragged down by the Canadian business. Senior apartments and wellness housing rates are up 6.3%. Our operators across the board are seeing broad momentum that continued to build. Irrespective of product type, geography, activity, this is the most optimistic tone I've heard from our operating partners in a long time. We're even seeing the lifestyle-driven customers are starting to come back, which frankly surprised me in a positive way. 
Fundamental results have exceeded our expectations in Q1, and we're anticipating strong momentum in Q2. While we continue to avoid speculation on what the arc of the recovery may look like, we have provided additional disclosure on the additional LOI and earnings power of our portfolio assuming a return to 2019 level of NOI for our stable portfolio and adding incremental NOI from our filler portfolio. We believe this would result in additional $480 million of NOI. And remember, this assumes a return to 2019 level of occupancy and margin, and it does not assume a return to frictional vacancy or any rate growth since Q4 of 2019.
We're seeing something similar happening in the private markets. While current cash flow multiples of what we are buying might be high as compared to what we're willing to pay 2 to 3 years ago, this is a moot point. We're paying a much lower multiple and a stabilized cash flow as evidenced by a much lower price per unit. While in most other asset classes this could be a matter of opinion, I believe in real estate it is a simple business where you can obtain a very granular view of price per unit and how this compares to replacement cost. While we can sit here and debate how different assets and portfolio prices compare to prices per unit 2 to 3 years ago, replacement costs are shooting upwards, with a white hot housing market driving construction costs exponentially higher in recent quarters. This phenomena is now spilling into other material costs due to a $2 trillion infrastructure plan announced by the Biden administration. As costs continue to rise, the market clearing rent to achieve minimum acceptable return is also ratcheting up. However, those returns are not going to be easy to achieve today, as much of the senior housing industry effectively remains in lease-up mode, given the impact of COVID on occupancy.
If this was not enough, now the interest rate curve is backing up, creating further pressure on developers pro forma. This backdrop clearly is unique to the current cycle, which we believe will result in meaningfully lower new starts in near to medium term. The supply outlook, along with already rising demographic growth in the first half of the decade, gives us confidence that we'll achieve the level of asset performance that we provided. Although I have nothing to add in terms of the timing and/or the trajectory of the recovery, our analysis was done one asset at a time, and I hope you will find this new disclosure useful. 
During the first quarter, we continued our effort to create greater alignment of interest with our operating partners by restructuring several relationship constructs. And as we mentioned on our last call, we have made structural changes to several senior housing agreements. I would also like to highlight some recently announced strategic transactions with Genesis and ProMedica, with elements of both deals reflects our approach to value creation for our shareholders. First, Genesis. As we announced last month, after 10 years, we have substantially exited our Genesis real estate relationship through a series of transactions, which meaningfully derisked our cash flow stream going forward. Effectuating this nearly $900 million, the transaction wasn't easy. It involved a skilled nursing operator deeply impacted by COVID-19 pandemic, the transitional access to local and regional operators, working through our outstanding loans to Genesis, at the same time, creating opportunity for Welltower to participate in the post-COVID recovery in post-acute fundamentals. 
Ultimately, we executed a mutually beneficial transaction for Genesis and Welltower shareholders. For Genesis, the transaction resulted in a meaningful deleveraging of its balance sheet, which will help you to reposition the company post COVID-19. And for Welltower, we were able to execute the transaction at a par bid value of $144,000 and generated an 8.5% unlevered return over the full term of Genesis relationship. And upon the repayment of the outstanding debt, that return will rise to 9%, with even further upside potential from participating preferred and the equity position. 
We believe that this represents a very favorable outcome for the shareholders, Welltower shareholders, particularly in light of challenging environment that we have faced in the post-acute sector and then COVID-related pandemic-induced downside we have seen. While transactions will result in some near-term earnings dilution for Welltower, we expect to create significant value for our shareholders following the deployment of the $745 million of anticipated proceeds over a range of high-quality opportunity that I'll discuss shortly. 
Since our announcement last month, Genesis has received an infusion of equity capital and named a turnaround specialist in Harry Wilson as CEO. We wish the team of Genesis much success in the future. As we have substantially exited a challenging legacy structure with Genesis, I hope our shareholders appreciate the favorable ultimate outcome. As we have done with several operating relationship over the last few years and discussed on various calls, our team embrace complexity, fix creative solutions, doesn't run away from their problems and situations where the choices may be imperfect, and ultimately works tirelessly to fulfill our commitment to our owners, operating partners and employees. 
Second, ProMedica. We announced 2 transactions to strengthen and expand our relationship with ProMedica, which will enhance the quality of our joint venture position and continued growth. The first transaction involved $265 million sale of 25 skilled nursing assets with an average age of 41 years, which will result in an immediate improvement to the quality of the portfolio. At the same time, we also crystallized a 22% unlevered IRR over 2.5 years of ownership of the asset, which is a true reflection of the power of our value-oriented investment philosophy. We at Welltower firmly believe that basis, not yield or cap rates, determines investment success. 
Through a separate transaction, we are pleased to maintain an 80% stake in our state-of-the-art PowerBack assets which has been contributed to our 80/20 joint venture with ProMedica. ProMedica has already assumed the operations of these assets, which have been rebranded as ProMedica Senior Care. This successful transaction is yet another example of our focus on improving quality and growth profile of our portfolios while doing so at favorable economic terms to all stakeholders. ProMedica team is making progress in developing new relationships with other health systems as a provider of choice, as Promedica represents the premium not-for-profit provider at the leading edge of health care evolution. We're hopeful that we'll be able to deploy far direct accretive capital with this innovative partner of ours. 
Speaking of accretive capital deployment, we are pleased to share with you that we have closed in excess of $1.3 billion of acquisitions year-to-date with very attractive unlevered IRR. In particular, extremely happy to announce that we have partnered with a Safanad-led investment group to recapitalize HC-One, the largest and most reputable operator of care homes communities in the U.K. Our investment in excess of $800 million comes in form of first mortgage debt on HC-One's real estate and equity in recapitalization. We also received significant warrants that would further allow us to participate in the post-COVID upside that we are confident that management in process of executing. HC-One will add a value option to our high-end focused U.K. platform. This is significant -- there is significant opportunity to upgrade the asset base, operating platform and people in this portfolio, and we have tremendous confidence in James and David to fulfill their missions to deliver the highest quality care, along with the resident and employee satisfaction. 
In recent weeks, HC-One has experienced the same positive occupancy momentum as our broader U.K. portfolio, gaining 90 bps of occupancy from the March 2021 trough. Our debt investment represents the last found exposure of just $40,000 per unit, an important statistic given our unrelenting focus on basis. This basis also represents a significant discount to replacement cost. In addition to the upside from equity and warrants, we think this is an extraordinary risk-adjusted return story. We believe we'll be able to generate low to mid-teens unlevered IRR from this transaction, while adding a highly [indiscernible] partner to fill a gap that we have in our portfolio in the U.K.
With acquisitions, patience is a virtue and so is occasional boldness. Since we mentioned in our October call the moment of boldness is here, we have closed in excess of $1.8 billion of acquisitions. The initial yield of this whole tranche is 6.8%, but we expect it will stabilize at a significantly higher number. While the environment was very uncertain then and we didn't give into institutional imperative about headline pressures, and we relied on independent thinking and resilience of our team. 
We remain very bullish on acquisition opportunities and have several attractive deals under contract currently and a highly visible pipeline, which we think we'll be able to execute through year-end. While our focus continues to be on the right asset with the right basis and with the right operator, I'm hopeful that our 2021 class of acquisitions will be immediately accretive to 2022 earnings and will be significantly accretive to 2023 and beyond. 
Lastly, I will address a very interesting question I have received from an investor post our last call. I was asked why we have such an emphasis on partner selection and whether it would be better off vertically integrating. We think this is an excellent question that deserves some reflecting for a moment. Notwithstanding with the RIDEA law in senior housing, we believe we're better off in this ecosystem of partners and implementing an industrial view of vertical integration. That view is rooted in our belief that the combination of centralized capital allocation and decentralized execution creates the best long-term return. We believe this strategy of decentralized execution relates to entrepreneurial energy and keeps politics and costs at bay. This is especially important in real estate, which is profoundly a local business. However, overall, we are happy with our execution so far in the year to create partial value for our shareholders, but by no means we are satisfied. We are cautiously optimistic about the fundamental environment and excited about our opportunity to acquire assets, create new relationships and attract quality challenges. 
With that, I'll pass it over to Tim. Tim?"

My comments today will focus on our first quarter 2021 results, the performance of our investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity, and finally, a balance sheet and liquidity update, in addition to an outlook for the second",2276,"Thank you, Shankh. My comments today will focus on our first quarter 2021 results, the performance of our investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity, and finally, a balance sheet and liquidity update, in addition to an outlook for the second quarter.
After a year defined by infection protocols, move in restrictions and incredible operating challenges for our partners, we started 2021 in arguably the most challenging environment yet, with case counts hitting new highs across all 3 of our geographies and operating restrictions moving up in lockstep. Towards the end of February, the vaccine rollout hit its stride and nearly 80% of our facilities had their second vaccine clinic. Case counts across the portfolio dropped precipitously, and we started to see the early signs of stabilization. The effectiveness and rapid deployment of vaccines within our communities are just starting to be felt across our resident population. And while we are encouraged by the last 6 weeks of recovery in the U.S. and U.K., significant uncertainty remains with respect to the prevalence of the virus amongst the general population, the timing of the reopening of the economy, and the timing of further rollbacks of operating restrictions, especially with respect to our Canadian portfolio. The result is a near-term operating environment that, although notably improved, remains highly unpredictable in the short term. 
As a result of this uncertainty, like last quarter, we provided a 1 quarter outlook with our results last night. As we have done over the past 14-plus months, we will continue to disclose and update information on a frequent basis with the intention of providing a more complete outlook as soon as the virus-related variables moderate to a level that allows for more reliable forecasting. 
Now turning to the quarter. Welltower reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.17 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $0.80 per diluted share versus guidance of $0.71 to $0.76 per share. When providing guidance last quarter, we also provided expectations for $31 million of HHS provider relief funds we received in the quarter. We ended up recognizing approximately $34.7 million of HHS funds, along with $2.5 million of out-of-period payments for similar programs in Canada. Removing the impact of these funds, along with the $3.5 million termination fee that was received in one of our senior housing management company investments, which was not contemplating guidance, our normalized FFO moves to $0.70 per share. Therefore, on an apples-to-apples basis, we came out $0.01 above the top end of our HHS-adjusted prior guidance of $0.64 to $0.69 per share.
Now turning to our individual portfolio components. First, our triple-net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats reported 1 quarter in arrears. So these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 12/31/2020. Importantly, our collection rate for rent remained high in the first quarter, having collected 96% of triple-net contractual rent due in the period. 
Starting with our senior housing triple-net portfolio. Same-store declined 2% year-over-year as leases that were moved to cash recognition in prior quarters continue to comp against the prior year full contractual rent received. EBITDAR coverage decreased 0.01x on a sequential basis in the portfolio to 1.00. During the quarter, we transitioned the remaining 5 capital senior assets, moving one to triple-net structure under a new operator and the other 4 to a RIDEA structure with CSU until transition. We also completed the transition of 4 properties leased by Hearth Management to StoryPoint under a new lease agreement. These transitions had a net positive impact of 0.02x in total portfolio coverage. 
Next, our long-term/post-acute portfolio generated positive 0.2% year-over-year same-store growth and EBITDAR coverage increased 0.37x sequentially to 1.37x as 51 of the 79 Genesis assets began operator transitions. 23 assets have already transitioned as of this call, including 9 former PowerBack properties, which moved to ProMedica Senior Care. Pro forma for the already completed ProMedica JV, Genesis Healthcare represents less than 90 basis points of our total in-place NOI. And long-term post-acute will be reduced to 6% of total NOI. 
And lastly, health systems, which is comprised by ProMedica Senior care joint venture with the ProMedica Health System. We had same-store NOI growth of positive 2.8% year-over-year and trailing 12 EBITDAR coverage was 1.9x. 
Before turning to outpatient medical, I want to highlight a disclosure change we made to our presentation of occupancy in our supplemental disclosure. Historically, we reported occupancy to 100% ownership. But going forward, we will present both at Welltower's pro rata share to better reflect Welltower's ownership economics. This has no impact on NOI, which has always been presented at Welltower share. We have footnoted the occupancy levels if presented at 100% ownership in both the senior housing operating and medical office portion of our supplement. 
Now turning to our outpatient medical portfolio, which delivered positive 3.1% year-over-year same-store growth, as cash rent growth and higher platform profitability combined to producing acceleration in NOI growth. Tenant retention continued to be strong at 87.7% in the quarter, as we executed renewals on more than 540,000 square feet of space in the quarter, our highest amount ever reported. Additionally, we've also seen the length of term on executed renewals increase as compared to last year. Also in the quarter, we completed our second joint venture with Invesco Real Estate for a portfolio of outpatient medical assets and completed our first with Wafra. Our ability to form joint ventures with best-in-class capital partners over the last 2 years has allowed us to maintain scale, and more importantly, the tenant relationships generated from our in-house asset management platform. At the same time, we diversified our access to capital during a period of significant capital market turbulence. We look forward to growing these relationships further going forward. 
Now turning to our senior housing operating portfolio. Before getting into this quarter's results, I want to point out that we received approximately $35 million from our Department of Health and Human Services CARES Act provider relief fund. As we've done in the past quarters, the funds are recognized on a cash basis, and as such, will flow through financials in the quarter they are received. We're normalizing these HHS funds out of same store metrics, however, along with any other government funds received that are not matched to expenses incurred in the period they were received. In the first quarter, there were approximately $33.8 million of reimbursement normalized out of our same-store senior housing operating results, mainly tied to the HHS program in the U.S. 
Now turning to results for the quarter. Same-store NOI decreased 44% as compared to first quarter 2020 and decreased 15.6% sequentially from the fourth quarter. Sequential same-store revenue was down 3.6% in Q1, driven primarily by a 310 basis point drop in average occupancy versus our guidance midpoint of 325 basis points. 
Turning to REVPOR in the quarter. SHO portfolio REVPOR was down 1.5% year-over-year, but mix shift and an extra day of rent in the comparable leap year quarter are distorting the true picture of rent growth metrics, as over 40% of our revenue is derived on a per diem basis. When adjusting for the leap year, total portfolio REVPOR growth moves to negative 1%. And breaking out our individual segments, our active adult, independent living and assisted living segments reported year-over-year growth of positive 6.3%, positive 0.7% and positive 1.6%, respectively. 
As I mentioned in the past few quarters, the combined total portfolio metric is being impacted by considerable change in the composition of occupied units in the year-over-year portfolio. Our lower acuity properties, comprised of independent living and seniors apartments, held up considerably better on the occupancy front since the start of COVID, which has the mathematical impact of having a higher portion of our total portfolio occupied units being lower acuity, and therefore, lower rent paying units. So in conclusion, rental rates are proving resilient, more resilient across our portfolio than would appear in our aggregate reported statistics. 
Lastly, expenses. Total same-store expenses declined 2.6% year-over-year and decreased 20 basis points sequentially. I'll focus on sequential since the changes are more relevant to trends in the current operating environment. The 20 basis point sequential decline in operating costs was driven mainly by lower COVID cover cost as case counts dropped dramatically in March. The meaningful decline in our top line, combined with these expense pressures, had a significant impact to our operating margins, which declined 280 basis points sequentially to 19.4%. As I noted earlier in the call, we not include government reimbursement that was not tied to parity expenses. And therefore, COVID expenses negatively impacted same-store by $14.8 million. We are not factoring any HHS funds into our second quarter outlook. 
Looking forward to the second quarter, and starting with the April quarter-to-date data we've already observed, we've experienced a 20-basis-point increase in occupancy through April 23, with the U.S. and U.K. up 40 and 90 basis points, respectively, while Canada is down 20 basis points. While we are encouraged by the recovery in the U.S. and U.K. and are hopeful that the effectiveness of the vaccines has put a floor underneath operating results, we remain cautious on projecting an acceleration in recent trends, given the lack of historical precedents and uncertainty of reopening trend, particularly in Canada. On a spot basis, we are currently projecting a 130 basis point increase in occupancy from March 31 through June 30. We expect monthly REVPOR to be plus 1.2% sequentially, although adjusting for the extra day in 2Q versus 1Q reduced to plus 70 basis points sequentially. Lastly, we expect total expenses to be effectively flat, as increases in operating costs from higher occupancy should be offset by a reduction in COVID-related expenses. 
Turning to capital market activity. We continue to execute on our strategy of maximizing balance sheet stability. We're maintaining flexibility to position us to take advantage of attractive capital deployment opportunities. In March, we issued $750 million of senior unsecured notes due June 2031 bearing an interest rate of 2.8%, and used these proceeds to redeem all remaining senior unsecured notes due 2023. As a result, we were able to extend all senior unsecured debt maturities to 2024 and beyond, extend our weighted average maturity profile for nearly 8 years. We also extinguished $42 million of secured debt at a blended average interest rate of 7.6% in the quarter.
In February, we highlighted a robust pipeline of capital deployment opportunities. As these transactions materialize and the pipeline has grown, we've utilized our forward ATM program, selling 3.7 million shares of common stock to date at an initial average weighted price of $73.43 per share. These shares will generate future gross proceeds of approximately $272 million, and along with $1 billion of cash from our balance sheet, will enable us to officially capitalize our highly visible pipeline of capital deployment opportunities. 
Moving on to leverage. We ended the quarter at 6.59x net debt to adjusted EBITDA, a 31 basis point increase over the previous quarter as underlying cash flows continue to be pressured by the impact of COVID. While transactions closed in the second quarter will result in a slight increase in leverage, after adjusting for expected proceeds from assets held for sale and $272 million in proceeds from the forward sale of common stock, we expect leverage to settle in the high 6s before the ramp in senior housing cash flows begin to naturally drive leverage lower in the coming quarters. 
Speaking of recovery, Shankh spoke earlier about the magnitude of potential cash flow growth from just returning to pre-COVID levels of margins and occupancy in our senior housing operating portfolio. This will have a significantly positive impact on cash flow based leverage metrics. And although the duration of this recovery remains highly uncertain, the inflection point this quarter leaves us optimistic that it has begun. And our demonstrated ability to access significant equity proceeds through asset sales, even in the most difficult times, along with our return in the equity market since last quarter, leaves us confident that we'll be able to keep the balance sheet in a position of strength as a natural deleveraging when the senior housing recovery returns us to well within our historical target levels in the not-too-distant future. 
Lastly, moving to our second quarter outlook. Last night, we provided an outlook for the second quarter of net income attributable to common stockholders per diluted share of $0.31 to $0.36, and normalized FFO per diluted share of $0.72 to $0.77 per share. As I noted earlier, this guidance does not take into consideration any further HHS funds or similar government programs in the U.K. and Canada. So when comparing sequentially to our first quarter normalized FFO per share, it's better to use the $0.70 per share number I mentioned earlier in my comments, which excludes the benefits of these programs as well. On this comparison, the midpoint of our second quarter guidance of $0.745 per share represents a $0.045 sequential increase from 1Q. The $0.045 increase is composed of a $0.02 increase per share increase from our senior housing operating portfolio, driven by an increase in sequential average occupancy and expected reduction in COVID costs; a $0.025 per share increase in net investment activity, as strong post quarter investments is offsetting the initial dilution from loan reductions and operator transitions related to Genesis; a $0.01 increase in NOI from triple-net and outpatient medical segments; and this is offset by the expected $0.01 increase in sequential G&A, driven mainly by new hires. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Shankh."

And so people want to know what the snapback is going to look like. 
My estimates are down 30% versus pre COVID because of all this noise. And so I guess the way I would ask the question is, if you can't give trajectory, what would disappoint you in terms of getting back to square one?

But I'll just address the question, is any definitive answer for our end is as much of a guess from us as it is from you, right? So just understand there's no historical precedence to what's going on. We're simply telling you, if we go back asset by asset to where the NOI of these assets were, I think it's an important exercise because we have sold a lot of assets, bought a lot of assets, so it's very hard for you to figure out from our supplement what the number looks like. So we try to answer that question that if we just went back for the stabilized pool of assets to Q4 of '19, what will the NOI look like? And we add the filler portfolio and stabilize that, what does that combined look like?
Now I cannot answer the question, whether it's 2 years or 4 years or -- you've got to really put that in the context and your expectation. However, I will say this, and it's a very important point. It is to a Q4 2019 rent level a.k.a. that if you assume that this will be expanded out, let's just say it will take 4 years from today to get to that stabilized level of NOI. So it's going to stabilize in 2026. You have to assume the rent of the business remains flat to achieve that NOI, right, which we don't think obviously is happening. 
We have continued to say that we expect that rent growth will hold up. Right? So you might get it later, but you will get x number of years of rent growth to get added to that. Obviously, that rent growth has a contribution margin that's very high and it falls to the bottom line. On the other hand, if we say, okay, we're going to get that earlier, you are not going to get as much rent growth. You will only get, just say that you decide that you're going to get there in 2 years, right, I'm making this up. And 2 years up, so you will only get the rent growth from '19 to '23 instead of '19 to '26.
So I'm pointing out that there are many levers here that you have to think through. The longer gestation period will bring you ultimately a higher number because of the rent growth aspect that I'm talking about versus the shorter. And that's all I'm willing to say right now. I can guess, but it is a guess. We're underwriting assets in a way that, frankly speaking, we don't need to know. That's why we're so focused on basis. If you look at our stock, it's a real estate company. You can look at what the basis looks like on a price per unit basis, and then go and think about what it takes to build that portfolio. You will see that portfolio trade had a significant discount to what it takes to build it today."

So right now, we're seeing 140 basis points below -- we were 1,400 basis points below where we were pre COVID on occupancy front. So you've just got substantially lower number of residents in the building. So if you run a kind of historical churn levels, it obviously changes occupancy builds and then move outs start to kind of match historical levels. But as historical churn levels, you should be running at around 80% of kind of indexed historical levels of move outs. If that gets elevated a bit, we've talked about this from a higher acuity resident moving in during COVID. That probably moves to mid to upper 80s. But that can stay, I think, pretty consistent through a recovery. It is tough looking at the last kind of 6 months ticking through what has been natural move-outs and what's been really -- certainly a spike we've seen from COVID in the December, January, February period. I think what you're starting to see in March is a return to that kind of 80% level that we would expect, again, giving historical type of churn. But it's certainly something we're watching pretty closely.But from just a level of kind of the comment I made last quarter was from a level of occupancy in the buildings. That move-out percentage, getting back to historical levels of 2019 levels of move-ins, you can drive 80, 90 basis points a month in occupancy by just getting back there because the move-outs are going to be lower, purely mathematically based off the occupancy level."

First is the $10 billion number I mentioned, obviously, is a multiyear opportunity, not a 1-year opportunity, right? So I just want to clarify that. But you're right in that expansion with obviously expanding with HC-One, this transaction expands that opportunity. I want you to understand, as I've said in my prepared remarks, that this investment is not just a financial investment, it's a strategic investment. 
And we looked at the company, its footprint, its management, and we see an opportunity that fills a big hole in our portfolio. Our portfolio in U.K. is very focused on high end, and we didn't have the value option. And there is a tremendous opportunity to grow in that value option, which we think we'll be able to execute through the HC-One platform. We structured the investment in the 3 tranches that we talked about. We don't go into an investment thinking we'll do debt, we'll do equity, we'll do mez or participating equity or cash. That's not how we think about it. We just look at an opportunity first. Think about what is the first asset opportunity and strategic opportunities, then think about how we get to invest capital so that we can be aligned with our partners. That's a very different approach than it's an asset and we've got to buy it, are we going to lend to it. That's just not how we think.
And it is the right risk-adjusted return. You look at an asset or a collection of assets or portfolio and you think about what -- where in the capital structure yields the best risk-adjusted return for your investors. Remember, there are different investors in the, obviously, the spectrum of this transaction. There is $235 million of equity on top of us, which obviously Safanad-led investment group, that includes [ Fanning ] and others, they're obviously bringing in, and they think there's an extraordinary opportunity to create value for their capital, right? 
So that's a very important point. Now going back to the -- sort of the pipeline, the pipeline is primarily today is senior housing, and the pipeline is very much what we talked about. It's significant. It's very robust. It's large. And it reflects a very significant discount to replacement cost. We're not going to sit here and tell you that we believe that every deal we'll do, we'll have this kind of return that we have described in HC-One, but as said before, that we think we can hit high single-digit to low double-digit IRR and that environment is still here. We don't necessarily, given our cost of capital, need to hit that. But we're still seeing many, many, many opportunities that we have under contract today that will get to you to that kind of return, which is in the high single digit, low double-digit type of IRR. Hope that helps."

It is a debt, it's structured as a lot of [ kind of ] capital deployed is debt investment, but it also comes with a very significant equity ownership through a warrant -- or future ownership through a warrant and [ kind ] ownership through the equity stakes. So that's how we thought about it. This is not an opportunistic investment. This is a strategic investment. If you look at our portfolio, you will see majority of our U.K. portfolio is kind of in that GBP 1,400 -- GBP 1,350, GBP 1,400 per week to GBP 1,600 plus per week kind of. That's our sweet spot. And we think there is a real value option needed in U.K. where on the private pay side, you can -- there's a tremendous amount of business, tremendous depth of need in, let's call it, the GBP 900 to GBP 1,000 per week. So this fills a true strategic hole that we have in our portfolio, which we have been looking for a long time, not just the last 12 months, to fill that hole. And we think this will be our platform. And as we have talked to our partners via Safanad, we have always seen it as a strategic investment. That's what we have talked to James and David, who run HC-One, and we think you will see further capital deployment activity coming through it in that segment. 
We're not going to go -- I don't want to speak for the management. I do not believe -- if suddenly they're pivoting the business going from GBP 1,000 a week to GBP 1,600 per week, that's not how the vision of the company is. The vision is to grab that demand in that segment, and there's not a lot of quality and a lot of deep provider in that segment. So that's what we see here."

But I think you will also see margin expansion from, as Tim talked about previously, we believe that you will see the margin expansion going back to the historic margins level. So it's a yin and a yang.
I will tell you one thing, though. I would highly encourage you not to look at 1 quarter or 1 month of labor costs and projecting there. This is a lot of noise and volatility around the fact that a lot of people have received the stimulus check, and that has impacted short term. We do not believe that will be sustained as this sort of -- this dries up. However, you are right that labor cost inflation will remain, but it will not be what you see in other sectors, because what you are seeing in other sectors such as lodging and all the sectors, they have laid off all their employees, the shutdown, right? That was the case. For us, our communities have never shut down. They continue to employ our -- obviously, because to take care of our residents, and that continues. Is it -- is there no issues? Absolutely not, will remain so. I would also encourage you to think about the potential immigration changes that is -- we're hearing about. Obviously, I know it less -- probably less than you do, but that also has an offsetting impact. So it's a long term problem, but just understanding the demand supply of labor as it relates to demand supply of people and also how that impacts people's other choices at home, this will all come into place.

So I think the right way to think about it is, it has been a main focus point for us. And it seems to be for investors as well.

We have been pretty quick to move to cash when we have tenants that are not paying rent. So I think looking at our in-place, looking at our coverage metrics, those are tenants that are current on rent paying us and very much are doing so because of their long-term belief in their business. 
And if anything, I think what we've seen in the first quarter from the start of a recovery, enhances that belief that there will be -- there won't be much impairment here. I think the other key here is, I think, the difference between cash flow and value. And the underlying assets, I think you're seeing this across the board, are holding value. So the impairment to cash flow, I think, is short term. That speaks to the view there's a recovery.

And we have to assume that people will do things that is economically beneficial to them. If you look at how much the costs have changed, let's just say -- let's just talk about cost in the last 3 years. You have places in the coast, costs are probably up 20-plus percent, low 20%. And if you look at some of the locations in, pick Dallas, Charlotte, Nashville, cost is up between 30% and 35%. The housing market is very significantly impacting not just the cost of lumber, which is everybody is talking about, but the cost and availability of labor. Right? So if you -- that's sort of one big impact and a development model is a highly leveraged model, right? So if you thought you're going to make 7% yield on cost and suddenly now looks like 5%, you are in trouble. But on the other hand, if you see what's going on, interest rate is backing up in a highly leveraged model. By definition level, development is a highly-leveraged model, with construction loans, et cetera. What you have is now interest rates backing up. So it's farther eating into your pro forma. And those 2 combinations, assuming people don't develop for fun, they want to develop to make money, that proposition is increasingly becoming very difficult. This is an industry-wide comment. This is not -- I'm not suggesting, see if you can go and develop a building in a given location and can't make money. That's not the point. 
As an industry-wide, it is becoming much more difficult. And assuming people who want to develop to make money, that proposition is getting much, much harder. I'm not even talking about availability of debt capital, et cetera. The attractiveness of the model has been meaningfully hit in last, call it, 3 years, particularly last 12 months, as housing has just gone parabolic. So in that context, we think there will be, obviously, a lot less supply than it has been in the, call it, between '15 to '19. Also the '15 to '19, sort of the supply boom was -- frankly, was created by a lot of the players, including our company, was paid $1.20, $1.5 on the dollar on the basis. I do not see those participants in the industry anymore. People are very, very -- people who are involved in buying assets today, they're very focused on the right basis. And a lot of the sort of the take out premium is meaningfully gone from the industry as well. So if we put all of those things together, we think that it is reasonable to expect. You can never accurately forecast what the future will look like. It is reasonable to expect that supply in next 5 years will be a lot less than last 5 years, but it is a guess, nonetheless. 
And we do think that will impact the rent growth, which is the point I was trying to make on the $480 million, is that is the beauty of basis. I highly encourage all of you to look at what is the implied per basis value of Welltower. And if you have to make that basis a number, what rent do you need, versus what it takes to build and to make some minimum acceptable return, call it, 7%, whatever you think is the development yield should be and what is the rent. And you will see what it takes to build on our -- today in our company, there's a huge gap between the potential reward -- rent, what's potential to bring new supply versus what you can get. That's not just a Welltower problem. I'm saying existing inventory versus the new inventory, and that will give you much more insight into what the rental may or may not be."

So there are many ways you can do this. If you keep the assets under lease, you can give obviously short-term rate and -- but you can create 2 years out, 3 years out, depending on the level of EBITDA. You can do all",579,"Yes. That's a very good question, Tayo. So there are many ways you can do this. If you keep the assets under lease, you can give obviously short-term rate and -- but you can create 2 years out, 3 years out, depending on the level of EBITDA. You can do all bells and whistles to recoup that rent as cash flow comes back. And that's the point we were trying to make. Remember this is -- cash flow is now starting to come back, right? So that's sort of if you retain it, obviously, in the lease. Remember, these leases are not -- there's nothing behind the leases. There's a propco interest sits behind the leases. So you have a value protection.
If you go to RIDEA, right, we are not afraid, Tayo, to get -- take a rent stance and if that is what, what is the sustainable level of rent from the sustainable level of production, right? You saw that we bought a new -- we did a -- we bought a bunch of new assets in the quarter -- reported quarter where we did a triple-net lease with a highly respected operator. In that particular case, you would say, why didn't they do a RIDEA? Because if you look at in that portfolio, what we bought, the rent before us was substantially higher, right, 50% higher that you are paying to the previous landlord. 
Our rent is much lower. We set it in our way. But then we have some sort of a catch-up. Our rent goes up, not by 3%, but as the EBITDA comes back significantly, and the EBITDA is already moving in that direction, we have a provision to get some more rent. It is also, for the operator, at some point, they were paying 50% higher rent. And they will end up probably paying from the current rent level, 10% more, 15% more, but they will keep rest of the cash flow, right? So it works out on both sides. Why does it work out on both sides? Because the basis is lower. The issue is not -- a lease is fundamentally a form of a leverage and if you put the basis in the assets so much higher, and then you put a high LTV loan or high LTV credit for the lease, you are kind of creating problems from two ends. In this case, it's a very low basis that helps both parties, the owner as well as the operators, to make money going forward. 
Going back to your specific question, there's a lot of collateral that sits behind these leases from this specific issue that Juan and Connor, and now you're asking about. This particular operator, which is one of the most respected operators in our space, has a substantial amount of propco interest that they have created through a very significant development machine through '90s. And that propco interest sits behind that lease. So let's just say, you can do it from a lease. This is just a general statement, or you can go to a RIDEA, right? If you go to a RIDEA the ownership will change and will reflect the fact that their future liability is lower, a.k.a. we lost an asset. And we have enacted that, backed that lease, and we have an opportunity in that restructuring to own more of the real estate, not the same amount. That's the way to think about it."

I hope all of you and families are safe and healthy. Before I make some introductory comments on the state of senior housing and on capital allocation environment, I want to welcome John Barker, our Chief Opera",1994,"Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I hope all of you and families are safe and healthy. Before I make some introductory comments on the state of senior housing and on capital allocation environment, I want to welcome John Barker, our Chief Operating Officer, to this call. John joined Walltower last week after luster 25-year career at Ethics. We believe he will make a tremendous long-term impact on our platform.
Following my remarks, as usual, Tim will walk you through our operating and financial results. We're cautiously optimistic on the senior housing business as occupancy is starting to build, and we're encouraged by nearly 200 basis points of spot-to-spot occupancy growth in second quarter, which clearly exceeded our expectations. Momentum in the U.S. continued to be strong with leads generation returning to pre-COVID levels, resulting in a 280 basis point occupancy gain in the quarter. and the U.K. remained resilient despite a rise in the Delta variant cases being driven by the younger cohorts.
Though we are monitoring the situation closely, we have seen very little impact to the portfolio so far as the U.K. case counts more broadly appear to be decreasing rapidly after recent spike. While Canada was a drag on occupancy, we're witnessing some green shoots following a material decline in COVID cases. In fact, towards almost doubled in June from April and May in Canada as provinces have move-in restrictions and are now permitting in-person tours.
For our overall portfolio, June was a particularly impressive month with move-ins exceeding 2019 level for the first time since the beginning of pandemic. I'm also encouraged that our operators were able to achieve these occupancy gains while holding rates, reflecting the need-based nature of our asset class and strong value proposition of this business. Year-over-year, same-store report is up 3.2% across our assisted living properties, 2.8% across our independent living properties and 5.3% across our wellness housing communities.
This trend in same-store RevPAR was primarily driven by our high stand luxury product in primary total markets. Having said that, I'll caution you that there is still significant uncertainty and many unknowns related to the path of COVID, and it is too early to signal an all clear.
However, we're very pleased with the progress that we're making towards achieving the substantial embedded NOI growth in our show portfolio. Last quarter, we provided details of nearly $0.5 billion of NOI upside, which assumes a return to fourth quarter 2019 occupancy and margin levels.
We are pleased to report that we not only achieved $71 million towards this total goal in one quarter, but also added another $29 million of potential upside through the second quarter acquisition and development deliveries. Going forward, we still have another $430 million of NOI upside in that business. Again, this only assumes a return to pre-COVID occupancy with potential upside from higher rates and return to frictional vacancy, which is mid- to high single digits.
Turning to capital allocation. Last fall, when we have made a significant pivot from defense to offense, we made an explicit bet that consumers will return to this Nutrien business. with 400 basis points of occupancy ramp in U.S. from March trough with healthy rates, it appears that we're on the right side of that bet.
Over the past 3 quarters, we have deployed $4 billion of capitals at extremely attractive pricing during a time when others were fearful. But we remain paranoid optimist and our humility and lack of complacency are pushing us to test our hypothesis and underwrite everything we look at with conservatism.
And you can rest assured that we look at pretty much everything in our space. Therefore, we are only willing to pay a price by unit that does not require everything to go right for our owners to make a reasonable return. The second quarter was one of the best quarters in -- from a capital deployment perspective, having closed approximately $1.4 billion of gross investments.
Q3 will likely top Q2, and we have anticipated that it will be another record quarter of investment activity for the company. We started Q3 with the bang. And so far in July, we have already closed $230 million of gross investments and expect our previously disclosed holiday transaction to close in third quarter as well.
While it is fun to talk about large transactions like holiday, which I'll get to you in a minute, I want to point out that our core strategy and strength is granular transaction with a diverse group of our operating partners and is supported by our data analytics platform.
Our COVID class, which I define as anything we bought since starting to offense in Q4 of last year, now exceeds $4 billion of gross investment activity, including holiday across 37 transactions with 24 unique partners. In the U.S., that would, on average, be a $16.6 million per community or $161,000 per unit, which we believe represents a significant discount to replacement cost.
The pipeline remained very strong with many owners and operators eager to join our operator and data platform. Let me give you some examples. First, I'm very pleased to announce that we'll expand our relationship with John Moore and his team at Atria while Lilly and her team and Holiday will join our platform who are buying nearly identical holiday independent living assets at more approachable end of senior living spectrum with an addition of 6 more combination AL/IL assets for a total consideration of $1.58 billion or $152,000 per unit.
Our base remains compelling even after our anticipated investment of $1.5 million to $2 million of CapEx per community to bring them to tomorrow standards. While these -- the lease-up of this portfolio from the compelling basis should generate a double-digit unlevered IRR, we believe there are a few opportunities to enhance our return. Number one, our underwritten rent growth is 2.5% per year despite a heavy investment in the portfolio that will improve the asset quality and marketability. 
Our 2026 underwritten rent remains $700 to $800 below feasibility rent to make development pencil. Two, we have a significant expansion opportunity in 10-plus assets, which we expect will generate a double-digit return on invested capital.
Three, the optimization of 6 AL buildings under Atria platform; and fourth, there are at least 5 higher and better use opportunities. And a couple of them are so significant that they may generate enough proceeds to pay for a significant portion of the CapEx investment for the whole portfolio.
If we are successful in this effort, we'll have a completely renovated portfolio at roughly our going-in basis, which will enhance our IRR materially.
Moving on from holiday, I'd like to make a few operator specific comments on this call. First, where we continue to be encouraged by Jack Callison leadership at Sunrise. Jack is refocusing the organization as a premier senior living brand in North America.
We are excited about this focused growth strategy and have brought Sunrise in to run a recently occurred community in the Philadelphia metro area. This is our first acquisition initiative with Sunrise in several years and believe we'll have many opportunities to grow together.
In the U.K., Sunrise platform and portfolio will be occurred by Signature and Care U.K. Signature is an existing Welltower operating partner, which runs our high stent communities in the U.K. We're tremendously excited to welcome U.K. to our platform, which is one of the most well-respected and largest senior living operators in the U.K. with the addition of AT1 on the value end and Care U.K. on the higher end, along with our existing operating partners, the barbell approach to portfolio construction that we have taken in the U.S., which is all -- which we always aspire to be in the U.K. is beginning to take shape.
We're very excited about Care U.K.'s technology and management platform. We're also thrilled to work on pathway living to Welltower's operating platform, which we believe opens another avenue for growth for us.
Next, I'm excited to announce our expanded partnership with Oakmont Management Group, which is one of our strongest and best operating partners. This expanded partnership with Courtney and our team is expected to result in a nearly doubling of our client portfolio together in California.
We're also embarking on a long-term exclusive development program together to meaningfully expand our relationship in the next decade. Fun fact, Oakmonts are first operated in our portfolio to return to the 90% occupancy mark post-COVID. A reflection of Oakmont's operating acumen and market strength.
Finally, I'm excited to announce our new partnership with Chris Smith and his team at Aspect Health. We recapped Aspect's existing MOB portfolio in Karnataka and New York and entered into a long-term development partnership with Chris. We believe a combination of our data and operating capabilities with aspects, relationships and development talent will create significant opportunities for growth for both the companies.
We are already on our first development together, which will be a 60,000 square feet outpatient medical billing look at a very attractive market in the New York metropolitan area, the property will be master leased to a leading health system for 20 years and is expected to start construction early next year.
Speaking of growth opportunities, I'm pleased to announce our continued growth with the Renna organization. In the next -- in the second quarter, our partnership closed on the first building of a large development near Norman, Oklahoma with normal retail health system. The total development cost for Phase 1 of this multiphase development is expected to be in excess of $100 million, consisting of 181,000 rentable square foot of Class A outpatient medical facilities.
Our significant MOB development platform pipeline, which is 100% leased, is now in excess of 1 million square feet and will create significant value for our shareholders in a very tight acquisition market. All of these operating and development partnerships make us the foundation for our core belief that centralized capital allocation and centralized execution releases entrepreneur energy while keeping cost and politics at bay.
We are very proud that we have formed 50 new operators and help relationships since the beginning of pandemic, and we have a handful more in the works.
The implication of our rapidly growing operator and the health platform are vast including a network effect, whereby addition of more operators create exponentially reach a data set and thus stronger and attractive and analytics platform. This dramatically enhances the informational advantage where already processes through our best-in-class did analytics platform, which forms the basis of our capital allocation decision.
Needless to say, these relationships create foundation for significant capital deployment opportunities as each one of them are attracted growth vehicles on their own right. This Lalapalooza effect of intertwining operating and data platform has created a wide and increasingly deeper moat for Welltower.
As team will speak to you in a moment, we're very pleased with our progress to further strengthen our balance sheet and liquidity profile. More specifically, our sequential adjusted EBITDA growth of roughly $50 million indicates that we're on our way to deleverage organically as senior housing recovery unfolds.
Overall, we're very happy with our execution so far in the year to create our share value for our shareholders. We're cautiously optimistic about the fundamental environment and excited about our opportunity to state to acquire and develop talent, create new relationships and attract quality partners, which should result outsized, internal and external growth for years to come.
After retooling our asset and portfolio operator and building a formidable brake analytics platform and talent base and growing with conviction following 2 negative cycles superimposed on each other, resulting from oversupply and COVID, I'm happy to say that we're emerging as a partner of choice, an employer of choice and an investor of choice on the other side of this and mic. With that, I'll pass it over to Tim. Tim?"

My comments today will focus on our second quarter 2021 results, the performance of our investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity and finally, a balance sheet and liquidity update in addition to our outlook for the third",2353,"Thank you, Shankh. My comments today will focus on our second quarter 2021 results, the performance of our investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity and finally, a balance sheet and liquidity update in addition to our outlook for the third quarter. The time of our last earnings call on April 29, we were 6 weeks into an occupancy recovery in our senior housing operating portfolio, which has seen total portfolio occupancy increased 67 basis points of March 12 lows or an average increase of 11 basis points per week.
In the 13 weeks that have followed, we have seen the occupancy recovery accelerate, adding an additional 204 basis points through July 23, at an average pace of 16 basis points per week, bringing the portfolio-wide occupancy recovery since March 12 to 271 basis points.
The recovery continues to be uneven across the portfolio, with the U.S. leading at 401 basis points since March 12, followed by the U.K. at 275 basis points. And lastly, Canada, which has seen a net decrease of 88 basis points over this time period.
We believe these geographic discrepancies will normalize over time as the reopening of both Canada and the U.K. catch up to the U.S. Looking forward, despite the uncertainty around the path of COVID in the near term, particularly rather than new variants, we continue to both gain evidence that the vaccines are exceptionally effective at protecting our residents and staff from this evolving virus, and gain confidence that the permanent demand impairment thesis that surrounded the senior housing asset class to much of the last 1.5 years is becoming significantly less probable.
Now turning to the quarter. Welltower reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.06 per diluted share and normalized FFO of $0.79 per diluted share versus initial guidance of $0.72 to $0.70 -- $0.77 per share and our June guidance update of $0.75 to $0.79 per share, which included a $5 million benefit from HHS provider relief funds.
We ultimately recognize that $5 million benefit from HHS funds and also recognized an additional $4.9 million of reimbursement payments for similar programs in Canada and the U.K. After adjusting for the impact of these funds, our normalized FFO per diluted share in the quarter is $0.77.
Now turning to our individual portfolio components. First, our triple net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats reported a quarter in arrears. So these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 3/31 2021. Importantly, our collection rate remained high in the second quarter having collected 95% of triple-net contractual rent during the period.
In our senior housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI declined 2.7% year-over-year as leases that were moved to cash recognition in prior quarters continue to comp against prior year full contractual rent received and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was 0.89x.
As I've stated in the past, the timing and slope of the recovery in our senior housing portfolio will dictate whether or not disruption from COVID to underlying fundamentals generates a short-term liquidity issue or solvency problem for certain operators.
Over the first 4 months of recovery, we observed occupancy and EBITDA trends within this portfolio that are in line with our U.S. and U.K. operating portfolios. As these recovery trends strengthened, the solvency risk for operators has decreased in tandem. And our continued strong cash rent collection in the quarter is the best evidence on behalf of us.
The value of the collateral that sits behind many of our lease agreements, continue to allow us to work with our operators to enhance near-term liquidity without impairing the value of Welltower's real estate position. Next, our long-term post-acute portfolio generated negative 1.1% year-over-year same-store growth and drilling 12 months EBITDAR coverage was 1.29x.
In the quarter, we transitioned 40 of the 51 plan Genesis transition assets to new operators, including 9 PowerBack assets transitioned to ProMedica with the 11 -- the remaining 11 scheduled to transition in the third quarter. 35 of these assets are expected to be disposed of in the third quarter. With the expected third quarter Genesis dispositions and the $75 million sales in LTAC portfolio in the quarter, Welltower's percentage in-place NOI generated from long-term post-acute segment will be reduced to 5.6% and Genesis Healthcare will represent less than 90 basis points of total company in-place NOI.
Lastly, health systems, which is comprised of our ProMedica Senior Care joint venture with the ProMedica Health System had since NOI growth of positive 2.7% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was 1.25x.
Turning to medical office. Our outpatient medical segment delivered 2.2% year-over-year same-store growth due to improved platform profitability and increased property level expense recoveries. Occupancy in our same-store portfolio ended the quarter at 94.8% a 20 basis point sequential increase versus first quarter.
The strong growth was driven by executed new leasing totaling 178,000 square feet, our highest quarter since the fourth quarter of 2019 and supported by 94% retention in the quarter as consistent renewal activity was paired with reduced vacancies. Also during the quarter, we delivered on purpose-built medical office building with the Monities Medical Center in Brooklyn along with 2 recently converted state-of-the-art MOBs in Charlotte with Atrium Health. 
These buildings totaled 449,000 square feet of fully occupied space with highly credited health systems. Now turning to our senior housing operating portfolio. Before getting into this quarter's results, I want to provide some color on the recently announced transfer of the Sunrise U.K. operating platform to 2 local operators, Signature Senior Lifestyle and Care U.K. 
We're excited to take this opportunity to deepen our local operator relationships. The Sunrise U.K. portfolio consists of 46 predominantly private pay properties located primarily in Southern England. The portfolio is being split largely by geographic focus. The properties located in Greater London moving the signature, a premium operator with its Welltowers and our relationship since 2012. And the rest of the property is moving to Care U.K. a new member of the Welltower operating family and the fourth largest independent care home operator in the U.K. with a focus on the private pay market.
Turning to government grants. In the quarter, we received approximately $5 million from the Department of Health and Human Services, Cares Act provided release fund. As we've done in past quarters, these funds are recognized on a cash basis, and as such, will flow through financials in the quarter they are received.
We are normalizing HHS funds out of our same-store metrics, however, along with any other government funds received that are not matched expenses incurred in the period they are received. In the second quarter, we were approximately $9.3 million of reimbursements normalized out of our same-store senior housing operating results.
Now turning to results for the quarter. Year-over-year same-store NOI decreased 17.6% as compared to 2Q 2020 driven by a 670 basis point decrease in year-over-year average occupancy. The COVID-related decline in occupancy that began in March of 2020 came to a halt in mid-March of this year and portfolio-wide occupancy increased by approximately 230 basis points from March 12 to the end of June, with the 190 basis points taking place in the second quarter.
The start of the occupancy recovery and the accompanying operating margin expansion has created an inflection point for bottom line results. The sequential same-store NOI increased 11.2% from the first to the second quarter.
Sequential same-store revenue was up 1.8% in Q2, driven primarily by a 40 basis point increase in average occupancy and sequential monthly RevPAR increase of 1.3%. With respect to expenses, total same-store expenses decreased 40 basis points sequentially and declined 2.9% year-over-year. I'll focus on the sequential change, and this is more relevant to trend in the current operating environment.
The 40 basis point sequential decline in operating costs was driven mainly by lower coverage costs as case counts remain near 0 for all the second quarter after spiking meaningfully in the first quarter. Costs were also driven lower sequentially by seasonal utility costs as the spring and early summer have lower utility costs relative to Q1.
The net result of the resilient rental rates and reoccupancy combined with a decrease in total expenses was a sequential margin improvement in our same-store pool of 180 basis points to 21.2%.
Looking forward to the third quarter and starting with July quarter-to-date data we have already observed, we've experienced a 40 basis point increase in occupancy through July 23, with the U.S. and U.K., up 60 and 30 basis points, respectively, while Canada is flat.
Despite the strength of the recovery so far, particularly in the U.S., we remain cautious on projecting an acceleration in trends from the second quarter to the third quarter given the continued lack of historical precedent with which to forecast and also uncertainty around Provimiriant. Despite seeing promising resilience in our U.K. portfolio over the last month as a surge in the delta vary infections amongst the general population has not been echoed amongst our resident population, there remains uncertainty, particularly around how national local authorities may react in the coming months if the surge continues or accelerates in our other geographies.
On a spot basis, we are currently projecting an approximately 190 basis point increase in occupancy from June 30 through September 30. We expect monthly RevPOR to be up 1% to 1.5% sequentially and up 2.5% year-over-year. Lastly, we expect total expenses to be up 1.5% to 2% sequentially driven by a combination of occupancy-driven labor utilization and seasonal utility costs, offset slightly by continued declines in COVID costs. 
The net result of the sequential changes will be expected flow-through margins in the mid-60s inclusive of the seasonal utility increase and mid-70s normalizing for the seasonality of utility costs. Turning to capital market activity. In June, we expanded our existing unsecured credit facility to $4.7 billion after closing on a $4 billion unsecured revolving line of credit, which replaced our previous $3 billion revolver.
The revolving facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 77.5 basis points, representing a 5 basis point improvement from pricing under our previous revolver. The facility was reported by 31 incumbent in new banks and highlights the incredible support of our banking partners.
On June 28, we completed the issuance of $500 million of senior unsecured notes due January 2029, bearing interest at 2.05%. Proceeds from the offering were used to pay down borrowings on our revolving line of credit and to pay down the remaining balance of our COVID term loan put in place in April of 2020.
Additionally, in the quarter, we stingnuished $674 million of senior unsecured notes due 2023 using proceeds from our March 25, 2021, bond issuance, improving our weighted average maturity across senior and secured notes to 8.2 years.
We continue to enhance our balance sheet strength and position the company to efficiently capitalize a robust and highly visible pipeline of capital deployment opportunities by utilizing our ATM program to fund those near-term transactions, having sold 20.1 million shares since the beginning of the second quarter via a forward sale agreement at an initial weighted average price of approximately $80 per share for expected gross proceeds of $1.6 billion. 
Since the beginning of the year, we have sold a total of 22.3 million shares of common stock via forward sale agreements, which are expected to generate a total of $1.8 billion in proceeds, of which 5 million shares were settled during the second quarter, resulting in $372 million of gross proceeds.
As capital deployment opportunities continue to materialize, we will look to fund those opportunities while maintaining ample liquidity and balance sheet flexibility.
We ended the second quarter at 6.8x net debt to adjusted EBITDA, [ 6.88x ] when adjusting out $5 million of HHS funds received in the quarter. This HHS adjusted 2Q '21 leverage number represents a 0.25x decline from the prior quarter's 7.13 debt-to-EBIT adjusted rate to HHS. 
Last quarter, I highlighted the impact that the recovery in senior housing fundamentals would have on underlying EBITDA and cash flow-based leverage metrics. We are encouraged to see this trend take shape as a 15% sequential improvement in EBITDA contribution from senior housing operating drove the entirety of the HHS adjusted improvement in debt to EBITDA.
With total portfolio occupancy sitting at 74.6% at quarter end, 12.6% below pre-COVID levels and approximately 16.6% and below peak levels achieved prior to last decade supply wave, we believe the stage is set for powerful EBITDA recovery as occupancy upside is coupled with margin expansion of a very depressed base.
Lastly, moving to our third quarter outlook. Last night, we provided an outlook for the third quarter of net income attributable to common stockholders of per diluted share of $0.44 to $0.49 and normalized FFO per diluted share of $0.78 to $0.83. This guidance does not take into consideration any further HHS funds or similar government programs in the U.K. and Canada.
So when comparing it sequentially to our second quarter normalized outlook per share, it'd be better to use the as-adjusted $0.77 per share number I mentioned earlier in my comments, which excludes the out-of-period benefits of those programs as well. On this comparison, the midpoint of our third quarter guidance $0.85 per share represents a $0.035 sequential increase from 2Q.
This $0.035 increase is comprised of a $0.03 per share increase from our senior housing operating portfolio driven by an increase in sequential average occupancy and expected reduction in COVID costs. A $0.02 per share increase from strong net investment activity, highlighted by the expected closing of the holiday senior living portfolio during the third quarter, result in dilution from dispositions related to our previously communicated reduction in exposure to Genesis and $0.5 million increased NOI from recently converted developments, mainly 2 fully leased MOBs in Charlotte, North Carolina and Brooklyn.
These increases are offset by a $0.01 per share increase in sequential G&A driven mainly by new hires and a $0.01 dilution from shares settled in the second quarter. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Shankh."

Now you're asking me to speculate. So I will speculate but it's a speculation nonetheless. But if you think about the occupancy as we get back sort of to the more stabilized occupancy level, you just call it high 80%. I think you will see significant pricing power even above what you have seen sort of this quarter -- or this particular quarter.
Let me remind you, through the supply cycle, sort of call it from '15 to '19, when our occupancy has gone down we have still raised rates about 4%, right, in face of a supply cycle, which I expect the setup is completely different this cycle or this decade forward where you have better demand and probably in a better environment for supply as well.
So is it -- should we see once stabilization happens, greater pricing power, we absolutely should but it remains to be seen. As I will tell you, one of the things that we interestingly watch is the very tight correlation of housing price appreciation and pricing power in the senior housing industry.
And we have seen significant increase of record household sort of wealth growth and that hasn't really translated so far into senior housing pricing. We're probably starting to see some of that this quarter, but it will come through."

That's a very, very good question. So we continue to believe, as I said before, that you will see some supply but you will not see this cycle, we believe that supply will face demand instead of demand chasing supply like you have seen last decade. 
If we see no supply, we have bigger issues, right, that says that we're the only people who actually see the business and everybody else's missing, that's not how it is going to happen. But I wouldn't react to short-term high-frequency data on these things because this data is obviously -- comes with a lot of errors and noises. The similar types of data that we have in supply would have told you that occupancy for us for the quarter will be down with negative pricing. That clearly didn't happen.
So I wouldn't react too much to this high-frequency data from 1 or 2 providers. I will tell you that forget about what others are doing, we are looking at a lot of development, and they're very, very hard to pencil. They're very hard to pencil given feasibility rent remains between 20% and 30% below depending on different markets. And that's just a question of how much rents are sort of cost has gone down -- cost has gone up. And a high-frequency indicator like lumber price on your Bloomberg screen doesn't tell you that it has changed significantly.
You've got to look at a long-term average and people's ownership of that, that's sitting in the warehouse as it hasn't shown up yet. Will it show up? Probably, it will show up at some point. But that's it. At the same time, we're seeing a lot of other product cost is going up. The country is significantly undersupplied on overall housing, and you will see housing starts will continue to go up with the demand of the different materials. So I think that a lot of lessons have been learned on the bank side, losing a lot of money in this space, a lot of equity has lost a lot of money. Clearly, you can see where we're buying products, new products. at significantly below replacement cost and the gap between where we are buying, call it, $0.60 on the dollar and the $0.10 is somebody lost a lot of money, right? And so it was -- obviously, these lessons will be remembered in the near term as the demographic catch on. But we are very much very much aware of what you are saying. This is why we so focus on price per unit.
And that's why I made the point I made during my prepared remarks that we're not willing to buy anything and everything, even if we think it's a decent deal because in many cases, a lot of these things as a long-time investor in the space, a lot of these things need to go right over a period of time for us, our shareholders to make money, and that's not that kind of investment I do make."

You're still -- remember, the NOI has troughed last quarter, it's still coming down, right, from a trailing 4 quarter basis is how you report coverages, which means the better quarters are getting out of numbers and what quarters are getting in the numbers. Due mostly speaking, in a normalized -- in a stabilized environment, coverage should give you the state of the business. At inflection points like this where you got sharp decrease and sharp increases it will not give you the state of the business. There's just like our other operators that you're seeing in shop part of the portfolio, the fundamentals have troughed last quarter, and it's actually getting better. So for example, let's just talk about America. 
I don't want to get into this because, frankly speaking, for our investors, ProMedica covers is a relevant metric because as I have told you before, that ProMedica rent is guaranteed by the health system, the mother ship at the top end, right? So it really is a real relevant metric for our investors. However, having said that, let me make some observations about that topic.
The revenue, if you think about versus second quarter, was the highest in actually for ProMetic. For that specific business for ManorCare was the highest in the last 5 quarters. They have seen significant increase -- sequential increase in occupancy just this quarter, about 400 basis points in the skilled nursing business. And what is going on is BRI in Middle lock as we Informatica Midla selling a bunch of assets, right?
And those asset base is going through -- it has a negative EBITDA, as I talked about before when we announced the deal, and that's still flowing to the number and creating significant noise on the number side. So that is absolutely sort of going to create a lot of issues.
And also on the same side, you are seeing we added 9 power back building that is getting integrated. So we have a lot of noise. I will tell you, let's take a step back and think about where the business is trending. Business, as I said, their second quarter revenue was the highest actually in the last 5 quarters, business is getting better.
ProMedica team, senior care team is doing exactly what we laid it out that will happen, which is creating new partnership with different systems. We announced it. They announced a new partnership with MetroHealth in Cleveland. There's another one, they sign a joint venture, which I'm not the Liberty and naming name right at this point, a premier system at the country business is moving forward. But as far as well our shareholders are concerned, that trend is guaranteed by the mother ship, which obviously is a very significant system with $2-plus billion of cash and material $7 billion of revenue.
So I don't want to get into that conversation. Remember, at this point in Janus not just talking about ProMedica, but any triple net leases will not reflect the state of the business because of the 4 quarter trailing nature of how we report coverages.
From a standpoint of your second question, I think Tim touched on it. I will still say again, we have told you before that we believe that our leases are backed by a material amount of credit and assets that we own in joint venture and other assets owned by the operators.
We do not believe there will be significant disruption of earnings and cash flow coming out of that. And our belief that statement is getting stronger and stronger every day. That's how much I'm willing to talk about any specific operator at this call."

It's about what comes next. That's the point I was trying to make on the coverage metrics, right? It's the state of what's happening now and what's happening next, not what happened yesterday. Having said that",472,"Thank you, Juan. I completely agree with you. It's about what comes next. That's the point I was trying to make on the coverage metrics, right? It's the state of what's happening now and what's happening next, not what happened yesterday. Having said that, I'll tell you, it's important to understand when we talk about acquisition, unlike many companies, we don't talk about what's under contract unless it is a very large transaction that shareholders should know about. Holiday is a very good example.
So the $4 billion or so of COVID Class is transaction which we have closed. We could have given you a significantly higher number of the transaction we have taken our hands on. So pipeline, I know you understand that, but I wanted to make a very concerted effort to make that point again because it's very different from how most other companies report their numbers.
So the pipeline, let's just talk about pipeline, which is where we have shaken hands, we have agreed on a transaction and it's just going through the process. Real estate transactions take a long time to close, as you know, we're pretty quick, quicker than probably most other organizations that you'll meet, but we're also extremely thorough, right?
So it takes time. We visit every property that we buy. So it takes time. So let's just talk about that pipeline, which we define as something that's under contract. That's visible, that is significant and it's under contract. So we feel very, very good about continued momentum on the acquisition side. So let's talk about the shadow pipeline, which I define as something that we are negotiating right now that is also significant and visible.
And I think you will see continued acquisitions at very, very favorable price. As I've said before -- going forward, as I've said before, we're driven by value of acquisition, not volume of it, right? So as long as we can create value, we'll continue to occur. And if we see that market prices have moved to a place where it doesn't make sense, we will not. And for -- it could be a lead service, but you can look at our history and you will see that we have exactly done that. We have moved with market pricing.
And if market pricing has got into a place where we think it doesn't make sense, we sold assets. So near term, we see a tremendous amount of opportunities by this -- all this disruption in the market. And we are seeing tremendous opportunity because there are several operators and developers want to join our platform to access the data that we talked about for several quarters on this call. So sum it all together, I'm very, very optimistic about capital deployment opportunities at very attractive price in Tumi."

Look, I mean, when we made last year this bet, for example, I'll tell you this is exactly a year 1-year mark when we first have started this discussion with Oman how to grow this business significantly as a partnership yesterday marked exactly 1 year. The times are scared, right?
I mean, there's no question about it. Occupancy was falling like Iraq. EBITDA, obviously, was going down materially given on the high operating leverage in the business. But we had unwavering belief that the product is needed and the consumers will return, right? That doesn't mean that we knew for sure that will happen. That's the bet we made and that bet actually made sense on a risk-adjusted basis. And we talked about that over the last 4 calls.
And I am very pleased as we recognized that, that bed seems to be playing out. So how is it changing? Look, at the end of the day, if you have to think about real estate as a gamer basis. right? No matter how good the environment is or how bad the environment is, there's a floor and selling on value depending on what it costs to build.
So we are not going out to say no, it's all clear. I think that's fantastic. Let's just pay prices that are VA replacement cost and acquire as much assets because we can because we have a cost of capital that is how we run this play. Cost, we have a cost of capital, our owners have given us a cost of capital hour.
The bondholders have given us the cost of capital so that we can accrue value to our owners, not because we want to accrue value to the sellers. And that is how we have always run this place, and that is how we'll always run this place. There is no doctor opportunity. We're not significantly changing our underwriting and frankly speaking, we're a basis investor, an IRR investor.
So you might say, okay, your long-term 10-year IRR or 15-year IRR really hasn't changed. Has your near-term growth rates have changed? Yes, it has. But that doesn't translate into higher prices because we are still solving for the same IRR, and we're still really focused on what the price per unit price of food is. Hopefully, that helps you to get me how we underwrite."

It is usually the replacement cost of assisted living for a like-for-like location is higher, sometimes significantly higher. But we always invest capital relative to what the replacement cost is.
IR targets are not different. I will tell you that we have a general propensity to go with a micro market with a strong operator who have a strong hold on a product type. Going forward, as you think about, I said this before, our portfolio has a barbell approach. We want to be at a high price point high service areas, high service products in great bars to high bars to entry market, or we want to be on the lower sort of approachable end of lower price point, low service, right? 
That's kind of what our barbell approach is, and we have not changed that. So there is a lot of creativity in the shop. But usually, that's not around just a product selection that's around where you want to play in the capital structure high on to structured transaction that is not just one transaction and is done. For example, we like to build these growth vehicles that we've continued to talk about. This quarter, we talked about Oakmont and aspect. But as you can see, if you go back and look at 5 quarters ago or 6 quarters ago, we probably talked about rear organization. And you see this quarter, we started $100-plus million of MLPs, right?
So our job is not only to see, okay, where can we get that sort of the play set of play right now, which is the deep value end of the play, but also create these growth vehicles that create -- changes the growth rate through the cycle, right? That's what we are focused on.
And I'll be honest with you, Derek. I'm very, very proud of this team that has created, I think this company will have unprecedented growth that will be unmatched in its history. And I think it is relatively understood the cyclical sort of bounce of that, but I think it is fairly, fairly misunderstood on what this cycle can look like."

I hope all of you and families are safe and healthy. Before I make some introductory comments on the state of senior housing and on capital allocation environment, I want to welcome John Burkart, our Chief Operating Officer, to this call. John joined Welltower last week after an illustrious 25-year career at Essex. We believe he will make a tremendous long-term impact on our platform. 
Following my remarks, as usual, Tim will walk you through our operating and financial results. We're cautiously optimistic on the senior housing business as occupancy is starting to build, and we're encouraged by nearly 200 basis points of spot-to-spot occupancy growth in second quarter, which clearly exceeded our expectations. Momentum in the U.S. continued to be strong with leads generation returning to pre-COVID levels, resulting in a 280 basis point occupancy gain in the quarter. and the U.K. remained resilient despite a rise in the Delta variant cases being driven by the younger cohorts. 
Though we are monitoring the situation closely, we have seen very little impact to the portfolio so far as the U.K. case counts more broadly appear to be decreasing rapidly after recent spike. While Canada was a drag on occupancy, we're witnessing some green shoots following a material decline in COVID cases. In fact, tours almost doubled in June from April and May in Canada as provinces have removed move-in restrictions and are now permitting in-person tours.  
For our overall portfolio, June was a particularly impressive month with move-ins exceeding 2019 level for the first time since the beginning of pandemic. I'm also encouraged that our operators were able to achieve these occupancy gains while holding rates, reflecting the need-based nature of our asset class and strong value proposition of this business. Year-over-year, same-store REVPOR is up 3.2% across our assisted living properties, 2.8% across our independent living properties and 5.3% across our wellness housing communities. 
This trend in same-store REVPOR was primarily driven by our highest end luxury product in primary coastal markets. Having said that, I'll caution you that there is still significant uncertainty and many unknowns related to the path of COVID, and it is too early to signal an all clear. 
However, we're very pleased with the progress that we're making towards achieving the substantial embedded NOI growth in our SHO portfolio. Last quarter, we provided details of nearly $0.5 billion of NOI upside, which assumes a return to fourth quarter 2019 occupancy and margin levels. 
We are pleased to report that we not only achieved $71 million towards this total goal in one quarter, but also added another $29 million of potential upside through the second quarter acquisition and development deliveries. Going forward, we still have another $430 million of NOI upside in that business. Again, this only assumes a return to pre-COVID occupancy with potential upside from higher rates and return to frictional vacancy, which is mid- to high single digits. 
Turning to capital allocation. Last fall, when we had made a significant pivot from defense to offense, we made an explicit bet that consumers will return to this Nutrien business. With 400 basis points of occupancy ramp in U.S. from March trough with healthy rates, it appears that we're on the right side of that bet. 
Over the past 3 quarters, we have deployed $4 billion of capitals at extremely attractive pricing during a time when others were fearful. But we remain paranoid optimist and our humility and lack of complacency are pushing us to test our hypothesis and underwrite everything we look at with conservatism. 
And you can rest assured that we look at pretty much everything in our space. Therefore, we are only willing to pay a price per unit that does not require everything to go right for our owners to make a reasonable return. The second quarter was one of the best quarters in -- from a capital deployment perspective, having closed approximately $1.4 billion of gross investments. 
Q3 will likely top Q2, and we have anticipated that it will be another record quarter of investment activity for the company. We started Q3 with a bang. And so far in July, we have already closed $230 million of gross investments and expect our previously disclosed holiday transaction to close in third quarter as well. 
While it is fun to talk about large transactions like Holiday, which I'll get to in a minute, I want to point out that our core strategy and strength is granular transaction with a diverse group of our operating partners and is supported by our data analytics platform. 
Our COVID class, which I define as anything we bought since starting to offense in Q4 of last year, now exceeds $4 billion of gross investment activity, including Holiday across 37 transactions with 24 unique partners. In the U.S., that would, on average, be a $16.6 million per community or $161,000 per unit, which we believe represents a significant discount to replacement cost. 
The pipeline remained very strong with many owners and operators eager to join our operator and data platform. Let me give you some examples. First, I'm very pleased to announce that we'll expand our relationship with John Moore and his team at Atria while Lily and her team at Holiday will join our platform. We're buying 80 nearly identical Holiday independent living assets at more approachable end of senior living spectrum with an addition of 6 more combination AL/IL assets for a total consideration of $1.58 billion or $152,000 per unit. 
Our basis remains compelling even after our anticipated investment of $1.5 million to $2 million of CapEx per community to bring them to tomorrow standards. While these -- while the lease-up of this portfolio from the compelling basis should generate a double-digit unlevered IRR, we believe there are a few opportunities to enhance our return. Number one, our underwritten rent growth is 2.5% per year despite a heavy investment in the portfolio that will improve the asset quality and marketability.  
Our 2026 underwritten rent remains $700 to $800 below feasibility rent to make development pencil; two, we have a significant expansion opportunity in 10-plus assets, which we expect will generate a double-digit return on invested capital; three, the optimization of 6 AL buildings under Atria platform; and fourth, there are at least 5 higher and better use opportunities. And a couple of them are so significant that they may generate enough proceeds to pay for a significant portion of the CapEx investment for the whole portfolio. If we are successful in this effort, we'll have a completely renovated portfolio at roughly our going-in basis, which will enhance our IRR materially.  
Moving on from Holiday, I'd like to make a few operator specific comments on this call. First, we continue to be encouraged by Jack Callison leadership at Sunrise. Jack is refocusing the organization as a premier senior living brand in North America. We are excited about this focused growth strategy and have brought Sunrise in to run a recently acquired community in the Philadelphia metro area. This is our first acquisition initiative with Sunrise in several years and believe we'll have many opportunities to grow together. 
In the U.K., Sunrise platform and portfolio will be acquired by Signature and Care UK. Signature is an existing Welltower operating partner, which runs our highest end communities in the U.K. We're tremendously excited to welcome Care UK. to our platform, which is one of the most well-respected and largest senior living operators in the U.K. with the addition of HC-One on the value end and Care UK. on the higher end, along with our existing operating partners, the barbell approach to portfolio construction that we have taken in the U.S., which is all -- which we always aspire to be in the U.K. is beginning to take shape. We're very excited about Care UK.'s technology and management platform. We're also thrilled to work on pathway living to Welltower's operating platform, which we believe opens another avenue for growth for us. 
Next, I'm excited to announce our expanded partnership with Oakmont Management Group, which is one of our strongest and best operating partners. This expanded partnership with Courtney and our team is expected to result in a nearly doubling of our client portfolio together in California. 
We're also embarking on a long-term exclusive development program together to meaningfully expand our relationship in the next decade. Fun fact, Oakmont is the first operator in our portfolio to return to the 90% occupancy mark post-COVID. A reflection of Oakmont's operating acumen and market strength. 
Finally, I'm excited to announce our new partnership with Chris Smith and his team at Aspect Health. We recapped Aspect's existing MOB portfolio in Connecticut and New York and entered into a long-term development partnership with Chris. We believe a combination of our data and operating capabilities with Aspect's relationships and development talent will create significant opportunities for growth for both the companies. 
We are already on our first development together, which will be a 60,000 square feet outpatient medical billing located at a very attractive market in the New York metropolitan area, the property will be master leased to a leading health system for 20 years and is expected to start construction early next year. 
Speaking of growth opportunities, I'm pleased to announce our continued growth with the [ Remnar ] organization. In the next -- in the second quarter, our partnership closed on the first building of a large development near Norman, Oklahoma with normal retail health system. The total development cost for Phase 1 of this multiphase development is expected to be in excess of $100 million, consisting of 181,000 rentable square foot of Class A outpatient medical facilities. 
Our significant MOB development platform pipeline, which is 100% leased, is now in excess of 1 million square feet and will create significant value for our shareholders in a very tight acquisition market. All of these operating and development partnerships make us the foundation for our core belief that centralized capital allocation and decentralized execution releases entrepreneurial energy while keeping cost and politics at bay.
We are very proud that we have formed 50 new operators and development relationships since the beginning of pandemic, and we have a handful more in the works. 
The implication of our rapidly growing operator and developer platform are vast including a network effect, whereby addition of more operators create exponentially richer data set and thus stronger and attractive analytics platform. This dramatically enhances the informational advantage where already processes through our best-in-class data analytics platform, which forms the basis of our capital allocation decision. 
Needless to say, these relationships create foundation for significant capital deployment opportunities as each one of them are attractive growth vehicles on their own right. This Lollapalooza Effect of intertwining operating and data platform has created a wide and increasingly deeper moat for Welltower. 
As Tim will speak to you in a moment, we're very pleased with our progress to further strengthen our balance sheet and liquidity profile. More specifically, our sequential adjusted EBITDA growth of roughly $50 million indicates that we're on our way to deleverage organically as senior housing recovery unfolds. 
Overall, we're very happy with our execution so far in the year to create per share value for our shareholders. We're cautiously optimistic about the fundamental environment and excited about our opportunity set to acquire and develop talent, create new relationships and attract quality partners, which should result outsized, internal and external growth for years to come. 
After retooling our asset and portfolio operator and building a formidable data analytics platform and talent base and growing with conviction following 2 negative cycles superimposed on each other, resulting from oversupply and COVID, I'm happy to say that we're emerging as a partner of choice, an employer of choice and an investor of choice on the other side of this pandemic. 
With that, I'll pass it over to Tim. Tim?"

My comments today will focus on our second quarter 2021 results, the performance of our investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity and finally, a balance sheet and liquidity update in addition to our outlook for the third",2356,"Thank you, Shankh. My comments today will focus on our second quarter 2021 results, the performance of our investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity and finally, a balance sheet and liquidity update in addition to our outlook for the third quarter. At time of our last earnings call on April 29, we were 6 weeks into an occupancy recovery in our senior housing operating portfolio, which has seen total portfolio occupancy increase 67 basis points of March 12 lows or an average increase of 11 basis points per week. 
In the 13 weeks that have followed, we have seen the occupancy recovery accelerate, adding an additional 204 basis points through July 23, an average pace of 16 basis points per week, bringing the portfolio-wide occupancy recovery since March 12 to 271 basis points. 
The recovery continues to be uneven across the portfolio, with the U.S. leading at 401 basis points since March 12, followed by the U.K. at 275 basis points. And lastly, Canada, which has seen a net decrease of 88 basis points over this time period. 
We believe these geographic discrepancies will normalize over time as the reopening of both Canada and the U.K. catch up to the U.S. Looking forward, despite the uncertainty around the path of COVID in the near term, particularly rather than new variants, we continue to both gain evidence that the vaccines are exceptionally effective at protecting our residents and staff from this evolving virus, and gain confidence that the permanent demand impairment thesis that surrounded the senior housing asset class to much of the last 1.5 years is becoming significantly less probable. 
Now turning to the quarter. Welltower reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.06 per diluted share and normalized FFO of $0.79 per diluted share versus initial guidance of $0.72 to $0.70 -- $0.77 per share and our June guidance update of $0.75 to $0.79 per share, which included a $5 million benefit from HHS Provider Relief Funds. 
We ultimately recognize that $5 million benefit from HHS funds and also recognized an additional $4.9 million of reimbursement payments for similar programs in Canada and the U.K. After adjusting for the impact of these funds, our normalized FFO per diluted share in the quarter is $0.77. 
Now turning to our individual portfolio components. First, our triple-net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats are reported a quarter in arrears. So these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 3/31/2021. Importantly, our collection rate remained high in the second quarter, having collected 95% of triple-net contractual rent due in the period. 
In our senior housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI declined 2.7% year-over-year. As leases that were moved to cash recognition in prior quarters continue to comp against prior year full contractual rent received and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was 0.89x. As I've stated in the past, the timing and slope of the recovery in our senior housing portfolio will dictate whether or not disruption from COVID to underlying fundamentals generates a short-term liquidity issue or solvency problem for our triple-net operators. 
Over the first 4 months of recovery, we observed occupancy and EBITDA trends within this portfolio that are in line with our U.S. and U.K. operating portfolios. As these recovery trends strengthened, the solvency risk for operators has decreased in tandem. And our continued strong cash rent collection in the quarter is the best evidence we have of this. 
The value of the collateral that sits behind many of our lease agreements, continue to allow us to work with our operators to enhance near-term liquidity without impairing the value of Welltower's real estate position. 
Next, our long-term post-acute portfolio generated negative 1.1% year-over-year same-store growth and trailing 12 months EBITDAR coverage was 1.29x. 
In the quarter, we transitioned 40 of the 51 planned Genesis transition assets to new operators, including 9 PowerBack assets transitioned to ProMedica with the 11 -- the remaining 11 scheduled to transition in the third quarter. 35 of these assets are expected to be disposed of in the third quarter. With the expected third quarter Genesis dispositions and the $75 million sales in LTAC portfolio in the quarter, Welltower's percentage of in-place NOI generated from long-term post-acute segment will be reduced to 5.6% and Genesis Healthcare will represent less than 90 basis points of total company in-place NOI. 
Lastly, health systems, which is comprised of our ProMedica Senior Care joint venture with the ProMedica Health System had since NOI growth of positive 2.7% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was 1.25x. 
Turning to medical office. Our outpatient medical segment delivered 2.2% year-over-year same-store growth due to improved platform profitability and increased property level expense recoveries. Occupancy in our same-store portfolio ended the quarter at 94.8%, a 20 basis point sequential increase versus first quarter. The strong growth was driven by executed new leasing totaling 178,000 square feet, our highest quarter since the fourth quarter of 2019 and supported by 94% retention in the quarter as consistent renewal activity was paired with reduced vacancies. 
Also during the quarter, we delivered one purpose-built medical office building with the Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn along with 2 recently converted state-of-the-art MOBs in Charlotte with Atrium Health. These buildings totaled 449,000 square feet of fully occupied space with highly credited health systems. 
Now turning to our senior housing operating portfolio. Before getting into this quarter's results, I want to provide some color on the recently announced transfer of the Sunrise U.K. operating platform to 2 local operators, Signature Senior Lifestyle and Care UK.  
We're excited to take this opportunity to deepen our local operator relationships. The Sunrise U.K. portfolio consists of 46 predominantly private pay properties located primarily in Southern England. The portfolio is being split largely by geographic focus. The properties located in Greater London moving to Signature, a premium operator. With it Welltower has had a relationship since 2012. And the rest of the property is moving to Care UK a new member of the Welltower operating family and the fourth largest independent care home operator in the U.K. with a focus on the private pay market. 
Turning to government grants. In the quarter, we received approximately $5 million from the Department of Health and Human Services, CARES Act Provider Relief Fund. As we've done in past quarters, these funds are recognized on a cash basis, and as such, will flow through financials in the quarter they are received. We are normalizing HHS funds out of our same-store metrics, however, along with any other government funds received that are not matched to expenses incurred in the period they are received. 
In the second quarter, approximately $9.3 million of reimbursements normalized out of our same-store senior housing operating results. 
Now turning to results for the quarter. Year-over-year same-store NOI decreased 17.6% as compared to 2Q 2020 driven by a 670 basis point decrease in year-over-year average occupancy. The COVID-related decline in occupancy that began in March of 2020 came to a halt in mid-March of this year and portfolio-wide occupancy increased by approximately 230 basis points from March 12 to the end of June, with 190 basis points taking place in the second quarter. The start of the occupancy recovery and the accompanying operating margin expansion has created an inflection point for bottom line results. 
The sequential same-store NOI increased 11.2% from the first to the second quarter. Sequential same-store revenue was up 1.8% in Q2, driven primarily by a 40 basis point increase in average occupancy and sequential monthly REVPOR increase of 1.3%. 
With respect to expenses, total same-store expenses decreased 40 basis points sequentially and declined 2.9% year-over-year. I'll focus on the sequential change, and this is more relevant to trend in the current operating environment. The 40 basis point sequential decline in operating costs was driven mainly by lower COVID costs as case counts remain near 0 for all the second quarter after spiking meaningfully in the first quarter. Costs were also driven lower sequentially by seasonal utility costs as the spring and early summer have lower utility costs relative to Q1. 
The net result of the resilient rental rates and rebounding occupancy combined with a decrease in total expenses was a sequential margin improvement in our same-store pool of 180 basis points to 21.2%. 
Looking forward to the third quarter and starting with July quarter-to-date data we have already observed, we've experienced a 40 basis point increase in occupancy through July 23, with the U.S. and U.K., up 60 and 30 basis points, respectively, while Canada is flat. 
Despite the strength of the recovery so far, particularly in the U.S., we remain cautious on projecting an acceleration in trends from the second quarter to the third quarter. Given the continued lack of historical precedence with which to forecast and also uncertainty around COVID variants. 
Despite seeing promising resilience in our U.K. portfolio over the last month as a surge in the Delta variant infections amongst the general population has not been echoed amongst our resident population, there remains uncertainty, particularly around how national and local authorities may react in the coming months if the surge continues or accelerates in our other geographies. 
On a spot basis, we are currently projecting an approximately 190 basis point increase in occupancy from June 30 through September 30. We expect monthly REVPOR to be up 1% to 1.5% sequentially and up 2.5% year-over-year. Lastly, we expect total expenses to be up 1.5% to 2% sequentially driven by a combination of occupancy-driven labor utilization and seasonal utility costs, offset slightly by continued declines in COVID costs.  
The net result of the sequential changes will be expected flow-through margins in the mid-60s inclusive of the seasonal utility increase and mid-70s normalizing for the seasonality of utility costs. 
Turning to capital market activity. In June, we expanded our existing unsecured credit facility to $4.7 billion after closing on a $4 billion unsecured revolving line of credit, which replaced our previous $3 billion revolver. The revolving facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 77.5 basis points, representing a 5 basis point improvement from pricing under our previous revolver. The facility was reported by 31 incumbent in new banks and highlights the incredible support of our banking partners. 
On June 28, we completed the issuance of $500 million of senior unsecured notes due January 2029, bearing interest at 2.05%. Proceeds from the offering were used to pay down borrowings on our revolving line of credit and to pay down the remaining balance of our COVID term loan put in place in April of 2020. 
Additionally, in the quarter, we extinguished $674 million of senior unsecured notes due 2023 using proceeds from our March 25, 2021, bond issuance, improving our weighted average maturity across senior unsecured notes to 8.2 years. 
We continue to enhance our balance sheet strength and position the company to efficiently capitalize our robust and highly visible pipeline of capital deployment opportunities by utilizing our ATM program to fund those near-term transactions. 
Having sold 20.1 million shares since the beginning of the second quarter via a forward sale agreement at an initial weighted average price of approximately $80 per share for expected gross proceeds of $1.6 billion. Since the beginning of the year, we have sold a total of 22.3 million shares of common stock via forward sale agreements, which are expected to generate a total of $1.8 billion in proceeds, of which 5 million shares were settled during the second quarter, resulting in $372 million of gross proceeds. 
As capital deployment opportunities continue to materialize, we will look to fund those opportunities while maintaining ample liquidity and balance sheet flexibility. 
We ended the second quarter at 6.8x net debt to adjusted EBITDA, 6.88x when adjusting out $5 million of HHS funds received in the quarter. This HHS adjusted 2Q '21 leverage number represents a 0.25x decline from the prior quarter's 7.13 debt-to-EBIT adjusted for HHS.  
Last quarter, I highlighted the impact that the recovery in senior housing fundamentals would have on underlying EBITDA and cash flow-based leverage metrics. We are encouraged to see this trend take shape as a 15% sequential improvement in EBITDA contribution from senior housing operating drove the entirety of the HHS adjusted improvement in debt to EBITDA. 
With total portfolio occupancy sitting at 74.6% at quarter end, 12.6% below pre-COVID levels and approximately 16.6% below peak levels achieved prior to last decade supply wave, we believe the stage is set for powerful EBITDA recovery as occupancy upside is coupled with margin expansion of a very depressed base.  
Lastly, moving to our third quarter outlook. Last night, we provided an outlook for the third quarter of net income attributable to common stockholders of per diluted share of $0.44 to $0.49 and normalized FFO per diluted share of $0.78 to $0.83. This guidance does not take into consideration any further HHS funds or similar government programs in the U.K. and Canada.  
So when comparing it sequentially to our second quarter normalized FFO per share, it'd be better to use the as-adjusted $0.77 per share number I mentioned earlier in my comments, which excludes the out-of-period benefits of those programs as well. On this comparison, the midpoint of our third quarter guidance [ $0.805 ] per share represents a $0.035 sequential increase from 2Q.  
This $0.035 increase is comprised of a $0.03 per share increase from our senior housing operating portfolio driven by an increase in sequential average occupancy and expected reduction in COVID costs. A $0.02 per share increase from strong net investment activity, highlighted by the expected closing of the Holiday senior living portfolio during the third quarter, results in dilution from dispositions related to our previously communicated reduction in exposure to Genesis. And a [ half penny ] increased NOI from recently converted developments, mainly 2 fully leased MOBs in Charlotte, North Carolina and Brooklyn.  
These increases are offset by a $0.01 per share increase in sequential G&A driven mainly by new hires and a $0.01 dilution from shares settled in the second quarter. 
And with that, I will turn the call back over to Shankh."

Now you're asking me to speculate. So I will speculate but it's a speculation nonetheless. But if you think about the occupancy as we get back sort of to the more stabilized occupancy level, you just call it high 80%. I think you will see significant pricing power even above what you have seen sort of this quarter -- or this particular quarter. 
Let me remind you, through the supply cycle, sort of call it from [ 15 to 19 ], when our occupancy has gone down we have still raised rates about 4%, right, in face of a supply cycle, which I expect the setup is completely different this cycle or this decade forward where you have better demand and probably in a better environment for supply as well.  
So is it -- should we see once stabilization happens, greater pricing power? We absolutely should but it remains to be seen. As I will tell you, one of the things that we interestingly watch is the very tight correlation of housing price appreciation and pricing power in the senior housing industry. And we have seen significant increase of record household sort of wealth growth and that hasn't really translated so far into senior housing pricing. We're probably starting to see some of that this quarter, but it will come through."

That's a very, very good question. So we continue to believe, as I said before, that you will see some supply but you will not see this cycle, we believe that supply will chase demand instead of demand chasing supply like you have seen last decade. If we see no supply, we have bigger issues, right, that says that we're the only people who actually see the business and everybody else's missing, that's not how it is going to happen. But I wouldn't react to short-term high-frequency data on these things because this data is obviously -- comes with a lot of errors and noises. The similar types of data that we have in supply would have told you that occupancy for us for the quarter will be down with negative pricing.  
That clearly didn't happen. So I wouldn't react too much to this high-frequency data from 1 or 2 providers. I will tell you that forget about what others are doing, we are looking at a lot of development, and they're very, very hard to pencil. They're very hard to pencil given feasibility rent remains between 20% and 30% below depending on different markets. And that's just a question of how much rents have -- sort of cost has gone down -- cost has gone up. And a high-frequency indicator like lumber price on your Bloomberg screen doesn't tell you that it has changed significantly. 
You've got to look at a long-term average and people's ownership of that, that's sitting in the warehouses, it hasn't shown up yet. Will it show up? Probably, it will show up at some point. But that's -- at the same time, we're seeing a lot of other product cost is going up. The country is significantly undersupplied on overall housing, and you will see housing starts will continue to go up with the demand of the different materials. 
So I think that a lot of lessons have been learned on the bank side, losing a lot of money in this space, a lot of equity, has lost a lot of money. Clearly, you can see where we're buying products, new products. at significantly below replacement cost and the gap between where we are buying, call it, $0.60 on the dollar and the $1 is somebody lost a lot of money, right? And so it was -- obviously, these lessons will be remembered in the near term as the demographic catch on. 
But we are very much aware of what you are saying. This is why we so focus on price per unit. And that's why I made the point I made during my prepared remarks that we're not willing to buy anything and everything, even if we think it's a decent deal because in many cases, a lot of these things -- as a long-time investor in the space, a lot of these things need to go right over a period of time for us, our shareholders to make money, and that's not that kind of investment I do make."

So first, coverage came down for obvious reasons, right? You're still -- remember, the NOI has troughed last quarter, it's still coming down, right, from a trailing 4 quarter basis is how you report coverages, which means the better quarters are getting out of numbers and worse quarters are getting in the numbers. Do you -- mostly speaking, in a normalized -- in a stabilized environment, coverage should give you the state of the business. At inflection points like this where you got sharp decrease and sharp increases it will not give you the state of the business. There's just like our other operators that you're seeing in SHOP part of the portfolio, the fundamentals have troughed last quarter, and it's actually getting better. 
So for example, let's just talk about ProMedica. I don't want to get into this because, frankly speaking, for our investors, ProMedica coverage is an irrelevant metric because as I have told you before, that ProMedica rent is guaranteed by the health system, the mother ship at the top end, right? So it really is an irrelevant metric for our investors. 
However, having said that, let me make some observations about that topic. The revenue, if you think about versus second quarter, was the highest actually for ProMedica. For that specific business for ManorCare was the highest in the last 5 quarters. They have seen significant increase -- sequential increase in occupancy just this quarter, about 400 basis points in the skilled nursing business. And what is going on is they are in middle of -- as we and ProMedica are in middle of selling a bunch of assets, right? And those asset base is going through -- it has a negative EBITDA, as I talked about before when we announced the deal, and that's still flowing to the number and creating significant noise on the number side. 
So that is absolutely sort of going to create a lot of issues. And also on the same side, you are seeing we added 9 PowerBack buildings that is getting integrated. So we hear a lot of noise. I will tell you, let's take a step back and think about where the business is trending. Business, as I said, their second quarter revenue was the highest actually in the last 5 quarters, business is getting better. 
ProMedica team, senior care team is doing exactly what we laid it out that will happen, which is creating new partnership with different systems. We announced it. They announced a new partnership with MetroHealth in Cleveland. There's another one, they signed a joint venture, which I'm not at the liberty at naming the name right at this point, a premier system in that the country business is moving forward. 
But as far as what our shareholders are concerned, that trend is guaranteed by the mother ship, which obviously is a very significant system with $2-plus billion of cash and material $7 billion of revenue. So I don't want to get into that conversation. 
Remember, at this point in juncture not just talking about ProMedica, but any triple-net leases will not reflect the state of the business because of the 4 quarter trailing nature of how we report coverages. 
From a standpoint of your second question, I think Tim touched on it. I will still say again, we have told you before that we believe that our leases are backed by a material amount of credit and assets that we own in joint venture and other assets owned by the operators. We do not believe there will be significant disruption of earnings and cash flow coming out of that. And our belief that statement is getting stronger and stronger every day. That's how much I'm willing to talk about any specific operator at this call."

It's the state of what's happening now and what's happening next, not what happened yesterday. Having said that, I'll tell you, it's important to understand when we talk about acquisition, unlike many companies, we don't talk about what's under contract unless it is a very large transaction that shareholders should know about. Holiday is a very good example.  
So the $4 billion or so of COVID class is transaction which we have closed. We could have given you a significantly higher number of the transaction we have shaken our hands on. So pipeline, I know you understand that, but I wanted to make a very concerted effort to make that point again because it's very different from how most other companies report their numbers.  
So the pipeline, let's just talk about pipeline, which is where we have shaken hands, we have agreed on a transaction and it's just going through the process. Real estate transactions take a long time to close, as you know, we're pretty quick, quicker than probably most other organizations that you'll meet, but we're also extremely thorough, right? So it takes time. We visit every property that we buy. So it takes time. 
So let's just talk about that pipeline, which we define as something that's under contract. That's visible, that is significant and it's under contract. So we feel very, very good about continued momentum on the acquisition side. So let's talk about the shadow pipeline, which I define as something that we are negotiating right now that is also significant and visible. And I think you will see continued acquisitions at very, very favorable price. 
As I've said before -- going forward, as I've said before, we're driven by value of acquisition, not volume of it, right? So as long as we can create value, we'll continue to acquire. And if we see that market prices have moved to a place where it doesn't make sense, we will not. And for -- it could be a lift service, but you can look at our history and you will see that we have exactly done that. We have moved with market pricing. And if market pricing has got into a place where we think it doesn't make sense, we sold assets. 
So near term, we see a tremendous amount of opportunities by this -- all this disruption in the market. And we are seeing tremendous opportunity because there are several operators and developers who want to join our platform to access the data that we talked about for several quarters on this call. So sum it all together, I'm very, very optimistic about capital deployment opportunities at very attractive price in coming quarters."

Look, I mean, when we made last year this bet, for example, I'll tell you this is exactly a year, 1-year mark when we first have started this discussion with Oakmont how to grow this business significantly as a partnership. Yesterday marked exactly 1 year. 
The times were scary, right? I mean, there's no question about it. Occupancy was falling like a rock. EBITDA, obviously, was going down materially given on the high operating leverage in the business. But we had unwavering belief that the product is needed and the consumers will return, right? That doesn't mean that we knew for sure that will happen. That's the bet we made and that bet actually made sense on a risk-adjusted basis. And we talked about that over the last 4 calls. 
And I am very pleased as you recognized that, that bet seems to be playing out. So how is it changing? Look, at the end of the day, if you -- you have to think about real estate as a game of basis, right? No matter how good the environment is or how bad the environment is, there's a floor and ceiling of value depending on what it costs to build.  
So we are not going out to say, it's all clear. I think that's fantastic. Let's just pay prices that are above replacement cost and acquire as much assets because we can because we have a cost of capital, that is how we run this play. 
Cost, just we have a cost of capital, our owners have given us a cost of capital. Our bondholders have given us the cost of capital so that we can accrue value to our owners, not because we want to accrue value to the sellers. And that is how we have always run this place, and that is how we'll always run this place. There is no doubt of opportunity. We're not significantly changing our underwriting and frankly speaking, we're a basis investor, an IRR investor. So you might say, okay, your long-term 10-year IRR or 15-year IRR really hasn't changed. Has your near-term growth rates have changed? Yes, it has. 
But that doesn't translate into higher prices because we are still following for the same IRR, and we're still really focused on what the price per unit, price per foot is. Hopefully, that helps you to get a glimpse of how we underwrite."

The biggest difference at this point if you look at July 4 holiday was a very low moving week, which is not surprising to us. Looking at June, so up 40 were a bit -- more than 40 relative -- or sorry, in July were a bit more than 40 months to date. At this point in July, we were mid 50s. So we -- call it 10-plus basis points behind kind of where we were in June. And we're 10 to 15 basis points ahead of where we were in April and May. So we're continuing to see this improvement on a trended basis. We're trying not to read too much into kind of the micro trends.

But we always invest capital relative to what the replacement cost is. IRR targets are not different. I will tell you that we have a general propensity to go with a micro market with a strong operator who have a strong hold on a product type. 
Going forward, as you think about, I said this before, our portfolio has a barbell approach. We want to be at a high price point high service areas, high service products in great barriers to high barriers to entry market, or we want to be on the lower sort of approachable end of lower price point, low service, right? That's kind of what our barbell approach is, and we have not changed that. 
So there is a lot of creativity in the shop. But usually, that's not around just a product selection, that's around where you want to play in the capital structure, how you want to structure transaction that is not just one transaction and then done. For example, we like to build these growth vehicles that we've continued to talk about. 
This quarter, we talked about Oakmont and Aspect. But as you can see, if you go back and look at 5 quarters ago or 6 quarters ago, we probably talked about [ Remnar ] organization. And you see this quarter, we started $100-plus million of MOBs, right? So our job is not only to see, okay, where can we get that sort of the play, set of play right now, which is the deep value end of the play, but also create these growth vehicles that create -- that changes the growth rate through the cycle, right? That's what we are focused on.  
And I'll be honest with you, Derek. I'm very, very proud of this team that has created, I think this company will have unprecedented growth that will be unmatched in its history. And I think it is relatively understood the cyclical sort of bounce of that, but I think it is fairly, fairly misunderstood on what this cycle can look like."

Tim will walk you through the triple net businesses, earnings guidance and capitalization. This is John's first call as he's beginning to dig into the business. So please go easy on him. Despite mediocre bottom line results, we cannot be happier with the overall results of the quarter. Just 6 months ago, many industry participants and observers were cautioning if the COVID pandemic would result in apartment impairment of demand for senior housing. 
And even most people who believe that the demand would come back were worried that with every surge of the virus, the business will take a significant step back. As it has been our experience that these surges drive revenue down, cost up, resulting in a significant hit to the bottom line. For the first time since the beginning of pandemic, we bought this trend. And despite witnessing a significant search of the Delta variant after we spoke 3 months ago, we still posted the strongest sequential revenue growth in the company's history. 
Occupancy went up 210 basis points in the quarter relative to our guidance of 190 basis points free delta, and rate growth accelerated, resulting in a 3.5% sequential increase in top line revenue across our same-store shop portfolio. 
Importantly, year-over-year revenue growth inflected positively in the U.S. and U.K. portfolio for the first time since the beginning of pandemic. This trend accelerated into September when we observed a year-over-year revenue increase for the Intacta portfolio led by U.S. and U.K., which reported a year-over-year revenue growth over 2%. 
This is particularly impressive in context of a massive delta surge. Let's reflect on why that might be the case. With nearly all resident vaccinated and staff vaccination rates approaching 90%, which is substantially higher than general population, prospective residents and their families recognized that our communities are much safer environment than alternative settings. 
You can see that in our data. In the U.S., despite a tenfold increase in the daily case counts across U.S. in July and August, the number of cases within our SHO portfolio was just 10% of peak levels observed during the prior COVID surges. A similar trend was experienced across our Canadian and U.K. portfolios for -- over the same time. 
This helped us build significant top line momentum in our business as we received the dual benefit of occupancy and rate growth, which we believe will continue into next year. In fact, I believe this trend will meaningfully accelerate into next year as we feel significant momentum in the rate environment. Despite this great top line performance, our bottom line performance was mediocre and impacted by a perfect storm across the expense stack. We had a confluence of extraordinary costs, including agency labor as COVID surged, heightened R&M, insurance costs, utility costs and other sundry costs all hitting at the same time. 
There was also an extra day in the quarter, which resulted in a mismatch of revenue and expenses as the majority of our operators charge rent on a monthly basis. Additionally, we saw a meaningful rise in paid time off as many employees took advantage of the easing travel restriction during the summer. 
The rise of COVID also resulted additional call-offs from our team members at the last minute, which drove a significant spike in the use of agency liver, which cost 2 to 3x. This situation was further complicated by the vaccination mandate, which the system is currently working through. The only good news on the expense overall is that we began to see this situation normalize in October. While it is too early to comment on exactly how long it will take for this situation to fully normalize, we need to unpack what logically will stay with us in the medium to long term and what will dissipate. 
In our opinion, base wage increases are sticky and they will likely to be here as unit cost of labor. We firmly believe Welltower's operating partners will be able to overcome this hurdle through rent increases as they offer a premium product within a premium micro market. 
The alternative of one-on-one care just got significantly more expensive. We are beginning to see the green shoots emerge as operating partners have been -- have seen expansion of labor pool with supplemental unemployment benefits rolling off and children having gone back to school. 
John will provide more details on this topic, but we believe the usage of agency liver will dissipate going forward. Our guidance for Q4 will suggest that we do not expect this situation to completely reverse, primarily because of 3 factors: One, we have a mismatch of revenue growth and expense growth as a significant portion of our annual increases happen on Jan 1. Two, after you hire people, it takes an extended period of time to go through preemployment and training process before new employees can hit the floor. And three, Delta wave, which peaked in late September is still with us even in November. 
However, none of this has changed my view that Welltower stabilized shop margin post COVID will be higher than that of pre-Covid margins. Even on a near-term basis, I do not believe the earnings power of this portfolio's 2022 exit run rate or 2023 run that has changed. I want to repeat that one more 
time. 
Even on a near-term basis, I don't believe the earnings power of this portfolio's 2022 exit run rate or 2023 run rate has changed. The based operators will rise from this difficult time stronger with significant higher market share, while many others will find this business too hard to figure out. 
We are engaged in, frankly, starkly different conversation with the management team of operators in this industry more broadly. While everyone is fatigued from the events of the past 18 months, many of our partners are working with John to rethink how technology, operational excellence, revenue optimization and data analytics can fundamentally change this business. Think of some very basic question. Unit labor is going up, but how many units do we need? Price needs to go up, but how do you differentiate price on units with a view of Central Park versus a brick wall? 
Many operators within the industry are hoping things will get better on their own. Unfortunately, hope is not a great strategy. Our intense operational focus translates directly into our capital allocation strategy. Let me restate what that is. We want to own the right assets in the right micro market with the right operator focused on right acuity and price point, and we want to own that asset at the right basis, either will buy at a discount or replacement cost or will build at an extremely targeted way at replacement cost. 
While bidding tents are pretty thin primarily with a few first time or relatively new capital, we remain extraordinarily active in off-market, privately negotiated transactions where we bring unmet certainty to close with operator and cash capital. 
As most of the situation are debt maturity driven ; nothing is more important to the seller than the certainty of close with a firm handshake. And as you know, our reputation is we don't negotiate and we don't reiterate after we have a form and shape. This approach has resulted in one of the most active quarter in the history of our company. 
We closed $2 billion of investments at a significant discount to replacement cost with expected IRRs in the high single digits to low double digits. We continued our momentum subsequent to the end of third quarter with another $1.3 billion transaction that we have signed purchase and sale agreement and that we have described in our press release. 
While they are all very important transaction, let me highlight 3 different flavors of the deal. We are excited about a $580 million transaction to buy 8 rental and 6 entrance fee communities in great micro markets. We would recall that we bought a handful of Sunrise CCRCs from SNH in 2018. 
This transaction is very similar in asset quality and location standpoint, but at a materially better price. And the previous owner has spent significant amount of capital, over $50 million in the last 5 years. We should be able to achieve a high single-digit, unlevered IRR as our operating partner, watermark leases up the communities. 
However, we think we can push this return into double-digit unlevered category as we execute a higher and better use strategy similar to what we have -- where we're embarking on our 85 Atria portfolio, 85 property Atria portfolio. 
For example, there is an extraordinary piece of land in a highly desirable residential corridor, Bellevue, Washington, that is entitled for high-density residential as of right. We can build a great vertical campus of senior or wellness living there or sell it to a multifamily developer. 
For many of these communities, their excess land, while we intend to build additional cartage style units which are already sold out in this location and get the flavor. In a separate transaction, we bought 5 Class A senior housing communities in Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic region with an extraordinary partner -- with a extraordinary operator and development group for $172 million. 
The average age of these communities is 3 years, and we expect to generate a high single-digit unlevered IRR. We also negotiated a long-term exclusive development contract with this team. I cannot wait to disclose the details of this group and our growth plan with them on our next call. But here's the teaser. This team has executed flawlessly, even during this challenging Q3 without any agency labor. 
That gives you a sense of their operating prowess. In a similar vein to new buildings, we bought 3 brand-new communities in the Midwest from a multifamily developer with new perspective, our existing operator. 
On average, these buildings are 2 years old. We feel our future pipeline is robust as we are on a 2-year line with several other granular transactions. We are also building significant momentum around redevelopment and real estate value add as John Burkart has executed a strategy at FX for over 2 decades. 
My team historically has focused on operator-oriented value-add as we frankly didn't have the right experience after somewhat underwhelming experience from our vintage transaction many years ago. Now with John and Mike Fey, our Global Head of Development in one team, redevelopment and real estate value add will be another avenue for growth going forward. Stay tuned for more.
On the relationship side, I cannot be more pleased to announce that we started 2 new development projects with Cisco, the second phase of Cardinal and Carnegie. Cisco is one of our best operators in our portfolio, occupancy incredibly bouncing already back to high 90s. I cannot be more proud to be partnering with Andy Colberg and his team to find a few more A++ micro markets where a cardinal model will be fantastically successful. 
We signed a long-term exclusive development contract with Cisco and look forward to grow this partnership over the next decade. From the success of this wonderful new addition to the exclusive pipeline agreements quarter-after-quarter, I hope that you, as our investors, now share the same belief that we truly have built a deep and wide mode around the real estate business through predictive analytics platform that is unique and unprecedented in the real estate industry. With that, I'll pass it on to John for a deep dive in operational trends. John?"

My comments today will focus on the performance of our outpatient medical and seniors housing operating portfolio. Starting with our outpatient medical. During the third quarter, our outpatient medical segment delivered 3.1% same-store revenue growth over the prior year's quarter leading to same-store NOI growth of 3.4%. 
The increases were driven by increased property level expense recovery and a reduction in bad debt. Occupancy in our same-store portfolio ended the quarter at 94.7% a 30 basis point reduction from the prior year's quarter. 
We continue to see record retention rates with the third quarter exceeding 90%. And with increasing construction costs and rising market rates, we will continue to push renewal rates and accept a reasonable level of increased turnover and related frictional vacancy as we strive to optimize top and bottom line performance and maximize the value of the portfolio. 
Now turning to our senior housing operating portfolio. I'm pleased to report that year-over-year revenue growth in our SHO portfolio turned positive in September, marking the first monthly increase since the onset of COVID-19. The strong demand-based recovery in seniors housing was led by our U.S. portfolio, which year-over-year revenue turned positive in August and our U.K. portfolio, which turned positive in September. 
The occupancy recovery, an improvement in RevPAR, which began in Q1 reflect the need-based nature of senior housing and a recognition that these communities are active, safe and social, 3 key elements to quality senior living. The U.S. continues to lead the recovery, growing occupancy 600 basis points from the trough in mid-March through September 30, followed by the U.K. at 540 basis points.
Our Canadian portfolio remains behind the U.S. and U.K. in the recovery, but posted an occupancy gain of 70 basis points in the third quarter compared to a decline in Q2. While the Delta variant has impacted staffing and related costs, it has clearly not slowed to the demand-driven recovery in occupancy and our operators' ability to drive rate growth. Year-over-year same-store NOI for the SHO portfolio decreased 14.9% as compared to Q3 2020, driven by a 200 basis point decrease in average occupancy and increased expenses in part due to the Delta spike and related impact on staffing. 
While still down versus last year, same-store NOI has improved markedly from the decline of 44% in the first quarter, a trend which should continue going forward. The increased labor costs during the quarter were driven by a host of macro factors, which led to temporary labor shortages affecting virtually all industries. 
The result was increased compensation in the form of wages, overtime bonuses and the use of agency labor as our operators have been squarely focused on both meeting the increased demand for their active safe and social communities and a refusal to compromise on the quality of care. The use of agency labor, which can be 2x to 3x more expensive than permanent employees was particularly impactful during the quarter as employees who had COVID were exposed to COVID or even had a cold -- had to call in sick, leaving agency staffing as the only option. 
As Shank alluded to, these extraordinary labor expenses are starting to abate although I expect we will still see some continued pressure for several months. I'm hearing green shoots as our operators are making comments such as the peak labor challenge has passed, or we've seen a substantial pickup in applications, our new hires outnumber the employees leaving 2.5:1. 
And even we are currently fully staffed at almost all of our communities. Going forward, obviously, I don't know how COVID will impact the economy, but we do know that the operators are increasing their rates substantially to cover the increased labor costs. Similar to the multifamily business, there can be timing issues or delay between expenses hitting the bottom line when the revenue flows through to the bottom line. 
We are seeing that right now with elevated maintenance expense, which in part relates to preparing units for occupancy due to increasing demand. Additionally, rental rates and care service reimbursements are typically adjusted annually and require 60 to 90 days notice similar to multifamily. Therefore, we continue to move forward -- therefore, as we continue to move forward in this demand-driven recovery, we expect to see the impact from these rate increases in 2022. 
Additionally, despite similar occupancy improvement across all states, which withdrew early from the -- additionally, despite a similar occupancy improvement across all states, we've seen a divergence in the impact of agency expense between states, which we grew early from the federal unemployment programs versus those which maintain supplemental benefits through the early September. 
More specifically, states opting out of these programs early saw roughly 2/3 of the incremental sequential increase in agency expense as compared to those states which maintained supplemental benefits. Finally, during the last 90 days, I've been fully immersed in the various aspects of Welltower's senior housing business, including volunteering at sites, meeting with the leadership of various operators and, of course, touring numerous properties. My experience has been consistent with my expectations, and that has found that the operators deliver a very high level of care to our residents and provide a top quality living experience. 
While the focus on care has been and continues to be very high, I believe that similar to the multifamily industry 20 to 30 years ago, there was an opportunity to modernize our senior housing business and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the operations. These efforts will further improve the resident experience, employee engagement and the financial performance of these communities, including the potential for significant margin expansion. 
Without giving away my entire playbook, renovating and reamenitizing certain communities, implementing revenue management across the portfolio and engaging in a digital transformation are just a few examples of what I'm thinking about. Being at the beginning of this coming demographic demand wave and see an array of growth and optimization opportunities across all our businesses make this a very exciting time to be at Welltower. Now I'll turn the call over to Tim."

My comments today will focus on our third quarter 2021 results. The performance of our triple net investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity and finally, a balance sheet and liquidity update in addition to our outlook for the fourth quarter. Welltower reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.42 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $0.80 per diluted share, versus guidance of $0.78 to $0.83 per share. 
Turning to our triple net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats are reported a quarter in arrears. So these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 6/30, 2021. Importantly, our collection rate remained high in the third quarter. having collected 92% of triple-net contractual rent during the period across our senior housing triple net and long-term post-acute portfolios. In our senior housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI declined 80 basis points year-over-year as a negative year-over-year impact of leases moving to cash recognition began to dissipate. 
We expect same-store NOI growth to turn positive next quarter. Trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was 0.83x. Looking forward, we expect coverage at the bottom next quarter near current coverage levels before starting the recovery in Q1. Over the first 7 months of the recovery, we've observed occupancy and EBITDAR trends within our senior housing triple net portfolio that are in line with our U.S. and U.K. operating portfolios. As these recovery trends have strengthened, the solvency risk for our operators has decreased in tandem. 
And our continued strong cash rent collection, along with the value of the collateral that sits behind many of our lease agreements, continues to provide us confidence that Welltower's real estate position remains strong. Next, our long-term post-acute portfolio generated negative 1% year-over-year same-store growth and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage of 1.25x.
In the quarter, we transitioned 11 more Genesis assets to new operators, bringing total year-to-date Genesis transitions to 48 properties. We also completed the disposition of 21 of these transition assets, bringing total year-to-date dispositions to 30 former Genesis assets, including our 9 PowerBack assets sold in the ProMedica joint venture in the second quarter, with another 14 scheduled for disposition in the coming months. 
Long-term post-acute in-place NOI concentration is now 5.4% of total portfolio in-place NOI. And lastly, health systems, which is comprised of our ProMedica Senior Care joint venture with the ProMedica Health system. We had same-store NOI growth of positive 2.8% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was 0.24x. 
The drop in sequential coverage was driven largely by the timing of HHS stimulus as the majority of HHS revenue received by ProMedica was received in 2Q '20, and this was not repeated in 2Q '21. x HHS funds 2Q '21 EBITDA was up relative to 2Q '20
as revenues grew both on a year-over-year and sequential basis. 
Our June trailing 12-month coverage also includes results of the previously announced sale of 25 assets held by the joint venture, 21 of which have already been sold to date, with the remaining 4 are expected to be completed in the coming months. These assets have contributed more than $30 million in negative EBITDA for the trailing 12 months period ending 6/30 2021. 
And thus, their disposal alone will create considerable coverage accretion on a go-forward basis. I'd also like to remind everyone that our lease is fully backed by a senior claim and the substantial real estate value held in the joint venture and also the full corporate guarantee of the ProMedica Health system. 
Turning to capital market activity. We continue to enhance our balance sheet strength and position the company to efficiently capitalize a robust and highly visible pipeline of capital deployment opportunities by utilizing our ATM program to fund those near-term transactions.
Since the beginning of the third quarter, we have sold 11.5 million shares via forward sale agreement, an initial weighted average price of approximately $84.36 per share for expected gross proceeds of $966 million. Since the beginning of the year, we have sold a total of 29.5 million shares of common stock via forward sale agreements, which are expected to generate total proceeds of $2.4 billion, of which 12.7 million shares were settled during the third quarter resulting in $1 billion of gross proceeds. 
As of the end of the quarter, we had approximately 11.8 million shares remaining unsettled, which are expected to generate future proceeds of $1 billion. Rent in the second quarter at 6.97x net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA, up slightly from an HHS adjusted 6.8x at the end of the last quarter. The uptick in leverage was a product of $1.7 billion of net investment activity completed in the quarter. 
If we run rate the impact of the investment activity completed in the quarter, pro forma net debt to EBITDA decreased to 6.82x. As a reminder, we ended the quarter with approximately $1 million one-sale equity raised on a forward basis, along with $309 million expected disposition proceeds and loan payoffs.
Our efforts to strengthen our balance sheet and improve our liquidity profile, coupled with the recovery underway in our senior housing sector have been recognized by S&P and Moody's with both rating agencies recently rating our credit outlook to stable. The upgrades validate the prudent measures Welltower has taken to mitigate risk through the pandemic and to appropriately capitalize our recent investment activity.
On a forward-looking basis, as both Shank and John have noted, we continue to be pleased with the momentum of the recovery of the senior housing operating portfolio. With portfolio occupancy ending the quarter at 76.7%, 210 basis points higher than at the end of the prior quarter, but still over 1,000 basis points below pre-Covid levels, the portfolio also sits 1,400 basis points below peak occupancy levels achieved prior to last decade supply wave, setting the stage for a powerful EBITDA recovery as occupancy upside and strong rate growth is coupled with significant margin expansion of a very depressed base. 
Lastly, moving to our fourth quarter outlook. Last night, we provided an outlook for the fourth quarter of net income attributable to common stockholders per diluted share of $0.20 to $0.25 and normalized FFO per diluted share of $0.78 to $0.83 per share. 
This guidance does not take into consideration any further HHS or similar government programs in the U.K. and Canada. So when comparing it sequentially to our third quarter normalized FFO per share to be better to use an as adjusted $0.79 per share for 3Q, which excludes $5 million in out-of-period Canadian benefits that we received in the quarter. 
On this comparison, the midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance, $0.85 represents a $0.015 sequential increase from 3Q. This $0.015 increase is composed of $0.035 of accretion from strong investment activity in the third quarter and a sequential increase in senior housing operating portfolio NOI driven by an expected 140 basis point increase in sequential average occupancy, offset by $0.02 of dilution from increased sequential G&A and increased share count from share settled in the third quarter. And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Shank."

First, despite our historic amount of capital deployment over the last few months, I'm very optimistic about the momentum into the year-end and next year. A recent prominent trend that we are starting to see that deals are bouncing back to us as buyers from buyers who need property level financing as debt market has become very skittish after recent disruption from Delta and labor challenges. We are working on 3 such transactions right now. 
Second, with the significant rise of labor and other costs, operators are left with 2 choices if they were to survive as a business, either to cut services or corners or to increase prices. We believe families understand from looking at prices of virtually all goods and services from fast food to apartment rents that there is an unprecedented upward pressure in cost.
After speaking with vast majority of our operators, I can assure you that Welltower's operating partners do not plan to diminish the level of services and care provided to our residents. So for the industry in general, recent increase in expense, it would be difficult to continue to provide quality services without an appropriate balance in revenue. 
As such, rent levels will need to be increased. The industry should not cut corners and should never lose focus on the quality of their services. Please remember, the simple mantra that there is no mission without margin. Third, our frantic pace of new hiring continues through the summer and fall for both early career as well as experience professionals. In fact, we have added 125 new colleagues since the beginning of COVID, representing a 25% increase in our overall headcount. 
We're rounding up on our campus recruitment program as we speak, and I'm delighted that this year class will be the biggest in the history of the company. With that, operator, please open the call up for questions."

Obviously, we try to put together some slides to give you some sense, right, of what happened to the people who are funding the resident, this expense. And you will see that asset inflation has never been more significant. AKA, that affordability of the product has never been better. 
So I think you are on to something, as I've tried to say without putting a number, putting those 2 slides should give you a context of how much rent increases is possible, not just near term but over a long period of time. 
And frankly speaking, as I said, right, if you think about we have a barbell strategy in our portfolio. If you go back and look at the Q4 of '19 call, this is the last call before COVID that I talked about in details of how this barbell strategy work, where you have a high-touch, high-service product in the coast, our coastal type market where you can -- where labor cost can be fully recovered and still in margin to be made. 
On the other hand, the other side of the barbell, our wellness housing portfolio, there's no labor, right? So we have gone to that. And that diversification, we have been very, very focused and very intentional. So between the 2, you will see a very significant inflation plus growth that's coming that will be funded, obviously, through the asset inflation that already has happened."

The real estate rate, if you just call it the real estate component of the rent, is not -- the street rates are lower. 
It is just that the operators are realizing that they're not competing just on price, right? They have a quality product and that quality product, people -- I don't hear from my operating partners, people are coming that I want to stay down the lane for $500 less, my operating partner, so you should go ahead and do that, right? 
We're not going to -- there's a cost to provide the services, the first-class services that we provide, right? That's just not going to happen that you'll cut it. You are not going to stay at Riccarton for Hilton Gardens price. Nothing wrong with any of those models, but that's just not the model, right? So the street rates are going up because you have demand. Look at that take what we are seeing even at this kind of late into the year when you should have seasonality, we should have come off and we haven't. 
So as operators gain momentum on the sales side, right, they're realizing that I have a special product, there's a cost, obviously, of serving that piece of occupancy, and we have to charge for it."

So I'll answer both, and I hope I can remember it. So let's just try first, it's not an increased level of interest in the CCRC communities. We are value-driven real estate investors. We saw a tremendous opportunity because of the Dart. So if I give you some details, we bought that portfolio for $195,000 a unit and with remarkable dart, right? 
So talk about West eastern New York, Dana Voin, California, Belvieu, Washington, Alexandria, that level that kind of dart. And then we thought what we can do with the dart, right? And I mentioned, obviously, there is an example of the asset came with a piece of parcel that is the last residential zoned piece of land in residential area of Bellevue, right? 
So when we look at a lot of CCRCs, we continue to -- we always have, we continue to look at -- It's just we never seen this kind of opportunity where we can do more than what we buy, not just leasing up, obviously, what we've done, but also a lot more what that can be done with the dart, right, with the current entitlement. That's why we're interested in. 
As I mentioned, I'll give you details of what I think that it can go from a high single-digit unlevered IRR to a low double-digit unlevered IRR as we execute on this. And frankly, we bought -- that's where most of our returns have been focused on. We continue to get, call it, between 9% to 12%, 13% unlevered IRR. Most of the transactions we have done and the returned life right there. 
Focused on the real estate value add, one of the big real estate value add that this company tried to do is vintage as you are well aware of the fact that hasn't played out well for us. So as I've gone through the experience, I realized that we didn't have the right talent. It's much more difficult to do it than obviously, we thought. 
And we stopped that whole focus on real estate value add in a traditional sense of the real estate. As you know, John has done this for billions of dollars of transactions and executed based on the strategy. So when we're talking to John going back a few months ago that's something that came up. And now, obviously, John, is the most into the portfolio. And he's obviously one of the most important member of our investment committee. So those opportunities, we're now ready to really expand on and really execute on.
It also adds to what I mentioned that we have built an extraordinary development team over the last 18 months under the leadership of Mike Fey. We brought in Mike over a year ago, and he has built a very large team. And so those are all -- those starts are all coming together, right? But it's a skill set we didn't have, and now we do have it."

It's an individual how you price the units. But more than that, and more than even the software. And this gets into really one of the wonderful things here is leveraging our data analytics platform because what you have to do is you have to price the units right on the amenity price and the base pricing. 
It's not just about changing the price over time. It's about pricing the base price correctly, the relationships between ones and twos the values of certain units, those with views, those without, et cetera. And looking at a portfolio, you just can't possibly do that. 
One person, 10 people, 20 people and get it right. But leveraging the data analytics platform and to go back in time and look at how the market has priced it. Now that's a different -- that's a game changer. And that's what we're working on right now is I'm partnered up with our data analytics platform to go back and look at our units, look and understand how the market's priced it. I can tell you in one particular case. We looked and saw on a high-rise substantial variations in demand versus pricing, and we're talking, in some cases, $1,000 a unit, really dramatic change in how we're going to price that product based upon what the market has told us.
So we'll take that, and then we'll add on top of that some other software that will ultimately create to price the unit. So super excited about that. And the second question was the technology, what was your second question, Tremendous opportunities. No question about it. I won't go into these deals here because I don't want to give that away. 
But yes, there are tremendous opportunities to really improve the customer experience, but also to reduce the labor. And of course, that's a big component by just applying existing technology into the business that hasn't been used in the past. So very excited about that."

Tim will walk you through the triple net businesses, earnings guidance and capitalization. This is John's first call as he's beginning to dig into the business. So please go easy on him. Despite mediocre bottom line results, we cannot be happier with the overall results of the quarter.  Just 6 months ago, many industry participants and observers were cautioning if the COVID pandemic would result in apartment impairment of demand for senior housing.  
And even most people who believe that the demand would come back  were worried that with every surge of the virus, the business will take a significant step back. As it has been our experience that these surges drive revenue down, cost up, resulting in a significant hit to the bottom line. For the first time since the beginning of pandemic, we bought this trend, and despite witnessing a significant surge of the Delta variant after we spoke 3 months ago, we still posted the strongest sequential revenue growth in the company's history.    
Occupancy went up 210 basis points in the quarter relative to our guidance of 190 basis points pre delta, and rate growth accelerated, resulting in a 3.5% sequential increase in top line revenue across our same-store SHOP shop portfolio.  
Importantly, year-over-year revenue growth inflected positively in the U.S. and U.K. portfolio for the first time since the beginning of pandemic. This trend accelerated into September when we observed a year-over-year revenue increase for the SHO portfolio led by U.S. and U.K., which reported a year-over-year revenue growth over 2%.  
This is particularly impressive in context of a massive delta surge. Let's reflect on why that might be the case.  With nearly all residents vaccinated and staff vaccination rates approaching 90%, which is substantially higher than general population, prospective residents and their families recognized that our communities are much safer environment than alternative settings.  
You can see that in our data. In the U.S., despite a tenfold increase in the daily case counts across U.S. in July and August,   the number of cases within our SHO portfolio was just 10% of peak levels observed during the prior COVID surges.   A similar trend was experienced across our Canadian and U.K. portfolios for -- over the same time.  
This helped us build significant top line momentum in our business as we received the dual benefit of occupancy and rate growth, which we believe will continue into next year. In fact, I believe this trend will meaningfully accelerate into next year as we feel significant momentum in the rate environment. Despite this great top line performance, our bottom line performance was mediocre and impacted by a perfect storm across the expense stack.  We had a confluence of extraordinary costs, including agency labor as COVID surged, heightened R&M, insurance costs, utility costs and other sundry costs all hitting at the same time.  
There was also an extra day in the quarter, which resulted in a mismatch of revenue and expenses as the majority of our operators charge rent on a monthly basis. Additionally, we saw a meaningful rise in paid time off as many employees took advantage of the easing travel restriction during the summer.    
The rise of COVID also resulted additional call-offs from our team members at the last minute, which drove a significant spike in the use of agency lever, which cost 2x to 3x. This situation was further complicated by the vaccination mandate, which the system is currently working through. The only good news on the expense overall is that we began to see this situation normalize in October.  While it is too early to comment on exactly how long it will take for this situation to fully normalize, we need to unpack what logically will stay with us in the medium to long term and what will dissipate.    
In our opinion, base wage increases are sticky and they will likely to be here as unit cost of labor. We firmly believe Welltower's operating partners will be able to overcome this hurdle through rent increases as they offer a premium product within a premium micro market.  
The alternative of one-on-one care just got significantly more expensive. We are beginning to see the green shoots emerge as operating partners have been -- have seen expansion of labor pool with supplemental unemployment benefits rolling off and children having gone back to school.  
John will provide more details on this topic, but we believe the usage of agency lever will dissipate going forward. Our guidance for Q4 will suggest that we do not expect this situation to completely reverse, primarily because of 3 factors:   One, we have a mismatch of revenue growth and expense growth as a significant portion of our annual increases happen on Jan 1. Two, after you hire people, it takes an extended period of time to go through preemployment and training process before new employees can hit the floor. And three, Delta wave, which peaked in late September is still with us even in November.  
However, none of this has changed my view that Welltower stabilized shop margin post COVID will be higher than that of pre-Covid margins. Even on a near-term basis, I do not believe the earnings power of this portfolio's 2022 exit run rate or 2023 run that has changed. I want to repeat that one more time.  
Even on a near-term basis, I don't believe the earnings power of this portfolio's 2022 exit run rate or 2023 run rate has changed. The base operators will rise from this difficult time stronger with significant higher market share, while many others will find this business too hard to figure out.  
We are engaged in, frankly, starkly different conversation with the management team of operators in this industry more broadly. While everyone is fatigued from the events of the past 18 months, many of our partners are working with John to rethink how technology, operational excellence, revenue optimization and data analytics can fundamentally change this business. Think of some very basic question. Unit labor is going up, but how many units do we need? Price needs to go up, but how do you differentiate price on units with view of Central Park versus a brick wall. Many operators within the industry are hoping things will get better on their own. Unfortunately, hope is not a great strategy. Our intense operational focus translates directly into our capital allocation strategy. Let me restate what that is. We want to own the right assets in the right micro market with the right operator focused on right acuity and price point, and we want to own that asset at the right basis, either we'll buy at a discount or replacement cost or we'll build at an extremely targeted way at replacement cost. 
While bidding tents are pretty thin primarily with a few first time or relatively new capital, we remain extraordinarily active in off-market, privately negotiated transactions where we bring unmatched, unmet certainty to close with operator and cash capital. 
As most of the situation are debt maturity driven, nothing is more important to the seller than the certainty of close with a firm handshake. And as you know, our reputation is we don't negotiate and we don't reiterate after we have a firm handshake. This approach has resulted in one of the most active quarter in the history of our company. 
We closed $2 billion of investments at a significant discount to replacement cost with expected IRRs in the high single-digits to low double-digits. We continued our momentum subsequent to the end of third quarter with another $1.3 billion transaction that we have signed purchase and sale agreement and that we have described in our press release. 
While they are all very important transaction, let me highlight 3 different flavors of the deal. We are excited about a $580 million transaction to buy 8 rental and 6 entrance fee communities in great micro markets. We would recall that we bought a handful of Sunrise CCRCs from SNH in 2018. 
This transaction is very similar in asset quality and location standpoint, but at a materially better price. And the previous owner has spent significant amount of capital, over $50 million in the last 5 years. We should be able to achieve a high single-digit, unlevered IRR as our operating partner, Watermark leases up the communities. 
However, we think we can push this return into double-digit unlevered IRR category as we execute a higher and better use strategy similar to what we have -- where we're embarking on our 85 Atria portfolio -- 85 property Atria portfolio. 
For example, there is an extraordinary piece of land in a highly desirable residential corridor, Bellevue, Washington, that is entitled for high-density residential as of right. We can build a great vertical campus of senior or wellness living there or sell it to a multifamily developer. 
For many of these communities, their excess land, while we intend to build additional cottage style units which are already sold out in this location and get the flavor. In a separate transaction, we bought 5 Class A senior housing communities in Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic region with an extraordinary partner -- with a extraordinary operator and development group for $172 million. 
The average age of these communities is 3 years, and we expect to generate a high single-digit unlevered IRR. We also negotiated a long-term exclusive development contract with this team. I cannot wait to disclose the details of this group and our growth plan with them on our next call. But here's the teaser. This team has executed flawlessly, even during this challenging Q3 without any agency labor. 
That gives you a sense of their operating prowess. In a similar vein to new buildings, we bought 3 brand-new communities in the Midwest from a multifamily developer with new perspective, our existing operator. 
On average, these buildings are 2 years old. We feel our future pipeline is robust as we are on a 2-year line with several other granular transactions. We are also building significant momentum around redevelopment and real estate value add as John Burkart has executed a strategy at Essex for over 2 decades. 
My team historically has focused on operator-oriented value-add as we frankly didn't have the right experience. After somewhat underwhelming experience from our vintage transaction many years ago, now with John and Mike Fey, our Global Head of Development in one team, redevelopment and real estate value-add will be another avenue for growth going forward. Stay tuned for more.
On the relationship side, I cannot be more pleased to announce that we started 2 new development projects with Cisco, the second phase of Cardinal and Carnegie. Cisco is one of our best operators in our portfolio, occupancy incredibly bouncing already back to high 90s. I cannot be more proud to be partnering with [ Andy Colberg ] and his team to find a few more A++ micro markets where a cardinal model will be fantastically successful. 
We signed a long-term exclusive development contract with Cisco and look forward to grow this partnership over the next decade. From the success of this wonderful new addition to the exclusive pipeline agreements quarter-after-quarter, I hope that you, as our investors, now share the same belief that we truly have built a deep and wide moat around the real estate business through predictive analytics platform that is unique and unprecedented in the real estate industry. With that, I'll pass it on to John for a deep dive in operational trends. John?"

My comments today will focus on the performance of our outpatient medical and seniors housing operating portfolio. Starting with our outpatient medical. During the third quarter, our outpatient medical segment delivered 3.1% same-store revenue growth over the prior year's quarter leading to same-store NOI growth of 3.4%. 
The increases were driven by increased property level expense recovery and a reduction in bad debt. Occupancy in our same-store portfolio ended the quarter at 94.7%, a 30 basis point reduction from the prior year's quarter. 
We continue to see record retention rates with the third quarter exceeding 90%. And with increasing construction costs and rising market rates, we will continue to push renewal rates and accept a reasonable level of increased turnover and related frictional vacancy as we strive to optimize top and bottom line performance and maximize the value of the portfolio. 
Now turning to our senior housing operating portfolio. I'm pleased to report that year-over-year revenue growth in our SHO portfolio turned positive in September, marking the first monthly increase since the onset of COVID-19. The strong demand-based recovery in seniors housing was led by our U.S. portfolio, which year-over-year revenue turned positive in August and our U.K. portfolio, which turned positive in September. 
The occupancy recovery, an improvement in REVPOR, which began in Q1, reflect the need-based nature of senior housing and a recognition that these communities are active, safe and social, 3 key elements to quality senior living. The U.S. continues to lead the recovery, growing occupancy 600 basis points from the trough in mid-March through September 30, followed by the U.K. at 540 basis points.
Our Canadian portfolio remains behind the U.S. and U.K. in the recovery, but posted an occupancy gain of 70 basis points in the third quarter compared to a decline in Q2. While the Delta variant has impacted staffing and related costs, it has clearly not slowed the demand-driven recovery in occupancy and our operators' ability to drive rate growth. Year-over-year same-store NOI for the SHO portfolio decreased 14.9% as compared to Q3 2020, driven by a 200 basis point decrease in average occupancy and increased expenses, in part due to the Delta spike and related impact on staffing. 
While still down versus last year, same-store NOI has improved markedly from the decline of 44% in the first quarter, a trend which should continue going forward. The increased labor costs during the quarter were driven by a host of macro factors, which led to temporary labor shortages affecting virtually all industries. 
The result was increased compensation in the form of wages, overtime bonuses and the use of agency labor as our operators have been squarely focused on both meeting the increased demand for their active, safe and social communities and a refusal to compromise on the quality of care. The use of agency labor, which can be 2x to 3x more expensive than permanent employees was particularly impactful during the quarter as employees who had COVID, were exposed to COVID or even had a cold, had to call in sick, leaving agency staffing as the only option. 
As Shank alluded to, these extraordinary labor expenses are starting to abate, although I expect we will still see some continued pressure for several months. I'm hearing green shoots as our operators are making comments such as the peak labor challenge has passed, or we've seen a substantial pickup in applications, our new hires outnumber the employees leaving 2.5:1. 
And even we are currently fully staffed at almost all of our communities. Going forward, obviously, I don't know how COVID will impact the economy, but we do know that the operators are increasing their rates substantially to cover the increased labor costs. Similar to the multifamily business, there can be timing issues or delay between expenses hitting the bottom line when the revenue flows through to the bottom line. 
We are seeing that right now with elevated maintenance expense, which in part relates to preparing units for occupancy due to increasing demand. Additionally, rental rates and care service reimbursements are typically adjusted annually and require 60 to 90 days notice similar to multifamily. Therefore, we continue to move forward -- therefore, as we continue to move forward in this demand-driven recovery, we expect to see the impact from these rate increases in 2022. 
Additionally, despite similar occupancy improvement across all states, which withdrew early from the -- additionally, despite a similar occupancy improvement across all states, we've seen a divergence in the impact of agency expense between states, which we grew early from the federal unemployment programs versus those which maintain supplemental benefits through the early September. 
More specifically, states opting out of these programs early saw roughly 2/3 of the incremental sequential increase in agency expense as compared to those states which maintained supplemental benefits. Finally, during the last 90 days, I've been fully immersed in the various aspects of Welltower's senior housing business, including volunteering at sites, meeting with the leadership of various operators and, of course, touring numerous properties. My experience has been consistent with my expectations, and that has found that the operators deliver a very high level of care to our residents and provide a top quality living experience. 
While the focus on care has been and continues to be very high, I believe that similar to the multifamily industry 20 to 30 years ago, there was an opportunity to modernize our senior housing business and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the operations. These efforts will further improve the resident experience, employee engagement and the financial performance of these communities, including the potential for significant margin expansion. 
Without giving away my entire playbook, renovating and reamenitizing certain communities, implementing revenue management across the portfolio and engaging in a digital transformation are just a few examples of what I'm thinking about. Being at the beginning of this coming demographic demand wave and see an array of growth and optimization opportunities across all our businesses make this a very exciting time to be at Welltower. Now I'll turn the call over to Tim."

My comments today will focus on our third quarter 2021 results. The performance of our triple-net investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity and finally, a balance sheet and liquidity update in addition to our outlook for th",1181,"Thank you, John. My comments today will focus on our third quarter 2021 results. The performance of our triple-net investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity and finally, a balance sheet and liquidity update in addition to our outlook for the fourth quarter. Welltower reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.42 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $0.80 per diluted share, versus guidance of $0.78 to $0.83 per share. 
Turning to our triple-net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats are reported a quarter in arrears. So these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 6/30/2021. Importantly, our collection rate remained high in the third quarter. having collected 92% of triple-net contractual rent during the period across our senior housing triple-net and long-term post-acute portfolios. In our senior housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI declined 80 basis points year-over-year as a negative year-over-year impact of leases moving to cash recognition began to dissipate. 
We expect same-store NOI growth to turn positive next quarter. Trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was 0.83x. Looking forward, we expect coverages to bottom next quarter near current coverage levels before starting the recovery in Q1. Over the first 7 months of the recovery, we've observed occupancy and EBITDAR trends within our senior housing triple-net portfolio that are in line with our U.S. and U.K. operating portfolios. As these recovery trends have strengthened, the solvency risk for our operators has decreased in tandem. 
And our continued strong cash rent collection, along with the value of the collateral that sits behind many of our lease agreements, continues to provide us confidence that Welltower's real estate position remains strong. Next, our long-term post-acute portfolio generated negative 1% year-over-year same-store growth and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage of 1.25x.
In the quarter, we transitioned 11 more Genesis assets to new operators, bringing total year-to-date Genesis transitions to 48 properties. We also completed the disposition of 21 of these transition assets, bringing total year-to-date dispositions to 30 former Genesis assets, including our 9 PowerBack assets sold in the ProMedica joint venture in the second quarter, with another 14 scheduled for disposition in the coming months. 
Long-term post-acute in-place NOI concentration is now 5.4% of total portfolio in-place NOI. And lastly, health systems, which is comprised of our ProMedica Senior Care joint venture with the ProMedica Health system. We had same-store NOI growth of positive 2.8% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was 0.24x. 
The drop in sequential coverage was driven largely by the timing of HHS stimulus as the majority of HHS revenue received by ProMedica was received in 2Q '20, and this was not repeated in 2Q '21. Ex HHS funds 2Q '21 EBITDAR was up relative to 2Q '20 as revenues grew both on a year-over-year and sequential basis. 
Our June trailing 12-month coverage also includes results of the previously announced sale of 25 assets held by the joint venture, 21 of which have already been sold to date, with the remaining 4, expected to be completed in the coming months. These assets have contributed more than $30 million in negative EBITDAR for the trailing 12 months period ending 6/30/2021. 
And thus, their disposal alone will create considerable coverage accretion on a go-forward basis. I'd also like to remind everyone that our lease is fully backed by a senior claim and the substantial real estate value held in the joint venture and also the full corporate guarantee of the ProMedica Health system. 
Turning to capital market activity. We continue to enhance our balance sheet strength and position the company to efficiently capitalize a robust and highly visible pipeline of capital deployment opportunities by utilizing our ATM program to fund those near-term transactions.
Since the beginning of the third quarter, we have sold 11.5 million shares via forward sale agreement, an initial weighted average price of approximately $84.36 per share for expected gross proceeds of $966 million. Since the beginning of the year, we have sold a total of 29.5 million shares of common stock via forward sale agreements, which are expected to generate total proceeds of $2.4 billion, of which 12.7 million shares were settled during the third quarter resulting in $1 billion of gross proceeds. 
As the end of the quarter, we had approximately 11.8 million shares remaining unsettled, which are expected to generate future proceeds of $1 billion. Rent in the second quarter at 6.97x net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA, up slightly from an HHS adjusted 6.88x at the end of the last quarter. The uptick in leverage was a product of $1.7 billion of net investment activity completed in the quarter. 
If we run rate the impact of the investment activity completed in the quarter, pro forma net debt to EBITDA decreased to 6.82x. As a reminder, we ended the quarter with approximately $1 billion on sale equity raised on a forward basis, along with $309 million expected disposition proceeds and loan payoffs.
Our efforts to strengthen our balance sheet and improve our liquidity profile, coupled with the recovery underway in our senior housing sector, have been recognized by S&P and Moody's, with both rating agencies recently rating our credit outlook to stable. The upgrades validate the prudent measures Welltower has taken to mitigate risk through the pandemic and to appropriately capitalize our recent investment activity.
On a forward-looking basis, as both Shank and John have noted, we continue to be pleased with the momentum of the recovery of the senior housing operating portfolio. With portfolio occupancy ending the quarter at 76.7%, 210 basis points higher than at the end of the prior quarter, but still over 1,000 basis points below pre-Covid levels, the portfolio also sits 1,400 basis points below peak occupancy levels achieved prior to last decade supply wave. Setting the stage for a powerful EBITDA recovery as occupancy upside and strong rate growth is coupled with significant margin expansion of a very depressed base. 
Lastly, moving to our fourth quarter outlook. Last night, we provided an outlook for the fourth quarter of net income attributable to common stockholders per diluted share of $0.20 to $0.25 and normalized FFO per diluted share of $0.78 to $0.83 per share. 
This guidance does not take into consideration any further HHS or similar government programs in the U.K. and Canada. So when comparing it sequentially to our third quarter normalized FFO per share, it would be better to use an as-adjusted $0.79 per share for 3Q, which excludes $5 million in out-of-period Canadian benefits that we received in the quarter. 
On this comparison, the midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance, $0.85 represents a $0.015 sequential increase from 3Q. This $0.015 increase is composed of $0.035 of accretion from strong investment activity in the third quarter and a sequential increase in senior housing operating portfolio NOI driven by an expected 140 basis point increase in sequential average occupancy, offset by $0.02 of dilution from increased sequential G&A and increased share count from share settled in the third quarter. And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Shank."

First, despite our historic amount of capital deployment over the last few months, I'm very optimistic about the momentum into the year-end and next year. A recent prominent trend that we are starting to see that deals are bouncing back to us as buyers, from buyers who need property level financing as debt market has become very skittish after recent disruption from Delta and labor challenges. We are working on 3 such transactions right now. 
Second, with the significant rise of labor and other costs, operators are left with 2 choices if they were to survive as a business, either to cut services or corners or to increase prices. We believe families understand from looking at prices of virtually all goods and services from fast food to apartment rents that there is an unprecedented upward pressure in cost.
After speaking with vast majority of our operators, I can assure you that Welltower's operating partners do not plan to diminish the level of services and care provided to our residents. So for the industry in general, recent increase in expense, it would be difficult to continue to provide quality services without an appropriate balance in revenue. 
As such, rent levels will need to be increased. The industry should not cut corners and should never lose focus on the quality of their services. Please remember, the simple mantra that there is no mission without margin. Third, our frantic pace of new hiring continues through the summer and fall for both early career as well as experience professionals. In fact, we have added 125 new colleagues since the beginning of COVID, representing a 25% increase in our overall headcount. 
We're rounding up on our campus recruitment program as we speak, and I'm delighted that this year class will be the biggest in the history of the company. With that, operator, please open the call up for questions."

We're not a volume-driven investor. We're a value-driven investor. That's the first point. The $5.6 billion significantly understate what that investment volume is. Just to give you a simple example, that what the transactions that we have closed represent, the $5.6 billion that you mentioned, 25,000 units. 
Let's just think about it what that means. 25,000 units we have done at a $172,000 per unit pricing. In a normal environment, that would have been $10 billion, $11 billion, $12 billion of transaction, right? That's sort of -- we've got to put that into perspective. Second, the industry remains very fragmented and there is a lot of churn going on in ownership as people are finding it either this is -- if you are in 3 different businesses, and you don't want to be in this business anymore. 
We're seeing data from a lot of families. The labor pressure, obviously, COVID was hard enough. Now the labor pressure challenge sort of arising from this. In the last few months, we have seen those repeat transactions that we had conversation 8 months ago. 
You'll recall I mentioned that when we are not getting to the finish line on a transaction. That's not because that's going to somewhere else. It really means that they're not selling, right? At that price, they're not selling. And now we're seeing a lot of people are giving -- really giving up . 
Now remember, they can give up because we bring an operator to the table, right? You will not sell your real estate and continue to run it. The reason you are selling real estate that you don't want to run it, right? So putting all this together, as I've said in my prepared remarks, despite a significant acquisition volume, I remain very optimistic that this trend of acquisition at this kind of prices will continue frankly, longer than I thought."

I'm just kind of curious, Shank, earlier on, you kind of mentioned, ultimately, you expect winners and losers in the senior housing space over the next few years. 
Does that suggest that we start to see a little bit more concentration going forward across acuity, geography and operating model based on who you believe winners will be? Or should we still expect to kind of see real diversification across acuity and monthly rents with the idea being you just kind of pick the best players at each kind of points on this graph."

Let me give you an example. A pretty good example to talk about. One of our base operating partner is our operating partner in Midwest, name StoryPoint. You have heard several times about how highly I think of this team. Before pandemic, we got an unsolicited offer at an incredible price. So we sold the 13 buildings we had with StoryPoint and kept 2 new developments that we recently at that point opened, right? 
So a big partner, we went from 13 to 2. That was 2 years ago. Today, with all the transactions that we have done and all the transactions that are in pipeline, in that 2 years, frankly, through the pandemic in the last 18 months, we are back to 50-plus communities with StoryPoint. That tells you how the winners and losers are changing in the business. The market share of great operators are changing, right? I'll give you another example. Look at how many assets Oakmont managed, right, is a great example of a fantastic operator. 
Look at how many assets Oakmont managed 12 months ago, 18 months ago, and make it note on your calendar to see Oakmont become a dominant player in California, today, 12 months from now, 24 months from now, right? This is just an example I'm trying to give you. 
So you will see that shift of winners and losers. You have seen some spectacular failure of senior housing operators in the business, and I can tell you, those are not the only ones that you know of."

If you think about inflation, inflation, and most people think about inflation is a matter of how much not just obviously the supply side, but also the demand side and people's ability to pay, right? So generally speaking, inflation is an income concept, which, obviously, as we all know, that's for most types of products and services. Senior housing is different. Senior housing is not an income-driven sector. 
It's an asset-driven sector. Look at the asset inflation of what happened. Obviously, we try to put together some slides to give you some sense, right, of what happened to the people who are funding the residence, this expense. And you will see that asset inflation has never been more significant. AKA, the affordability of the product has never been better. 
So I think you are on to something, as I've tried to say without putting a number, putting those 2 slides should give you a context of how much rent increases is possible, not just near term but over a long period of time. 
And frankly speaking, as I said, right, if you think about we have a barbell strategy in our portfolio. If you go back and look at the Q4 of '19 call, this is the last call before COVID that I talked about in details of how this barbell strategy work, where you have a high-touch, high-service product in the coast, our coastal type market where you can -- where labor cost can be fully recovered and still in margin to be made. 
On the other hand, the other side of the barbell, our wellness housing portfolio, there's no labor, right? So we have gone to that. And that diversification, we have been very, very focused and very intentional. So between the 2, you will see a very significant inflation plus growth that's coming that will be funded, obviously, through the asset inflation that already has happened."

The real estate rate, if you just call it the real estate component of the rent, is not -- the street rates are lower. 
It is just that the operators are realizing that they're not competing just on price, right? They have a quality product and that quality product, people -- I don't hear from my operating partners, people are coming that I want to stay down the lane for $500 less, my operating partner, so you should go ahead and do that, right? 
We're not going to -- there's a cost to provide the services, the first-class services that we provide, right? That's just not going to happen that you'll cut it. You are not going to stay at Riccarton for Hilton Garden's price. Nothing wrong with any of those models, but that's just not the model, right?

So I'll answer both, and I hope I can remember it. So let's just try first, it's not an increased level of interest in the CCRC communities. We are value-driven real estate investors. We saw a tremendous opportunity because of the Dart. So if I give you some details, we bought that portfolio for $195,000 a unit and with remarkable Dart, right? 
So talk about West eastern New York, Dana Point, California, Bellevue, Washington, Alexandria, that level that kind of Dart. And then we thought what we can do with the Dart, right? And I mentioned, obviously, there is an example of the asset came with a piece of parcel, that is the last residential zoned piece of land in residential area of Bellevue, right? 
So when we look at a lot of CCRCs, we continue to -- we always have, we continue to look at -- It's just we never seen this kind of opportunity where we can do more than what we buy, not just leasing up, obviously, what we've done, but also a lot more what that can be done with the Dart, right, with the current entitlement. That's why we're interested in. 
As I mentioned, I'll give you details of what I think that it can go from a high single-digit unlevered IRR to a low double-digit unlevered IRR as we execute on this. And frankly, we bought -- that's where most of our returns have been focused on. We continue to get, call it, between 9% to 12%, 13% unlevered IRR. Most of the transactions we have done and the returned life right there. 
Focused on the real estate value add, one of the big real estate value-add that this company tried to do is vintage as you are well aware of the fact that hasn't played out well for us. So as I've gone through the experience, I realized that we didn't have the right talent. It's much more difficult to do it than obviously, we thought. 
And we stopped that whole focus on real estate value add in a traditional sense of the real estate. As you know, John has done this for billions of dollars of transactions and executed based on the strategy. So when we're talking to John going back a few months ago, that's something that came up. And now, obviously, John, is the most into the portfolio. And he's obviously one of the most important member of our investment committee. So those opportunities, we're now ready to really expand on and really execute on.
It also adds to what I mentioned that we have built an extraordinary development team over the last 18 months under the leadership of Mike Fey. We brought in Mike over a year ago, and he has built a very large team. And so those are all -- those starts are all coming together, right? But it's a skill set we didn't have, and now we do have it."

And this gets into really one of the wonderful things here is leveraging our data analytics platform because what you have to do is you have to price the units right on the amenity price and the base pricing. 
It's not just about changing the price over time. It's about pricing the base price correctly, the relationships between ones and twos the values of certain units, those with views, those without, et cetera. And looking at a portfolio, you just can't possibly do that. 
One person, 10 people, 20 people and get it right. But leveraging the data analytics platform and to go back in time and look at how the market has priced it. Now that's a different -- that's a game changer. And that's what we're working on right now is I'm partnered up with our data analytics platform to go back and look at our units, look and understand how the market's priced it. I can tell you in one particular case, we looked and saw on a high-rise substantial variations in demand versus pricing, and we're talking, in some cases, $1,000 a unit, really dramatic change in how we're going to price that product based upon what the market has told us.
So we'll take that, and then we'll add on top of that some other software that will ultimately create to price the unit. So super excited about that. And the second question was the technology, what was your second question, Tremendous opportunities. No question about it. I won't go into these deals here because I don't want to give that away. 
But yes, there are tremendous opportunities to really improve the customer experience, but also to reduce the labor. And of course, that's a big component by just applying existing technology into the business that hasn't been used in the past. So very excited about that."

You -- people didn't travel for 18 months. And then that's the first time we've got a lot of PTOs being taken.

Majority of that we got, obviously, problems in July, but then we got a massive spike as we follow the COVID curve through August and September. We're on the other side of that, right? So that's why if you put all of this together, then obviously follow the opt-in state versus opt-out state comment that John made.

We are cautiously optimistic on the senior housing business, with green shoots emerging in U.S. and U.K. While it is too early to raise an all-clear flag as another COVID resurgence can never be ruled out, we're delighted to report an occupancy increase of 120 bps in U.K. and 90 bps in U.S. over the past 6 weeks. Despite growing optimism in U.S. and U.K., performance in Canada has remained somewhat weak due to an increased COVID cases across many regions. While most residents within our Canadian senior housing properties have been vaccinated, the rollout to the broader population has lagged meaningfully due to lockdown in certain areas within Ontario and QuÃ©bec, move-ins, tours and visitation have been highly restricted, which has ultimately led to an occupancy loss of 50 basis points since mid-March. This trend has improved in April. Despite the drag from Canada, the move-in activity in March is higher than the last non-COVID impacted month of February of 2020. 
In addition, as I have described in past quarters, rates continue to hold. As adjusted for 2020 leap year, AL rates are up 1.6%, IL rates are up 0.7%, mostly dragged down by the Canadian business. Senior apartments and wellness housing rates are up 6.3%. Our operators across the board are seeing broad momentum that continued to build. Irrespective of product type, geography, activity, this is the most optimistic tone I've heard from our operating partners in a long time. We're even seeing the lifestyle-driven customers are starting to come back, which frankly surprised me in a positive way. 
Fundamental results have exceeded our expectations in Q1, and we're anticipating strong momentum in Q2. While we continue to avoid speculation on what the arc of the recovery may look like, we have provided additional disclosure on the additional LOI and earnings power of our portfolio assuming a return to 2019 level of NOI for our stable portfolio and adding incremental NOI from our filler portfolio. We believe this would result in additional $480 million of NOI. And remember, this assumes a return to 2019 level of occupancy and margin, and it does not assume a return to frictional vacancy or any rate growth since Q4 of 2019.
We're seeing something similar happening in the private markets. While current cash flow multiples of what we are buying might be high as compared to what we're willing to pay 2 to 3 years ago, this is a moot point. We're paying a much lower multiple and a stabilized cash flow as evidenced by a much lower price per unit. While in most other asset classes this could be a matter of opinion, I believe in real estate it is a simple business where you can obtain a very granular view of price per unit and how this compares to replacement cost. While we can sit here and debate how different assets and portfolio prices compare to prices per unit 2 to 3 years ago, replacement costs are shooting upwards, with a white hot housing market driving construction costs exponentially higher in recent quarters. This phenomena is now spilling into other material costs due to a $2 trillion infrastructure plan announced by the Biden administration. As costs continue to rise, the market clearing rent to achieve minimum acceptable return is also ratcheting up. However, those returns are not going to be easy to achieve today, as much of the senior housing industry effectively remains in lease-up mode, given the impact of COVID on occupancy.
If this was not enough, now the interest rate curve is backing up, creating further pressure on developers pro forma. This backdrop clearly is unique to the current cycle, which we believe will result in meaningfully lower new starts in near to medium term. The supply outlook, along with already rising demographic growth in the first half of the decade, gives us confidence that we'll achieve the level of asset performance that we provided. Although I have nothing to add in terms of the timing and/or the trajectory of the recovery, our analysis was done one asset at a time, and I hope you will find this new disclosure useful. 
During the first quarter, we continued our effort to create greater alignment of interest with our operating partners by restructuring several relationship constructs. And as we mentioned on our last call, we have made structural changes to several senior housing agreements. I would also like to highlight some recently announced strategic transactions with Genesis and ProMedica, with elements of both deals reflects our approach to value creation for our shareholders. First, Genesis. As we announced last month, after 10 years, we have substantially exited our Genesis real estate relationship through a series of transactions, which meaningfully derisked our cash flow stream going forward. Effectuating this nearly $900 million, the transaction wasn't easy. It involved a skilled nursing operator deeply impacted by COVID-19 pandemic, the transitional access to local and regional operators, working through our outstanding loans to Genesis, at the same time, creating opportunity for Welltower to participate in the post-COVID recovery in post-acute fundamentals. 
Ultimately, we executed a mutually beneficial transaction for Genesis and Welltower shareholders. For Genesis, the transaction resulted in a meaningful deleveraging of its balance sheet, which will help you to reposition the company post COVID-19. And for Welltower, we were able to execute the transaction at a par bid value of $144,000 and generated an 8.5% unlevered return over the full term of Genesis relationship. And upon the repayment of the outstanding debt, that return will rise to 9%, with even further upside potential from participating preferred and the equity position. 
We believe that this represents a very favorable outcome for the shareholders, Welltower shareholders, particularly in light of challenging environment that we have faced in the post-acute sector and then COVID-related pandemic-induced downside we have seen. While transactions will result in some near-term earnings dilution for Welltower, we expect to create significant value for our shareholders following the deployment of the $745 million of anticipated proceeds over a range of high-quality opportunity that I'll discuss shortly. 
Since our announcement last month, Genesis has received an infusion of equity capital and named a turnaround specialist in Harry Wilson as CEO. We wish the team of Genesis much success in the future. As we have substantially exited a challenging legacy structure with Genesis, I hope our shareholders appreciate the favorable ultimate outcome. As we have done with several operating relationship over the last few years and discussed on various calls, our team embrace complexity, fix creative solutions, doesn't run away from their problems and situations where the choices may be imperfect, and ultimately works tirelessly to fulfill our commitment to our owners, operating partners and employees. 
Second, ProMedica. We announced 2 transactions to strengthen and expand our relationship with ProMedica, which will enhance the quality of our joint venture position and continued growth. The first transaction involved $265 million sale of 25 skilled nursing assets with an average age of 41 years, which will result in an immediate improvement to the quality of the portfolio. At the same time, we also crystallized a 22% unlevered IRR over 2.5 years of ownership of the asset, which is a true reflection of the power of our value-oriented investment philosophy. We at Welltower firmly believe that basis, not yield or cap rates, determines investment success. 
Through a separate transaction, we are pleased to maintain an 80% stake in our state-of-the-art PowerBack assets which has been contributed to our 80/20 joint venture with ProMedica. ProMedica has already assumed the operations of these assets, which have been rebranded as ProMedica Senior Care. This successful transaction is yet another example of our focus on improving quality and growth profile of our portfolios while doing so at favorable economic terms to all stakeholders. ProMedica team is making progress in developing new relationships with other health systems as a provider of choice, as Promedica represents the premium not-for-profit provider at the leading edge of health care evolution. We're hopeful that we'll be able to deploy far direct accretive capital with this innovative partner of ours. 
Speaking of accretive capital deployment, we are pleased to share with you that we have closed in excess of $1.3 billion of acquisitions year-to-date with very attractive unlevered IRR. In particular, extremely happy to announce that we have partnered with a Safanad-led investment group to recapitalize HC-One, the largest and most reputable operator of care homes communities in the U.K. Our investment in excess of $800 million comes in form of first mortgage debt on HC-One's real estate and equity in recapitalization. We also received significant warrants that would further allow us to participate in the post-COVID upside that we are confident that management in process of executing. HC-One will add a value option to our high-end focused U.K. platform. This is significant -- there is significant opportunity to upgrade the asset base, operating platform and people in this portfolio, and we have tremendous confidence in James and David to fulfill their missions to deliver the highest quality care, along with the resident and employee satisfaction. 
In recent weeks, HC-One has experienced the same positive occupancy momentum as our broader U.K. portfolio, gaining 90 bps of occupancy from the March 2021 trough. Our debt investment represents the last found exposure of just $40,000 per unit, an important statistic given our unrelenting focus on basis. This basis also represents a significant discount to replacement cost. In addition to the upside from equity and warrants, we think this is an extraordinary risk-adjusted return story. We believe we'll be able to generate low to mid-teens unlevered IRR from this transaction, while adding a highly strategic partner to fill a gap that we have in our portfolio in the U.K.
With acquisitions, patience is a virtue and so is occasional boldness. Since we mentioned in our October call the moment of boldness is here, we have closed in excess of $1.8 billion of acquisitions. The initial yield of this whole tranche is 6.8%, but we expect it will stabilize at a significantly higher number. While the environment was very uncertain then and we didn't give into institutional imperative about headline pressures, and we relied on independent thinking and resilience of our team. 
We remain very bullish on acquisition opportunities and have several attractive deals under contract currently and a highly visible pipeline, which we think we'll be able to execute through year-end. While our focus continues to be on the right asset with the right basis and with the right operator, I'm hopeful that our 2021 class of acquisitions will be immediately accretive to 2022 earnings and will be significantly accretive to 2023 and beyond. 
Lastly, I will address a very interesting question I have received from an investor post our last call. I was asked why we have such an emphasis on partner selection and whether it would be better off vertically integrating. We think this is an excellent question that deserves some reflecting for a moment. Notwithstanding with the RIDEA law in senior housing, we believe we're better off in this ecosystem of partners and implementing an industrial view of vertical integration. That view is rooted in our belief that the combination of centralized capital allocation and decentralized execution creates the best long-term return. We believe this strategy of decentralized execution relates to entrepreneurial energy and keeps politics and costs at bay. This is especially important in real estate, which is profoundly a local business. However, overall, we are happy with our execution so far in the year to create partial value for our shareholders, but by no means we are satisfied. We are cautiously optimistic about the fundamental environment and excited about our opportunity to acquire assets, create new relationships and attract quality challenges. 
With that, I'll pass it over to Tim. Tim?"

My comments today will focus on our first quarter 2021 results, the performance of our investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity, and finally, a balance sheet and liquidity update, in addition to an outlook for the second",2276,"Thank you, Shankh. My comments today will focus on our first quarter 2021 results, the performance of our investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity, and finally, a balance sheet and liquidity update, in addition to an outlook for the second quarter.
After a year defined by infection protocols, move in restrictions and incredible operating challenges for our partners, we started 2021 in arguably the most challenging environment yet, with case counts hitting new highs across all 3 of our geographies and operating restrictions moving up in lockstep. Towards the end of February, the vaccine rollout hit its stride and nearly 80% of our facilities had their second vaccine clinic. Case counts across the portfolio dropped precipitously, and we started to see the early signs of stabilization. The effectiveness and rapid deployment of vaccines within our communities are just starting to be felt across our resident population. And while we are encouraged by the last 6 weeks of recovery in the U.S. and U.K., significant uncertainty remains with respect to the prevalence of the virus amongst the general population, the timing of the reopening of the economy, and the timing of further rollbacks of operating restrictions, especially with respect to our Canadian portfolio. The result is a near-term operating environment that, although notably improved, remains highly unpredictable in the short term. 
As a result of this uncertainty, like last quarter, we provided a 1 quarter outlook with our results last night. As we have done over the past 14-plus months, we will continue to disclose and update information on a frequent basis with the intention of providing a more complete outlook as soon as the virus-related variables moderate to a level that allows for more reliable forecasting. 
Now turning to the quarter. Welltower reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.17 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $0.80 per diluted share versus guidance of $0.71 to $0.76 per share. When providing guidance last quarter, we also provided expectations for $31 million of HHS provider relief funds we received in the quarter. We ended up recognizing approximately $34.7 million of HHS funds, along with $2.5 million of out-of-period payments for similar programs in Canada. Removing the impact of these funds, along with the $3.5 million termination fee that was received in one of our senior housing management company investments, which was not contemplating guidance, our normalized FFO moves to $0.70 per share. Therefore, on an apples-to-apples basis, we came out $0.01 above the top end of our HHS-adjusted prior guidance of $0.64 to $0.69 per share.
Now turning to our individual portfolio components. First, our triple-net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats reported 1 quarter in arrears. So these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 12/31/2020. Importantly, our collection rate for rent remained high in the first quarter, having collected 96% of triple-net contractual rent due in the period. 
Starting with our senior housing triple-net portfolio. Same-store declined 2% year-over-year as leases that were moved to cash recognition in prior quarters continue to comp against the prior year full contractual rent received. EBITDAR coverage decreased 0.01x on a sequential basis in the portfolio to 1.00. During the quarter, we transitioned the remaining 5 capital senior assets, moving one to triple-net structure under a new operator and the other 4 to a RIDEA structure with CSU until transition. We also completed the transition of 4 properties leased by Hearth Management to StoryPoint under a new lease agreement. These transitions had a net positive impact of 0.02x in total portfolio coverage. 
Next, our long-term/post-acute portfolio generated positive 0.2% year-over-year same-store growth and EBITDAR coverage increased 0.37x sequentially to 1.37x as 51 of the 79 Genesis assets began operator transitions. 23 assets have already transitioned as of this call, including 9 former PowerBack properties, which moved to ProMedica Senior Care. Pro forma for the already completed ProMedica JV, Genesis Healthcare represents less than 90 basis points of our total in-place NOI. And long-term post-acute will be reduced to 6% of total NOI. 
And lastly, health systems, which is comprised by ProMedica Senior care joint venture with the ProMedica Health System. We had same-store NOI growth of positive 2.8% year-over-year and trailing 12 EBITDAR coverage was 1.9x. 
Before turning to outpatient medical, I want to highlight a disclosure change we made to our presentation of occupancy in our supplemental disclosure. Historically, we reported occupancy to 100% ownership. But going forward, we will present both at Welltower's pro rata share to better reflect Welltower's ownership economics. This has no impact on NOI, which has always been presented at Welltower share. We have footnoted the occupancy levels if presented at 100% ownership in both the senior housing operating and medical office portion of our supplement. 
Now turning to our outpatient medical portfolio, which delivered positive 3.1% year-over-year same-store growth, as cash rent growth and higher platform profitability combined to producing acceleration in NOI growth. Tenant retention continued to be strong at 87.7% in the quarter, as we executed renewals on more than 540,000 square feet of space in the quarter, our highest amount ever reported. Additionally, we've also seen the length of term on executed renewals increase as compared to last year. Also in the quarter, we completed our second joint venture with Invesco Real Estate for a portfolio of outpatient medical assets and completed our first with Wafra. Our ability to form joint ventures with best-in-class capital partners over the last 2 years has allowed us to maintain scale, and more importantly, the tenant relationships generated from our in-house asset management platform. At the same time, we diversified our access to capital during a period of significant capital market turbulence. We look forward to growing these relationships further going forward. 
Now turning to our senior housing operating portfolio. Before getting into this quarter's results, I want to point out that we received approximately $35 million from our Department of Health and Human Services CARES Act provider relief fund. As we've done in the past quarters, the funds are recognized on a cash basis, and as such, will flow through financials in the quarter they are received. We're normalizing these HHS funds out of same store metrics, however, along with any other government funds received that are not matched to expenses incurred in the period they were received. In the first quarter, there were approximately $33.8 million of reimbursement normalized out of our same-store senior housing operating results, mainly tied to the HHS program in the U.S. 
Now turning to results for the quarter. Same-store NOI decreased 44% as compared to first quarter 2020 and decreased 15.6% sequentially from the fourth quarter. Sequential same-store revenue was down 3.6% in Q1, driven primarily by a 310 basis point drop in average occupancy versus our guidance midpoint of 325 basis points. 
Turning to REVPOR in the quarter. SHO portfolio REVPOR was down 1.5% year-over-year, but mix shift and an extra day of rent in the comparable leap year quarter are distorting the true picture of rent growth metrics, as over 40% of our revenue is derived on a per diem basis. When adjusting for the leap year, total portfolio REVPOR growth moves to negative 1%. And breaking out our individual segments, our active adult, independent living and assisted living segments reported year-over-year growth of positive 6.3%, positive 0.7% and positive 1.6%, respectively. 
As I mentioned in the past few quarters, the combined total portfolio metric is being impacted by considerable change in the composition of occupied units in the year-over-year portfolio. Our lower acuity properties, comprised of independent living and seniors apartments, held up considerably better on the occupancy front since the start of COVID, which has the mathematical impact of having a higher portion of our total portfolio occupied units being lower acuity, and therefore, lower rent paying units. So in conclusion, rental rates are proving resilient, more resilient across our portfolio than would appear in our aggregate reported statistics. 
Lastly, expenses. Total same-store expenses declined 2.6% year-over-year and decreased 20 basis points sequentially. I'll focus on sequential since the changes are more relevant to trends in the current operating environment. The 20 basis point sequential decline in operating costs was driven mainly by lower COVID cover cost as case counts dropped dramatically in March. The meaningful decline in our top line, combined with these expense pressures, had a significant impact to our operating margins, which declined 280 basis points sequentially to 19.4%. As I noted earlier in the call, we not include government reimbursement that was not tied to parity expenses. And therefore, COVID expenses negatively impacted same-store by $14.8 million. We are not factoring any HHS funds into our second quarter outlook. 
Looking forward to the second quarter, and starting with the April quarter-to-date data we've already observed, we've experienced a 20-basis-point increase in occupancy through April 23, with the U.S. and U.K. up 40 and 90 basis points, respectively, while Canada is down 20 basis points. While we are encouraged by the recovery in the U.S. and U.K. and are hopeful that the effectiveness of the vaccines has put a floor underneath operating results, we remain cautious on projecting an acceleration in recent trends, given the lack of historical precedents and uncertainty of reopening trend, particularly in Canada. On a spot basis, we are currently projecting a 130 basis point increase in occupancy from March 31 through June 30. We expect monthly REVPOR to be plus 1.2% sequentially, although adjusting for the extra day in 2Q versus 1Q reduced to plus 70 basis points sequentially. Lastly, we expect total expenses to be effectively flat, as increases in operating costs from higher occupancy should be offset by a reduction in COVID-related expenses. 
Turning to capital market activity. We continue to execute on our strategy of maximizing balance sheet stability. We're maintaining flexibility to position us to take advantage of attractive capital deployment opportunities. In March, we issued $750 million of senior unsecured notes due June 2031 bearing an interest rate of 2.8%, and used these proceeds to redeem all remaining senior unsecured notes due 2023. As a result, we were able to extend all senior unsecured debt maturities to 2024 and beyond, extend our weighted average maturity profile for nearly 8 years. We also extinguished $42 million of secured debt at a blended average interest rate of 7.6% in the quarter.
In February, we highlighted a robust pipeline of capital deployment opportunities. As these transactions materialize and the pipeline has grown, we've utilized our forward ATM program, selling 3.7 million shares of common stock to date at an initial average weighted price of $73.43 per share. These shares will generate future gross proceeds of approximately $272 million, and along with $1 billion of cash from our balance sheet, will enable us to officially capitalize our highly visible pipeline of capital deployment opportunities. 
Moving on to leverage. We ended the quarter at 6.59x net debt to adjusted EBITDA, a 31 basis point increase over the previous quarter as underlying cash flows continue to be pressured by the impact of COVID. While transactions closed in the second quarter will result in a slight increase in leverage, after adjusting for expected proceeds from assets held for sale and $272 million in proceeds from the forward sale of common stock, we expect leverage to settle in the high 6s before the ramp in senior housing cash flows begin to naturally drive leverage lower in the coming quarters. 
Speaking of recovery, Shankh spoke earlier about the magnitude of potential cash flow growth from just returning to pre-COVID levels of margins and occupancy in our senior housing operating portfolio. This will have a significantly positive impact on cash flow based leverage metrics. And although the duration of this recovery remains highly uncertain, the inflection point this quarter leaves us optimistic that it has begun. And our demonstrated ability to access significant equity proceeds through asset sales, even in the most difficult times, along with our return in the equity market since last quarter, leaves us confident that we'll be able to keep the balance sheet in a position of strength as a natural deleveraging when the senior housing recovery returns us to well within our historical target levels in the not-too-distant future. 
Lastly, moving to our second quarter outlook. Last night, we provided an outlook for the second quarter of net income attributable to common stockholders per diluted share of $0.31 to $0.36, and normalized FFO per diluted share of $0.72 to $0.77 per share. As I noted earlier, this guidance does not take into consideration any further HHS funds or similar government programs in the U.K. and Canada. So when comparing sequentially to our first quarter normalized FFO per share, it's better to use the $0.70 per share number I mentioned earlier in my comments, which excludes the benefits of these programs as well. On this comparison, the midpoint of our second quarter guidance of $0.745 per share represents a $0.045 sequential increase from 1Q. The $0.045 increase is composed of a $0.02 increase per share increase from our senior housing operating portfolio, driven by an increase in sequential average occupancy and expected reduction in COVID costs; a $0.025 per share increase in net investment activity, as strong post quarter investments is offsetting the initial dilution from loan reductions and operator transitions related to Genesis; a $0.01 increase in NOI from triple-net and outpatient medical segments; and this is offset by the expected $0.01 increase in sequential G&A, driven mainly by new hires. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Shankh."

But I'll just address the question, is any definitive answer for our end is as much of a guess from us as it is from you, right? So just understand there's no historical precedence to what's going on. We're simply telling you, if we go back asset by asset to where the NOI of these assets were, I think it's an important exercise because we have sold a lot of assets, bought a lot of assets, so it's very hard for you to figure out from our supplement what the number looks like. So we try to answer that question that if we just went back for the stabilized pool of assets to Q4 of '19, what will the NOI look like? And we add the filler portfolio and stabilize that, what does that combined look like?
Now I cannot answer the question, whether it's 2 years or 4 years or -- you've got to really put that in the context and your expectation. However, I will say this, and it's a very important point. It is to a Q4 2019 rent level a.k.a. that if you assume that this will be expanded out, let's just say it will take 4 years from today to get to that stabilized level of NOI. So it's going to stabilize in 2026. You have to assume the rent of the business remains flat to achieve that NOI, right, which we don't think obviously is happening. 
We have continued to say that we expect that rent growth will hold up. Right? So you might get it later, but you will get x number of years of rent growth to get added to that. Obviously, that rent growth has a contribution margin that's very high and it falls to the bottom line. On the other hand, if we say, okay, we're going to get that earlier, you are not going to get as much rent growth. You will only get, just say that you decide that you're going to get there in 2 years, right, I'm making this up. And 2 years up, so you will only get the rent growth from '19 to '23 instead of '19 to '26.
So I'm pointing out that there are many levers here that you have to think through. The longer gestation period will bring you ultimately a higher number because of the rent growth aspect that I'm talking about versus the shorter. And that's all I'm willing to say right now. I can guess, but it is a guess. We're underwriting assets in a way that, frankly speaking, we don't need to know. That's why we're so focused on basis. If you look at our stock, it's a real estate company. You can look at what the basis looks like on a price per unit basis, and then go and think about what it takes to build that portfolio. You will see that portfolio trade had a significant discount to what it takes to build it today."

Can you just maybe talk to us about move-outs? They're at [ 91 1 ] in March. So the indexes,- they're below. Why would they remain sort of below pre-pandemic levels going forward? How would you be able to keep them? Or how would your operators be able to keep them below pre-pandemic levels for a sustained period that would sort of maintain or improve even this net absorption pace that we've recently seen?"

So right now, we're seeing 140 basis points below -- we were 1,400 basis points below where we were pre COVID on occupancy front. So you've just got substantially lower number of residents in the building. So if you run a kind of historical churn levels, it obviously changes occupancy builds and then move outs start to kind of match historical levels. But as historical churn levels, you should be running at around 80% of kind of indexed historical levels of move outs. If that gets elevated a bit, we've talked about this from a higher acuity resident moving in during COVID. That probably moves to mid to upper 80s. But that can stay, I think, pretty consistent through a recovery. It is tough looking at the last kind of 6 months ticking through what has been natural move-outs and what's been really -- certainly a spike we've seen from COVID in the December, January, February period. I think what you're starting to see in March is a return to that kind of 80% level that we would expect, again, giving historical type of churn. But it's certainly something we're watching pretty closely.But from just a level of kind of the comment I made last quarter was from a level of occupancy in the buildings. That move-out percentage, getting back to historical levels of 2019 levels of move-ins, you can drive 80, 90 basis points a month in occupancy by just getting back there because the move-outs are going to be lower, purely mathematically based off the occupancy level."

First is the $10 billion number I mentioned, obviously, is a multiyear opportunity, not a 1-year opportunity, right? So I just want to clarify that. But you're right in that expansion with obviously expanding with HC-One, this transaction expands that opportunity. I want you to understand, as I've said in my prepared remarks, that this investment is not just a financial investment, it's a strategic investment. 
And we looked at the company, its footprint, its management, and we see an opportunity that fills a big hole in our portfolio. Our portfolio in U.K. is very focused on high end, and we didn't have the value option. And there is a tremendous opportunity to grow in that value option, which we think we'll be able to execute through the HC-One platform. We structured the investment in the 3 tranches that we talked about. We don't go into an investment thinking we'll do debt, we'll do equity, we'll do mez or participating equity or cash. That's not how we think about it. We just look at an opportunity first. Think about what is the first asset opportunity and strategic opportunities, then think about how we get to invest capital so that we can be aligned with our partners. That's a very different approach than it's an asset and we've got to buy it, are we going to lend to it. That's just not how we think.
And it is the right risk-adjusted return. You look at an asset or a collection of assets or portfolio and you think about what -- where in the capital structure yields the best risk-adjusted return for your investors. Remember, there are different investors in the, obviously, the spectrum of this transaction. There is $235 million of equity on top of us, which obviously Safanad-led investment group, that includes [ Fanning ] and others, they're obviously bringing in, and they think there's an extraordinary opportunity to create value for their capital, right? 
So that's a very important point. Now going back to the -- sort of the pipeline, the pipeline is primarily today is senior housing, and the pipeline is very much what we talked about. It's significant. It's very robust. It's large. And it reflects a very significant discount to replacement cost. We're not going to sit here and tell you that we believe that every deal we'll do, we'll have this kind of return that we have described in HC-One, but as said before, that we think we can hit high single-digit to low double-digit IRR and that environment is still here. We don't necessarily, given our cost of capital, need to hit that. But we're still seeing many, many, many opportunities that we have under contract today that will get to you to that kind of return, which is in the high single digit, low double-digit type of IRR. Hope that helps."

So this fills a true strategic hole that we have in our portfolio, which we have been looking for a long time, not just the last 12 months, to fill that hole. And we think this will be our platform.

So it's a yin and a yang.
I will tell you one thing, though. I would highly encourage you not to look at 1 quarter or 1 month of labor costs and projecting there. This is a lot of noise and volatility around the fact that a lot of people have received the stimulus check, and that has impacted short term. We do not believe that will be sustained as this sort of -- this dries up. However, you are right that labor cost inflation will remain, but it will not be what you see in other sectors, because what you are seeing in other sectors such as lodging and all the sectors, they have laid off all their employees, the shutdown, right? That was the case. For us, our communities have never shut down. They continue to employ our -- obviously, because to take care of our residents, and that continues. Is it -- is there no issues? Absolutely not, will remain so. I would also encourage you to think about the potential immigration changes that is -- we're hearing about. Obviously, I know it less -- probably less than you do, but that also has an offsetting impact.

So I think the right way to think about it is, it has been a main focus point for us. And it seems to be for investors as well.

So I think looking at our in-place, looking at our coverage metrics, those are tenants that are current on rent paying us and very much are doing so because of their long-term belief in their business. 
And if anything, I think what we've seen in the first quarter from the start of a recovery, enhances that belief that there will be -- there won't be much impairment here. I think the other key here is, I think, the difference between cash flow and value. And the underlying assets, I think you're seeing this across the board, are holding value.

I tried to address that in my prepared remarks. Look, we're all guessing, right? And we have to assume that people will do things that is economically beneficial to them. If you look at how much the costs",659,"So Steve, that's an extremely important question. I tried to address that in my prepared remarks. Look, we're all guessing, right? And we have to assume that people will do things that is economically beneficial to them. If you look at how much the costs have changed, let's just say -- let's just talk about cost in the last 3 years. You have places in the coast, costs are probably up 20-plus percent, low 20%. And if you look at some of the locations in, pick Dallas, Charlotte, Nashville, cost is up between 30% and 35%. The housing market is very significantly impacting not just the cost of lumber, which is everybody is talking about, but the cost and availability of labor. Right? So if you -- that's sort of one big impact and a development model is a highly leveraged model, right? So if you thought you're going to make 7% yield on cost and suddenly now looks like 5%, you are in trouble. But on the other hand, if you see what's going on, interest rate is backing up in a highly leveraged model. By definition level, development is a highly-leveraged model, with construction loans, et cetera. What you have is now interest rates backing up. So it's farther eating into your pro forma. And those 2 combinations, assuming people don't develop for fun, they want to develop to make money, that proposition is increasingly becoming very difficult. This is an industry-wide comment. This is not -- I'm not suggesting, see if you can go and develop a building in a given location and can't make money. That's not the point. 
As an industry-wide, it is becoming much more difficult. And assuming people who want to develop to make money, that proposition is getting much, much harder. I'm not even talking about availability of debt capital, et cetera. The attractiveness of the model has been meaningfully hit in last, call it, 3 years, particularly last 12 months, as housing has just gone parabolic. So in that context, we think there will be, obviously, a lot less supply than it has been in the, call it, between '15 to '19. Also the '15 to '19, sort of the supply boom was -- frankly, was created by a lot of the players, including our company, was paid $1.20, $1.5 on the dollar on the basis. I do not see those participants in the industry anymore. People are very, very -- people who are involved in buying assets today, they're very focused on the right basis. And a lot of the sort of the take out premium is meaningfully gone from the industry as well. So if we put all of those things together, we think that it is reasonable to expect. You can never accurately forecast what the future will look like. It is reasonable to expect that supply in next 5 years will be a lot less than last 5 years, but it is a guess, nonetheless. 
And we do think that will impact the rent growth, which is the point I was trying to make on the $480 million, is that is the beauty of basis. I highly encourage all of you to look at what is the implied per basis value of Welltower. And if you have to make that basis a number, what rent do you need, versus what it takes to build and to make some minimum acceptable return, call it, 7%, whatever you think is the development yield should be and what is the rent. And you will see what it takes to build on our -- today in our company, there's a huge gap between the potential reward -- rent, what's potential to bring new supply versus what you can get. That's not just a Welltower problem. I'm saying existing inventory versus the new inventory, and that will give you much more insight into what the rental may or may not be."

So there are many ways you can do this. If you keep the assets under lease, you can give obviously short-term rate and -- but you can create 2 years out, 3 years out, depending on the level of EBITDA. You can do all",579,"Yes. That's a very good question, Tayo. So there are many ways you can do this. If you keep the assets under lease, you can give obviously short-term rate and -- but you can create 2 years out, 3 years out, depending on the level of EBITDA. You can do all bells and whistles to recoup that rent as cash flow comes back. And that's the point we were trying to make. Remember this is -- cash flow is now starting to come back, right? So that's sort of if you retain it, obviously, in the lease. Remember, these leases are not -- there's nothing behind the leases. There's a propco interest sits behind the leases. So you have a value protection.
If you go to RIDEA, right, we are not afraid, Tayo, to get -- take a rent stance and if that is what, what is the sustainable level of rent from the sustainable level of production, right? You saw that we bought a new -- we did a -- we bought a bunch of new assets in the quarter -- reported quarter where we did a triple-net lease with a highly respected operator. In that particular case, you would say, why didn't they do a RIDEA? Because if you look at in that portfolio, what we bought, the rent before us was substantially higher, right, 50% higher that you are paying to the previous landlord. 
Our rent is much lower. We set it in our way. But then we have some sort of a catch-up. Our rent goes up, not by 3%, but as the EBITDA comes back significantly, and the EBITDA is already moving in that direction, we have a provision to get some more rent. It is also, for the operator, at some point, they were paying 50% higher rent. And they will end up probably paying from the current rent level, 10% more, 15% more, but they will keep rest of the cash flow, right? So it works out on both sides. Why does it work out on both sides? Because the basis is lower. The issue is not -- a lease is fundamentally a form of a leverage and if you put the basis in the assets so much higher, and then you put a high LTV loan or high LTV credit for the lease, you are kind of creating problems from two ends. In this case, it's a very low basis that helps both parties, the owner as well as the operators, to make money going forward. 
Going back to your specific question, there's a lot of collateral that sits behind these leases from this specific issue that Juan and Connor, and now you're asking about. This particular operator, which is one of the most respected operators in our space, has a substantial amount of propco interest that they have created through a very significant development machine through '90s. And that propco interest sits behind that lease. So let's just say, you can do it from a lease. This is just a general statement, or you can go to a RIDEA, right? If you go to a RIDEA the ownership will change and will reflect the fact that their future liability is lower, a.k.a. we lost an asset. And we have enacted that, backed that lease, and we have an opportunity in that restructuring to own more of the real estate, not the same amount. That's the way to think about it."

Yet you're not really willing to commit to an occupancy range on the year. 
And I guess I'm just wondering what is giving you confidence that you're going to get back to a higher occupancy level. I mean the 20 basis points of April occupancy benefit seems like it's a smaller number than what you were talking about with your weekly benefit when you put out a presentation earlier this month. So I'm just trying to -- I'm just wondering if there's something that you can point to. You have a backlog of pent-up demand that you're learning from prospective residents that's going to increase move-ins as you get into the third quarter and beyond.
