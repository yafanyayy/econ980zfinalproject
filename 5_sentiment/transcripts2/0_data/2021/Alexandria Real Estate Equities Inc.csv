With me, as usual, Jenna Foger, Steve Richardson, Peter Moglia and Dean Shigenaga. 
Want to welcome everybody and extend our thoughts and prayers to each one of you to continue to be well safe and state COVID free. 
Just over 1 year ago, January 21, 2020, the United States had its first reported case of COVID-19 in Seattle. And just today, a little more than a year later, we've lost more than 443,000 Americans, a number that's actually quite astounding to imagine. 
And that does not even count the number of -- the millions, probably tens of millions of Americans who have suffered really irreparable personal, mental and financial arm due to the worldwide pandemic. 
President Roosevelt on the -- on Pearl Harbor Day referred to that day as a day that would live in infamy. And I think we will all feel that 2020 is a year that will live in infamy in all of our memories. 
Talking about the pandemic, there's much work to do to control the virus' spread. We need to enhance manufacturing supply chains as well as a big effort on distribution, administration of the vaccines as well as continued testing. 
And we, as a country, I think, for decades, have been ill prepared and behind the curve to respond to a true worldwide and kind of a 100-year pandemic, I think our readiness just has not been there, unfortunately. Much work to do to rebuild businesses and lives so devastatingly impacted. And I would say it's going to take a good part of this decade to do that for many people who've been really so devastated. We still have not discovered the root cause of the virus, natural or human made or brought those responsible to an accounting. We at Alexandria at the Vanguard, the heart of the life science industry, are honored, proud and yet humbled to serve this mission-critical industry, which has been on the forefront, 24/7, really as the savior of human kind in this pandemic. It really doesn't get more important or impactful than that truly. There are 2 primary causes behind the COVID vaccines rescue of humanity from this pandemic, I firmly believe. 
The first 1 is our free market system here in the United States, the economic system that facilitated the innovation, competition and cooperation between our biotech and pharma industries and government, that literally doesn't happen in other countries around the world. There would likely be no multiple COVID vaccines today that they're not being venture capitalist prepared to invest before product or profit was really visible and no corporate leadership would be willing to double down other than those in our country with the company's own money in the spring of 2020 to fund a crash effort produce -- to produce a safe and affected vaccine by year-end, really truly unheard of. 
The revolutionary, I think, cooperation and coordination between government and the private sector, the collaboration, cooperation and really ingenuity of operation work speed really led by the world's, probably, foremost vaccine expert Moncef Slaoui, who is empowered to allocate billions of dollars outside of the normal government contracting procedures, and he was able to bring forth multiple technology platforms with multiple vaccines in absolute record time. 
So as Americans, we can now look forward to getting vaccinating, getting our lives back into a somewhat nonpandemic normal environment during 2021. It probably will never be the same again. And we paused to give thanks to the remarkable group of scientists and entrepreneurs who's free market drive, passion and mission, truly pushed them to venture into the unknown. 
Our solid mission with our remarkable life science and life saving, life science industry colleagues has been to do everything in our power to help the industry repatriate mission-critical and novel research development and manufacturing capability back to the United States and to control the research development in manufacturing in the future of complex medicines. 
Policymakers and legislatures must absolutely avoid the awful temptation to raise corporate taxes and reverse what is the mission-critical onshoring of our critical R&D and manufacturing in this country and to its citizens. 
Let me make a few comments generally about the life science industry and particularly the #1 cluster in the world and our #1 region, Greater Boston. 
Peter will highlight Alexandria's highly insightful, strategic and collaborative entry into and our intent to create a new life science cluster in the fenway submarket of our Greater Boston region. 
And contrary to incorrect recent news reports, Alexandria is, in fact, the absolute leading largest and most dominant life science owner-operator and developer of office lab space in our Cambridge submarket. 
With 3 mega campuses, 33 properties and approximately 5.2 million square feet, including our 325 Binney Street development. We're also the leading largest and most dominant life science owner-operator and developer in our Greater Boston region. 
Currently, as of this date, February 2, Groundhog Day, all of us know, we have approximately 14.6 million square feet of office laboratory assets, including operating properties, plus our entire value creation pipeline, near term, intermediate and future which also includes the recent Fenway acquisition. 
With respect to the industry, 2020 is the ultimate Paradox, the worst year of our lives, yet the greatest year ever for the life science industry. Science won the day in 2020. 
Our R&D laboratories operated continuously 24/7, and ARE was on the front lines of making that happen. The FDA-approved a record-setting second place all time, 53 new medicines in 2020, including a number of breakthrough medicines for pediatric neuroblastoma, spinal muscular atrophy and thyroid eye disease. Great clinical progress was made for many medicines in 2020 as well. 
With this impressive scientific backdrop, it was not a surprise that the capital markets boomed in 2020. Biotech equity markets had the best year ever. Every major biotech index hit an all-time high in 2020. Biotech IPOs hit their all-time high for both volume and deal activity, and the IPO class of 2020 had very strong post-IPO performance. 
Follow-on equity, financings and biotech hit their all-time high as well. And venture funding in biotech hit an all-time high. 2 other thoughts I'd like to share with everybody. First of all, a truly profound thank you to each and every 1 of the members of our team whose everyday operational excellence during this continuous operation to keep our R&D labs going 24/7 during a horrendous worldwide pandemic really is a testament to their great passion, fortitude and mission-driven excellence. And thank you to each and everyone who work collectively and contributed to those -- to our record-setting results for the fourth quarter and for 2020 and wish each of you to stay safe and God bless. And before I turn it over to Jenna, I want to end with a timely quote from Confucius, he once said, our greatest glory is not in never failing, but in rising up every time we fail. The greater the obstacle, the more the glory and overcoming it. 
So with that, I turn it over to Jenna for a deep dive on vaccines."
365138,696747444,2188653,"Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2021",2021-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.","Executives","Thank you so much, Phil, and good afternoon, everyone. So really echoing Joel here. As the entire world looks to the power of science, the life science industry and specifically to our tenants to lead us out of this [indiscernible] COVID pandemic. 2020 ha",1773,"Thank you so much, Phil, and good afternoon, everyone. So really echoing Joel here. As the entire world looks to the power of science, the life science industry and specifically to our tenants to lead us out of this [indiscernible] COVID pandemic. 2020 has underscored why Alexandria has dedicated our business, our passion and purpose helped drive this mission-critical industry forward. Without a doubt biopharma, essential R&D engine has persisted with amazing productivity and resilience throughout the past year, which has further magnified our tenant's role as the key solution to overcoming today's greatest health challenges, bringing unprecedented positive sentiment to the sector, as Joel mentioned. 
The achievements in COVID vaccine development from our tenants, Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, Novavax and AstraZeneca many others in the fourth quarter, specifically of 2020 and into the beginning of 2021, have marked the culmination of a full year's worth of tireless, truly collaborative efforts across the industry with significant aid of federal funding. 
So where are we now? As Joel mentioned, it's been just over a year since the first U.S. COVID case was reported in January of 2020, with over 26 million confirmed cases in the U.S. and nearly 450,000 deaths in the U.S. alone. 
So but at the same time, this is all transpiring, developed with unprecedented speed. We now have 2 vaccines for tenants, Moderna and Pfizer, authorized for emergency use with strong safety and efficacy profiles in the 95% range. At least 3 other vaccines from tenant Johnson & Johnson, Novavax and AstraZeneca have reported Phase III results and similarly, exceeded expectations in their efficacy data in the range of 62% to 96% in various trials each with strong safety profile as well. 
And to put this in perspective, at the outset of the code vaccine development efforts, the FDA had set the minimum standard escap thresholds for authorization of COVID vaccine at 50%. And so clearly, each major vaccine program has blown away past its mark. 
In aggregate, these 5 companies have capacity now to produce at least 8 billion doses in 2021 with over 700 million doses already procured by our own government. The national vaccine rollout campaign has begun with nearly 26 million people in the U.S., having already received at least their first dose, which includes about 6 million people in the country who have already been fully vaccinated. The distribution has been slower than hoped for, our tenants are doing really what they can to bring significant manufacturing resources that continue to scale vaccine production. 
Also, not to be under appreciated, though I want to focus on vaccines for these comments is really the role of therapies in this equation in the fourth quarter in addition to the full approval of Gilead or [indiscernible] 
The FDA also authorized the emergency use of antibody-based therapies for mild to moderate COVID and highest individuals from tenant Eli Lilly, and then Regeneron and another repurposed Lilly arthritis drug in combination with remdesivir for hospitalized patients, amazing results in those studies as well. 
Given that COVID will unfortunately, but likely remain on the planet indefinitely. Therapies are going to continue to be important in mitigating the severity of COVID-19 and also potentially play a role in added prophylaxis as well. 
So to help further impact the COVID vaccine landscape, what we thought we'd do this time is address 5 pressing questions and help frame what we may look towards in the coming months. 
So number one, what are the major differences between the current vaccines? And how should we think about which might be the best. So we have Pfizer and Moderna with EUAs emergency's authorizations granted and J&J, Novavax and AstraZeneca with Phase III data for major tiles reported. And while there are advantages and nuances that I won't go into at this call in the amount of shots that you get from each one, Pfizer, Moderna Colgin requirements, et cetera, all 5 major programs are showing strong safety and efficacy. And comparing efficacy between trials and companies is really not apples-to-apples. So the differences in efficacy that we're all reading in the headlines, [indiscernible] 66% to 72%, and Novavax is 86% to 96% et cetera, are referring to prevention against COVID infection of any kind, even the most mild cases. 
So what we really need to focus on when we read these headlines is whether these vaccines protect against the severity of the disease, whether they reduce death and hospitalization and longer-term complications? That's how we're going to get out of this pandemic. And it is important to note that each of these vaccines does very well probably in excess of 85% and protecting against severe disease. A direct comparison between vaccine efficacy can also be misleading because differences in trial populations and the new variants circulating around the world at any given time. 
So Moderna and Pfizer trials were largely based in the U.S. and were mostly performed prior to the evolution and transmission of these new strains that we're hearing about in the U.K., Brazil, South Africa, with Johnson & Johnson and Novavax vaccine to capture, lowering their overall efficacy. 
And given the addressable population for these vaccines, i.e., the entire world, this will not be a winner-take-all opportunity. No one company alone can possibly supply the global demand. So a diversity of options is important. 
Question #2. Is it worth waiting to get a vaccine until more data becomes available, especially in light of these new variants? 
While I'm not a physician, here's a critical fact. Of the roughly 75,000 people who have received 1 of these 5 vaccines in a major research trial, not a single person has died from COVID. And only a few people appear to have been hospitalized in the vaccine group. So none of them, however, remain hospitalized 28 days after receiving a shot from COVID from the vaccine itself or otherwise. If you compare that to COVID exposure in a similar population, we'd likely end up with about 150 deaths and many more hospitalizations. 
So I'd say this is a pretty strong risk-benefit argument. Of course, unknowns remain regarding the durability of protection from these vaccines, how often we should be getting vaccinated after the initial one-two shot, vaccine guidance for pregnant women and children, so we should have more insight into these in the coming year. 
Question #3. So what do we make of all of these new COVID strains? Should I wait and get back needed against the newer strains instead? 
While we need to take these new gains seriously, this does not render the vaccines already out there as ineffective. The predominant strains in the U.S. right now are still closer to the original target of Moderna, Pfizer and other vaccines. What's making headlines right now is particularly the Brazil and South Africa variant that seems to create several mutations to the site protein on the virus, basically allowing the virus to partially escape the antibodies produced by current vaccines, reducing their overall efficacy. 
Until now, most mutations that were detected, the original strain with a little consequence. And even the new U.K. variance, that seems to increase transmission by 50% does not evade the neutralizing antibodies produced by the current vaccines, which allows for vaccines to still work well against it. All of this is to say, as we continue to vaccinate more population with current vaccines, it should still serve as a backstop against the continued spread of these variants and in new ones that will inevitably evolve. 
So question #4 and related to #3 is, will these new variant strains up end current vaccine development efforts? Quite to the contrary, the more rapidly vaccinate our population, the more quickly we can stay ahead of and slow down the emergence of new variants. There will always be mutations. This is the nature of viruses and not shocking. 
Moderna and Pfizer with their mRNA based platform, particularly well suited to adapt quickly to mutational changes and others are already working on booster shots against new strains that could be available as early as the fall. 
To understand and maximize efficacy, we do need to sequence COVID patients more to identify the prevalence and emergence of new variants in real time. 
And last question, when is all of this going to end? 
On the bright side, the incidence of positive COVID-19 cases have begun to decline in the U.S. with strong efficacy data from these initial vaccines are highly encouraging and particularly their ability to protect against severe disease. The supply outlook for existing vaccine is improving and the makers of these vaccines are already working on boosters to combat new strains that emerge. And remember, so it would be nice, we do not need to completely eradicate COVID from the face of the earth for like to return to normal. Instead, we need to downgrade it from a deadly pandemic to a more mild virus that we could effectively treat, which further underscores the inforce of new therapies, as I mentioned earlier. 
At the same time, we do need to slow transmission. We're still a ways off from herd immunity. Public health officials estimate that between 70% to 85% of the population needs to be vaccinated before people can start moving freely again society. 
So things go well, this could start happening by the summertime, at which point we should have enough vaccine supply for the entire U.S. population. But again, it depends on the uptake of the vaccine and the level of infection in the community. As more people get vaccinated, we should also expect severity of hospitalizations and death to drop. So all things considered, if we can continue to improve vaccine distribution and access and encourage enough of the population get vaccinated, we should be able to return to a more normal -- new normal and early fall and hopefully bringing into the tendency year-end 2021. And despite the incredible fatigue we all feel around social distancing, mask wearing, quarantining and limited travel, we really do need to continue to be vigilant. The more [indiscernible] we as a society the more we continue to give the virus opportunity to adapt against natural selection pressure that mutate more efficiently. 
And for all of these reasons, it is our honor to continue to serve at the Vanguard as essential life science industry and the fight against COVID-19 and to support the remote work of our tenants and campus communities addressing to over 10,000 diseases plaguing upon today and solving tomorrow's greatest threat to human health. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve."

A tremendous deep dive. Good afternoon, everyone. A clear insured vision fused with undaunted determination during 2020 from the Alexandria team has enabled the company to thrive during this unprecedented and challenging time. At a high",778,"Thank you, Jenna. A tremendous deep dive. Good afternoon, everyone. A clear insured vision fused with undaunted determination during 2020 from the Alexandria team has enabled the company to thrive during this unprecedented and challenging time. At a high level, consider the truly exceptional growth during the past 12 months. The operating platform has grown from 26.9 million square feet to 31.8 million square feet, an increase of [ 18%. ] 
The development -- redevelopment pipeline has grown from 12.1 million square feet to 17.8 million square feet, an increase of 47%. And it's important to note that this development pipeline has been smartly derisked with 45% of this value in significantly pre-leased projects well underway, 40% in covered land plays and just 15% of this value in land. The total Alexandria Real Estate platform then has grown during 2020 from 39 million square feet to 49.7 million square feet, an increase of 27%, a truly remarkable achievement. 
The company's leadership and central role in the nation's life science ecosystem is clearly evident in only increasing in each of our core clusters. The year 2020 demanded the very best from our teams, from operational excellence to the vision and execution of critical strategic growth initiatives. 
Alexandria is pleased to prevent its outperformance highlights for Q4 and 2020. 
Operational excellence. The company collected 99.8% of its accounts receivable during COVID from April 1 through December 31, 2020, and we're at 99.6% for the month of January. 
Alexandria's labs were deemed essential infrastructure and have been operational from day 1 in the pandemic. 
Leasing outperformance. During Q4, we leased approximately 1.4 million square feet and a total of 4.35 million square feet during 2020, which is meaningfully above our 10-year average of 4 million square feet and consistent with our 5-year average of 4.4 million square feet. The current and near-term development pipeline is 78% leaser negotiating, a significant metric when 1 considers the active pipeline is now at 4.8 million square feet, up from 4.1 million square feet just 3 months ago at the end of Q3. 
An exceptionally strong core. I want to pause for a moment and underscore that during the challenging time, we achieved the highest annual rental rate increases during the past 10 years with cash increases of 18.3% and GAAP increases of 37.6%. The fourth quarter was also strong with cash increases of 10.7% and GAAP increases of 29.8%. We are honored to work with the most innovative life science companies in the world and believe these metrics further validate the value we are providing to the life science ecosystem. 
Solid occupancy. We are at 94.6% across 31.8 million square feet in the operating portfolio. And again, context is important here as we've increased the operating portfolio from 26.9 million square feet, as mentioned before, providing strategic embedded growth opportunities through lease-up of available suites in the coming quarters. 
I just want to emphasize this last point, as the recent acquisitions provide very near-term increases in cash flows and strategic expansion of our tenant base. 
Market health. Demand continues to be broad-based across our innovation clusters as each of the markets have made meaningful contributions to the company's overall growth during 2020 and Alexandria continues to capture a dominant market share in each of these clusters. 
We have discussed potential supply in our core clusters the past several quarters. And as we highlighted during our Investor Day, the conversion of generic office product into mission-critical Class A laboratory facilities is brought with significant fault insufficient clear heights and live loads, compromise hazardous material storage areas, dysfunctional shipping and receiving areas, impaired HVAC capabilities and performance, amongst others. 
We continue to monitor all potential supply closely, but do not see significant high-quality Class A products being delivered during the near-term in our markets. Also a note on the San Francisco Bay Area as this has been a focus in the press. As we've stated, the life science market continues to be very healthy with low single-digit vacancy of 3.4% and demand of 2.6 million square feet, enabling Alexandria to successfully lease-up our Haskins and 825, 835 project at increasing rental rates, all while the city of San Francisco's tech office sector is struggling with direct vacancy now at 12.4%, above the 15-year average of 8% and sublease space pushing the availability rate to 20.2%. 
In conclusion, year 2020 accelerated Alexandria's leadership role in the life science ecosystem. Our team is energized and enthusiastic to continue our partnership with world-class enterprises and the fight against COVID-19 and in the broader mission of building the future of life-changing innovation. 
With that, I'll hand it off to Peter."

I'm going to follow-up on some remarks we made about our valuation on Investor Day. And then I'm going to update you all on our development pipeline and briefly comment on a new acquisition. As the inventor and pioneer of the essential life",1333,"Thanks, Steve. I'm going to follow-up on some remarks we made about our valuation on Investor Day. And then I'm going to update you all on our development pipeline and briefly comment on a new acquisition. As the inventor and pioneer of the essential life science real estate asset class, we've created our campuses and clusters in the best locations with the market's best assets. By combining our irreplaceable locations and our world-class campuses and ecosystems with meticulously designed, highly functional buildings and a world-class tenant base, Alexandria has aggregated the best life science real estate base in the world and it isn't close. 
During Investor Day, we highlighted our views that the private market has been sending strong signals that there should be significant upside in our stock price. This included a comparison of Ventas' acquisition of the Genesis property in South San Francisco for $1,260 per square foot, which has since been updated to $1,301 per square foot. And Blackstone's recap of BMR at a value of $1,100 per square foot against a very simple back of the napkin, $767 per square foot implied value of our operating portfolio, which was based upon the difference between the closing price of our common stock on September 30, 2020, and the book value of other significant assets such as construction in progress, venture investments and cash divided by our total operating square feet. 
We acknowledge that the implied value of our operating portfolio can vary up or down depending upon the valuation of our other assets and liabilities as well as adjustments for joint ventures, but we believe the underlying thesis remains true, which is that Alexandria is significantly undervalued. 
The Genesis property is vastly inferior to our South San Francisco asset base. It is located on the opposite side of the 101 Freeway, making it part of the cluster by address only. The original South Tower is an office building conversion, which sat vacant for years and required some jerry rigging to make it work and will require more work to complete the conversion of the top floors. 
And the North Tower has relatively small floor place, which causes it to have a load factor that exceeds what is typically acceptable in the market. Both buildings have relatively low floor-to-floor heights that will dictate a lower finished ceiling than the market prefers. And as a result, the 2 buildings did not attract a high-quality tenant base. 
Blackstone has done well reforming and adding to BMRs original somewhat older and tired asset base. But given Alexandria superior locations, assets and tenants, our asset base should command a premium valuation on the real estate alone. 
Taking all this into account, our assets should be valued significantly higher than what is implied by today's stock price. 
Since Investor Day, more evidence from the private markets has come to light such as the sale of the 2.3 million square foot former Forest City lab portfolio from Brookfield to Blackstone BMR for $3.45 billion, which implied an approximately $1,500 per square foot total valuation according to Green Street. Approximately 90% of the portfolio is concentrated in University Park, which was the original Cambridge development area before the emergence of Kendall Square. 
And according to CoStar, the allocation to those assets yielded a value of $1,800 per square foot and an implied cap rate of 4.2%. 
This value, and therefore, the overall value of the transaction would have likely been materially higher if not for the fact that those assets are in relatively short to medium-term ground leases. When comparing this portfolio to Alexandria's primary Cambridge asset base located in the preferred Kendall square location, it should be apparent that the location of our assets are superior as we are aggregated at the front door of MIT, proximate to the Kendall square tea stop in the center of gravity of the East Cambridge ecosystem versus being on the western edge of MIT, far from the heart of the campus in the less desirable area of Cambridge port. 
Some sell-side analysts seem to agree with this premise. The 5 that have NAVs above our current stock price ranging from $175.54 to $184 per share, value our operating portfolio within a range of $824 per square foot to $1,062 per square foot. These same analysts have price targets ranging from $185 per square foot to $206. So they seem to be factoring in the private market activity we are seeing. 
If you're still not convinced and want to look at it from a different angle, I would encourage you to compare Alexandria's multiple to the sector FFO multiples published in cities weekly REIT and lodging strategy published on January 15. Even with all of the momentum in life science real estate, the single-family home sector's FFO multiple is 1.1 higher than ours. The industrial mixed ratio is 3.9 higher and the manufactured homes and data center FFO multiple ratios are 3.8 and 5.6 higher than Alexandria's, respectively. We are in the early days of the biology revolution with 10,000 known diseases and less than 10% of those are addressable treatments. COVID-19 has brought unprecedented positive sentiment to the sector as the world recognizes the life science industry's contributions to solving today's greatest health challenges. 
The 5 fundamentals that signals strong demand, government funding, medical research philanthropy, FDA regulatory environment, venture capital and public market investor sentiment and commercial R&D funding continue to have tailwinds and there is no reason to suspect that, that will change anytime soon. 
The life science industry is one of the few bright spots in the world today, and Alexandria is well positioned to enable and participate in its outside growth. We invite you to reassess your valuation and future prospects in light of the private market data presented and the significant prospects for growth in our underlying industry. 
On to development. We are pleased to report that we continue to make great progress with our development pipeline. We delivered 177,953 square feet and 3 projects in the fourth quarter including 100% of the 9877 Waples Street project in the Seromas submarket of San Diego, which was featured at Investor Day because it illustrated the power of our brand. 
When an existing tenant needed to expand, and we did not have space for them, they found a building and effectuated the sale to us by telling the owner it would only lease it from us because the facility was mission-critical to them, and they would not entrust its development and operation with anyone else. 
Leasing activity has been robust since the third quarter with over 913,000 square feet of leasing completed and approximately 50,000 square feet of space put under LOI in the development redevelopment pipeline, led by significant leasing at 201 Haskins in South San Francisco, the Alexandria center for Life Science San Carlos, 3115 Merryfield in San Diego, and the newly acquired Alexandria Center for Life Science, Durham, which significantly increased their pre-leasing percentages in the range of 27% to 58%. 
Overall, with the addition of 6 new projects, we now have approximately 3.3 million square feet under construction, that is 74% pre-leased, an increase of over 1.3 million square feet from last quarter's project aggregation, which was only 63% pre-leased. 
And as Joel mentioned, I'd like to conclude by expressing our great pride and enthusiasm with the acquisition just recently closed a 401 Park Drive, 201 Brookline and a continuous development site that will provide Alexandria operating income and an ability to realize upside by marking rents to market, converting certain office and retail space to lab, completing the lease-up of 201 Brookline and developing the future 400,000 square foot development opportunity into a world-class laboratory office building in the fenway. 
We are also pleased to be developing this campus in a collaborative venture with esteemed local developer Samuelson associates, who has been the visionary for the fenway for more than 20 years. 
With that, I'm going to pass it over to Dean."

Now they're also very pleased with continued recognition as a leader in ESG. From our 115 projects focused on solving the opioid epidemic, combating the COVID-19 pandemic, the GRESB sector leadership and leadership in health, wellness and safety. Our team's passion goes well beyond operational excellence and strong financial and operating results from our real estate business. Our fourth quarter and year-end 2020 financial and operating results were outstanding. 
For 2020, we reported strong growth in total revenues of 23.1%, NOI growth of 24.8%, and adjusted EBITDA growth of 17.4%, EPS and FFO as adjusted of $6.01 and $7.70 per share diluted, respectively. Now our high-quality properties in tenant roster, combined with our outstanding execution by our best-in-class team, continue to generate strong performance, including many results representing some of the top in the REIT industry. 
Investment-grade rated or large-cap publicly traded companies generate 55% of our annual rental revenue, consistently high and timely payment of rent and well into the 99% range each month. Strong 5.1% cash same-property NOI growth, strong leasing velocity with record rental rate growth of 37.6% and 18.3% on a cash basis, an adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%, highlighting operational excellence, occupancy of 94.6% or 97.7% adjusted for vacancy at recently acquired properties. 
And please see Page 25 of our supplemental package for details on vacancy at these recently acquired properties. 
Now I should briefly mention that our quarterly rental rate growth related to lease renewals and releasing of space does vary occasionally, since it's only 1/4 of our annual leasing volume. For example, in the third quarter of '20, we reported 30.9% cash rental rate growth. And then in the fourth quarter of '20, we reported 10.7% cash rental rate growth. I think the key takeaway is that rental rate growth for 2020 was very strong at 37.6% and 18.3% on a cash basis. And importantly, our outlook for 2021 reflects continued strength in the financial and operating performance, including rental rate growth on lease renewals and releasing of space at 30.5% and 17.5% at the midpoint of our guidance ranges. 
Now our team is executing extremely well. We are projecting strong growth in net operating income and cash flows. We anticipate significant growth in occupancy in 2021 and 2022, as our team executes on lease-up of recently acquired properties with vacancy. 
Additionally, as Peter highlighted, we have a very highly leased pipeline of projects undergoing construction and a very large volume of deliveries in 2021. 
Now it's important to highlight that our Board has been very consistent with our common stock dividend policy, given the high amount of operating cash flows after dividends that we generate each year. 
Now in 2020, the growth in our annual common stock dividend was 6%, and cash flows from operating activities after dividends is projected in 2021 to be approximately $230 million at the midpoint of our guidance. 
Now on Friday, we completed the purchase of what has been rebranded as the Alexandria Center for Life Science, Fenway. It's a campus of 1.8 million square feet upon full build-out. 
Now as a result, we expect to settle the [ $1.1 billion ] in forward equity sale agreements in March, and that was related to our January common stock offering. So huge kudos to our entire team for outstanding execution on this transaction and upon full build-out, this will represent another awesome collaborative campus in our asset base. 
It's super important to have one of the best teams in the country, since real estate transactions move quickly from selection by the buyer -- excuse me, selection by the seller to closing. And in this case, the seller selected Alexandria as the best party for this transaction on December 9. 
On the real estate disposition front, we provided our initial range of guidance for 2021 at a midpoint of $1.375 billion, and we'll provide more information on dispositions quarter-to-quarter. 
Our team has really positioned us very well with our pipeline of redevelopment and development of Class A properties. The key highlights include execution over 1 million rentable square feet of leasing in 2020 related to our development and redevelopment pipeline. Projects undergoing construction aggregate 3.2 million rentable square feet or 74% leased, about 2.5 million or plus square feet of this is projected for delivery in 2021, making 2021 the largest year of deliveries for Alexandria. 
And this to generate annual net operating income of about $135 million, which on average, commences in the third quarter of '21. 
Now we have a number of well-located near-term projects, aggregating 4.9 rentable square feet -- 4.9 million rentable square feet including approximately 348,000 rentable square feet that is 79% leased with vertical construction commencing in the second quarter. 
And in January, we added 2 key projects under construction, aggregating 640,000 rentable square feet with pre-leasing in the 20% to 25% range. 
Now our venture portfolio continues to perform extremely well. Realized gains on our venture investments included in FFO per share were $21.6 million and $71.6 million for the fourth quarter and 2020, respectively. 
Now as a percentage of adjusted EBITDA, our venture investment gains were approximately 5.5% for 2020, up slightly from approximately the mid-4% range for 2019. 
And as we look forward into 2021, we expect venture investment gains to increase slightly as a percentage of adjusted EBITDA as we look to capture a portion of the unrealized gains in the portfolio. Unrealized gains on venture investments as of December 31 were $776 million on our adjusted cost basis of [ $835 ] million. 
Now thank you to our team for hitting our key balance sheet goals, and we're well positioning our balance sheet to support our strategic business initiatives. We are very pleased to have corporate credit ratings that rank in the top 10% of companies within the REIT industry. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 5.3x for fourth quarter annualized with slight improvement to 5.2x by the end of '21. 
Now our fixed charge coverage ratio is 4.6x for the fourth quarter annualized and is also expected to improve by the fourth quarter '21. 
Liquidity was very solid at $4.1 billion, and we continue to view long-term capital to fund growth in our business and are very fortunate to have access to efficient cost of capital. 
Now to put this into perspective, pricing for 10- and 30-year bonds today for Alexandria is extremely attractive at approximately 2% and 3%, respectively. Our prior shelf registration expired in December 2020, 3 years after we filed it. An odd aspect of the ATM program is that each program is associated with a specific shelf registration versus the program that can be used as long as you have an effective shelf registration in place. 
Now in our case, our ATM program expired in connection with the shelf registration statement that expired in December. And as a result, we expect to file a new ATM program over the next 4 weeks. 
Moving on to guidance. Please refer to our detailed underlying assumptions included in our 2021 guidance, beginning on Page 12 of our supplemental package. Changes were limited to a breakout of our range of real estate dispositions from the overall equity type capital guidance. 
The midpoint of our guidance for dispositions, as I mentioned earlier, is at $1.375 billion. And we also provided an update on acquisitions completed in January 2021, most of which was previously disclosed. 
Now there were no changes in our 2021 guidance for EPS diluted of a range from $2.14 to $2.34 and FFO per share diluted of a range from $7.60 to $7.80. 
Now embedded in our overall guidance is continued strong growth in cash flows as we execute on the lease-up and occupancy growth in 2021 and 2022 and continued execution on an important year of record deliveries in 2021 of our highly leased redevelopment and development projects. 
With that, let me turn it back to Joel."

I think it's pretty clear that the location of Fenway which has good proximity to the other submarkets, obviously, to Boston itself and Downtown and Cambridge, but it is also pretty proximate to the collection of important Harvard hospitals, et cetera. And it has been a submarket that has been, I think, quite vital for several decades, and we just think that time is right for the kind of change to a more life science orientation there. And so that's one of the motivations that certainly attracted us. It's pretty clear that the greater Boston region still is the #1 region or I should say, the #1 cluster market in the world and still the major destination for so many companies because there's such a rich amount of science, talent capital and the location is certainly one that's excellent. 
So Peter, just general comments?"

There's some opportunities at the 401 Park building as well to marks some rents to market. So overall, just typical Alexandria value creation play here with combination of using our brand to increase rents to bring new product to market and ultimately, another building to create a nice urban campus."

I think the biggest worry would be a knee-jerk reaction by some to raise corporate taxes to try to somewhat either address deficits or just because it seems fair. But the challenge with that and policymakers and lawmakers should really know better and understand that plants can revert back to Ireland or more favorable tax havens and cash can go overseas if the incentives aren't made to do those things in America. 
So I hope that people take a long-term view of that. But at the moment, I think, by and large, it looks, I'd say, favorable but still too early to tell."

One is, I think, COVID and pandemic virus, we've been through a number of mini ones over the years. But certainly, this is 1 of the biggest ones we've ever seen in our lifetime, different than HIV aids, which we did turn into a chronic condition. So I think and Jenna said, it will be with us for a long, long time, and there will be continual effort not only on the vaccine side and the booster side, the testing side. This testing is going to be critical going forward, and then obviously, on the therapy side because if you can take a quick -- if you can have access to therapy that's maybe not infusible, but 1 that's a pill like, just as you get a sour throat, you get a fever, that would be a whole lot better than trying to -- or being very sick and looking for an infusion site. 
So there's a lot to do there. And I do think COVID will be a continuous business and these companies will be very busy. But I think one of the things about Moderna, in particular, we've bought into the mRNA revolution back almost a decade ago when Moderna was founded. And I think today, if you just separate out the COVID-19 stuff, Moderna represents really one of the most impressive and important platforms for many different -- to address many different illnesses. Imagine if the body could replicate erythropoietin, you didn't need to have constant external injections, et cetera, where the body itself could address different or insulin where you could do it by regulation in a sense. So the opportunity is pretty big, and that's what we've looked at when we look at companies like Moderna, and there are obviously many more that have enormously big technology platforms.

Obviously, there was a defund police effort going on there. So I think part of the effort is, hopefully, for the city. I think there's a Mayor election coming up, I think, maybe later this year to get back into a more normal environment. We hope that's true. And this, certainly, I think you'll see activity on this over the next 6 months. 
But I think Seattle, certainly, South Lake Union remains very safe and really good area. Seattle's got a strong, obviously, on the technology side anchored by the likes of Amazon and Microsoft across the water and the big Facebook and Google and the big things are up there other than Netflix different way. 
But so I think that's been all positive. The life science industry. As you know, Peter, I think, talked about our pricing on the partial interest sale we made in a couple of assets. Seattle has attracted a lot of institutional money and the life science industry certainly is growing well, anchored by the Fred Hutch and the University of Washington.

Alewife is a good example. We stayed out of Alewife because we believe that transportation in and transportation out have been super problematic.

With me, as usual, Jenna Foger, Steve Richardson, Peter Moglia and Dean Shigenaga.  
Want to welcome everybody and extend our thoughts and prayers to each one of you to continue to be well, safe and stay COVID free.
Just over one year ago, January 21, 2020, the United States had its first reported case of COVID-19 in Seattle. And just today, a little more than a year later, we've lost more than 443,000 Americans, a number that's actually quite astounding to imagine.  
And that does not even count the number of -- the millions, probably tens of millions of Americans who have suffered really irreparable personal, mental and financial harm due to the worldwide pandemic.  
President Roosevelt on the -- on Pearl Harbor Day referred to that day as a day that would live in infamy. And I think we will all feel that 2020 is a year that will live in infamy in all of our memories.
Talking about the pandemic, there's much work to do to control the virus' spread. We need to enhance manufacturing supply chains as well as a big effort on distribution, administration of the vaccines as well as continued testing. 
And we, as a country, I think, for decades, have been ill prepared and behind the curve to respond to a true worldwide and kind of a 100-year pandemic, I think our readiness just has not been there, unfortunately. Much work to do to rebuild businesses and lives so devastatingly impacted. And I would say it's going to take a good part of this decade to do that for many people who've been really so devastated. We still have not discovered the root cause of the virus, natural or human-made or brought those responsible to an accounting. We at Alexandria at the vanguard, and the heart of the life science industry, are honored, proud and yet humbled to serve this mission-critical industry, which has been on the forefront, 24/7, really as the savior of humankind in this pandemic. It really doesn't get more important or impactful than that truly. There are 2 primary causes behind the COVID vaccines' rescue of humanity from this pandemic, I firmly believe.  
The first one is our free market system here in the United States, the economic system that facilitated the innovation, competition and cooperation between our biotech and pharma industries and government, that literally doesn't happen in other countries around the world. There would likely be no multiple COVID vaccines today that they're not being venture capitalist prepared to invest before product or profit was really visible and no corporate leadership would be willing to double down other than those in our country with the company's own money in the spring of 2020 to fund a crash effort produce -- to produce a safe and effective vaccine by year-end, really truly unheard of.  
The revolutionary, I think, cooperation and coordination between government and the private sector, the collaboration, cooperation and really ingenuity of operation work speed really led by the world's, probably, foremost vaccine expert, Moncef Slaoui, who is empowered to allocate billions of dollars outside of the normal government contracting procedures. And he was able to bring forth multiple technology platforms with multiple vaccines in absolute record time.
So as Americans, we can now look forward to getting vaccinated, and getting our lives back into a somewhat nonpandemic normal environment during 2021. It probably will never be the same again. And we pause to give thanks to the remarkable group of scientists and entrepreneurs whose free market drive, passion and mission, truly pushed them to venture into the unknown.
Our solid mission with our remarkable life science and lifesaving, life science industry colleagues has been to do everything in our power to help the industry repatriate mission-critical and novel research development and manufacturing capability back to the United States and to control the research development and manufacturing in the future of complex medicines.  
Policymakers and legislatures must absolutely avoid the awful temptation to raise corporate taxes and reverse what is the mission-critical onshoring of our critical R&D and manufacturing in this country and to its citizens. 
Let me make a few comments generally about the life science industry and particularly the #1 cluster in the world and our #1 region, Greater Boston.
Peter will highlight Alexandria's highly insightful, strategic and collaborative entry into and our intent to create a new life science cluster in the Fenway submarket of our Greater Boston region.  
And contrary to incorrect recent news reports, Alexandria is, in fact, the absolute leading, largest and most dominant life science owner, operator and developer of office lab space in our Cambridge submarket, with 3 mega campuses, 33 properties and approximately 5.2 million square feet, including our 325 Binney Street development. We're also the leading, largest and most dominant life science owner, operator and developer in our Greater Boston region.  
Currently, as of this date, February 2, Groundhog Day, as all of us know, we have approximately 14.6 million square feet of office laboratory assets, including operating properties, plus our entire value creation pipeline, near term, intermediate and future, which also includes the recent Fenway acquisition.  
With respect to the industry, 2020 is the ultimate paradox, the worst year of our lives, yet the greatest year ever for the life science industry. Science won the day in 2020.
Our R&D laboratories operated continuously 24/7, and ARE was on the front lines of making that happen. The FDA approved a record-setting second place all time, 53 new medicines in 2020, including a number of breakthrough medicines for pediatric neuroblastoma, spinal muscular atrophy and thyroid eye disease. Great clinical progress was made for many medicines in 2020 as well.  
With this impressive scientific backdrop, it was not a surprise that the capital markets boomed in 2020. Biotech equity markets had the best year ever. Every major biotech index hit an all-time high in 2020. Biotech IPOs hit their all-time high for both volume and deal activity, and the IPO class of 2020 had very strong post-IPO performance.
Follow-on equity, financings and biotech hit their all-time high as well. And venture funding in biotech hit an all-time high. Two other thoughts I'd like to share with everybody. First of all, a truly profound thank you to each and every one of the members of our team whose everyday operational excellence during this continuous operation to keep our R&D labs going 24/7 during a horrendous worldwide pandemic really is a testament to their great passion, fortitude and mission-driven excellence. And thank you to each and every one who work collectively and contributed to those -- to our record-setting results for the fourth quarter and for 2020 and wish each of you to stay safe and God bless. 
And before I turn it over to Jenna, I want to end with a timely quote from Confucius, he once said, ""Our greatest glory is not in never failing, but in rising up every time we fail."" The greater the obstacle, the more the glory in overcoming it.
So with that, I turn it over to Jenna for a deep dive on vaccines."
365138,696747444,2188817,"Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2021",2021-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.","Executives","Thank you so much, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. So really echoing Joel here, as the entire world looks to the power of science, the life science industry and specifically to our tenants to lead us out of this devastating COVID pandemic, 2020 has un",1785,"Thank you so much, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. So really echoing Joel here, as the entire world looks to the power of science, the life science industry and specifically to our tenants to lead us out of this devastating COVID pandemic, 2020 has underscored why Alexandria has dedicated our business, our passion and purpose help drive this mission-critical industry forward. Without a doubt, biopharma's essential R&D engine has persisted with amazing productivity and resilience throughout the past year, which has further magnified our tenant's role as the key solution to overcoming today's greatest health challenges, bringing unprecedented positive sentiment to the sector, as Joel mentioned.
The achievements in COVID vaccine development from our tenants, Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, Novavax and AstraZeneca, many others in the fourth quarter, specifically of 2020 and into the beginning of 2021, have marked the culmination of a full year's worth of tireless, truly collaborative efforts across the industry with the significant aid of federal funding.
So where are we now? As Joel mentioned, it's been just over a year since the first U.S. COVID case was reported in January of 2020, with over 26 million confirmed cases in the U.S. and nearly 450,000 deaths in the U.S. alone.  
So but at the same time, this is all transpiring, developed with unprecedented speed, we now have 2 vaccines for tenants, Moderna and Pfizer, authorized for emergency use with strong safety and efficacy profiles in the 95% range. At least 3 other vaccines from tenants, Johnson & Johnson, Novavax and AstraZeneca have reported Phase III results and similarly, exceeded expectations in their efficacy data in the range of 62% to 96% in various trials each with strong safety profiles as well.  
And to put this in perspective, at the outset of the COVID vaccine development efforts, the FDA had set the minimum standard efficacy thresholds for authorization of COVID vaccines at 50%. And so clearly, each major vaccine program has blown away past its mark.  
In aggregate, these 5 companies have capacity now to produce at least 8 billion doses in 2021 with over 700 million doses already procured by our own government. The national vaccine rollout campaign has begun with nearly 26 million people in the U.S., having already received at least their first dose, which includes about 6 million people in the country who have already been fully vaccinated. The distribution has been slower than hoped for, our tenants are doing really what they can to bring significant manufacturing resources that continue to scale vaccine production.
Also, not to be under appreciated, though I want to focus on vaccines for these comments, is really the role of therapies in this equation in the fourth quarter in addition to the full approval of Gilead's remdesivir.
The FDA also authorized the emergency use of antibody-based therapies for mild to moderate COVID and high-risk individuals from tenant Eli Lilly, and then Regeneron and another repurposed Lilly arthritis drug in combination with remdesivir for hospitalized patients. Amazing results in those studies as well.  
Given that COVID will unfortunately, but likely remain on the planet indefinitely. Therapies are going to continue to be important in mitigating the severity of COVID-19 and also potentially play a role in added prophylaxis as well. So to help further impact the COVID vaccine landscape, what we thought we'd do this time is address 5 pressing questions and help frame what we may look towards in the coming months.  
So number one, what are the major differences between the current vaccines? And how should we think about which might be the best. 
So we have Pfizer and Moderna with EUA's emergency's authorizations granted and J&J, Novavax and AstraZeneca with Phase III data for major trials reported. And while there are advantages and nuances that I won't go into at this call in the amount of shots that you get from each one, Pfizer, Moderna cold chain requirements, et cetera, all 5 major programs are showing strong safety and efficacy. And comparing efficacy between trials and companies is really not apples-to-apples. So the differences in efficacy that we're all reading in the headlines, J&J is 66% to 72%, and Novavax is 86% to 96%, et cetera, are referring to prevention against COVID infection of any kind, even the most mild cases.  
So what we really need to focus on when we read these headlines is whether these vaccines protect against the severity of the disease, whether they reduce death and hospitalizations and longer-term complications. That's how we're going to get out of this pandemic. And it is important to note that each of these vaccines does very well probably in excess of 85% in protecting against severe disease. A direct comparison between vaccine efficacy can also be misleading because differences in trial populations and the new variants circulating around the world at any given time.  
So Moderna and Pfizer trials were largely based in the U.S. and were mostly performed prior to the evolution and transmission of these new strains that we're hearing about in the U.K., Brazil, South Africa, with Johnson & Johnson and Novavax vaccine to capture, lowering their overall efficacy.
And given the addressable population for these vaccines, i.e., the entire world, this will not be a winner-take-all opportunity. No one company alone can possibly supply the global demand. So a diversity of options is important.  
Question #2. Is it worth waiting to get a vaccine until more data becomes available, especially in light of these new variants?  
While I'm not a physician, here's a critical fact. Of the roughly 75,000 people who have received 1 of these 5 vaccines in a major research trial, not a single person has died from COVID. And only a few people appear to have been hospitalized in the vaccine group. So none of them, however, remained hospitalized 28 days after receiving a shot from COVID from the vaccine itself or otherwise. If you compare that to COVID exposure in a similar population, we'd likely end up with about 150 deaths and many more hospitalizations.
So I'd say this is a pretty strong risk-benefit argument. Of course, unknowns remain regarding the durability of protection from these vaccines, how often we should be getting vaccinated after the initial one-two shot, vaccine guidance for pregnant women and children, so we should have more insight into these in the coming year.  
Question #3. So what do we make of all of these new COVID strains? Should I wait and get vaccinated against the newer strains instead?  
While we need to take these new strains seriously, this does not render the vaccines already out there as ineffective. The predominant strains in the U.S. right now are still closer to the original target of Moderna, Pfizer and other vaccines. What's making headlines right now is particularly the Brazil and South Africa variant that seems to create several mutations to the spike protein on the virus, basically allowing the virus to partially escape the antibodies produced by current vaccines, reducing their overall efficacy.
Until now, most of the mutations that were detected to the original strain were of little consequence. And even the new U.K. variant, that seems to increase transmission by 50%, does not evade the neutralizing antibodies produced by the current vaccines, which allows for vaccines to still work well against it. All of this is to say, as we continue to vaccinate more population with current vaccines, it should still serve as a backstop against the continued spread of these variants and in new ones that will inevitably evolve.
So question #4, and related to #3 is, will these new variant strains up end current vaccine development efforts? Quite to the contrary, the more rapidly we vaccinate our population, the more quickly we can stay ahead of and slow down the emergence of new variants. There will always be mutations. This is the nature of viruses and not shocking.
Moderna and Pfizer with their mRNA-based platform, particularly well suited to adapt quickly to mutational changes and others are already working on booster shots against new strains that could be available as early as the fall.
To understand and maximize efficacy, we do need to sequence COVID patients more to identify the prevalence and emergence of new variants in real time. 
And last question, when is all of this going to end?  
On the bright side, the incidents of positive COVID-19 cases have begun to decline in the U.S. with strong efficacy data from these initial vaccines are highly encouraging and particularly their ability to protect against severe disease. The supply outlook for existing vaccines is improving and the makers of these vaccines are already working on boosters to combat new strains that emerge. And remember, though it would be nice, we do not need to completely eradicate COVID from the face of the earth for life to return to normal. Instead, we need to downgrade it from a deadly pandemic to a more mild virus that we could effectively treat, which further underscores the in force of new therapies, as I mentioned earlier.
At the same time, we do need to slow transmission. We're still a ways off from herd immunity. Public health officials estimate that between 70% to 85% of the population needs to be vaccinated before people can start moving freely again in society.
So if things go well, this could start happening by the summertime, at which point we should have enough vaccine supply for the entire U.S. population. But again, it depends on the uptake of the vaccine and the level of infection in the community. As more people get vaccinated, we should also expect severity of hospitalizations and deaths to drop. So all things considered, if we can continue to improve vaccine distribution and access and encourage enough of the population to get vaccinated, we should be able to return to a more normal -- new normal in early fall and hopefully bringing end to this pandemic by year-end 2021. 
And despite the incredible fatigue we all feel around social distancing, mask wearing, quarantining and limited travel, we really do need to continue to be vigilant. The more relaxed we get as a society, the more we continue to give the virus opportunity to adapt against natural selection pressures and mutate more efficiently.  
And for all of these reasons, it is our honor to continue to serve at the vanguard at this essential life science industry and the fight against COVID-19 and to support the remote work of our tenants and campus communities addressing to over 10,000 diseases plaguing upon today and solving tomorrow's greatest threats to human health.  
And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve."

That was a tremendous deep dive. Good afternoon, everyone. A clear insured vision fused with undaunted determination during 2020 from the Alexandria team has enabled the company to thrive during this unprecedented and challenging time. A",781,"Thank you, Jenna. That was a tremendous deep dive. Good afternoon, everyone. A clear insured vision fused with undaunted determination during 2020 from the Alexandria team has enabled the company to thrive during this unprecedented and challenging time. At a high level, consider the truly exceptional growth during the past 12 months. The operating platform has grown from 26.9 million square feet to 31.8 million square feet, an increase of 18%. 
The development -- redevelopment pipeline has grown from 12.1 million square feet to 17.8 million square feet, an increase of 47%. And it's important to note that this development pipeline has been smartly derisked with 45% of this value in the significantly pre-leased projects well underway, 40% in covered land plays and just 15% of this value in land. The total Alexandria Real Estate platform then has grown during 2020 from 39 million square feet to 49.7 million square feet, an increase of 27%, a truly remarkable achievement.  
The company's leadership and central role in the nation's life science ecosystem is clearly evident and only increasing in each of our core clusters. The year 2020 demanded the very best from our teams, from operational excellence to the vision and execution of critical strategic growth initiatives.  
Alexandria is pleased to present its outperformance highlights for Q4 and 2020.  
Operational excellence. The company collected 99.8% of its accounts receivable during COVID from April 1 through December 31, 2020, and we're at 99.6% for the month of January.  
Alexandria's labs were deemed essential infrastructure and have been operational from day 1 of the pandemic.  
Leasing outperformance. During Q4, we leased approximately 1.4 million square feet and a total of 4.35 million square feet during 2020, which is meaningfully above our 10-year average of 4 million square feet and consistent with our 5-year average of 4.4 million square feet. The current and near-term development pipeline is 78% leased or negotiating, a significant metric when one considers the active pipeline is now at 4.8 million square feet, up from 4.1 million square feet just 3 months ago at the end of Q3.  
An exceptionally strong quarter. I want to pause for a moment and underscore that during this challenging time, we achieved the highest annual rental rate increases during the past 10 years with cash increases of 18.3% and GAAP increases of 37.6%. The fourth quarter was also strong with cash increases of 10.7% and GAAP increases of 29.8%. We are honored to work with the most innovative life science companies in the world and believe these metrics further validate the value we are providing to the life science ecosystem.
Solid occupancy. We are at 94.6% across 31.8 million square feet in the operating portfolio. And again, context is important here as we've increased the operating portfolio from 26.9 million square feet, as mentioned before, providing strategic embedded growth opportunities through lease-up of available suites in the coming quarters.  
I just want to emphasize this last point, that the recent acquisitions provide very near-term increases in cash flows and strategic expansion of our tenant base.
Market health. Demand continues to be broad-based across our innovation clusters as each of the markets have made meaningful contributions to the company's overall growth during 2020 and Alexandria continues to capture a dominant market share in each of these clusters.  
We have discussed potential supply in our core clusters the past several quarters. And as we highlighted during our Investor Day, the conversion of generic office product into mission-critical Class A laboratory facilities is brought with significant fault, insufficient clear heights and live loads, compromised hazardous material storage areas, dysfunctional shipping and receiving areas, impaired HVAC capabilities and performance, amongst others.  
We continue to monitor all potential supply closely, but do not see significant high-quality Class A products being delivered during the near term in our markets. Also a note on the San Francisco Bay Area as this has been a focus in the press. As we've stated, the life science market continues to be very healthy with low single-digit vacancy of 3.4% and demand of 2.6 million square feet, enabling Alexandria to successfully lease-up our Haskins and 825, 835 project at increasing rental rates, all while the city of San Francisco's tech office sector is struggling with direct vacancy now at 12.4%, above the 15-year average of 8% and sublease space pushing the availability rate to 20.2%.
In conclusion, year 2020 accelerated Alexandria's leadership role in the life science ecosystem. Our team is energized and enthusiastic to continue our partnership with world-class enterprises in the fight against COVID-19 and in the broader mission of building the future of life-changing innovation.  
With that, I'll hand it off to Peter."

I'm going to follow-up on some remarks we made about our valuation on Investor Day. And then I'm going to update you all on our development pipeline and briefly comment on a new acquisition. As the inventor and pioneer of the essential life",1333,"Thanks, Steve. I'm going to follow-up on some remarks we made about our valuation on Investor Day. And then I'm going to update you all on our development pipeline and briefly comment on a new acquisition. As the inventor and pioneer of the essential life science real estate asset class, we've created our campuses and clusters in the best locations with the market's best assets. By combining our irreplaceable locations and our world-class campuses and ecosystems with meticulously designed, highly functional buildings and a world-class tenant base, Alexandria has aggregated the best life science real estate base in the world, and it isn't close.
During the Investor Day, we highlighted our views that the private market has been sending strong signals that there should be significant upside in our stock price. This included a comparison of Ventas' acquisition of the Genesis property in South San Francisco for $1,260 per square foot, which has since been updated to $1,301 per square foot. And Blackstone's recap of BMR at a value of $1,100 per square foot against a very simple, back of the napkin, $767 per square foot implied value of our operating portfolio, which was based upon the difference between the closing price of our common stock on September 30, 2020, and the book value of other significant assets such as construction in progress, venture investments and cash divided by our total operating square feet.
We acknowledge that the implied value of our operating portfolio can vary up or down depending upon the valuation of our other assets and liabilities as well as adjustments for joint ventures, but we believe the underlying thesis remains true, which is that Alexandria is significantly undervalued.  
The Genesis property is vastly inferior to our South San Francisco asset base. It is located on the opposite side of the 101 Freeway, making it part of the cluster by address only. The original South Tower is an office building conversion, which sat vacant for years and required some jerry-rigging to make it work and will require more work to complete the conversion of the top floors.
And the North Tower has relatively small floor place, which causes it to have a load factor that exceeds what is typically acceptable in the market. Both buildings have relatively low floor-to-floor heights that will dictate a lower finished ceiling than the market prefers. And as a result, the 2 buildings did not attract a high-quality tenant base.
Blackstone has done well reforming and adding to BMRs original somewhat older and tired asset base. But given Alexandria's superior locations, assets and tenants, our asset base should command a premium valuation on the real estate alone.  
Taking all this into account, our assets should be valued significantly higher than what is implied by today's stock price.
Since Investor Day, more evidence from the private markets has come to light such as the sale of the 2.3 million square foot former Forest City lab portfolio from Brookfield to Blackstone BMR for $3.45 billion, which implied an approximately $1,500 per square foot total valuation according to Green Street. Approximately 90% of the portfolio is concentrated in University Park, which was the original Cambridge development area before the emergence of Kendall Square.  
And according to CoStar, the allocation to those assets yielded a value of $1,800 per square foot and an implied cap rate of 4.2%.
This value, and therefore, the overall value of the transaction would have likely been materially higher if not for the fact that those assets are in relatively short to medium-term ground leases. When comparing this portfolio to Alexandria's primary Cambridge asset base located in the preferred Kendall Square location, it should be apparent that the location of our assets are superior as we are aggregated at the front door of MIT, proximate to the Kendall Square tea stop in the center of gravity of the East Cambridge ecosystem versus being on the western edge of MIT, far from the heart of the campus in the less desirable area of Cambridge port.
Some sell-side analysts seem to agree with this premise. The 5 that have NAVs above our current stock price ranging from $175.54 to $184 per share, value our operating portfolio within a range of $824 per square foot to $1,062 per square foot. These same analysts have price targets ranging from $185 per square foot to $206. So they seem to be factoring in the private market activity we are seeing.  
If you're still not convinced and want to look at it from a different angle, I would encourage you to compare Alexandria's multiple to the sector FFO multiples published in Citi's Weekly REIT and Lodging Strategy published on January 15. Even with all of the momentum in life science real estate, the single-family home sector's FFO multiple is 1.1 higher than ours. The industrial mixed ratio is 3.9 higher and the manufactured homes and data center FFO multiple ratios are 3.8 and 5.6 higher than Alexandria's, respectively. 
We are in the early days of the biology revolution with 10,000 known diseases and less than 10% of those are addressable with treatments. COVID-19 has brought unprecedented positive sentiment to the sector as the world recognizes the life science industry's contributions to solving today's greatest health challenges.
The 5 fundamentals that signal strong demand, government funding, medical research philanthropy, FDA regulatory environment, venture capital and public market investor sentiment and commercial R&D funding continue to have tailwinds and there is no reason to suspect that, that will change anytime soon.
The life science industry is one of the few bright spots in the world today, and Alexandria is well positioned to enable and participate in its outsized growth. We invite you to reassess your valuation and future prospects in light of the private market data presented and the significant prospects for growth in our underlying industry.  
On to development. We are pleased to report that we continue to make great progress with our development pipeline. We delivered 177,953 square feet and 3 projects in the fourth quarter including 100% of the 9877 Waples Street project in the Sorrento Mesa submarket of San Diego, which was featured at Investor Day because it illustrated the power of our brand.  
When an existing tenant needed to expand, and we did not have space for them, they found a building and effectuated the sale to us by telling the owner they would only lease it from us because the facility was mission-critical to them, and they would not entrust its development and operation with anyone else.
Leasing activity has been robust since the third quarter with over 913,000 square feet of leasing completed and approximately 50,000 square feet of space put under LOI in the development/redevelopment pipeline, led by significant leasing at 201 Haskins in South San Francisco, the Alexandria Center for Life Science, San Carlos, 3115 Merryfield in San Diego, and the newly acquired Alexandria Center for Life Science–Durham, which significantly increased their pre-leasing percentages in the range of 27% to 58%.  
Overall, with the addition of 6 new projects, we now have approximately 3.3 million square feet under construction, that is 74% pre-leased, an increase of over 1.3 million square feet from last quarter's project aggregation, which was only 63% pre-leased.  
And as Joel mentioned, I'd like to conclude by expressing our great pride and enthusiasm with the acquisition just recently closed of 401 Park Drive, 201 Brookline and a continuous development site that will provide Alexandria operating income and an ability to realize upside by marking rents to market, converting certain office and retail space to lab, completing the lease-up of 201 Brookline and developing the future 400,000 square foot development opportunity into a world-class laboratory office building in the Fenway.  
We are also pleased to be developing this campus in a collaborative venture with esteemed local developer Samuelson Associates, who has been the visionary for the Fenway for more than 20 years.  
With that, I'm going to pass it over to Dean."

Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. Our team is super passionate about our strategic initiatives to drive unique, disruptive and highly impactful solutions to tackle society's most complex and pressing challenges.
Now they're also very pleased with continued recognition as a leader in ESG. From our 115 projects focused on solving the opioid epidemic, combating the COVID-19 pandemic, the GRESB sector leadership and leadership in health, wellness and safety, our team's passion goes well beyond operational excellence and strong financial and operating results from our real estate business. Our fourth quarter and year-end 2020 financial and operating results were outstanding.
For 2020, we reported strong growth in total revenues of 23.1%, NOI growth of 24.8%, and adjusted EBITDA growth of 17.4%, EPS and FFO as adjusted of $6.01 and $7.70 per share diluted, respectively. Now our high-quality properties and tenant roster, combined with our outstanding execution by our best-in-class team, continues to generate strong performance, including many results representing some of the top in the REIT industry.
Investment-grade-rated or large-cap publicly-traded companies generate 55% of our annual rental revenue, consistently high and timely payment of rent and well into the 99% range each month. Strong 5.1% cash same-property NOI growth, strong leasing velocity with record rental rate growth of 37.6% and 18.3% on a cash basis, an adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%, highlighting operational excellence, occupancy of 94.6% or 97.7% adjusted for vacancy at recently acquired properties. And please see Page 25 of our supplemental package for details on vacancy at these recently acquired properties.  
Now I should briefly mention that our quarterly rental rate growth related to lease renewals and re-leasing of space does vary occasionally, since it's only 1/4 of our annual leasing volume. For example, in the third quarter of '20, we reported 30.9% cash rental rate growth. And then in the fourth quarter of '20, we reported 10.7% cash rental rate growth. I think the key takeaway is that rental rate growth for 2020 was very strong at 37.6% and 18.3% on a cash basis. And importantly, our outlook for 2021 reflects continued strength in the financial and operating performance, including rental rate growth on lease renewals and re-leasing of space at 30.5% and 17.5% at the midpoint of our guidance ranges.
Now our team is executing extremely well. We are projecting strong growth in net operating income and cash flows. We anticipate significant growth in occupancy in 2021 and 2022, as our team executes on lease-up of recently acquired properties with vacancy.  
Additionally, as Peter highlighted, we have a very highly leased pipeline of projects undergoing construction and a very large volume of deliveries in 2021.  
Now it's important to highlight that our Board has been very consistent with our common stock dividend policy, given the high amount of operating cash flows after dividends that we generate each year.  
Now in 2020, the growth in our annual common stock dividend was 6%, and cash flows from operating activities after dividends is projected in 2021 to be approximately $230 million at the midpoint of our guidance.  
Now on Friday, we completed the purchase of what has been rebranded as the Alexandria Center for Life Science, Fenway. It's a campus of 1.8 million square feet upon full build-out.
Now as a result, we expect to settle the $1.1 billion in forward equity sale agreements in March, and that was related to our January common stock offering. So huge kudos to our entire team for outstanding execution on this transaction and upon full build-out, this will represent another awesome collaborative campus in our asset base.  
It's super important to have one of the best teams in the country, since real estate transactions move quickly from selection by the buyer -- excuse me, selection by the seller to closing. And in this case, the seller selected Alexandria as the best party for this transaction on December 9.  
On the real estate disposition front, we provided our initial range of guidance for 2021 at a midpoint of $1.375 billion, and we'll provide more information on dispositions quarter-to-quarter.  
Our team has really positioned us very well with our pipeline of redevelopment and development of Class A properties. The key highlights include execution over 1 million rentable square feet of leasing in 2020 related to our development and redevelopment pipeline. Projects undergoing construction aggregate 3.2 million rentable square feet or 74% leased, about 2.5 million or plus square feet of this is projected for delivery in 2021, making 2021 the largest year of deliveries for Alexandria.
And this to generate annual net operating income of about $135 million, which on average, commences in the third quarter of '21.
Now we have a number of well-located near-term projects, aggregating 4.9 rentable square feet -- 4.9 million rentable square feet including approximately 348,000 rentable square feet that is 79% leased with vertical construction commencing in the second quarter.
And in January, we added 2 key projects under construction, aggregating 640,000 rentable square feet with pre-leasing in the 20% to 25% range.  
Now our venture portfolio continues to perform extremely well. Realized gains on our venture investments included in FFO per share were $21.6 million and $71.6 million for the fourth quarter and 2020, respectively.  
Now as a percentage of adjusted EBITDA, our venture investment gains were approximately 5.5% for 2020, up slightly from approximately the mid-4% range for 2019.  
And as we look forward into 2021, we expect venture investment gains to increase slightly as a percentage of adjusted EBITDA as we look to capture a portion of the unrealized gains in the portfolio. Unrealized gains on venture investments as of December 31 were $776 million on our adjusted cost basis of $835 million.  
Now thank you to our team for hitting our key balance sheet goals, and we're well positioning our balance sheet to support our strategic business initiatives. We are very pleased to have corporate credit ratings that rank in the top 10% of companies within the REIT industry. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA is 5.3x for fourth quarter annualized with slight improvement to 5.2x by the end of '21. Now our fixed charge coverage ratio is 4.6x for the fourth quarter annualized and is also expected to improve by the fourth quarter of '21.
Liquidity was very solid at $4.1 billion, and we continue to view long-term capital to fund growth in our business and are very fortunate to have access to efficient cost of capital.
Now to put this into perspective, pricing for 10- and 30-year bonds today for Alexandria is extremely attractive at approximately 2% and 3%, respectively. Our prior shelf registration expired in December 2020, 3 years after we filed it. An odd aspect of the ATM program is that each program is associated with a specific shelf registration versus the program that can be used as long as you have an effective shelf registration in place.
Now in our case, our ATM program expired in connection with the shelf registration statement that expired in December. And as a result, we expect to file a new ATM program over the next 4 weeks. 
Moving on to guidance. Please refer to our detailed underlying assumptions included in our 2021 guidance, beginning on Page 12 of our supplemental package. Changes were limited to a breakout of our range of real estate dispositions from the overall equity-type capital guidance.
The midpoint of our guidance for dispositions, as I mentioned earlier, is at $1.375 billion. And we also provided an update on acquisitions completed in January 2021, most of which was previously disclosed. 
Now there were no changes in our 2021 guidance for EPS diluted of a range from $2.14 to $2.34 and FFO per share diluted of a range from $7.60 to $7.80. 
Now embedded in our overall guidance is continued strong growth in cash flows as we execute on the lease-up and occupancy growth in 2021 and 2022 and continued execution on an important year of record deliveries in 2021 of our highly leased redevelopment and development projects. 
With that, let me turn it back to Joel."

I think it's pretty clear that the location of Fenway, which has good proximity to the other submarkets, obviously, to Boston itself and Downtown and Cambridge, but it is also pretty proximate to the collection of important Harvard hospitals, et cetera. And it has been a submarket that has been, I think, quite vital for several decades, and we just think that time is ripe for the kind of change to a more life science orientation there. And so that's one of the motivations that certainly attracted us. It's pretty clear that the greater Boston region still is the #1 region or I should say, the #1 cluster market in the world and still the major destination for so many companies because there's such a rich amount of science, talent capital and the location is certainly one that's excellent.
So Peter, just general comments?"

And I don't think there'll be any change in the increase -- the rate of increase with respect to that. I think the biggest worry would be a knee-jerk reaction by some to raise corporate taxes to try to somewhat either address deficits or just because it seems fair. But the challenge with that, and policymakers and lawmakers should really know better and understand that, plants can revert back to Ireland or more favorable tax havens and cash can go overseas if the incentives aren't made to do those things in America.

One is, I think, COVID and pandemic virus, we've been through a number of mini ones over the years. But certainly, this is one of the biggest ones we've ever seen in our lifetime, different than HIV AIDS, which we did turn into a chronic condition. So I think and Jenna said, it will be with us for a long, long time, and there will be continual effort not only on the vaccine side and the booster side, the testing side. This testing is going to be critical going forward, and then obviously, on the therapy side because if you can take a quick -- if you can have access to therapy that's maybe not infusible, but one that's a pill-like, just as you get a sore throat, you get a fever, that would be a whole lot better than trying to -- or being very sick and looking for an infusion site.
So there's a lot to do there. And I do think COVID will be a continuous business and these companies will be very busy. But I think one of the things about Moderna, in particular, we've bought into the mRNA revolution back almost a decade ago when Moderna was founded. And I think today, if you just separate out the COVID-19 stuff, Moderna represents really one of the most impressive and important platforms for many different -- to address many different illnesses. Imagine if the body could replicate erythropoietin, so you didn't need to have constant external injections, et cetera, where the body itself could address different -- or insulin where you could do it by regulation in a sense. So the opportunity is pretty big, and that's what we've looked at when we look at companies like Moderna, and there are obviously many more that have enormously big technology platforms.

Alewife is a good example. We stayed out of Alewife because we believe that transportation in and transportation out have been super problematic.

And we want to wish everybody a safe and healthy go-forward year. We want to welcome all to this first quarter call as well and recognize and thank the entire Alexandria family team for the operationally excellent and truly stellar first quarter earnings report by all metrics and measures. We collectively continue to operate at an outstandingly high level into the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
And as I'm often fond of quoting Jim Collins of Good to Great theme, commented on Alexandria's feature in our annual report, Alexandria has achieved the 3 outputs that define a great company: superior results, and we believe the first quarter is emblematic of that distinctive impact; and we believe that our social responsibility programs have truly made a difference; and lasting endurance. And with respect to lasting endurance, we sit here at literally several decades after we were founded in 1994, and I'll talk more about that in a moment. 
We're particularly proud of the 6 pillars of our highly impactful and long-standing social responsibility efforts: accelerating groundbreaking medical research to advance life-saving treatments and cures; harnessing the entire agrifood ecosystem to combat hunger, improved nutrition and support human health at its most fundamental level; thirdly, bolstering the resilience of our military, our veterans and their families; fourth, conquering the opioid epidemic and revolutionizing addiction treatment; the fifth pillar that we've spent a tremendous amount of time in over the last year and for a good part of the last decade, educationally empowering underserved students to achieve long-term success and reach their potential as important principled leaders in the community; and then finally, building a model for comprehensive sustainable solution to address homelessness. 
Alexandria is also proud to be the focus cover story of the January-February 2021 NAREIT Magazine, showcasing that we have pioneered a novel data-driven comprehensive care model to overcome the opioid epidemic launched in Dayton, Ohio. We're now focused on adopting a similar model but in different respects to the homeless problem, which has really become pretty out of control in many urban cities. And it is fraught with a lot of complex stratified issues and actually is more of an issue of health care than it is simply one of housing. 
We've been recognized as a leader and continuing, and we continue to enhance our leadership in the area of sustainability. And we're on pace to achieve our first sorry -- net zero energy building in south San Francisco, one of our important submarkets and only 1 of 70 of such buildings in the entire world. So we're very proud of that achievement when we finally get the designation. 
I always try to think about a theme on each quarter and they are so different, given macro and micro circumstances. And I would say the theme for the first quarter has to be exceptional core and internal growth and really stellar value creation and external growth, both of which have driven our continued outstanding earnings results and as the absolute go-to landlord in life science real estate. Leasing demand for Alexandria's owned and operated first-in-class assets is at a historical high. 
And as I alluded to a moment ago, first quarter of 1994, 27 years ago this quarter, we completed our Series A financing led by Jacobs Engineering for $19 million, and here we sit 27 years later to the quarter with a total market cap of $32.5 billion and among the top 10 of all REITs. I remember attending the first REIT conference, I think it was in New Orleans in 1994 and I didn't know a single soul, so we've come a long way. And we still are in our fourth consecutive quarter of COVID-19, something we -- none of us will ever forget. 
The stellar results by any measure of metric is we're very proud, and we thank each and every 1 of our great team members. Dean will speak to the outstanding core and internal growth results, driven in part by strong rental rate growth, and particularly featured this quarter in the San Francisco Bay region, among others, one of our highest leasing quarters ever. And Steve and Peter will also speak to our stellar value creation growth, in part driven by our collaborative Fenway blockbuster transaction, and we greatly appreciate and recognize the team that put that together. 
A very highly leased valuation creation pipeline, which will provide continuing growth for Alexandria and so we're very proud of that. Also important to note, and I think Steve, Peter and Dean will also allude to this, our partial interest sale this quarter, I think, set a true benchmark valuation for Alexandria owned and operated first-in-class lab space in the south San Francisco submarket led by both Steve and Peter. And Peter in particular, who we brought here in 1998, who had special and unique joint venture talents and a stellar network, and we've been at it under his guidance there for 20 years. So we thank those 2 very much for that execution and the teams that supported them. 
We completed our first quarter with a very strong balance sheet. Dean will talk about that, with no debt maturities until 2024. And as some of you are aware, we filed an S-1 with the SEC to raise $250 million for an Alexandria-sponsored SPAC, importantly, because we believe there was a real need for this in our core agrifood tech industry. And as we are in a quiet period, we won't be discussing this at all. 
Moving on to the life science industry for a moment. The velocity and continuing demand for Alexandria lab space across our cluster markets is as strong as we've ever experienced. The pace of FDA approvals during the first quarter remained very strong, with FDA approving 14 new drugs. 36% of those were Alexandria client tenants. 
We also note strong bipartisan support and a proposed whopping 20% increase for the budgets of NIH, CDC and HHS. We don't know about FDA at this moment. And hopefully, the administration will select, in the not-too-distant future, a true great leader there and we're hoping for that. Public markets continued their strong pace with $4.5 billion raised and 29 IPOs this past quarter and -- I'm sorry, $12.6 billion raised in follow-on offerings, truly kind of a stellar capital markets quarter. Biopharma continues to invest heavily in its own R&D, likely north of $225 billion for all of 2021. 
Let me comment a moment about some proposed corporate tax changes that were announced by the current administration, which if enacted into law, would foolishly and directly hurt U.S. manufacturing, U.S. R&D and the repatriation of crucial supply chains that became evident in the pandemic that we were really woefully unprepared and relied on 70% of our supply chain efforts outside of the United States. I would say, mission-critical sectors, including biopharma, certainly will not be helped. 
In essence, the threat to the American competitiveness is way bigger and way more important than the everyday life of Americans, and higher rates -- than higher rates and a sad commentary on poor public policy. It's interesting to note the paradox of this pandemic moment. Large corporations have oftentimes been politically villainized, derided by the left and the right, yet the main and perhaps only reason COVID-19 scourge is easing is the vaccines that were developed by biopharma and some in connection with the government in a groundbreaking effort with the warp speed effort and we're very thankful for that. 
I think to quote Alex Gorsky, CEO of J&J, he made a pretty important quote recently and said, ""We fundamentally believe that having a market-based, innovation-based biopharmaceutical industry as well as a medical technology environment is critical to long-term -- is critical long term to produce the best overall outcomes for health care."" And I think that absolutely rings true. 
So as I do each quarter, let me finish with a -- or I did last quarter and will each quarter, a quote, kind of a timely quote. I quoted Confucius last quarter. Let me quote this quarter, Steve Prefontaine, one of the world-class runners of his time. ""To give anything less than your best is to sacrifice the gift."" And with that, let me turn it over to Steve Richardson."

Now the fir",521,"Thank you, Joel, and welcome, everybody as well. As we presented during the last quarterly call, 2020 represented an exceptional year of high-quality growth for Alexandria as we increased the asset base by 27% to nearly 50 million square feet. Now the first quarter of 2021, a truly blowout quarter by all metrics, has clearly signaled the continuation of this exceptional growth trajectory and definitively affirms Alexandria's leadership role in the now core life science asset class and its highly valued status within the broad life science ecosystem. 
The company's 27-year commitment to operational excellence at every level fuels the following outperformance highlights for Q1. Accounts receivable, we've collected 99.4% of our April AR billings as of today. And again, Alexandria's labs are essential infrastructure and have been operational from day 1 in the pandemic. Some detail on leasing outperformance. During Q1, we leased approximately 1,677,000 square feet, which notably represents the second highest quarterly leasing activity during the past 5 years, an amazing statistic considering the broader turmoil in the office market. 
Peter will touch on this in more detail, but the current and near-term development pipeline continues to deliver value in a derisked manner as we are at 76% leased and negotiating even while adding 1 million square feet of new starts during this quarter. The core, in particular, is exceptionally strong. Continue to highlight and bring everyone's attention to the embedded growth and value within the core operating platform comprised now of nearly 34 million square feet with cash increases this quarter of 17.4% and GAAP increases of 36.2%. 
On occupancy, also very, very solid with 94.5%, which has grown in excess of 2 million square feet this quarter compared to Q4 through our strategic acquisition activity. And we want to continue to bring to everyone's attention the near-term opportunity for increasing cash flows through the lease-up of 1.2 million square feet of existing inventory provided by these recent acquisitions. 
Overall, on market health, demand continues to be robust in our core clusters, and our mega campus offerings provide a significant competitive advantage to the company. Importantly, subleases are in tight check as since the start of 2021, just 2 subleases have been brought to market in 1 of our clusters, and both of those subleases have already been put under LOI. Supply more broadly is constrained for 2021 across all of our markets. And in the 2 largest markets for 2022, we see nearly 50% of the supply is pre-leased in greater Boston. And in the San Francisco area, we're monitoring just 2 projects for potential vertical activity in 2022. And as we've stated before, Alexandria's mega campus high-quality Class A product offerings continue to outperform any inferior one-off Class B office conversions in isolated locations. 
The year 2020 was truly an amazing year for Alexandria at the Vanguard heart of the life science ecosystem. And now the first quarter of 2021 has exceeded those accomplishments with Stellar performance. And in conclusion, I'd like to add to Joel's shout-out to the entire Alexandria team for this quarter's achievements. And with that, I'll hand it off to Peter."
365138,705363517,2259624,"Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. I'm going to update you all on our development pipeline, comment on construction cost escalations and discuss a couple of life science sales. We continue to work at a very productive pace, delivering 376,645 square feet during the quarter,",1211,"Thanks, Steve. I'm going to update you all on our development pipeline, comment on construction cost escalations and discuss a couple of life science sales. We continue to work at a very productive pace, delivering 376,645 square feet during the quarter, including the full delivery of 9804 Medical Center Drive in Rockville, Maryland to a high-quality cell therapy company at an 8% cash yield, which was 80 basis points above our initial disclosure. 
The project's outperformance was the direct result of our best-in-class team who were able to drive down overall cost savings through a combination of adept schedule management, alternative construction techniques and highly effective coordination with the tenant. In addition, we fully delivered the 100,086-square-foot 1165 East Lake Avenue East Building in Seattle to Adaptive Biotechnologies, a cutting-edge public immune medicine company on the front lines of fighting COVID-19. This building is highly unique as it sits on the edge of Lake Union, offering expansive use of the lake, Queen Anne and downtown Seattle. 
Leasing activity on our pipeline continues to be robust with approximately 789,000 square feet leased during the quarter and another approximately 450,000 square feet in executed LOIs. Highlights include completing the lease-up of 3115 Merrifield Road, well in advance of its 2022 delivery date, incremental progress at Alexandria Center Life -- Long Island City, which is approaching being half leased and committed and a surge of activity in both SD Tech and our newly acquired 201 Brookline asset in the Fenway area of Boston. 
At SD Tech, we executed LOIs increasing its lease negotiating status by 37% as tenants affirm the attractiveness of our transformation of this historical midsized tech campus into a highly amenitized science and technology mega-campus. As impressive as that is, the response by the market to our Fenway transaction and 201 Brookline has been even more remarkable. When we closed on that transaction in late January, the asset was 17% leased. As we sit today, we have letters of intent that when converted to leases, will bring that percentage up to 84%. This is a testament to the trust life science companies have in our best-in-class brand as these opportunities came to 201 Brookline in large part because of Alexandria. 
Overall, with the addition of 5 new projects and the full delivery of 9804 Medical Center Drive, we now have approximately 4 million square feet under construction that is 66% pre-leased and 76% committed when including signed LOIs. That is only 2% below the committed leasing percentage from last year's -- or from last quarter. And as Steve alluded to, despite the fact that we've also added 1 million square feet of new projects. 
Given the recent news on anticipated inflation, we wanted to give you guys an update on construction cost escalations as it relates to our pipeline. Before we get into what is happening in the construction market, we want to note that the projects listed on Page 42 that make up the 4 million square feet under construction are largely subject to guaranteed maximum price contracts, which protect us from any escalations not already negotiated into the pricing. 
Under construction projects that are still in negotiations, those that -- well, the ones that are still in negotiations have been conservatively underwritten with a conservative escalation range applied in our underwriting. The 80 basis point yield at 9804 Medical Center Drive that I spoke about earlier is a testament to our conservative underwriting and outstanding budget management. 
As we all know, coming into 2020, we all expected growth in the real estate sector to continue. And we were all taken by surprise when the global pandemic created disruption in our personal and professional lives. As reported in our 1Q call last year, Alexandria was required to temporarily suspend 7 projects during the quarter due to COVID-19. But with life science being deemed an essential business, we were able to restart relatively quickly. 
That wasn't so for many other developers and a large number of projects were put on hold or handled all together. That caused general and subcontractor backlogs to shrink. And for a moment, in the middle of the year, most major contractors assumed the worst and laid off workers. Demand for materials also diminished and for a brief period of time, overall construction costs trended lower than pre-COVID levels. We know in California that costs dropped as much as 2% during that time. 
However, as news of the effectiveness of vaccines came to light towards the end of the year, the construction industry experienced a V-shaped recovery led by residential and advanced technology, with life science and health care contributing to the sudden increase as well. One of our major contractors had to pivot quickly and today is still spending 10 hours a week on hiring as backlogs grow. In addition to the shortage of labor, costs are being materially influenced by a shortage of subcontractor shop capacity. 
The makers of glazing, duct work and other prefabricated materials have more work than they can handle, so many are increasing pricing to control their backlog. On top of that, the demand for raw materials is putting pressure on steel, copper, lumber and plywood. Steel is up 20% from April 2020 to February of this year. Copper is up 37% and lumber and plywood are up 62% over the same period. Although these percentages are high, materials are only 30% to 35% of the total cost stack. So we've been advised to plan for 5% to 6% annual escalations in the aggregate over the next 12 months. 
Rest assured, Alexandria constantly stays in front of this data, factors it into our underwriting and employee strategies to mitigate its impact. As a major developer with a number of significant major contractor and subcontractor relationships, we are able to leverage preferred pricing and priority in the queue. We have a great reputation among our vendors as we treat them like partners, and that enables us to continue to deliver on time and on budget in any market condition.
I'll conclude my commentary by talking about some private cap rates that you should factor into your NAV models. Our own partial interest sale of the 300,930-square-foot 213 East Grand building in south San Francisco was executed at a record 4% cap rate and translates to a value of $1,429 per square foot. This should be very impactful to our overall valuation as south San Francisco is one of our largest submarkets as we hold 3.3 million square feet in operation or under development. 
Despite the fact that the rent is approximately 20% to 25% below market on that asset, the lease goes for another 12 years, so we believe the yield is very reflective of what investors are willing to pay today for first-in-class Alexandria owned and stabilized assets. 
We'd also like to report that Blackstone sold 454,000 square foot, 96% lease Science Technology Park at Johns Hopkins to Ventas for $272 million or $600 per square foot, which is a 4.8% cap rate. Although the asset has strong tenancy, the neighborhood is tough so this was a positive outcome for Blackstone and another testament to the high demand for life science assets today. With that, I'll pass it over to Dean."

We continue to remain very disciplined with the allocation of capital in the projects that have and will generate significant long-term cash flows and tremendous value for our company and shareholders. 
Now let me take a moment to highlight again the exceptional execution by our team. During the first quarter, we strategically increased our current and future pipeline of development and redevelopment opportunities with $1.9 billion in acquisitions. These value creation-related acquisitions also included in-place cash flows that contributed to a very strong NOI growth in the quarter. Importantly, though, through these acquisitions, we added a number of very high-quality current and future development and redevelopment projects to our pipeline. 
Another key driver of strong NOI growth in the first quarter was the delivery and completion of development and redevelopment projects, aggregating 376,000 rentable square feet that were 100% leased. And on average, these were delivered mid-quarter. As of March 31, we had 4 million rentable square feet of some of the best laboratory space under construction that was highly leased negotiating at 76%. And this included 1 million rentable square feet of projects that were added in the first quarter. 
Now importantly, over the last 4 quarters, our team executed leases aggregating almost 1.8 million rentable square feet related to the development and redevelopment projects. And this included 789,000 rentable square feet of leases that we executed in the current quarter. Now these are truly spectacular stats, highlighting that we are the trusted partner to the life science industry. 
Now we are very pleased with our allocation of capital to these value-creation projects as these projects are on track to generate significant value, as highlighted by the partial interest sale we completed in the first quarter at a spectacular cap rate of 4%. We have a great pipeline of near-term and intermediate-term projects aggregating 9.2 million rentable square feet, and we're in a strong position to meet the demand from our broad and diverse network of life science and ag tech relationships. 
We have also been very strategic and disciplined with sources of capital and have, for many years, been taking advantage of the continued exceptional growth in private market valuation for our properties. As Peter highlighted, we completed a 70% partial interest sale at $301 million in a Class A property located in south San Francisco that is leased long term to Merck. Now this transaction, as Peter highlighted, sold at a record cap rate of 4% and at $1,429 per square foot and really generated a spectacular profit margin of 53%. 
Now this transaction highlights continued tightening of cap rates and growth in price per square foot for our high-quality life science properties. Proceeds from real estate dispositions remain an important low-cost component of our sources of capital each year. And we have completed real estate dispositions aggregating $324 million to date and have several transactions moving along that will allow us to hit our real estate disposition forecast range from $1.25 billion to $1.5 billion, and we expect to provide more details on real estate dispositions next quarter. Now additionally, we expect to generate capital for reinvestment from our venture investment program and more on this topic in a moment. 
Next, I wanted to really turn to real estate, which is at the core of our strong growth. We reported total revenues in the first quarter of $480 million or $1.9 billion annualized, up 9.1% over the first quarter of '20 and over double total revenues reported 5 years ago in the first quarter of 2016. Now we continue to report exceptional real estate financial and operating results, resulting in solid growth in our outlook for 2021. 
We delivered the following outstanding results in the quarter: very strong cash net operating income growth of 10.3%; and again, congratulations to our leasing team for truly awesome execution of leasing. We hit the second highest quarter of leases executed in the history of the company at 1.7 million rentable square feet. Continued strong rental rate growth on lease renewals and re-leasing the space at 36.2% and 17.4% on a cash basis, and we're in a great position today and updated our outlook for rental rate growth for 2021 by 100 basis points to a range from 30% to 33% and from 17% to 20% on a cash basis. 
And again, record leasing on the development and redevelopment projects over the last 4 quarters at 1.8 million rentable square feet. That includes the 789,000 square feet that we executed on in the first quarter. Now we're off to a great start, and we're on track for strong same-property NOI growth for 2021. First quarter same-property NOI growth was strong and up 4.4% and 6.1% on a cash basis. And the strength of our real estate vertical drove improvement in our outlook for same-property NOI growth for 2021. 
We increased our outlook by 50 basis points to a range from 1.5% to 3.5% and 30 basis points on a cash basis to a range from 4.3% to 6.3%. Our EBITDA margin was very strong at 69%, one of the best in the REIT industry. And our occupancy remains very strong at 94.5% and represents a key area that will drive growth in cash flows in 2021 and 2022. And please refer to Page 25 of our supplemental package for details on the recently acquired vacancy aggregating 1.2 million rentable square feet. 26% of this 1.2 million rentable square feet -- a vacancy is leased with most of this 26% taking occupancy over the next 2 quarters. 
And we're forecasting solid occupancy growth in 2021 of 100 basis points, with half of this increase forecasted in the third quarter and the remaining growth in the fourth quarter. We're also forecasting stronger occupancy growth into 2022. 
Now briefly on venture investments. Our venture investment portfolio continues to perform exceptionally well. And as of March 31, had unrealized gains of $729 million on an adjusted cost basis of $912 million. Now our adjusted cost base has represented only 3.2% of gross assets as of March 31. Realized gains on our venture investments included an FFO per share were $24.3 million, up only $2.7 million over the fourth quarter of '20.
Now looking forward to the rest of 2021. Realized gains from our venture investments should be in the $25 million to $27 million range per quarter. Now importantly, we also realized an additional gain of $22.9 million that related to an investment in a privately-held clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused in the oncology area that was acquired by a large equity cap biopharma company. 
Now this significant gain related to 1 transaction and was excluded from FFO per share as adjusted. We have significant unrealized gains of $725 million in our venture investment holdings, and we hope to have additional opportunities to generate capital and reduce the portion of our future equity capital needs by approximately $100 million in 2021. 
Now turning to our very strong and flexible balance sheet, which really supports our strategic growth initiatives. We're very proud of what our team has accomplished over recent years. Our overall corporate credit ratings from Moody's and S&P ranks within the top 10% of all equity REITs. Over the past 9 quarters, our team has issued $6.2 billion of unsecured senior notes payable, representing 72% of our total outstanding debt at a weighted average effective rate of 3.26% and a term of almost 16 years. 
Now the debt capital consisted of both growth capital and refinancing capital that significantly extended our weighted average remaining term of outstanding debt to 13 years and locked in very attractive long-term fixed rate debt. The February 2021 bond offering was a key example. We took advantage of very attractive interest rate environment, and they opportunistically issued $1.75 billion in unsecured notes, with a portion of the proceeds used to refinance $650 million of notes that were due in 2024. Now these new notes were issued at an amazingly low rate of 2% for 11-year notes, 3% for 30-year notes. 
Also, we just wanted to highlight other balance sheet statistics for the quarter and the year. We remain on track for continued improvement in net debt to adjusted EBITDA to 5.2x by year-end. Our fixed charge coverage ratio is very strong and has increased to 4.7x for the first quarter annualized And we continue to maintain significant liquidity of $4.3 billion. And as Joel had touched on earlier, no debt maturities until 2024 and only $184 million coming due in 2024. 
Touching on guidance here as we wrap up. As a reminder, just want to refer you to Pages 11 and 12 of our supplemental package for detailed and updated guidance assumptions for 2021. Our improved outlook for 2021 over the prior guidance captures the strength of our real estate performance, including an improvement in rental rate growth and growth in both same-property and overall net operating income. 
Now EPS diluted was updated to a range from $1.58 to $1.68, and FFO per share as adjusted was updated to a range from $7.68 to $7.78. And the midpoint of that range for FFO per share of $7.73 is up $0.03 over the prior guidance and represents projected growth of about 5.9% over our strong FFO per share results for 2020 of $7.30. With that, let me turn it back over to Joel. Thank you."

So I think the -- Dean, correct me if I'm wrong, I think yields will likely come out in future subs. I'm not sure we want to quote anything at this point. But I think, Sheila, Moderna has turned out to be one of those monumental companies, and vaccines were really almost nonexistent or a sideshow in their business plan for the last decade. But it's pretty clear that we own the adjacent location where it is mission-critical manufacturing for the vaccine. 
And as you can imagine, they're looking at lots of opportunities to expand that because the vaccine is not a 1 or 2 and done. This is likely to be like the flu, where you're going to have to get boosters on a fairly regular basis. So this is really part of their strategic plan to be able to supply both the United States and part of the world with much needed vaccines now and into the future. 
And it's going to be iterating because the variants are going to cause changes in what the vaccine needs to do. And so we felt that as the go-to landlord for Moderna, this was in both of our interests to make happen. So I hope that's helpful as just kind of a framework.

So as everybody knows, many on this call either live or work in New York and have seen over the last year what's happened there, still a somewhat tough place to be. Security is s",716,"Yes. So let me maybe take those in reverse and maybe speak to New York City. So as everybody knows, many on this call either live or work in New York and have seen over the last year what's happened there, still a somewhat tough place to be. Security is still an issue. Unfortunately, crime rates and shootings have gone up, really skyrocketed in enormous fashion. So we're very focused on the security of our campus. Our campuses is almost full although we're creating some additional space in the existing 2 buildings and moving a number of tenants around to accommodate growth. And we're also filling up Long Island City, which is kind of a nice relief valve. 
We're in discussions with the city on the North Tower. We are going to break ground here over the past many months, but clearly, because of what's going on there and the change in the macro environment, we didn't go forward instantly. We had to rejigger kind of what we're thinking about, but we're in discussions with the city to see how best we can move that forward. 
I think you have to remember, New York, growing a cluster is like having a baby for 25 years. And it's painful, right? And we're in the -- we're just finishing the first decade. And literally, New York, when we came and launched our first building there in 2010 and then into 2011 and beyond, literally no research -- life science research was done there, world-class academic work, world-class clinical work, [ 1 ] incubator up on the Columbia campus. But by and -- Pfizer had a headquarters there. But by and large, no research. 
Since then, we've made enormous strides. We've gotten venture capital off the ground there. A lot of companies have started. But we don't see big companies. They're reluctant and haven't really been successful in moving any big companies there. The recent tax efforts by the state certainly are aggressive to, I think, growth in New York, adding on to the tax burden in New York City, New York state, et cetera, and then a federal is kind of hurtful. 
So New York has a range of issues. It's great substrate, great NIH money, venture is formed, but it's going to take another decade or part of 1.5 decades to really grow that into a real-life secondary market like some of the others that you know much better. So it's a work in process. We see some company formation. There's certainly institutional demand and so forth, but it's different than the other markets. 
So maybe moving to Research Triangle, and I might have either Peter or Steve give any macro comments as well. But we made a move last summer. We felt that Research Triangle was an important part of the life science landscape, it has been for many years. We have both several mega campuses, both on the life science side and now the first one of its kind here in the U.S., maybe in the world, on the agrifood side, agrifood tech. 
And so we think it's a very, very good location. It's attracted a lot of brains from many places around the country, anchored by the 3 great universities, UNC, Duke and NC State. And it's been just a really, really good place to be. It used to be looked at as kind of a manufacturing or kind of a tertiary kind of location. I think today, it's moved up and become one of the hot and truly important places and people like to live there. I think that's going to be important going into the future. 
Is it a good place to live? And if you compare walking around in the Triangle versus New York City, New York City is tough these days. You see what's going on in the subways. And hopefully, governance will get better, security will get better and improve and hopefully, COVID will recede. But walking around in the Triangle is like being in heaven. So I think that's why a lot of companies have been moving there, and we've increased our footprint pretty dramatically. But Steve or -- Steve, you really started a lot of our efforts down there. So maybe a comment or 2 for you."

There was pretty dramatic tax reform in 2017 where multinationals previously charged with full U.S. corporate tax rates and they kept much of the cash overseas. They kind of -- it's called the GILTI tax, G-I-L-T-I. They kind of opened that up, lowered that dramatically. 
And you saw a lot of companies, including a lot of big pharma and companies like Apple, Facebook, Google, others, Microsoft, other big techs bringing back large amounts of capital to invest in this country. So we had a couple of years of really positive repatriation not only of capital but reinvestment in the United States, which was really positive. 
I think COVID then shone a very bright or shined a very bright light on the medical supply chains where, as I said, 70% of medical supply chain, many of it intermediates to create pharmaceutical products, et cetera, even just normal plastic gloves and all the stuff that we call PPE, 70% of that was sourced overseas, and we were seeing dramatic movement of that back to the United States. It's not just pills and stuff like that, it was very broad. 
And I think to reverse that or even to put out the word that you're going to start to shift that, I think, is one of the worst things you could do in the middle of a -- midway in the pandemic. I'm not sure what inning we're in. We'd have to ask Fauci or some of those folks based on what they see. But I think it's fair to say I was in a Zoom call with a company just getting off the ground here in the United States. And the first thing they did was set up operations and IP in Ireland, which has a 12.5% tax rate where we're going to be going to, I don't know whether it will be 28% or something like that. China is at 25% and most of the world is sub-28%. There's only a handful that are above that. 
So that's not a good place to be if you want to create jobs and want to really jolt this economy forward, given the damage that we've suffered over the past year from the pandemic. So I don't know. I have pretty strong feelings. And I think many people who are in corporate America believe that there are better ways to do that than become anticompetitive. 
And I think the administration's comments about, well, they're going to try to arrange a kind of a global tax kind of arrangement where everybody is charging the same rate, it's done through what's called the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a global minimum tax. Well, okay, that's a total joke. There's no 1 that's going to sign on to that. But -- so yes, bad news."

But I wonder if the shift will turn maybe more to therapies as opposed to vaccines in the sense that if we feel like we can be treated for it, even if we -- if it is an annual event, we know there's a thorough flu out there to take care of it beyond remdesivir.

So if by popular opinion, we'll bring Jenna back next quarter maybe, but we decided not to do that just because vaccines are kind of in the -- at the forefront, the country is making, I think, good progress. We'll see how that goes. But you are seeing India has hit an all-time high. And if you look at pictures of what's going on there, it literally breaks your heart. 
We've got some severe outbreaks throughout the United States. Michigan, which has been one of the toughest shutdown states, so go figure that out, is having some tough time. So we're still, I don't know, we may be in the fifth inning, something like that. I don't want to be a Dr. Fauci here, but we got a long way to go here and it's going to be with us. This just doesn't go away. It comes back in various forms. 
But I think when it comes to your question on therapies, I think if people rely on therapies like flu therapies or other kinds of therapies for COVID, I think that's a huge mistake. And we'll, next quarter, address that. I'll ask Jenna to specifically address it. But what I think is the challenge is if you get COVID, there is a cohort of patients. Right now, people, if you ask Scott Gottlieb and others, right now, it's maybe 10%, 15%, don't know if that number is too low or too high, but my guess is it could be right about right and could be higher, who are experiencing the long-haul symptoms. 
If you ever look at some of the articles on COVID, COVID attacks almost every system in the body. And it's something that you would not want to get and just get over because you don't know what the long-haul results are to the brain, to the immune system, to circulatory -- all the systems of the body. So I don't think the therapy is the answer. I think it's immunization and hopefully, herd immunity, although there's a cohort of people here in the United States who simply won't take the vaccine, which there may be medical reasons, there may be religious reasons. But I think it is hard to understand the assumption of the risk for one's self and others if you don't have those issues, not to take the vaccine. So long-winded answer. I hope that's helpful."

Our tenants haven't focused on your specific question but they have focused on really environmentally-friendly, sustainable real estate solutions. If you look across their business, if you take just a sample of our top 20 tenants as an example and look at their ESG initiatives, sustainability is a high priority across their entire business, real estate being a very small component. They actually touch on real estate a little bit on a few of the top 20 tenants. 
And as Joel highlighted, carbon-neutral, energy-neutral buildings, et cetera, just beyond lead today is super important. Most of these biopharma companies today have set carbon neutrality goals that are well inside the broad 2050 type of target dates that some have put out there.

Actually, I think your comment on heading to parity, that's actually -- when you started asking your question, I was like the geographic differences that used to be obvious are being blurred. Once you get down to 4% caps, I would not be surprised -- obviously, 4% cap is being achieved in Cambridge. I would not be surprised to see it go below 4% in Cambridge at some point soon. 
A high-quality asset in San Diego was probably at 5%, low 5% cap 2 years ago, and I would expect that to be a low 4% cap today. So things are starting to -- or the difference, the geographic difference that cap rates had before are really starting to narrow. And it's probably obvious that there's so many people out there looking for exposure to life science that the geography doesn't matter as much as it does to get the exposure to life science."

And with me today are Dean Shigenaga, Steve Richardson and Peter Moglia. And we want to wish everybody a safe and healthy go-forward year. We want to welcome all to this first quarter",1408,"Thank you, Paula, and welcome, everybody, to our first quarter call. And with me today are Dean Shigenaga, Steve Richardson and Peter Moglia. And we want to wish everybody a safe and healthy go-forward year. 
We want to welcome all to this first quarter call as well and recognize and thank the entire Alexandria family team for the operationally excellent and truly stellar first quarter earnings report by all metrics and measures. We collectively continue to operate at an outstandingly high level into the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic.  
And as I'm often fond of quoting Jim Collins of Good to Great fame, commented on Alexandria's feature in our annual report, Alexandria has achieved the 3 outputs that define a great company: superior results, and we believe the first quarter is emblematic of that distinctive impact; and we believe that our social responsibility programs have truly made a difference; and lasting endurance. And with respect to lasting endurance, we sit here at literally several decades after we were founded in 1994, and I'll talk more about that in a moment.  
We're particularly proud of the 6 pillars of our highly impactful and long-standing social responsibility efforts: accelerating groundbreaking medical research to advance life-saving treatments and cures; harnessing the entire agrifood ecosystem to combat hunger, improve nutrition and support human health at its most fundamental level; thirdly, bolstering the resilience of our military, our veterans and their families; fourth, conquering the opioid epidemic and revolutionizing addiction treatment; the fifth pillar that we've spent a tremendous amount of time in over the last year and for a good part of the last decade, educationally empowering underserved students to achieve long-term success and reach their potential as important principled leaders in the community; and then finally, building a model for comprehensive sustainable solution to address homelessness.  
Alexandria is also proud to be the focus cover story of the January/February 2021 Nareit Magazine, showcasing that we have pioneered a novel data-driven comprehensive care model to overcome the opioid epidemic launched in Dayton, Ohio. We're now focused on adopting a similar model but in different respects to the homeless problem, which has really become pretty out of control in many urban cities. And it is fraught with a lot of complex stratified issues and actually is more of an issue of health care than it is simply one of housing.  
We've been recognized as a leader and continuing -- and we continue to enhance our leadership in the area of sustainability. And we're on pace to achieve our first -- sorry, net zero energy building in South San Francisco, one of our important submarkets and only 1 of 70 of such buildings in the entire world. So we're very proud of that achievement when we finally get the designation.  
I always try to think about a theme on each quarter, and they are so different, given macro and micro circumstances. And I would say the theme for the first quarter has to be exceptional core and internal growth and really stellar value creation and external growth, both of which have driven our continued outstanding earnings results and as the absolute go-to landlord in life science real estate. Leasing demand for Alexandria's owned and operated first-in-class assets is at a historical high.  
And as I alluded to a moment ago, first quarter of 1994, 27 years ago this quarter, we completed our Series A financing led by Jacobs Engineering for $19 million, and here we sit 27 years later to the quarter with a total market cap of $32.5 billion and among the top 10 of all REITs. I remember attending the first REIT conference, I think it was in New Orleans in 1994, and I didn't know a single soul, so we've come a long way. And we still are in our fourth consecutive quarter of COVID-19, something we -- none of us will ever forget.  
The stellar results by any measure of metric is we're very proud, and we thank each and every one of our great team members. Dean will speak to the outstanding core and internal growth results driven in part by strong rental rate growth, and particularly featured this quarter in the San Francisco Bay region, among others, one of our highest leasing quarters ever. And Steve and Peter will also speak to our stellar value creation growth, in part driven by our collaborative Fenway blockbuster transaction, and we greatly appreciate and recognize the team that put that together.  
A very highly leased valuation creation pipeline, which will provide continuing growth for Alexandria, and so we're very proud of that. Also important to note, and I think Steve, Peter and Dean will also allude to this, our partial interest sale this quarter, I think, set a true benchmark valuation for Alexandria owned and operated first-in-class lab space in the South San Francisco submarket, led by both Steve and Peter. And Peter, in particular, who we brought here in 1998, who had special and unique joint venture talents and a stellar network, and we've been at it under his guidance there for 20 years. So we thank those 2 very much for that execution and the teams that supported them.  
We completed our first quarter with a very strong balance sheet, Dean will talk about that, with no debt maturities until 2024. And as some of you are aware, we filed an S-1 with the SEC to raise $250 million for an Alexandria-sponsored SPAC, importantly, because we believe there was a real need for this in our core agrifood tech industry. And as we are in a quiet period, we won't be discussing this at all.  
Moving on to life science industry for a moment. The velocity and continuing demand for Alexandria lab space across our cluster markets is as strong as we've ever experienced. The pace of FDA approvals during the first quarter remained very strong, with FDA approving 14 new drugs. 36% of those were Alexandria client tenants.  
We also note strong bipartisan support and a proposed whopping 20% increase for the budgets of NIH, CDC and HHS. We don't know about FDA at this moment. And hopefully, the administration will select, in the not-too-distant future, a true great leader there, and we're hoping for that. Public markets continued their strong pace with $4.5 billion raised and 29 IPOs this past quarter and -- I'm sorry, $12.6 billion raised in follow-on offerings, truly kind of a stellar capital markets quarter. Biopharma continues to invest heavily in its own R&D, likely north of $225 billion for all of 2021.  
Let me comment a moment about some proposed corporate tax changes that were announced by the current administration, which, if enacted into law, would foolishly and directly hurt U.S. manufacturing, U.S. R&D and the repatriation of crucial supply chains that became evident in the pandemic that we were really woefully unprepared and relied on 70% of our supply chain efforts outside of the United States. I would say, mission-critical sectors, including biopharma, certainly will not be helped. In essence, the threat to the American competitiveness is way bigger and way more important than the everyday life of Americans, and higher rates -- than higher rates and a sad commentary on poor public policy. 
It's interesting to note the paradox of this pandemic moment. Large corporations have oftentimes been politically villainized, derided by the left and the right, yet the main and perhaps only reason COVID-19 scourge is easing is the vaccines that were developed by biopharma and some in connection with the government in a groundbreaking effort with the warp speed effort, and we're very thankful for that.  
I think to quote Alex Gorsky, CEO of J&J, he made a pretty important quote recently and said, ""We fundamentally believe that having a market-based, innovation-based biopharmaceutical industry as well as a medical technology environment is critical to long-term -- is critical long term to produce the best overall outcomes for health care."" And I think that absolutely rings true.  
So as I do each quarter, let me finish with a -- or I did last quarter and will each quarter, a quote, kind of a timely quote. I quoted Confucius last quarter. Let me quote this quarter Steve Prefontaine, one of the world-class runners of his time. ""To give anything less than your best is to sacrifice the gift."" And with that, let me turn it over to Steve Richardson."

Now the fi",522,"Thank you, Joel, and welcome, everybody, as well. As we presented during the last quarterly call, 2020 represented an exceptional year of high-quality growth for Alexandria as we increased the asset base by 27% to nearly 50 million square feet. Now the first quarter of 2021, a truly blowout quarter by all metrics, has clearly signaled the continuation of this exceptional growth trajectory and definitively affirms Alexandria's leadership role in the now core life science asset class and its highly valued status within the broad life science ecosystem.  
The company's 27-year commitment to operational excellence at every level fuels the following outperformance highlights for Q1. Accounts receivable, we've collected 99.4% of our April AR billings as of today. And again, Alexandria's labs are essential infrastructure and have been operational from day 1 in the pandemic. 
Some detail on leasing outperformance. During Q1, we leased approximately 1,677,000 square feet, which notably represents the second highest quarterly leasing activity during the past 5 years, an amazing statistic considering the broader turmoil in the office market. 
Peter will touch on this in more detail, but the current and near-term development pipeline continues to deliver value in a derisked manner as we are at 76% leased and negotiating even while adding 1 million square feet of new starts during this quarter. 
The core, in particular, is exceptionally strong. Continue to highlight and bring everyone's attention to the embedded growth and value within the core operating platform comprised now of nearly 34 million square feet, with cash increases this quarter of 17.4% and GAAP increases of 36.2%.  
On occupancy, also very, very solid with 94.5%, which has grown in excess of 2 million square feet this quarter compared to Q4 through our strategic acquisition activity. 
And we want to continue to bring to everyone's attention the near-term opportunity for increasing cash flows through the lease-up of 1.2 million square feet of existing inventory provided by these recent acquisitions.  
Overall, on market health, demand continues to be robust in our core clusters, and our mega campus offerings provide a significant competitive advantage to the company. 
Importantly, subleases are in tight check. Since the start of 2021, just 2 subleases have been brought to market in one of our clusters, and both of those subleases have already been put under LOI. 
Supply more broadly is constrained for 2021 across all of our markets. And in the 2 largest markets for 2022, we see nearly 50% of the supply is preleased in greater Boston. And in the San Francisco Bay Area, we're monitoring just 2 projects for potential vertical activity in 2022.  
And as we've stated before, Alexandria's mega campus high-quality Class A product offerings continue to outperform any inferior one-off Class B office conversions in isolated locations.  
The year 2020 was truly an amazing year for Alexandria at the vanguard and heart of the life science ecosystem. And now the first quarter of 2021 has exceeded those accomplishments with stellar performance. And in conclusion, I'd like to add to Joel's shout-out to the entire Alexandria team for this quarter's achievements. 
And with that, I'll hand it off to Peter."
365138,705363517,2259879,"Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. I'm going to update you all on our development pipeline, comment on construction cost escalations and discuss a couple of life science sales. We continue to work at a very productive pace, delivering 376,645 square feet during the quarter",1211,"Thanks, Steve. I'm going to update you all on our development pipeline, comment on construction cost escalations and discuss a couple of life science sales. 
We continue to work at a very productive pace, delivering 376,645 square feet during the quarter, including the full delivery of 9804 Medical Center Drive in Rockville, Maryland to a high-quality cell therapy company at an 8% cash yield, which was 80 basis points above our initial disclosure.  
The project's outperformance was the direct result of our best-in-class team who were able to drive down overall cost savings through a combination of adept schedule management, alternative construction techniques and highly effective coordination with the tenant. 
In addition, we fully delivered the 100,086-square-foot 1165 Eastlake Avenue East building in Seattle to Adaptive Biotechnologies, a cutting-edge public immune medicine company on the front lines of fighting COVID-19. This building is highly unique as it sits on the edge of Lake Union, offering expansive use of the lake, Queen Anne and downtown Seattle.  
Leasing activity on our pipeline continues to be robust with approximately 789,000 square feet leased during the quarter and another approximately 450,000 square feet in executed LOIs. Highlights include completing the lease-up of 3115 Merryfield Row, well in advance of its 2022 delivery date; incremental progress at Alexandria Center Life -- Long Island City, which is approaching being half leased and committed; and a surge of activity in both SD Tech and our newly acquired 201 Brookline asset in the Fenway area of Boston.  
At SD Tech, we executed LOIs increasing its lease negotiating status by 37% as tenants affirm the attractiveness of our transformation of this historical midsized tech campus into a highly amenitized science and technology mega campus. 
As impressive as that is, the response by the market to our Fenway transaction and 201 Brookline has been even more remarkable. When we closed on that transaction in late January, the asset was 17% leased. As we sit today, we have letters of intent that when converted to leases, will bring that percentage up to 84%. This is a testament to the trust life science companies have in our best-in-class brand as these opportunities came to 201 Brookline in large part because of Alexandria.  
Overall, with the addition of 5 new projects and the full delivery of 9804 Medical Center Drive, we now have approximately 4 million square feet under construction that is 66% preleased and 76% committed when including signed LOIs. That is only 2% below the committed leasing percentage from last year's -- or from last quarter, and as Steve alluded to, despite the fact that we've also added 1 million square feet of new projects.  
Given the recent news on anticipated inflation, we wanted to give you guys an update on construction cost escalations as it relates to our pipeline. Before we get into what is happening in the construction market, we want to note that the projects listed on Page 42 that make up the 4 million square feet under construction are largely subject to guaranteed maximum price contracts, which protect us from any escalations not already negotiated into the pricing. 
Under construction projects that are still in negotiations, those that -- well, the ones that are still in negotiations have been conservatively underwritten with a conservative escalation range applied in our underwriting. The 80 basis point yield at 9804 Medical Center Drive that I spoke about earlier is a testament to our conservative underwriting and outstanding budget management. 
As we all know, coming into 2020, we all expected growth in the real estate sector to continue. And we were all taken by surprise when the global pandemic created disruption in our personal and professional lives. As reported in our 1Q call last year, Alexandria was required to temporarily suspend 7 projects during the quarter due to COVID-19. But with life science being deemed an essential business, we were able to restart relatively quickly. 
That wasn't so for many other developers, and a large number of projects were put on hold or canceled altogether. That caused general and subcontractor backlogs to shrink. And for a moment, in the middle of the year, most major contractors assumed the worst and laid off workers. Demand for materials also diminished, and for a brief period of time, overall construction costs trended lower than pre-COVID levels. We know in California that costs dropped as much as 2% during that time. 
However, as news of the effectiveness of vaccines came to light towards the end of the year, the construction industry experienced a V-shaped recovery led by residential and advanced technology, with life science and health care contributing to the sudden increase as well. One of our major contractors had to pivot quickly and today is still spending 10 hours a week on hiring as backlogs grow. In addition to the shortage of labor, costs are being materially influenced by a shortage of subcontractor shop capacity. 
The makers of [ glazing ] ductwork and other prefabricated materials have more work than they can handle, so many are increasing pricing to control their backlog. On top of that, the demand for raw materials is putting pressure on steel, copper, lumber and plywood. Steel is up 20% from April 2020 to February of this year. Copper is up 37%, and lumber and plywood are up 62% over the same period. Although these percentages are high, materials are only 30% to 35% of the total cost stack. So we've been advised to plan for 5% to 6% annual escalations in the aggregate over the next 12 months. 
Rest assured, Alexandria constantly stays in front of this data, factors it into our underwriting and employs strategies to mitigate its impact. As a major developer with a number of significant major contractor and subcontractor relationships, we are able to leverage preferred pricing and priority in the Q. We have a great reputation among our vendors as we treat them like partners, and that enables us to continue to deliver on time and on budget in any market condition.
I'll conclude my commentary by talking about some private cap rates that you should factor into your NAV models. Our own partial interest sale of the 300,930-square-foot 213 East Grand building in South San Francisco was executed at a record 4% cap rate and translates to a value of $1,429 per square foot. This should be very impactful to our overall valuation as South San Francisco is one of our largest submarkets as we hold 3.3 million square feet in operation or under development. 
Despite the fact that the rent is approximately 20% to 25% below market on that asset, the lease goes for another 12 years. So we believe the yield is very reflective of what investors are willing to pay today for first-in-class Alexandria owned and stabilized assets. 
We'd also like to report that Blackstone sold the 454,000-square-foot, 96% leased Science + Technology Park at Johns Hopkins to Ventas for $272 million or $600 per square foot, which is a 4.8% cap rate. Although the asset has strong tenancy, the neighborhood is tough. So this was a positive outcome for Blackstone and another testament to the high demand for life science assets today. 
With that, I'll pass it over to Dean."

Dean Shigenaga here, and good afternoon, everyone. I just want to kick off with a huge congratulations to our entire team for just a spectacular quarter of exceptional execution. The first quarter of 2021, when you compare it to the fourth",1678,"Peter, thanks. Dean Shigenaga here, and good afternoon, everyone. I just want to kick off with a huge congratulations to our entire team for just a spectacular quarter of exceptional execution. The first quarter of 2021, when you compare it to the fourth quarter, reflects one of the strongest operating and financial results in the company's history, with our unique and differentiated life science real estate platform really at the core of this very strong growth. Our highly experienced team, trusted partnership to the life science industry and high-quality campuses  in key centers of innovation continues to generate significant growth and value. 
Now I want to kick off with allocation and sources of capital. We continue to remain very disciplined with the allocation of capital in the projects that have and will generate significant long-term cash flows and tremendous value for our company and shareholders. 
Now let me take a moment to highlight again the exceptional execution by our team. During the first quarter, we strategically increased our current and future pipeline of development and redevelopment opportunities with $1.9 billion in acquisitions. These value creation-related acquisitions also included in-place cash flows that contributed to a very strong NOI growth in the quarter. Importantly, though, through these acquisitions, we added a number of very high-quality current and future development and redevelopment projects to our pipeline. 
Another key driver of strong NOI growth in the first quarter was the delivery and completion of development and redevelopment projects aggregating 376,000 rentable square feet that were 100% leased. And on average, these were delivered mid-quarter. As of March 31, we had 4 million rentable square feet of some of the best laboratory space under construction that was highly leased negotiating at 76%. And this included 1 million rentable square feet of projects that were added in the first quarter. 
Now importantly, over the last 4 quarters, our team executed leases aggregating almost 1.8 million rentable square feet related to the development and redevelopment projects. And this included 789,000 rentable square feet of leases that we executed in the current quarter. Now these are truly spectacular stats, highlighting that we are the trusted partner to the life science industry. 
Now we are very pleased with our allocation of capital to these value-creation projects as these projects are on track to generate significant value, as highlighted by the partial interest sale we completed in the first quarter at a spectacular cap rate of 4%. We have a great pipeline of near-term and intermediate-term projects aggregating 9.2 million rentable square feet, and we're in a strong position to meet the demand from our broad and diverse network of life science and ag tech relationships. 
We have also been very strategic and disciplined with sources of capital and have, for many years, been taking advantage of the continued exceptional growth in private market valuation for our properties. As Peter highlighted, we completed a 70% partial interest sale at $301 million in a Class A property located in South San Francisco that is leased long term to Merck. Now this transaction, as Peter highlighted, sold at a record cap rate of 4% and at $1,429 per square foot and really generated a spectacular profit margin of 53%. 
Now this transaction highlights continued tightening of cap rates and growth in price per square foot for our high-quality life science properties. Proceeds from real estate dispositions remain an important low-cost component of our sources of capital each year. And we have completed real estate dispositions aggregating $324 million to date and have several transactions moving along that will allow us to hit our real estate disposition forecast range from $1.25 billion to $1.5 billion, and we expect to provide more details on real estate dispositions next quarter. Now additionally, we expect to generate capital for reinvestment from our venture investment program and more on this topic in a moment. 
Next, I wanted to really turn to real estate, which is at the core of our strong growth. We reported total revenues in the first quarter of $480 million or $1.9 billion annualized, up 9.1% over the first quarter of '20 and over double total revenues reported 5 years ago in the first quarter of 2016. Now we continue to report exceptional real estate financial and operating results, resulting in solid growth in our outlook for 2021. 
We delivered the following outstanding results in the quarter. Very strong cash net operating income growth of 10.3%. And again, congratulations to our leasing team for truly awesome execution of leasing. We hit the second highest quarter of leases executed in the history of the company at 1.7 million rentable square feet. Continued strong rental rate growth on lease renewals and re-leasing the space at 36.2% and 17.4% on a cash basis. And we're in a great position today and updated our outlook for rental rate growth for 2021 by 100 basis points to a range from 30% to 33% and from 17% to 20% on a cash basis. And again, record leasing on the development and redevelopment projects over the last 4 quarters at 1.8 million rentable square feet. That includes the 789,000 square feet that we executed on in the first quarter. 
Now we're off to a great start, and we're on track for strong same-property NOI growth for 2021. First quarter same-property NOI growth was strong and up 4.4% and 6.1% on a cash basis. And the strength of our real estate vertical drove improvement in our outlook for same-property NOI growth for 2021. We increased our outlook by 50 basis points to a range from 1.5% to 3.5% and 30 basis points on a cash basis to a range from 4.3% to 6.3%. Our EBITDA margin was very strong at 69%, one of the best in the REIT industry. And our occupancy remains very strong at 94.5% and represents a key area that will drive growth in cash flows in 2021 and 2022. And please refer to Page 25 of our supplemental package for details on the recently acquired vacancy aggregating 1.2 million rentable square feet. 26% of this 1.2 million rentable square feet, a vacancy is leased, with most of this 26% taking occupancy over the next 2 quarters. And we're forecasting solid occupancy growth in 2021 of 100 basis points, with half of this increase forecasted in the third quarter and the remaining growth in the fourth quarter. We're also forecasting stronger occupancy growth into 2022. 
Now briefly on venture investments. Our venture investment portfolio continues to perform exceptionally well, and as of March 31, had unrealized gains of $729 million on an adjusted cost basis of $912 million. Now our adjusted cost basis represented only 3.2% of gross assets as of March 31. Realized gains on our venture investments included in FFO per share were $24.3 million, up only $2.7 million over the fourth quarter of '20.
Now looking forward to the rest of 2021. Realized gains from our venture investments should be in the $25 million to $27 million range per quarter. Now importantly, we also realized an additional gain of $22.9 million that related to an investment in a privately held clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused in the oncology area that was acquired by a large equity cap biopharma company. 
Now this significant gain related to 1 transaction and was excluded from FFO per share as adjusted. We have significant unrealized gains of $725 million in our venture investment holdings, and we hope to have additional opportunities to generate capital and reduce the portion of our future equity capital needs by approximately $100 million in 2021. 
Now turning to our very strong and flexible balance sheet, which really supports our strategic growth initiatives. We're very proud of what our team has accomplished over recent years. Our overall corporate credit ratings from Moody's and S&P ranks within the top 10% of all equity REITs. Over the past 9 quarters, our team has issued $6.2 billion of unsecured senior notes payable, representing 72% of our total outstanding debt at a weighted average effective rate of 3.26% and a term of almost 16 years. 
Now the debt capital consisted of both growth capital and refinancing capital that significantly extended our weighted average remaining term of outstanding debt to 13 years and locked in very attractive long-term fixed rate debt. The February 2021 bond offering was a key example. We took advantage of very attractive interest rate environment, and they opportunistically issued $1.75 billion in unsecured notes, with a portion of the proceeds used to refinance $650 million of notes that were due in 2024. Now these new notes were issued at an amazingly low rate of 2% for 11-year notes, 3% for 30-year notes. 
Also, we just wanted to highlight other balance sheet statistics for the quarter and the year. We remain on track for continued improvement in net debt to adjusted EBITDA to 5.2x by year-end. Our fixed charge coverage ratio is very strong and has increased to 4.7x for the first quarter annualized. And we continue to maintain significant liquidity of $4.3 billion. And as Joel had touched on earlier, no debt maturities until 2024 and only $184 million coming due in 2024. 
Touching on guidance here as we wrap up. As a reminder, just want to refer you to Pages 11 and 12 of our supplemental package for detailed and updated guidance assumptions for 2021. Our improved outlook for 2021 over the prior guidance captures the strength of our real estate performance, including an improvement in rental rate growth and growth in both same-property and overall net operating income. 
Now EPS diluted was updated to a range from $1.58 to $1.68. And FFO per share as adjusted was updated to a range from $7.68 to $7.78. And the midpoint of that range for FFO per share of $7.73 is up $0.03 over the prior guidance and represents projected growth of about 5.9% over our strong FFO per share results for 2020 of $7.30. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Joel. Thank you."

So as Joel said, I think there's a lot of talk out there, but we don't see a lot of action. Inevitably, there will be a handful of 50,000- to 100,000-square-foot offerings but nothing that really competes with the 1 million-plus square foot mega campus that's fully amenitized, with brand new or newly redeveloped Class A product that we're offering.

So I think the -- Dean, correct me if I'm wrong, I think yields will likely come out in future subs. I'm not sure we want to quote anything at this point. But I think, Sheila, Moderna has turned out to be one of those monumental companies, and vaccines were really almost nonexistent or a sideshow in their business plan for the last decade. But it's pretty clear that we own the adjacent location where it is mission-critical manufacturing for the vaccine. 
And as you can imagine, they're looking at lots of opportunities to expand that because the vaccine is not a 1 or 2 and done. This is likely to be like the flu, where you're going to have to get boosters on a fairly regular basis. So this is really part of their strategic plan to be able to supply both the United States and part of the world with much needed vaccines now and into the future. 
And it's going to be iterating because the variants are going to cause changes in what the vaccine needs to do. And so we felt that as the go-to landlord for Moderna, this was in both of our interests to make happen. So I hope that's helpful as just kind of a framework.

So let me maybe take those in reverse and maybe speak to New York City. So as everybody knows, many on this call either live or work in New York and have seen over the last year what's happened there, still a somewhat tough place to be. Security is still an issue. Unfortunately, crime rates and shootings have gone up, really skyrocketed in enormous fashion. So we're very focused on the security of our campus. Our campus is almost full, although we're creating some additional space in the existing 2 buildings and moving a number of tenants around to accommodate growth. And we're also filling up Long Island City, which is kind of a nice relief valve. 
We're in discussions with the city on the North Tower. We are going to break ground here over the past many months, but clearly, because of what's going on there and the change in the macro environment, we didn't go forward instantly. We had to rejigger kind of what we're thinking about, but we're in discussions with the city to see how best we can move that forward. 
I think you have to remember, New York, growing a cluster is like having a baby for 25 years. And it's painful, right? And we're in the -- we're just finishing the first decade. And literally, New York, when we came and launched our first building there in 2010 and then into 2011 and beyond, literally no research -- life science research was done there, world-class academic work, world-class clinical work, 1 incubator up in -- up on the Columbia campus. But by and -- Pfizer had a headquarters there. But by and large, no research. 
Since then, we've made enormous strides. We've gotten venture capital off the ground there. A lot of companies have started. But we don't see big companies. They're reluctant and haven't really been successful in moving any big companies there. The recent tax efforts by the state certainly are aggressive to, I think, growth in New York, adding on to the tax burden in New York City, New York state, et cetera, and then a federal is kind of hurtful. 
So New York has a range of issues. It's great substrate, great NIH money, venture is formed, but it's going to take another decade or part of 1.5 decades to really grow that into a real-life secondary market, like some of the others that you know much better. So it's a work in process. We see some company formation. There's certainly institutional demand and so forth, but it's different than the other markets. 
So maybe moving to Research Triangle, and I might have either Peter or Steve give any macro comments as well. But we made a move last summer. We felt that Research Triangle was an important part of the life science landscape. It has been for many years. We have both several mega campuses, both on the life science side and now the first one of its kind here in the U.S., maybe in the world, on the agrifood side, agrifood tech. 
And so we think it's a very, very good location. It's attracted a lot of brains from many places around the country, anchored by the 3 great universities, UNC, Duke and NC State. And it's been just a really, really good place to be. It used to be looked at as kind of a manufacturing or kind of a tertiary kind of location. I think today, it's moved up and become one of the hot and truly important places, and people like to live there. I think that's going to be important going into the future, is it a good place to live. 
And if you compare walking around in the Triangle versus New York City, New York City is tough these days. You see what's going on in the subways. And hopefully, governance will get better, security will get better and improve, and hopefully, COVID will recede. But walking around in the Triangle is like being in heaven. So I think that's why a lot of companies have been moving there, and we've increased our footprint pretty dramatically. 
But Steve or -- Steve, you really started a lot of our efforts down there. So maybe a comment or 2 for you."

And you saw a lot of companies, including a lot of big pharma and companies like Apple, Facebook, Google, others -- Microsoft, other big techs bringing back large amounts of capital to invest in this country. So we had a couple of years of really positive repatriation not only of capital but reinvestment in the United States, which was really positive. 
I think COVID then shone a very bright -- or shined a very bright light on the medical supply chains where, as I said, 70% of medical supply chain, many of it intermediates to create pharmaceutical products, et cetera, even just normal plastic gloves and all the stuff that we call PPE, 70% of that was sourced overseas, and we were seeing dramatic movement of that back to the United States. It's not just pills and stuff like that, it was very broad. 
And I think to reverse that or even to put out the word that you're going to start to shift that, I think, is one of the worst things you could do in the middle of a -- or midway in the pandemic. I'm not sure what inning we're in. We'd have to ask Fauci or some of those folks based on what they see. 
But I think it's fair to say I was in a Zoom call with a company just getting off the ground here in the United States. And the first thing they did was set up operations and IP in Ireland, which has a 12.5% tax rate where we're going to be going to, I don't know what it will be, 28% or something like that. China is at 25%. And most of the world is sub-28%. There's only a handful that are above that. 
So that's not a good place to be if you want to create jobs and want to really jolt this economy forward, given the damage that we've suffered over the past year from the pandemic. So I don't know. I have pretty strong feelings. And I think many people who are in corporate America believe that there are better ways to do that than become anticompetitive. 
And I think the administration's comments about, well, they're going to try to arrange a -- kind of a global tax kind of arrangement where everybody is charging the same rate. It's done through what's called the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, a global minimum tax. Well, okay, that's a total joke. There's no one that's going to sign on to that. But -- so yes, bad news."

But I do have a question for the team there and maybe she's around. The vaccine success is wonderful. You mentioned this is not -- there's more to come, treating it more like a flu. 
But I wonder if the shift will turn maybe more to therapies as opposed to vaccines in the sense that if we feel like we can be treated for it, even if we -- it is an annual event. We know there's a thorough flu out there to take care of it beyond remdesivir. I'm just wondering if you can comment on that at all."

So if by popular opinion, we'll bring Jenna back next quarter maybe, but we decided not to do that just because vaccines are kind of in the -- at the forefront, the country is making, I think, good progress. We'll see how that goes. But you are seeing India has hit an all-time high. And if you look at pictures of what's going on there, it literally breaks your heart. 
We've got some severe outbreaks throughout the United States. Michigan, which has been one of the toughest shutdown states, so go figure that out, is having some tough time. So we're still -- I don't know, we may be in the fifth inning, something like that. I don't want to be a Dr. Fauci here. But we got a long way to go here, and it's going to be with us. This just doesn't go away. It comes back in various forms. 
But I think when it comes to your question on therapies, I think if people rely on therapies like flu therapies or other kinds of therapies for COVID, I think that's a huge mistake. And we'll, next quarter, address that. I'll ask Jenna to specifically address it. 
But what I think is the challenge is, if you get COVID, there is a cohort of patients. Right now, people -- if you ask Scott Gottlieb and others, right now, it's maybe 10%, 15%, don't know if that number is too low or too high, but my guess is it could be right about right and could be higher, who are experiencing the long-haul symptoms. 
If you ever look at some of the articles on COVID, COVID attacks almost every system in the body. And it's something that you would not want to get and just get over because you don't know what the long-haul results are to the brain, to the immune system, to circulatory -- all the systems of the body. So I don't think the therapy is the answer. I think it's immunization and, hopefully, herd immunity, although there's a cohort of people here in the United States who simply won't take the vaccine, which there may be medical reasons, there may be religious reasons. But I think it is hard to understand the assumption of the risk for one's self and others if you don't have those issues not to take the vaccine. So long-winded answer. I hope that's helpful, Rick."

Our tenants haven't focused on your specific question, but they have focused on really environmentally friendly, sustainable real estate solutions. If you look across their business, if you take just a sample of our top 20 tenants as an example and look at their ESG initiatives, sustainability is a high priority across their entire business, real estate being a very small component. They actually touched on real estate a little bit on a few of the top 20 tenants. 
And as Joel highlighted, carbon-neutral, energy-neutral buildings, et cetera, just beyond lead today, is super important. Most of these biopharma companies today have set carbon neutrality goals that are well inside the broad 2050 type of target dates that some have put out there. And so I think overall, it's super important. I think for us, when we think about building green and sustainable buildings, it plays not only strategically important to our business but plays right into the strategies of our tenants as well. So I think it works well. 
And I think you pointed the obvious challenge that all companies are facing today is how do you read carbon neutrality today at a pace that needs to be faster than maybe possible at the moment, given technologies and solutions that are available. But if we don't put our best foot forward to be impactful here, we won't get anywhere close to some of the deadlines in different jurisdictions.

With me here today are Jenna Foger, Peter Moglia, Steve Richardson, and Dean Shigenaga. 
I want to welcome all to this second quarter call. And also, as I always try to do to recognize and thank the entire Alexandria family team for one of the best quarters in the entire history of the company with an operational tempo, really like none other, while working virtually most -- many of us for most of the past now into our second year of COVID. As Michael Jordan once said, some people want it to happen, some people wish it to happen, others make it happen. Alexandria makes it happen. We're deeply mission-driven and thankful for all that we do and urge you to read about many of our important programs and activities in the corporate social responsibility area in our press release and so. 
For a moment, keys to the second quarter, historic high demand for Alexandria's lab space and lab operations, which go along with that. Alexandria is at the vanguard of meeting the historic and high unprecedented demand from many of our more than 750 tenants for growth needs now and a critical path for future growth very importantly. 
Fundamental drivers of demand are the strongest we've ever seen. Rental rate growth continues unabated and no excess supply on the horizon at this time. We're very proud that we've got almost 7% quarter-to-quarter per share FFO growth, more than 40% rental rate growth, almost 18% NOI growth, almost 8% same-store NOI growth and a $1.3-plus billion annual NOI run rate, not to mention about $545 million in incremental revenue in our development and redevelopment pipeline. Alexandria truly has a demonstrable pricing power advantage in each of our cluster markets. And when life science tenants choose, they almost always prefer Alexandria's lab space and our operational excellence based on our critical lab operations. 
Nature Biotechnology, a magazine back in April wrote the following: 2020 was a year that smashed many records. Biotech saved your role in the pandemic attracted a stampede private and public investors alike. The pandemic apparently reinforced the requirement for long-term value-based investors of any kind to have exposure to life sciences.  And life science demand has in fact an all-time high as the world has recognized the importance of next-generation therapies to solve current and future really difficult health care challenges.  And talk a bit more about it. I'm going to highlight just a couple of things for the moment. The pandemic has underscored the support for the National Institutes of Health and investment in basic science, which are keys to ensuring that the U.S. maintain its leadership position in life science and maximizing national preparedness to address current and future health care challenges. There is a proposal right now to increase the fiscal year '22 NIH budget up to $51 billion, nearly a 20% boost over fiscal year '21. The FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, better known as CEDARS approved 23 new molecular entities in the first half of 2021, putting it on the pace to exceed 2020's near-record approval high of 53%. Following a historic year of 2020, venture capital in Life Science continues at a very strong pace of almost $36 billion already raised in the first half of 2021, on pace to eclipse 2020's all-time high of $46 billion. This unprecedented level is likely to continue throughout the year due to substantial dry powder available to life science funds and increased investment from institutional, generalists and traditional life science investors. 
Following a record 2020 for IPOs and follow-on offerings, the first half of this year have continued to reach new highs with over $8 billion raised in 52 IPOs and over $17 billion raised in many follow-ons, positioning 2021 for an all-time record year of public market investment in life science. R&D continues with amazing productivity and resilience through COVID, enabling the industry to expediently deliver novel vaccines and therapies to combat the global pandemic. New biology, drug discovery platforms and increasing focus on complex medicines as the future therapeutic innovation have all demonstrated the life science industry's ability to effectively drive solutions to current and future health care challenges and yield strong returns to investors. 
And maybe a final comment would be as Project Warp Speed did in bringing a historic public private partnership together of the government on the one hand and the private industry, biotech and pharma companies on the other hand, at a warp speed rate to bring research and development and commercialization of the COVID vaccines in record time as well as ensure a timely manufacturing supply. We really do need a 21st infrastructure package, not a 20th century package like the One Congress is now debating. We need to make the U.S. self-sufficient in semiconductors, we only produce now about 11% to 13% and self-sufficient and next-gen manufacturing of complex medicines. And so with that, let me turn it over to Joel."

As Joel highlighted last quarter and continues to be reaffirmed by the fundamental he just shared is the tremendous paradox of this pandemic moment for the life science industry. Despite the challenge",1442,"Thank you so much, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. As Joel highlighted last quarter and continues to be reaffirmed by the fundamental he just shared is the tremendous paradox of this pandemic moment for the life science industry. Despite the challenges of these past many months, COVID has illuminated the power of science and the industry's ability to transform the future of human health.  Not only as so many of our tenants in the industry, as Joel mentioned, risen to the challenge of combating global pandemics, but R&D and bioinnovation broadly have persisted with amazing productivity, resilience and experiences throughout this time. we cannot stress not how critical it is for us a halt to preserve and prioritize and continue to catalyze this groundbreaking innovation that has and will continue to save so many lives. So turning to COVID-specific update for a few moments. According to the World Health Organization, as of this morning, on a global scale, there has been over 194 million confirmed cases with COVID-19, including over 4.1 million deaths. A total of 3.7 billion vaccine doses have been administered worldwide with nearly 10% of these doses in the U.S. alone. Roughly 57.5% of the vaccine eligible population in our country, that's [indiscernible] over have been fully vaccinated by either tenant Pfizer or Moderna 2-shot mRNA-based vaccine or tenant Johnson & Johnson single-shot. This is just over 49% of the total U.S. population, and we hope this number of fully vaccinated individuals will continue to steadily rise. These numbers are astounding. And before we get into the where are we now, I want to emphasize that despite the COVID fatigue, we all continue to fuel even despite some relief from the easing of restrictions over the past few months, I'll be with the likely return of some new ones, none of where we are in the recovery process can be taken for granted. The fact that the biopharma industry spearheaded by many of our tenants was equipped with the know-how, resources and technology to create safe and effective vaccines to combat a novel viral pathogen would have been unimaginable just a few decades ago. The fact that our tenants Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson were able to develop, run robust clinical trials, manufacture and distribute billions of vaccines at scale in less than 12 months is absolutely unprecedented.  Few vaccines achieve such astounding safety and efficacy in the 90-plus percent range when the FDA has set the original bar at 50%, with an amazingly low incidence of side effects reported from the millions of people who have now received that is truly astounding. The fact that the biopharma industry, government and many other public and private agencies came together to ensure all of these that transpired at a pace and level sufficient to provide adequate vaccine supply to inoculate the entire U.S. population as we now have, unlike most nations around the world, is not to be undervalued. And the fact that we have a regulatory agency in the FDA that has worked around the clock to review thousands of COVID-19-related applications to maximize the availability of high-quality testing and safe and effective vaccines and therapies against COVID-19 cannot go unrecognized. 
So where are we now? It's been just over 18 months since the first U.S. COVID case was reported on January 21, 2020. Yet despite all of the progress with vaccines, et cetera, countries around the world are still very much combating new COVID-19 surges, driven most recently in part of the increasing prevalence of the so-called Delta variance. In the U.S., this highly continuous Delta variant, approximately 50% more transmissible with 1,000x higher viral load account for at least 83% of COVID cases. Average daily confirmed COVID case count now exceed 50,000, which is guide x that of the mid-June lows with hospitalization and deaths rising as well. And as such, it seems that as of this morning, requirements are likely to resume in various parts of the country. However, as worrying as this trend may seem breakthrough infections, those are infections that occur in vaccinated people are still relatively uncommon. And the vast majority of these breakthrough cases have not caused serious illness, hospitalization or death. More than 95% of people hospitalized for COVID-19 are unvaccinated, and the vaccine still remain effective even against the Delta variant. So while they may not entirely prevent transmission, they do seem almost entirely able to prevent severe disease and death. 
With regards to vaccine safety. There have been very few adverse events, less than 7 per million reported overall with nearly all cases resolving and without long-term side effects reported. As such, the strong safety and efficacy profile will likely garner full FDA approval for mRNA-based vaccines for Pfizer and Moderna the With regards to pregnancy and women of childbearing age, though data is more limited, based on the safety data generated state and how we know vaccines work in the body, the CDC does encourage pregnant to get vaccinated, especially given that pregnant and recently pregnant women are at increased risk for severe illness of COVID-19. With regards to children, Pfizer has an emergency use authorization for children over 12, and the FDA is urging Pfizer and Moderna to expand their studies in children ages 5 to 11. 
So what's next and where are we headed? The evolving data and the duration of immunity and COVID-19 variance of concern suggests that COV-19 and the need for vaccines and boosters will likely persist long term. However, the faster we can vaccinate the population in this country and increase access to vaccines in the rest of the world, the more effectively we can slow the emergence of new variants and the sooner we can turn the virus into a less deadly pathogen even if still contagious. And given that COVID will likely remain on the planet for the foreseeable future, therapies are going to continue to be important in mitigating the severity of COVID-19, such as recently authorized to our tenant  and GSK for their new antibody. Equally as important, is continued COVID testing, of course, for active virus and symptomatic individuals as well as surveillance testing across the population to detect new outbreaks, sequence emerging variants and track overall transmission. 
The last point I want to make is regarding the FDA, which has received somewhat on yielding flack over the past several months despite the herculean COVID efforts while maintaining a near all-time record high pace of new drug approvals, as Joel highlighted. This criticism is in mounting on account of several factors, including the lack of a fully appointed FDA commissioner, the growing backlog of review requirements for new investigational drug applications given the strong pace of innovation of our industry, the lack of fully approved vaccines despite their being authorized under the emergency use authorization pathway and most recently, the historic at highly controversial approval of Biogen to treat Alzheimer's disease. This was the first approval in nearly 2 decades for this chronic neurodegenetive disease affecting over 6 million people in the U.S. alone. 
I will save commentary on all of this for another time, but it needs to be said that without the FDA's steadfast and tireless work throughout COVID to maximize the review of the immense COVID-relating testing, therapeutic and vaccine applications will try to keep a pace with the record numbers of submissions from the industry, we as a nation would fall way behind. It is nothing short of astounding and worthy of the utmost recognition.  The FDA is critical for ensuring the safety of all drug products that are available in the U.S. while balancing efficacy and expediency. The future productivity and leadership of the agency, which will be announced by November of this year is of the utmost importance to all of us as the FDA is instrumental in ensuring the continued pace and vitality of biomedical innovation in our country. 
So in summary, thanks to the heroic work and collective investment of so many of our tenants in the industry, we have the tools and the road map at our disposal to end this pandemic. Biopharma is emerging from COVID as a dawn of historic new era for biotech and scientific innovation.  The world recognizes the value of this industry and the potential for next-generation medicines as evidenced by Moderna and Pfizer's next-generation vaccines to address current and future health care challenges. And clearly, the paradox of this pandemic moment has only reaffirmed why Alexandria has dedicated our business, our passion and our purpose to help drive this mission-critical industry forward. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve."

I'd like to take a step back at the start of my comments and provide some historical context for the accelerating demand which really translates into leasing at warp speed for Alexandria's mega campuses. At Alexandria's Annual Investor D",565,"Thank you, Jenna. I'd like to take a step back at the start of my comments and provide some historical context for the accelerating demand which really translates into leasing at warp speed for Alexandria's mega campuses. At Alexandria's Annual Investor Day during December 2017, we presented a bold framework to nearly double the company's annual rental revenues from a little more than $800 million to $1.5 billion by the end of 2022. We are pleased to share those annualized revenues for Q2 2021 are, in fact, in excess of $1.5 billion. And so the Alexandria team has accomplished this lofty goal in an accelerated time frame more than 1 year sooner than anticipated. The company has also grown from a mission-critical operating asset base and development pipeline of 29 million square feet at the end of 2017, to a total of 62 million square feet at the end of Q2 2021. Truly exceptional growth, more than doubling the footprint of the company, and importantly, concentrated in our core clusters with disciplined execution, enabling the continuation of high-quality cash flows. 
And as we fielded questions during the 2020 as to whether the healthy leasing activity for Alexandria's mega campus platform was perhaps a short-term blip driven by COVID-19, the second quarter of this year's leasing volume of more than 1.9 million square feet, the highest quarterly leasing volume in the history of the company is again evidence of the company's unique position as a trusted partner to the growing life science industry, providing a dual and sustainable competitive advantage in the market. 
I'll go ahead and review a few of the exceptional highlights, including the following: leasing outperformance. As we just stated, the 1.9 million square feet lease represents the highest quarterly leasing activity during the 27-year history of the company. Truly leasing at warp speed. 
I'll direct you to Page 2 of the supplemental, where it indicates the 3.4 million square feet under construction is 80% leased and the additional 3.6 million square feet anticipated to commence construction during 2021, 2022 is 89% leased and negotiating. So robust leasing and our growth pipeline provides exceptional clarity, and these projects in total will drive incremental revenues in excess of $545 million. We also have exceptional core results. Cash increases this quarter of 25.4% and GAAP increases of 42.4%. Occupancy remained very solid at 94.3% in the operating portfolio, which would have been 98.1% if we're not for the 1.4 million square feet of vacancy in recently acquired properties, which provide for near-term incremental annual rental revenues in excess of $55 million. In market health, demand, as we've outlined, continues to accelerate, and Alexandria is branded desirable mega campuses and supply does continue to be restrained during 2021 across all of our markets, and we do not see any disruptive large-scale projects delivering 2022, '23. We're closely evaluating Greater Boston's ground-up pipeline, which is 56% leased. And in the San Francisco area, we are monitoring leasing activity at 2 or 3 ground-up lab projects. 
And as we've stated before, there have been no significant lab sublease spaces put in the market for several quarters now. So in conclusion,  the first half of 2021 continues the very strong outperformance by Alexandria and our intent focus on operational excellence has positioned the company very well to enhance its industry-leading brand. With that, I'll hand it off to Peter."

I'm going to update you all on our development pipeline and construction cost trends, comment on our recent asset sales and report on a couple of comps that reflect that the private market appetite for life science assets is still very heal",1201,"Thanks, Steve. I'm going to update you all on our development pipeline and construction cost trends, comment on our recent asset sales and report on a couple of comps that reflect that the private market appetite for life science assets is still very healthy. As Steve and Joel both noted, we're experiencing historic demand and have responded by executing our differentiated life science strategy at an accelerated pace through expanding our collaborative campuses and asset base in each of our cluster markets. A significant sign of the health of the underlying life science industry is that we're expanding significantly in almost all of our markets. In many of our submarkets, the supply and demand imbalance has been exacerbated by a lack of near-term opportunities to expand, leading Alexandria to push the boundaries of those markets. Examples of this are successful forays into Watertown and Seaport in Greater Boston, new mega campuses in Serena Mesa, and expansion of San Diego Science sector to the north and east, and a highly successful mega campus underway in San Carlos. This high demand paired with our highly experienced development teams resulted in another very productive quarter for Alexandria. In the second quarter, we delivered 755,565 square feet, spread over 5 assets located in South San Francisco, San Carlos, Long Island City, San Diego and the Research Triangle. This is double what we delivered in the first quarter, and these deliveries will provide more than $31 million in annual rental revenue over the next year. In addition,  this historic demand has led to improved quarter-over-quarter leasing and leases under negotiation numbers despite adding 2 new assets that have had little marketing time. Assets contributing notably to this outcome include 840 Winter Street and Waltham Mass, which is a testament to our ability to capture demand from companies needing facilities for next-gen manufacturing. 3160 Porter Drive in Palo Alto, a joint effort with Stanford to commercialize the University's most innovative science. And 5505 Morehouse in Serono Mesa, which is benefiting from Alexander's place-making expertise and strong demand drivers in San Diego. 
As illustrated on Page 2 of the press release, this historic demand and our corresponding strategic response has led to our current pipeline growing to 3.4 million square feet in 33 properties that are, as Steve mentioned, 80% leased or under negotiation. In addition, we expect to have another 3.6 million square feet in 19 properties commenced construction this year, and next that are already 89% leased or under negotiation. As Steve also mentioned, these properties will cumulatively add approximately $545 million of annual rental revenue once fully delivered. I felt it necessary to remind everybody of that. 
Construction costs remain elevated from trade -- from some trades and commodities holding study and others continuing to be unexplainable and unprecedented levels. Lumber is a positive story and could be a microcosm for what will happen with other commodities. A year ago, lumber was $500 per thousand board feet, which was about $100 above its historical norm. It climbed to $1,700 per thousand board feet in early May, but has since dropped back down to $600 per thousand board feet, and is still dropping. The reason for the drop was a large number of residential projects were put on hold due to the price of lumber. With this pullback in demand, the mills have been able to catch up, leading to stabilization in pricing.  A correction due to a decrease in demand is essentially what's going to eventually normalize all construction commodities. Copper has shown signs of dropping, but it's still 2x above historical norms.  Alternatives such as aluminum are being considered to alleviate the pricing pressures. And if there's enough adoption, it could lead to a stabilization in pricing. Despite the promising news with lumber and copper, rolled steel remains very volatile and is not showing any signs of stabilizing. Rolled steel is used for things such as metal decks, metal studs and duct work. So it's very impactful on multilevel buildings with large HVAC needs such as lab buildings. So we have to keep our cost escalation assumptions on the high end despite the noted drop in some commodities. The reason being reported is both a commodity and labor issue at the shops that create the products from raw materials. COVID caused many to shut down. And then when demand exploded, the shops had a hard time getting the labor to come back. The shops try to solve this by scheduling longer shifts, but the amount of rolled steel showing up was not enough to support those shops. Thus, prices remain very high with metal studs up 75% since January. We want to assure you that we're keeping a very close eye on commodities and have been developing strategies to counter these increases. And together with our prudent underwriting, we will continue to deliver our projects on time and on budget as we always have. 
I'll conclude by commenting on our recent sales and provide a couple of comps that were announced recently. I discussed our record 4% cap rate at 213 East last quarter, but I want to add that in addition to achieving that cap rate, we also achieved an unlevered IRR of 9.6%. And a value creation margin, which is calculated by dividing our gain by gross book value of 56%.  This quarter, as disclosed on Page 3 of the press release, we once again demonstrated our ability to create tremendous value for our shareholders by selling a 70% interest in 400 Dexter, located in the Lake Union submarket of Seattle for a 4.2% cash cap rate with a gross value equaling $1,255 per square foot.  We achieved a 12% unlevered IRR on this sale and a value creation margin of 61%, a truly remarkable outcome, and it's very reflective of the high-quality assets we've developed and continue to develop in the Seattle region and elsewhere. 
Outside of those Alexandria transactions, there are a couple of transactions of note in our submarkets that reflect the high value that private investors are putting on life science assets today. In Sorrento Mesa, an asset known as The Canyons, which contains a little over 1/3 of lab and manufacturing space with the balance being office, sold at a 4.48% cap rate and a value of $575 per square foot. The cash flow is from a credit tenant and there is no near-term upside, so the cap rate really reflects the yield a private investor was willing to pay in a submarket that a couple of years ago would have commanded a cap rate with a 6 handle. In a similar vein,  the other comp we're reporting comes from Rockville, Maryland, which was received to be a 7 cap rate submarket by some analysts not too long ago. 9615 Medical Center Drive, located in the Shady Grove submarket and adjacent to a number of Alexandria properties was sold to a U.S. insurance company for a 5.18% cap rate and a valuation of $610 per square foot. The asset is a leasehold interest subject to a long-term ground lease that happens to be owned by Alexandria. Thank you. 
And with that, I'll pass it over to Dean."

Revenue and net operating income for the seco",1360,"Thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. We reported exceptional operating and financial results for the first half of '21 and provided a very strong outlook for the remainder of the year. Revenue and net operating income for the second quarter was up 16.6% and 16.8% over the second quarter of 2020, respectively. And NOI for the second quarter was up 6.9% over the first quarter of '21. 
Now venture investment gains included in FFO per share were [ $25 ] million for the second quarter and was consistent with the first quarter of '21. 
Now looking back over the last 2 quarters, we raised our outlook for FFO per share, $0.03 when we reported first quarter results. And during the second quarter, we raised our outlook for FFO per share again by another $0.02. Now this $0.02 increase was announced in connection with our Form 8-K filing date at June 14, when we were substantially through the second quarter and had solid visibility into the strength of core results for the quarter. Same-property NOI growth for the first half of '21 continue to benefit from our high-quality tenant roster with 53% of our annual rental revenue from investment-grade rated or large-cap publicly traded companies. Same-property NOI growth for the first half of '21 was very strong at 4.4% and [ 7.4% ] on a cash basis. High rental rate growth on lease renewals and re-leasing the space was the key driver for the improvement in our outlook for 2021 same-property net operating growth to 2% to 4% and 4.7% to 6.7%, an increase of 30 basis points and 40 basis points, respectively. 
Now while the primary focus of our acquisitions for 2021 has been driven by strong demand from our tenant relationships for both current and future development and redevelopment projects, certain acquisitions have also included operating properties with opportunities to drive growth and cash flows through lease-up of vacancy. Now these operating properties have contributed to NOI growth in the first half of '21. It's important to highlight that the lease-up of 1.4 million rental square feet of vacancy at these properties will provide further growth in annual rental revenue in excess of $55 million. Now occupancy that we reported for June 30 was 94.3% and 98.1% on a pro forma basis, excluding vacancy from recently acquired properties. And it's also important to highlight that if we set aside recently acquired properties, our occupancy is on track to improve by 100 basis points in 2021. Now we believe it's important to highlight the strategic benefits of having the team with tremendous experience and expertise with designing, building and operating sophisticated laboratory office buildings and the team with decades of trusted partnerships with our highly innovative tenants. As mentioned earlier, we have one of the highest credit tenant rosters in the REIT industry. We have one of the highest adjusted EBITDA margins in the REIT industry at 69%. We reported our lowest AR balance since 2012 at 6.7 million, truly amazing when you consider that our total market capitalization was over $26 billion as of June 30.  And we continue to consistently report high collections at 99.4% for July. We reported record leasing velocity at over 3.6 million rentable square feet executed in the first half of this year. And this run rate is significantly exceeding the strong leasing volume for 2020 and on track for exceptional rental rate growth in the range of 31% to 34% and 18% to 21% on lease renewals and re-leasing the space the last figures on a cash basis, by the way. 
Now as a trusted partner with access to over 750 tenants in our portfolio, we are well positioned to capture the tremendous demand from our tenant roster and life science industry relationships. We have a super exciting pipeline of projects under construction, aggregating 3.4 million rentable square feet, 80% lease negotiating. Near-term projects starts 89% leased were under negotiations, aggregating 3.7 million square feet. Now this aggregates about 6.9 million square feet, 90% of which is related to space requirements from our existing relationships. These projects will generate an amazing amount of incremental annual rental revenue exceeding $545 million or a 34% increase above the second quarter rental revenues annualized of $1.6 billion. Now importantly, we also expect to start additional projects between now and December of 2022. Our venture investments portfolio continue to highlight the exceptional talent of our science and technology team for underwriting high-quality innovative entities. As of June 30, unrealized gains were $962 million on an adjusted cost basis of $990 million. Realized gains on our venture investments for the second quarter were $60.2 million, including $34.8 million of realized gains excluded from FFO per share. Now for the first half of '21, we realized gains aggregate in about $57.7 million that related to significant gains in 3 investments that were excluded from FFO per share as adjusted. Now we're pleased that the venture investment program is generating capital exceeding our initial forecast for 2021, and we hope this will be in the range of about $100-plus million for the entire year. 
Now continuing on to our very strong and flexible balance sheet to support our strategic growth initiatives. We continue to be very pleased to have one of the best balance sheets in the REIT industry, providing us access to attractive long-term cost of capital. We remain on track for net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 5.2x by year-end. Our fixed charge coverage ratio for the fourth quarter has increased to greater than 5x. We continue to maintain significant liquidity of $4.5 billion as of June 30. We're in a solid position with debt maturities with our next maturity representing only $184 million comes due in 2024. And while it's challenging to predict when owners of real estate will decide to sell,  2 to 3 transactions drove most of the amount of acquisitions and accounted for about half of our target for 2021. For the remainder of the year, our goal is to remain very selective with acquisitions. 
Our team is advancing a number of important dispositions primarily focused on partial interest sales in high-value, low cap rate properties for reinvestment into our strategic value creation development and redevelopment projects. Now to date, in 2021, we have completed $580 million at cap rates in the 4% to 4.2% range. And we have about $1.4 billion in process at various stages and expect to move along other dispositions that will push us well above the top end of our range for dispositions, which are currently at $2.2 billion. Now we are targeting about $1 billion in dispositions to close in the third quarter and the remainder in the fourth quarter. Importantly, each of these key pending transactions will continue to highlight the tremendous value we have and continue to create for our stakeholders. 
Now as a reminder, please refer to Page 6 of our supplemental package for a detailed and updated guidance assumptions for 2021. This guidance is an update to our guidance for the year that was disclosed on our Form 8-K dated June 14. We narrowed the range of guidance from $0.10 to $0.08 for both EPS and FFO per share. EPS was updated to a range from $3.46 to $3.54 and FFO per share as adjusted was updated to a range from $7.71 to $7.79 with no change in the midpoint of FFO per share diluted as adjusted of $7.75. Now as a reminder, since our initial FFO per share guidance for 2021, we have increased the midpoint of our guidance by $0.05 for growth in 2021, representing an increase of 6.1% over 2020. 
Now before I turn it back over to Joel Marcus, I just wanted to highlight that we recently published our annual ESG report, highlighting continued leadership in sustainability, social and governance matters. I also wanted to express our team's appreciation for continued recognition by an independent panel of judges for a 6 NAREIT Gold Award for Communication and Reporting Excellence to the investment community. So congratulations to our team for outstanding execution, and I'll turn it back to Joel."

So I think we're being just a bit of a slower pace, but I wouldn't say the selectivity or the change in the underwriting or how we do things or what we do is any way shape or form changed."

We're probably peaking. And it's just hard to know where the market might go. So we're just going to be careful about stepwise about how we do things. We also have no anticipation of when -- I think Dean said this pretty clearly, we don't know when an owner is going to bring an asset to market. And so that oftentimes drives decisions as to the 750 tenants, many of whom have active current requirements and many of whom want a path to future growth. So we just have to be -- maybe the best word to use is judicious rather than selective.  And that's not necessarily parsing words. So I think we're just going to be judicious about how we go forward. There's only so many big acquisitions one can continue to do, and that actually exists. So I think the market will determine that."

But I think if you look in each of the key markets, you look in the Bay Area, you look at the Greater Boston area, the supply chart really is focused out several years. It's not focused on '21, '22 or even '23. You start to see bigger blips, for example, Kilroy's capability to do large-scale projects in the Oyster Point area in South San Francisco.  Pretty large numbers, but those are out quite a number of years. They're also at a disadvantage because they have a substandard location to kind of the gateway location.

And those will extend into 2022 and 2023. So when you look at that, you really don't see very significant pieces being added to the overall inventory from that basis. Other people may be talking about supply. But again, 4 or 5 years out, inevitably, the markets will change. Office will always be an alternative for all of these new entrants as well. And then in the Bay Area, as Joel said, there's 2 or 3 projects we're monitoring. There is leasing activity there. So there is additional supply, but we don't see large, disruptive, very large projects that are well under construction that have no leasing activity.

It's really been going into its seventh year, which is pretty historic. I think which gives us good comfort is on the private side, a number of the venture firms -- quite a number of the venture firms have raised record amounts of money, and those funds usually take multiple years to invest 2, 3, sometimes 4. And so that's going to give a runway to private companies, let's say there was a black swan event or something forbid happens that just causes the market to sell off pretty drastically. I think we're very fortunate. As Dean said, we have a historically high credit profile in our asset base. So that's good. I think the companies that would be most at risk would be newly public companies now that are outside of the private venture or private equity financing. They're public now. And if the markets shut down, they have capital, they'll have to adjust their burn rate and be careful because they won't be able to go back to the capital market. So I think that -- we saw that in '08 and '09. It was the newly public companies, companies that were preclinical particularly or in the clinic and needed a number of years of runway. So that would be a downside scenario. But as I said, I think for -- at least for the coming couple of coming quarters, we see a pretty steady flow of capital. We don't see any interruption. But you never know if China decides to make Taiwan like Hong Kong or something like that, and decide to reunify that could cause the markets to certainly freeze up. I mean they're already attacking a lot of the tech companies and so forth. So I think China remains a huge question as to the impact on the market and what their intention is."

And the other party thought we'd sell anything that they wanted. There'd be a lot of them. So we have been the ones that have selected what to sell. And obviously, we've done quite well. The typical profile is something that we have already really maxed the value out on at least in the near to medium to long term. So it's a good time to monetize. But it's fair to say that our whole portfolio is very attractive to many investors today given the shine on the life science industry."

I'm not getting -- not to give away too much secret sauce, but I -- last quarter I mentioned when I addressed the cost that we look at escalations in the 5% to 6% range right now. And that may not seem like a lot, but labor is fairly stable. So these large commodity increases and with materials being about 30% of the project, you can get to a weighted average of about 5% to 6%. Now that's -- that could be double what a normal year of escalations could be. In certain times, things obviously fluctuate. But we, along with our real estate development team, the underwriting team, communicates constantly about these things, so we make sure we get them right. And the proof is in the pudding. The yields that we publish, we hit like pretty much 100%. So other than that, we don't underwrite spikes in rents. I've talked about that before. We have a very good idea of what long-term growth looks like. We're probably more conservative than what actuals end up being, but that's great. Surprise the upside is always good. But yes, we're very comfortable with our current pipeline and the way we've underwritten it. And I think -- I've been here for 23 years, been an underwriter for all that time and feel very comfortable with our process and that we'll continue to meet the numbers that we're publishing."

With me here today are Jenna Foger, Peter Moglia, Steve Richardson, and Dean Shigenaga.
I want to welcome all to this second quarter call. And also, as I always try to do to recognize and thank the entire Alexandria family team for one of the best quarters in the entire history of the company with an operational tempo, really like none other, while working virtually for most -- many of us for most of the past now into our second year of COVID. As Michael Jordan once said, some people want it to happen, some people wish it to happen, others make it happen. Alexandria makes it happen. We're deeply mission-driven and thankful for all that we do and urge you to read about many of our important programs and activities in the corporate social responsibility area in our press release and so.
For a moment, keys to the second quarter, historic high demand for Alexandria's lab space and our critical lab operations, which go along with that. Alexandria is at the vanguard of meeting the historic and high unprecedented demand from many of our more than 750 tenants for growth needs now and a critical path for future growth very importantly.
Fundamental drivers of demand are the strongest we've ever seen. Rental rate growth continues unabated and no excess supply on the horizon at this time. We're very proud that we've got almost 7% quarter-to-quarter per share FFO growth, more than 40% rental rate growth, almost 18% NOI growth, almost 8% same-store NOI growth and a $1.3-plus billion annual NOI run rate, not to mention about $545 million in incremental revenue in our development and redevelopment pipeline. Alexandria truly has a demonstrable pricing power advantage in each of our cluster markets. And when life science tenants choose, they almost always prefer Alexandria's lab space and our operational excellence based on our critical lab operations.
Nature Biotechnology, a magazine back in April wrote the following: 2020 was a year that smashed many records. Biotech saved your role and the pandemic attracted a stampede of private and public investors alike. The pandemic apparently reinforced the requirement for long-term value-based investors of any kind to have exposure to life sciences. And life science demand has in fact hit an all-time high as the world has recognized the importance of next-generation therapies to solve current and future really difficult health care challenges. And Jenna will talk a bit more about it. I'm going to highlight just a couple of things for the moment. The pandemic has underscored the support for the National Institutes of Health and investment in basic science, which are keys to ensuring that the U.S. maintain its leadership position in life science and maximizing national preparedness to address current and future health care challenges. 
There is a proposal right now to increase the fiscal year '22 NIH budget up to $51 billion, nearly a 20% boost over fiscal year '21. The FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, better known as CDERS approved 23 new molecular entities in the first half of 2021, putting it on the pace to exceed 2020's near-record approval high of 53. Following a historic year of 2020, venture capital in Life Science continues at a very strong pace of almost $36 billion already raised in the first half of 2021, on pace to eclipse 2020's all-time high of $46 billion. This unprecedented level is likely to continue throughout the year due to substantial dry powder available to life science funds and increased investment from institutional, generalists and traditional life science investors.
Following a record 2020 for IPOs and follow-on offerings, the first half of this year have continued to reach new highs, with over $8 billion raised in 52 IPOs and over $17 billion raised in many follow-ons, positioning 2021 for an all-time record year of public market investment in life science. R&D continues with amazing productivity and resilience through COVID, enabling the industry to expediently deliver novel vaccines and therapies to combat the global pandemic. New biology, drug discovery platforms and increasing focus on complex medicines as the future therapeutic innovation have all demonstrated the life science industry's ability to effectively drive solutions to current and future health care challenges and yield strong returns to investors.
And maybe a final comment would be as Project Warp Speed did in bringing a historic public private partnership together of the government on the one hand and the private industry, biotech and pharma companies on the other hand, at a warp speed rate to bring research and development and commercialization of the COVID vaccines in record time as well as ensure a timely manufacturing supply. We really do need a 21st infrastructure package, not a 20th century package like the one Congress is now debating. We need to make the U.S. self-sufficient in semiconductors. We only produce now about 11% to 13% and self-sufficient in next-gen manufacturing of complex medicines. And so with that, let me turn it over to Jenna."
365138,716287616,2352055,"Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.","Executives","Thank you so much, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. As Joel highlighted last quarter and continues to be reaffirmed by the fundamental he just shared is the tremendous paradox of this pandemic moment for the life science industry. Despite the challenge",1449,"Thank you so much, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. As Joel highlighted last quarter and continues to be reaffirmed by the fundamental he just shared is the tremendous paradox of this pandemic moment for the life science industry. Despite the challenges of these past many months, COVID has illuminated the power of science and the industry's ability to transform the future of human health. Not only are so many of our tenants in the industry, as Joel mentioned, risen to the challenge of combating global pandemics, but R&D and bioinnovation broadly have persisted with amazing productivity, resilience and experiences throughout this time. And we cannot stress not how critical it is for us a halt to preserve and prioritize and continue to catalyze this groundbreaking innovation that has and will continue to save so many lives. 
So turning to COVID-specific update for a few moments. According to the World Health Organization, as of this morning, on a global scale, there has been over 194 million confirmed cases with COVID-19, including over 4.1 million deaths. A total of 3.7 billion vaccine doses have been administered worldwide with nearly 10% of these doses in the U.S. alone. Roughly 57.5% of the vaccine-eligible population in our country, that's 12 and over have been fully vaccinated by either tenant Pfizer or Moderna's 2-shot mRNA-based vaccine or tenant Johnson & Johnson's single shot. This is just over 49% of the total U.S. population, and we hope this number of fully vaccinated individuals will continue to steadily rise. These numbers are astounding. 
And before we get into the where are we now, I want to emphasize that despite the COVID fatigue, we all continue to fuel even despite some relief from the easing of restrictions over the past few months, albeit with the likely return of some new ones, none of where we are in the recovery process can be taken for granted. The fact that the biopharma industry spearheaded by many of our tenants was equipped with the know-how, resources and technology to create safe and effective vaccines to combat a novel viral pathogen would have been unimaginable just a few decades ago. The fact that our tenants Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson were able to develop, run robust clinical trials, manufacture and distribute billions of vaccines at scale in less than 12 months is absolutely unprecedented. These vaccines achieved such astounding safety and efficacy in the 90-plus percent range when the FDA has set the original bar at 50%, with an amazingly low incidence of side effects reported from the millions of people who have now received that is truly astounding. 
The fact that the biopharma industry, government and many other public and private agencies came together to ensure all of the above transpired at a pace and level sufficient to provide adequate vaccine supply to inoculate the entire U.S. population as we now have, unlike most nations around the world, is not to be undervalued. 
And the fact that we have a regulatory agency in the FDA that has worked around the clock to review thousands of COVID-19-related applications to maximize the availability of high-quality testing and safe and effective vaccines and therapies against COVID-19 cannot go unrecognized.
So where are we now? It's been just over 18 months since the first U.S. COVID case was reported on January 21, 2020. Yet despite all of the progress with vaccines, et cetera, countries around the world are still very much combating new COVID-19 surges, driven most recently in part to the increasing prevalence of the so-called Delta variant. In the U.S., this highly continuous Delta variant, approximately 50% more transmissible with 1,000x higher viral load account for at least 83% of COVID cases. Average daily confirmed COVID case count now exceed 50,000, which is guide x that of the mid-June lows with hospitalization and deaths rising as well. And as such, it seems that as of this morning, indoor mats requirements are likely to resume in various parts of the country. 
However, as worrying is this trend may seem breakthrough infections, those are infections that occur in vaccinated people are still relatively uncommon. And the vast majority of these breakthrough cases have not caused serious illness, hospitalization or death. More than 95% of people hospitalized for COVID-19 are unvaccinated, and the vaccine still remain effective even against the Delta variant. So while they may not entirely prevent transmission, they do seem almost entirely able to prevent severe disease and death.
With regards to vaccine safety. There have been very few adverse events, less than 7 per million reported overall with nearly all cases resolving and without long-term side effects reported. As such, the strong safety and efficacy profile will likely garner full FDA approval for mRNA-based vaccines for Pfizer and Moderna this fall. With regards to pregnancy and women of childbearing age, though data is more limited, based on the safety data generated to date and how we know vaccines work in the body, the CDC does encourage pregnant women to get vaccinated, especially given that pregnant and recently pregnant women are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. With regards to children, Pfizer has an emergency use authorization for children over 12, and the FDA is urging Pfizer and Moderna to expand their studies in children aged 5 to 11.
So what's next and where are we headed? The evolving data and the duration of immunity and COVID-19 variants of concern suggests that COVID-19 and the need for vaccines and boosters will likely persist long term. However, the faster we can vaccinate the population in this country and increase access to vaccines in the rest of the world, the more effectively we can slow the emergence of new variants and the sooner we can turn this virus into a less deadly pathogen even if still contagious. And given that COVID will likely remain on the planet for the foreseeable future, therapies are going to continue to be important in mitigating the severity of COVID-19, such as recently authorized to our tenant Bayer and GSK for their new antibody. Equally as important, is continued COVID testing, of course, for active virus in symptomatic individuals as well as surveillance testing across the population to detect new outbreaks, sequence emerging variants and track overall transmission.
The last point I want to make is regarding the FDA, which has received somewhat unyielding flack over the past several months despite the herculean COVID efforts while maintaining a near all-time record high pace of new drug approvals, as Joel highlighted. This criticism has been mounting on account of several factors, including the lack of a fully appointed FDA commissioner, the growing backlog of review requirements for new investigational drug applications given the strong pace of innovation of our industry, the lack of fully approved vaccines despite their being authorized under the emergency use authorization pathway and most recently, the historic and highly controversial approval of Biogen's Aduhelm to treat Alzheimer's disease. This was the first approval in nearly 2 decades for this chronic neurodegenetive disease affecting over 6 million people in the U.S. alone.
I will save commentary on all of this for another time, but it needs to be said that without the FDA's steadfast and tireless work throughout COVID to maximize the review of the immense COVID-relating testing, therapeutic and vaccine applications will try to keep up pace with the record numbers of submissions from the industry, we as a nation would fall way behind. It is nothing short of astounding and worthy of the utmost recognition. The FDA is critical for ensuring the safety of all drug products that are available in the U.S. while balancing efficacy and expediency. The future productivity and leadership of the agency, which will be announced by November of this year is of the utmost importance to all of us. As the FDA is instrumental in ensuring the continued pace and vitality of biomedical innovation in our country.  
So in summary, thanks to the heroic work and collective investment of so many of our tenants in the industry, we have the tools and the road map at our disposal to end this pandemic. Biopharma is emerging from COVID as a dawn of historic new era for biotech and scientific innovation. The world recognizes the value of this industry and the potential for next-generation medicines as evidenced by Moderna and Pfizer's next-generation vaccines to address current and future health care challenges. And clearly, the paradox of this pandemic moment has only reaffirmed why Alexandria has dedicated our business, our passion and our purpose to help drive this mission-critical industry forward.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve."

At Alexandria's Annual Investor D",566,"Thank you, Jenna. I'd like to take a step back at the start of my comments and provide some historical context for the accelerating demand which really translates into leasing at warp speed for Alexandria's mega campuses. At Alexandria's Annual Investor Day during December 2017, we presented a bold framework to nearly double the company's annual rental revenues from a little more than $800 million to $1.5 billion by the end of 2022. We are pleased to share those annualized revenues for Q2 2021 are, in fact, in excess of $1.5 billion. And so the Alexandria team has accomplished this lofty goal in an accelerated time frame more than 1 year sooner than anticipated. The company has also grown from a mission-critical operating asset base and development pipeline of 29 million square feet at the end of 2017, to a total of 62 million square feet at the end of Q2 2021. Truly exceptional growth, more than doubling the footprint of the company, and importantly, concentrated in our core clusters with disciplined execution, enabling the continuation of high-quality cash flows.
And as we fielded questions during the 2020 as to whether the healthy leasing activity for Alexandria's mega campus platform was perhaps a short-term blip driven by COVID-19, the second quarter of this year's leasing volume of more than 1.9 million square feet, the highest quarterly leasing volume in the history of the company is again evidence of the company's unique position as a trusted partner to the growing life science industry, providing a durable and sustainable competitive advantage in the market.
I'll go ahead and review a few of the exceptional highlights, including the following: leasing outperformance. As we just stated, the 1.9 million square feet lease represents the highest quarterly leasing activity during the 27-year history of the company. Truly leasing at warp speed.
I'll direct you to Page 2 of the supplemental, where it indicates the 3.4 million square feet under construction is 80% leased and the additional 3.6 million square feet anticipated to commence construction during 2021, 2022 is 89% leased and negotiating. So robust leasing and our growth pipeline provides exceptional clarity, and these projects in total will drive incremental revenues in excess of $545 million. We also have exceptional core results. Cash increases this quarter of 25.4% and GAAP increases of 42.4%. 
Occupancy remained very solid at 94.3% and the operating portfolio, which would have been 98.1% if were not for the 1.4 million square feet of vacancy in recently acquired properties, which provide for near-term incremental annual rental revenues in excess of $55 million. In market health, demand, as we've outlined, continues to accelerate, and Alexandria's branded and highly desirable mega campuses and supply does continue to be restrained during 2021 across all of our markets, and we do not see any disruptive large-scale projects delivering 2022, '23. We're closely evaluating Greater Boston's ground-up pipeline, which is 56% leased. And in the San Francisco area, we are monitoring leasing activity at 2 or 3 ground-up lab projects.
And as we've stated before, there have been no significant lab sublease spaces put in the market for several quarters now. So in conclusion, the first half of 2021 continues the very strong outperformance by Alexandria and our intent focus on operational excellence has positioned the company very well to enhance its industry-leading brand. With that, I'll hand it off to Peter."
365138,716287616,2352055,"Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. I'm going to update you all on our development pipeline and construction cost trends, comment on our recent asset sales and report on a couple of comps that reflect that the private market appetite for life science assets is still very heal",1200,"Thanks, Steve. I'm going to update you all on our development pipeline and construction cost trends, comment on our recent asset sales and report on a couple of comps that reflect that the private market appetite for life science assets is still very healthy. As Steve and Joel both noted, we're experiencing historic demand and have responded by executing our differentiated life science strategy at an accelerated pace through expanding our collaborative campuses and asset base in each of our cluster markets. 
A significant sign of the health of the underlying life science industry is that we're expanding significantly in almost all of our markets. In many of our submarkets, the supply and demand imbalance has been exacerbated by a lack of near-term opportunities to expand, leading Alexandria to push the boundaries of those markets. Examples of this are successful forays into Watertown and Seaport in Greater Boston, new mega campuses in Sorrento Mesa, and expansion of San Diego Science sector to the north and east, and a highly successful mega campus underway in San Carlos. This high demand paired with our highly experienced development teams resulted in another very productive quarter for Alexandria. 
In the second quarter, we delivered 755,565 square feet, spread over 5 assets located in South San Francisco, San Carlos, Long Island City, San Diego and the Research Triangle. This is double what we delivered in the first quarter, and these deliveries will provide more than $31 million in annual rental revenue over the next year. In addition, this historic demand has led to improved quarter-over-quarter leasing and leases under negotiation numbers despite adding 2 new assets that have had little marketing time. Assets contributing notably to this outcome include 840 Winter Street and Waltham Mass, which is a testament to our ability to capture demand from companies needing facilities for next-gen manufacturing. 3160 Porter Drive in Palo Alto, a joint effort with Stanford to commercialize the University's most innovative science. And 5505 Morehouse in Sorrento Mesa, which is benefiting from Alexandria's place-making expertise and strong demand drivers in San Diego.
As illustrated on Page 2 of the press release, this historic demand and our corresponding strategic response has led to our current pipeline growing to 3.4 million square feet in 33 properties that are, as Steve mentioned, 80% leased or under negotiation. In addition, we expect to have another 3.6 million square feet in 19 properties commenced construction this year, and next that are already 89% leased or under negotiation. As Steve also mentioned, these properties will cumulatively add approximately $545 million of annual rental revenue once fully delivered. I felt it necessary to remind everybody of that.
Construction costs remain elevated from trade -- from some trades and commodities holding study and others continuing to be unexplainable and unprecedented levels. Lumber is a positive story and could be a microcosm for what will happen with other commodities. A year ago, lumber was $500 per thousand board feet, which was about $100 above its historical norm. It climbed to $1,700 per thousand board feet in early May, but has since dropped back down to $600 per thousand board feet, and is still dropping. The reason for the drop was a large number of residential projects were put on hold due to the price of lumber. With this pullback in demand, the mills have been able to catch up, leading to stabilization in pricing. A correction due to a decrease in demand is essentially what's going to eventually normalize all construction commodities. Copper has shown signs of dropping, but it's still 2x above historical norms.  Alternatives such as aluminum are being considered to alleviate the pricing pressures. 
And if there's enough adoption, it could lead to a stabilization in pricing. Despite the promising news with lumber and copper, rolled steel remains very volatile and is not showing any signs of stabilizing. Rolled steel is used for things such as metal decks, metal studs and ductwork. So it's very impactful on multilevel buildings with large HVAC needs such as lab buildings. So we have to keep our cost escalation assumptions on the high end despite the noted drop in some commodities. The reason being reported is both a commodity and labor issue at the shops that create the products from raw materials. COVID caused many to shut down. And then when demand exploded, the shops had a hard time getting the labor to come back. The shops try to solve this by scheduling longer shifts, but the amount of rolled steel showing up was not enough to support those shops. Thus, prices remained very high with metal studs up 75% since January. 
We want to assure you that we're keeping a very close eye on commodities and have been developing strategies to counter these increases. And together with our prudent underwriting, we will continue to deliver our projects on time and on budget as we always have.
I'll conclude by commenting on our recent sales and provide a couple of comps that were announced recently. I discussed our record 4% cap rate at 213 East last quarter, but I want to add that in addition to achieving that cap rate, we also achieved an unlevered IRR of 9.6%. And a value creation margin, which is calculated by dividing our gain by gross book value of 56%. This quarter, as disclosed on Page 3 of the press release, we once again demonstrated our ability to create tremendous value for our shareholders by selling a 70% interest in 400 Dexter, located in the Lake Union submarket of Seattle for a 4.2% cash cap rate with a gross value equaling $1,255 per square foot. We achieved a 12% unlevered IRR on this sale and a value creation margin of 61%, a truly remarkable outcome, and it's very reflective of the high-quality assets we've developed and continue to develop in the Seattle region and elsewhere.
Outside of those Alexandria transactions, there are a couple of transactions of note in our submarkets that reflect the high value that private investors are putting on life science assets today. In Sorrento Mesa, an asset known as The Canyons, which contains a little over 1/3 of lab and manufacturing space with the balance being office, sold at a 4.48% cap rate and a value of $575 per square foot. The cash flow is from a credit tenant and there is no near-term upside, so the cap rate really reflects the yield a private investor was willing to pay in a submarket that a couple of years ago would have commanded a cap rate with a 6 handle. 
In a similar vein,  the other comp we're reporting comes from Rockville, Maryland, which was received to be a 7 cap rate submarket by some analysts not too long ago. 9615 Medical Center Drive, located in the Shady Grove submarket and adjacent to a number of Alexandria properties was sold to a U.S. insurance company for a 5.18% cap rate and a valuation of $610 per square foot. The asset is a leasehold interest subject to a long-term ground lease that happens to be owned by Alexandria. Thank you.
And with that, I'll pass it over to Dean."

Revenue and net operating income for the seco",1355,"Thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. We reported exceptional operating and financial results for the first half of '21 and provided a very strong outlook for the remainder of the year. Revenue and net operating income for the second quarter was up 16.6% and 16.8% over the second quarter of 2020, respectively. And NOI for the second quarter was up 6.9% over the first quarter of '21.  
Now venture investment gains included in FFO per share were $25.5 million for the second quarter and was consistent with the first quarter of '21.  
Now looking back over the last 2 quarters, we raised our outlook for FFO per share, $0.03 when we reported first quarter results. And during the second quarter, we raised our outlook for FFO per share again by another $0.02. Now this $0.02 increase was announced in connection with our Form 8-K filing date at June 14, when we were substantially through the second quarter and had solid visibility into the strength of core results for the quarter. Same-property NOI growth for the first half of '21 continue to benefit from our high-quality tenant roster, with 53% of our annual rental revenue from investment-grade rated or large-cap publicly traded companies. Same-property NOI growth for the first half of '21 was very strong at 4.4% and 7.4% on a cash basis. High rental rate growth on lease renewals and re-leasing the space was the key driver for the improvement in our outlook for 2021 same-property net operating growth to 2% to 4% and 4.7% to 6.7%, an increase of 30 basis points and 40 basis points, respectively.
Now while the primary focus of our acquisitions for 2021 has been driven by strong demand from our tenant relationships for both current and future development and redevelopment projects, certain acquisitions have also included operating properties with opportunities to drive growth and cash flows through lease-up of vacancy. Now these operating properties have contributed to NOI growth in the first half of '21. It's important to highlight that the lease-up of 1.4 million rental square feet of vacancy at these properties will provide further growth in annual rental revenue in excess of $55 million. Now occupancy that we reported for June 30 was 94.3% and 98.1% on a pro forma basis, excluding vacancy from recently acquired properties. And it's also important to highlight that if we set aside recently acquired properties, our occupancy is on track to improve by 100 basis points in 2021. 
Now we believe it's important to highlight the strategic benefits of having the team with tremendous experience and expertise with designing, building and operating sophisticated laboratory office buildings and the team with decades of trusted partnerships with our highly innovative tenants. As mentioned earlier, we have one of the highest credit tenant rosters in the REIT industry. We have one of the highest adjusted EBITDA margins in the REIT industry at 69%. We reported our lowest AR balance since 2012 at $6.7 million, truly amazing when you consider that our total market capitalization was over $26 billion as of June 30.  And we continue to consistently report high collections at 99.4% for July. We reported record leasing velocity at over 3.6 million rentable square feet executed in the first half of this year. And this run rate is significantly exceeding the strong leasing volume for 2020 and on track for exceptional rental rate growth in the range of 31% to 34% and 18% to 21% on lease renewals and re-leasing the space the last figures on a cash basis, by the way.
Now as a trusted partner with access to over 750 tenants in our portfolio, we are well positioned to capture the tremendous demand from our tenant roster and life science industry relationships. We have a super exciting pipeline of projects under construction, aggregating 3.4 million rentable square feet, 80% lease negotiating. Near-term projects starts 89% leased were under negotiations, aggregating 3.7 million square feet. Now this aggregates about 6.9 million square feet, 90% of which is related to space requirements from our existing relationships. These projects will generate an amazing amount of incremental annual rental revenue exceeding $545 million or a 34% increase above the second quarter rental revenues annualized of $1.6 billion. 
Now importantly, we also expect to start additional projects between now and December of 2022. Our venture investments portfolio continue to highlight the exceptional talent of our science and technology team for underwriting high-quality innovative entities. As of June 30, unrealized gains were $962 million on an adjusted cost basis of $990 million. Realized gains on our venture investments for the second quarter were $60.2 million, including $34.8 million of realized gains excluded from FFO per share. Now for the first half of '21, we realized gains aggregating about $57.7 million that related to significant gains in 3 investments that were excluded from FFO per share as adjusted. Now we're pleased that the venture investment program is generating capital exceeding our initial forecast for 2021, and we hope this will be in the range of about $100-plus million for the entire year.
Now continuing on to our very strong and flexible balance sheet to support our strategic growth initiatives. We continue to be very pleased to have one of the best balance sheets in the REIT industry, providing us access to attractive long-term cost of capital. We remain on track for net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 5.2x by year-end. Our fixed charge coverage ratio for the fourth quarter has increased to greater than 5x. We continue to maintain significant liquidity of $4.5 billion as of June 30. We're in a solid position with debt maturities with our next maturity representing only $184 million comes due in 2024. And while it's challenging to predict when owners of real estate will decide to sell, 2 to 3 transactions drove most of the amount of acquisitions and accounted for about half of our target for 2021. For the remainder of the year, our goal is to remain very selective with acquisitions.
Our team is advancing a number of important dispositions primarily focused on partial interest sales in high-value, low cap rate properties for reinvestment into our strategic value creation development and redevelopment projects. Now to date, in 2021, we have completed $580 million at cap rates in the 4% to 4.2% range. And we have about $1.4 billion in process at various stages and expect to move along other dispositions that will push us well above the top end of our range for dispositions, which are currently at $2.2 billion. Now we are targeting about $1 billion in dispositions to close in the third quarter and the remainder in the fourth quarter. Importantly, each of these key pending transactions will continue to highlight the tremendous value we have and continue to create for our stakeholders.  
Now as a reminder, please refer to Page 6 of our supplemental package for a detailed and updated guidance assumptions for 2021. This guidance is an update to our guidance for the year that was disclosed on our Form 8-K dated June 14. We narrowed the range of guidance from $0.10 to $0.08 for both EPS and FFO per share. EPS was updated to a range from $3.46 to $3.54 and FFO per share as adjusted was updated to a range from $7.71 to $7.79 with no change in the midpoint of FFO per share diluted as adjusted of $7.75. Now as a reminder, since our initial FFO per share guidance for 2021, we have increased the midpoint of our guidance by $0.05 for growth in 2021, representing an increase of 6.1% over 2020.
Now before I turn it back over to Joel Marcus, I just wanted to highlight that we recently published our annual ESG report, highlighting continued leadership in sustainability, social and governance matters. I also wanted to express our team's appreciation for continued recognition by an independent panel of judges for a 6 NAREIT Gold Award for Communication and Reporting Excellence to the investment community. So congratulations to our team for outstanding execution, and I'll turn it back to Joel."

Pretty large numbers, but those are out quite a number of years. They're also at a disadvantage because they have a substandard location to kind of the gateway location. But Steve, do you want to comment on kind of on the supply overall issue? I think you have a good perspective on that."

And just to add to what Joel said, when you look at Greater Boston in that pipeline, projects that actually have gone vertical that are under construction, more than half of that is already leased. And those will extend into 2022 and 2023. So when you look at that, you really don't see very significant pieces being added to the overall inventory from that basis. Other people may be talking about supply. But again, 4 or 5 years out, inevitably, the markets will change. 
Office will always be an alternative for all of these new entrants as well. And then in the Bay Area, as Joel said, there's 2 or 3 projects we're monitoring. There is leasing activity there. So there is additional supply, but we don't see large, disruptive, very large projects that are well under construction that have no leasing activity. So again, we do monitor it on a very granular basis, and that's what we're seeing over the next year or 2 or even 2.5 years."

It's really been going into its seventh year, which is pretty historic. I think which gives us good comfort is on the private side, a number of the venture firms -- quite a number of the venture firms have raised record amounts of money, and those funds usually take multiple years to invest 2, 3, sometimes 4. And so that's going to give a runway to private companies, let's say there was a black swan event or something God forbid happens that just causes the market to sell off pretty drastically. I think we're very fortunate. As Dean said, we have a historically high credit profile in our asset base. So that's good. 
I think the companies that would be most at risk would be newly public companies now that are outside of the private venture or private equity financing. They're public now. And if the markets shut down, they have capital, they'll have to adjust their burn rate and be careful because they won't be able to go back to the capital market. So I think that -- we saw that in '08 and '09. It was the newly public companies, companies that were preclinical particularly or in the clinic and needed a number of years of runway. So that would be a downside scenario. But as I said, I think for -- at least for the coming couple of coming quarters, we see a pretty steady flow of capital. We don't see any interruption. But you never know if China decides to make Taiwan like Hong Kong or something like that, and decide to reunify that could cause the markets to certainly freeze up. I mean they're already attacking a lot of the tech companies and so forth. So I think China remains a huge question as to the impact on the market and what their intention is."

But we, along with our real estate development team, the underwriting team, communicates constantly about these things, so we make sure we get them right. And the proof is in the pudding.

With me today are Jenna Foger,",954,"Thank you, Paula, and welcome, everyone, to Alexandria's Third Quarter '21 Earnings Call and our seventh consecutive quarter into COVID-19, which for sure has forever changed our world and our lives in very fundamental ways. With me today are Jenna Foger, Peter Moglia, Steve Richardson and Dean Shigenaga. In honor of my favorite NCAA basketball coach and in his final year as pet coach from Duke men's basketball, [indiscernible] said, Imagination has a great deal to do with winning. And I'd like to say to our extraordinary Alexandria family, thank you from the bottom of our hearts for a spectacular third quarter, and operational pace and execution tempo that really defines the terms operational excellence and for your great imagination as [indiscernible] said, in all things big and small. 
Moving on the keys to Alexandria's stellar third quarter performance by all metrics amid a historic demand environment. I think, and importantly, the best is yet to come, continuing historic high demand for Alexandria's best-in-class lab space, the niche, which we invented and are mission-critical and operationally excellent lab operations year-to-date, and others will talk about this. We've leased 5.4 million square feet and looking for a great fourth quarter to end the year. 
Alexandria is at the vanguard in the heart of meeting this historic high and unprecedented immediate lab space demand from many of our over 750 client tenants. Modern is a prime example and another one, which Dean will talk about, a big tenant in South San Francisco for a full building as well as a critical path for future growth, which is so needed thus the need for our acquisitions, redevelopment and development and has been repeated time and time again by life science tenants and their brokers if any other company is going up against Alexandria for leasing space the tenant will almost always pick Alexandria. We are proud to partner with Moderna on their Cambridge headquarters and core R&D facility. And Dean and others will talk about. It will be the most sustainable lab building in Cambridge with very strong economics and really great value creation. We're very honored and proud that Alexandria has had very really significant tenant relationships and stellar brand reputation across all of our cluster markets. We're also very fortunate to continue to have to truly demonstrate and do demonstrate pricing power in each of our core cluster markets. 
And by the way, the war for talent like other industries in the life science industry is creating an even greater space need -- set of space needs and demands in the core key life science clusters and that is very good for Alexandria. And we see an accelerating leasing demand even above and beyond what we see this quarter in several of our key cluster markets continuing. 
Rental rate growth continues strongly and excess supply is not a current threat. Alexandria's differentiated expertise and unique platform with its compelling internal and external growth drivers and outlook translates into genuine earnings power.  As indicated in the press release and submental, our visible and multiyear highly leased development pipeline is expected to generate approximately $615 million in future incremental revenue. And beyond that, the future leasing prospects really look extraordinary, as I've said. 
The biotech boom in historic life science demand driven by the strong industry fundamentals is evident. The 21st century is really the biological century as biology is in transition from an empirical science of trial and error to really an engineerable science with much more predictable and scalable outcomes.  We're witnessing the industrial revolution in biotech as we accelerate the application of new and innovative tools, we will see an acceleration in value creation. Products will come to market faster for less capital and with fewer failures. 
The life science industry and its ecosystem and its positive impact on humanity is truly a crown jewel of the United States and a testament to the free enterprise system of innovation. I think it's important to remember, politically, those who seek to create a cradle to grave entitlement society should not use this industry as it's fully pulped. 
And then finally, I want to turn to the second anniversary of our 115 project in Dayton, Ohio, which this month, we celebrate. Sad to say that overdoses have claimed a staggering 96,000 lives during the 12 months ended March of 2021, a 30% increase in the year before. 115 is an innovative, data-driven nonprofit evidence-based health care ecosystem dedicated to the full and sustained recovery of people with addiction and, as I said, Dayton, Ohio. 115 is revolutionizing the way addiction is treated through its tech-enabled care platform, which applies analytics to measure the effectiveness of various treatments and choices throughout the full continuum of care and continuously evolves its approach based on insights derived. Since its opening in 2015, 115 has served almost 4,000 individuals struggling with addiction and conducted over 9,000 telehealth visits since the start of COVID-19 pandemic. 
With our 115 partners, we're unwavering in our commitment to help people recover from addiction, live healthier lives while revitalizing the community. We would like to see this model replicated across the country, but politicians seem wholly ineffective, even given the large amount of capital that came to the cities and states during COVID-19. And our goal is not only to have 115 be a model for the success against opioid addiction in Dayton, Ohio, we hope to bring that model in a varied way to address the homeless crisis on the West Coast. 
And so with that, I'd like to turn it over to Jenna Foger, who is going to comment on some important COVID-19 matters, the NIH and the FDA, take it away, Jenna."

As we begin to turn a new corner on this COVID-19 pandemic, which I'll speak to in a moment. life science industry fundamentals still highlighted, continue to be very strong and provide the industry with the unique structural integrity to weather broader market volatility and cyclicality. The confluence of these drivers and key advances in our understanding of biology and next-generation modalities will continue to fuel life science demand well into the future. 
So as we spoke about last quarter, owing to the experience at which the industry and our tenants move to protect the country in the world. We now have the tools and a road map at our disposal and the pandemic, while also ushering in a historic new era for biotech and scientific innovation are none. 
So turning to our COVID-specific update.  By the numbers according to the World Health Organization, there have been a staggering 242 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, about 20% of these reported in the U.S. alone, including over 4.9 million cumulative deaths. 
In the U.S., the incidence of new COVID-19 cases has welcomingly declined over 55% from its recent September peak of over 160,000 new cases to now 70,000 new cases, and we hope to see this trend and decline continue, of course. 
Three of the most widely distributed vaccines worldwide and authorized by the FDA has been developed by [indiscernible] Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson.  And roughly 67% of the vaccine eligible population in our country that's 12 and over have been fully vaccinated. So this is just over 57% of the total U.S. population. And we hope with boosters and expanding the indications that this number of fully vaccinated individuals will continue to rise. 
As we saw last week, the FDA authorized the use of Moderna and Johnson & Johnson boosters in addition to Pfizer's already authorized booster shot as well as the mixing and matching of booster doses between Pfizer, Moderna and J&J in eligible population. 
In light of the evolving data on the duration of immunity and COVID-19 variants is concerned, including the common Delta variant and now the delta plus variant hitting U.S. soil, it's highly likely that COVID-19 vaccines will be required long term. 
With regard to vaccine efficacy in the study evaluating the real-world effectiveness of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, preventing symptomatic illness, the Moderna vaccine had an efficacy rate of 96% and Pfizer at 89%. So as we've all heard, breakthrough infections have occurred in a high single-digit percentage of vaccinated population. But while current vaccines may not entirely prevent transmission or contraction of COVID-19, they do significantly prevent severe disease and death, with over 90% of all hospitalized moved COVID represented by unvaccinated individual. 
With regard to vaccine safety, there has been very few vaccine-related adverse events, less than 7 per million reported overall with nearly all cases resolving and without long-term side effects reported date.  Given such a strong efficacy and safety profile, the FDA granted full approval for Pfizer's mRNA-based vaccine for people 16 and over, and Moderna's mRNA-based vaccine is likely to achieve full approval for its vaccine for 18 and over in the fourth quarter. 
With regard to pregnancy and women of childbearing age, based on the safety data generated to date and how we know vaccines work in the body, the CDC and top health officials have encouraged any American who is pregnant, aiming to become pregnant or currently breasting to get vaccinated against the coronavirus as soon as possible. 
With regard to children, Pfizer reported that its COVID-19 vaccine for ages 5 to 11 with states and nearly 91% effective. And on the basis of this data, the FDA is expected to authorize Pfizer's vaccine for this population in the fourth quarter. 
Moderna also just announced yesterday that its COVID vaccine is both safe and highly effective in children ages 6 to 11, which they will also submit to the FDA.  For young children ages 6 months to 4 years, vaccine authorization will likely come in early 2022. 
So despite these advances in vaccines, given that COVID will likely remain on the planet for the foreseeable future, albeit as an endemic virus, with seasonal and sporadic geographic peak therapies are going to continue to be important in mitigating the severity of COVID-19. And so most notably this past month, Alexandria at Merck in collaboration with Ridgeback Bio Therapeutics submitted an EUA application to the FDA for its oral antiviral molnupiravir. This drug demonstrated a 50% reduction in hospitalization or gas in patients with mild or moderate COVID-19. 
If authorized, molnupiravir will be the first oral antiviral therapy for COVID-19. This is a big deal. It's far easier and more cost-effective to administer broadly compared to current antibody treatment in the mild and moderate COVID-19 population. 
So despite the COVID fatigue that we all absolutely feel and the multitude of challenges that this pandemic has placed on our country, our society in the world, of course, the scientific advances achieved at an unprecedented speed is the 1 seating crease of the strategic period in our history. The scientific attitude and adaptability of so many of our tenants to translate their broad platforms and decades of work into safe and effective vaccines, therapies and testing in really a year's time is remarkable. And the application of these tools will forever transform the way we develop vaccines against our target. It will also augment future surveillance testing and our nation's pandemic preparedness overall. 
So to touch on another topic on the NIH and FDA leadership, the pandemic has also underscored how critical these agencies are and that strong support for these key federal agencies is paramount for National Security, for ensuring that the U.S. maintains its leadership in advancing scientific and biomedical innovation and for maximizing our ability to address current and future health challenges. 
So interestingly, over the past several weeks, the leadership positions that these 2 agencies have preceded increasing attention. On October 5, long-tenured NIH Director, Dr. Francis Collins, announced that he would be stepping down as a director of the agency by the end of the year. Dr. Collins is the longest-serving presidentially appointed NIH Director, having served 3 U.S. presidents over more than 12 years. During his tenure, the NIH has received increasing bipartisan support and the agency budget grew from $30 billion in 2009 when we started to nearly $50 billion in the upcoming fiscal year. 
The Biden administration is undergoing a formal process to name Collins replacement, which is expected later this year or more likely early next. And we're optimistic that his successor will continue to bolster biomedical and public health research in this country. As for the FDA, [indiscernible] Commissioner, Dr. [indiscernible] has led the agency since the beginning of the Biden administration. Under her leadership in addition to the COVID-related emergencies authorization that I just spoke about, the FDA Cedar has approved 40 new molecular entities through the third quarter, putting the agency on pace to meet 2020's near record high of 53 approvals. 
So because Dr. [ Janet Woodcock ] expires on November 15, the administration now needs to select and appoint a new commissioner in the coming weeks. So similarly, on October 14, the Biden administration announced that is likely to nominate Dr. Robert Califf as the next Commissioner of the FDA.  Dr. Califf is a cardiologist by training and current Head of Clinical Policy and Strategy for Verily and Google Health. Dr. Califf also served as FDA Commissioner from 2016 to 2017 under the Obama administration after being appointed Deputy Commissioner in 2015. Dr. Califf is also very well known and dear to us at Alexandria as a regular participant in the Alexandria Summit for the past several years and a partner in our 115 project to adjust the opioid epidemic, as Joel just spoke about. Dr. Califf's nomination would be viewed very favorably by the Life Science Industry, key investors and stakeholders. 
Clearly, the strength of the FDA is instrumental for ensuring the continued pace and vitality of biomedical innovation in our country, and I just wanted to highlight in addition to the COVID-19 related updates that we'll likely see in the fourth quarter, the FDA will also announce a handful of major approval decisions before the end of the year. Decisions that is positive will bring critical new drugs to patients as well as billions of dollars of additional revenue to the sector. 
For example, [ Eli Lilly ] is expected to submit an application for accelerated approval of an Alzheimer's therapy known as donanemab and and given all the controversies surrounding FDA's a positive approval of Biogen adding health in the same indication, the approval of Lilly's drug will likely inform future approvals in this area. There's also a major decision regarding a new class of drug for severe atopic dermatitis from Pfizer and AbbVie and several other weighted approvals for growing biotechs, including the approval of [indiscernible] for the treatment of bipolar disorder from long-standing Alexandria attendants and investment intracellular therapies. 
So just to wrap up before I turn it to Steve, I want to share a quote from former FDA Commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, in his new book, Uncontrolled Spread by COVID-19 crush us and how we can defeat the next pandemic. In his book Gottlieb writes, the brief history of COVID shows that innovation can't always be predicted. We don't know which platform will yield answers for future threats. As part of our national preparedness, it will be important to stockpile countermeasures to some of the known risks, but it's equally important to support the development of novel technology platforms that have brought applicability over a range of potential threats. 
The use of mRNA to customized synthetic vaccines show the value of having agile competencies at the ready. These are the technologies we will need to produce our nation's vulnerability. So it is this opportunity focus and unique ability and responsibility of the life science industry, that continue to reaffirm why Alexandria has dedicated our business, our passion and our purpose to help drive this mission-critical industry forward. And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve. Thank you."
365138,1679775708,2413059,"Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2021",2021-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jenna.

Good afternoon, everyone. Alexandria's brand power in the market is not only delivering the exceptional results today that you've seen, but also provides clarity for the potential trajectory of the future growth and enhanced dominant position in the life science ecosystem. Peter and I just completed an intensive on-the-ground tour through a few of our cluster markets and the energy and enthusiasm for Alexandria's entirety of offerings as an integral part of the life science ecosystem was abundantly evident. The Class A plus quality and the mission-critical nature of the facilities that is so important during this time of COVID-19, coupled with the creation of true renaissance like science centers on our mega campuses provides for a set of highly desirable and sought-after destinations. And the numbers of the team are posting bear-out this leadership position. The highlights include superb leasing milestones. Year-to-date leasing is 5.4 million square feet, the highest annual leasing run rate in the company's history achieved during just these first [indiscernible] of 2020 [indiscernible]. And as noted earlier by Joel, featuring the largest lease in the company's history to Moderna at 325 Binney Street for their 462 square foot state-of-the-art headquarters. It's critical to note 2 important aspects of this leasing activity. One, it is occurring in our core submarkets where we have high barriers to entry, low vacancy and a first-mover advantage and two, it is also occurring in the development and redevelopment pipeline at an accelerated rate with the 1 million square foot of leasing in the segment during Q3, reaching the second highest leasing level for development and redevelopment projects, further validating Alexandria's strategic and robust acquisition activity during 2021. 
Let's turn to the strategic expansion of our asset base. Q3 was a very productive quarter with completed acquisitions totaling 5.6 million square feet and a number of key aspects of this expansion of our asset base include the following: 4.9 million square feet of this total were highly accretive value creation opportunities. We are also able to continue either doubling down in our core submarkets as evidenced by 325 Binney Street or strategically expanding the boundaries of these submarkets. These critical decisions on acquisitions are informed by our unrivaled network of 750 tenants to meet their current needs and provide a path for future growth. 
And in total, we have now increased the total asset base from 47 million square feet to 64 million square feet during the past 4 quarters, a significant increase of 36%.  The core is also outperforming as renewal and releasing spreads of 19.3% cash and 35.3% gap during Q3 are impressive, but I also want to underscore and highlight that our mark-to-market across the portfolio headed up to 25% on a cash basis today, nearly doubling significantly up from 13.6% in Q1 of 2019. 
AR balance of 99.4% in October continues our hard work there, and we really do have a dream team in the operational realm and a big shout out to the folks who make this happen every day. Occupancy is increasing. As we noted throughout the year, we expected occupancy to increase, excluding the recently acquired projects with vacancy, and we've delivered on those goals.  We were at 97.1% as of June 2020, and we're now at 98.5%. 
Turning to market health. On the demand side, Joel and Jenna highlighted the key components driving demand in the life science industry. However, the seasoned executive life science management teams driving this manned are requiring high-quality facilities deeply experienced operational teams as clearly evidenced by our leasing volume and velocity. These companies are investing hundreds of millions of dollars in life-changing therapies and require exceptional performance from a world-class team and technically sophisticated facilities, downtime or mistakes that may destroy experiments in years of work are unacceptable risks. Alexandria as a pioneer of this life science niche has earned a reputation as a trusted partner to provide operational excellence for these mission-critical facilities. 
On the supply side, as I mentioned earlier, Peter and I recently toured a few of our regions firsthand to also evaluate the competitive supply on a granular level. And it's clear that there is no aggregation of disruptive large-scale projects delivering during 2022, 2023 time frame. There are, in fact, a handful of one-off buildings in the market but we have seen our qualitatively superior mega campuses compete very well against this type of offering. We are also closely monitoring the potential for projects beyond this time frame to definitively advance is genuine life science competition. But in many cases, they require many quarters or even years of entitlement permitting and horizontal infrastructure work before any decision to go vertical might be made. 
So in conclusion, as we close towards the end of 2021, the first 3 quarters of this year have yielded a tremendous productive foundation to continue the company's integral and indispensable role in the life science ecosystem. With that, I'll hand it off to Peter."
365138,1679775708,2413059,"Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2021",2021-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and hello, everybody. I'm going to update you all on our high-value creation development pipeline and construction cost trends. And then I'm going to comment on our recent partial interest sale in Mission Bay and some market activity that w",1250,"Thanks, Steve, and hello, everybody. I'm going to update you all on our high-value creation development pipeline and construction cost trends. And then I'm going to comment on our recent partial interest sale in Mission Bay and some market activity that we believe represents overzealous behavior by new entrants in the life science real estate market that should lead to challenges for such groups. As Joel mentioned in his opening, historic demand for our differentiated life science campuses has continued in the third quarter, and we expect this to continue through at least the near to medium term as record levels of government venture capital and biopharma investment continues to disseminate into Alexandria's cluster markets to discover, develop and manufacture new modalities such as cell, gene and RNA and DNA therapies. 
The resulting growth of our underlying industry gives us high conviction to continue at an elevated pace of development and redevelopment and to acquire assets to backfill the pipeline we are advancing today. This historic demand paired with our long-tenured development experience and expertise resulted in another outstanding quarter for Alexandria. We delivered 238,163 square feet spread over 6 assets, including our Sinolam the Charles and Watertown, which continues to be 1 of the hottest markets outside of Cambridge, 3160 Porter Drive, which is now materially oversubscribed with tenants looking to tap into this unique partnership we have with Stanford, and our 2 ground-up developments in Research Triangle, which are capitalizing on strong demand for research, development and manufacturing space from therapeutic and agricultural technology companies. These deliveries will contribute $14.3 million in NOI over the next year. 
And as Joel and Steve noted in their comments, during the quarter, we were very excited to add 325 Binney Street to our under construction pipeline. This new 462,000 square foot high-performance development, targeting lead 0 energy certification, showcases Alexandria's climate resilient design solutions as well as our mission-critical efforts to catalyze positive change to benefit human health and society. It is 100% leased to Moderna, an example of a highly disruptive and visionary company that has grown with Alexandria and shortly after it was founded. Early on, we identified the team and the transformational potential of its mRNA platform, and we have both invested and provided the company with mission-critical real estate over the past 10 years. This is truly a testament of our ability to recognize and become a trusted partner of the most impactful life science companies in the world. 
Including 325 Binney, we have added over 1.1 million square feet of new development to our pipeline and net of deliveries increased assets under construction from 3.4 million square feet to 4.3 million square feet. This increase in our pipeline is warranted by the demand I mentioned previously and evidenced by the tremendous leasing activity of over 1 million square feet for the quarter, truly a historic demand from the life science industry and tremendous execution by our leasing professionals. 
I'll now comment on cost trends. As reported over the past 2 quarters, construction costs remain elevated, driven by supply and demand dynamics for materials, but 2 other factors have begun to exacerbate the problem, labor shortages and supply chain problems. Nine months into 2021, previous year projects that had been put on hold due to COVID and new 2021 projects have created a double barrel demand for construction resources at a time when fabrication shops are struggling to procure raw materials and restart due to labor shortages. The result has been record escalation for concrete, steel, wood, aluminum and glass. 
Most of these commodities are sourced from the United States, but there are still a number that come from foreign sources, such as steel from Canada, Asia, Mexico and Brazil. glass from Thailand and resins used for pipe and specialty products such as bench tops for labs from Asia and Europe. As we all know, there have been significant supply chain disruptions around the world, none more apparent than the backlog of cargo ships in Southern California, which last Tuesday, reached an all-time high of over 100 ships waiting to unload thousands of containers outside the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, a bottleneck that is expected to continue into next year. 
In addition to supply disruptions, construction costs are being impacted by labor shortages. There is a lack of skilled workers to keep up with the accelerated demand caused by a number of factors, including GC finding that some of the workforce laid off or furloughed during COVID are not returning because of retirement or finding other jobs. And it could get worse if OSHA adopts vaccine mandates as the construction industry is 1 of the highest unvaccinated workforces. 
Unfortunately, higher costs are not the only consequence of material and labor shortages. Material shortages cause longer lead times that can delay deliveries. Based on our deep experience and expertise, lead times have generally increased by 6 to 8 weeks for most common materials, even longer for materials that are comprised of metal and PVC or have a need for computer ships such as building control. 
Alexandria is employing a number of mitigation measures to offset these impacts. And to date, we've been very successful in staying on budget and schedule the vast majority of our projects. Increases in rents have enabled us to maintain our yields, but future projects may trend slightly lower as escalations and longer lead times impact our underwriting. However, we are fortunate in that the demand for life science real estate investments continue to drive lower cap rates for stabilized buildings, allowing us to maintain our spread. And speaking of Cape compression, during the quarter, we sold additional interest in our [ 409-4999 ], Illinois and 1,500 Owen assets while recapitalizing them with a new partner.  our original recapitalization done in December 2015, we achieved a total valuation of $1,021 per square foot and a blended cap rate of 4.6%. In this transaction, we achieved a blended cap rate of 4.2% and a price per square foot of approximately $1,300 and $1,362, representing 33% appreciation over the whole period. To date, we've achieved a healthy unlevered IRR of 10.4% on those assets. 
Finally, an observation on those clamoring to position themselves to capture the growing life science real estate demand I referenced earlier. City Office REIT sale of 2 parcels in Sorrento Mesa to Sterling Bay and Harrison Street for $576 million illustrates a gold rush mentality proliferating across our market. City REIT's announcement stated that the south portion of the site was allocated $181 million of purchase price. A rendering of the site shows a very tight 2.0 FAR density of development that would imply a purchase price of $261 per square foot of land. To give you some context, our basis in the recently acquired land at 6250 to 6460 sequence drive, a far superior location in the same [indiscernible] submarket would have a basis of approximately 25% of that if we were to build it to the same density. Our plans contemplate a much more inviting campus with open space and amenities. So our basis will be more like 50% of theirs, but you get the point. 
This is a great example of why we are an incredibly -- in an incredibly advantageous position to capture any tenant requirement we want to capture. We are highly disciplined and have superior locations, superior basis, superior execution and the Superior brand. And with that, I'll pass it over to Dean."

Year-to-date, 2021 really has been an exceptional year of financial and operating performance for Alexandria. Our brand trusted partnerships with some of the most innovative life science entities, combined with operational excellence has allowed our team to generate strong results. Our internal growth has been very strong. Statistics from our pipeline of development and redevelopment projects are record-breaking and provide visibility for growth into the future. 
Total revenues, net operating income and adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter were very strong and were up 20%, 21% and 22%, respectively, over the third quarter of 2020, all really amazing and impactful results. And I should point out that these stats exclude the impact of the termination fee that was recognized in the third quarter of 2020. Now internal growth in operating results continue to reflect the strength of our unique and differentiated business model and strength of our brand. Our same property performance represents 1 of the highest quality growth engines within the REIT industry, of which we are immensely proud. 
We have 1 of the highest quality tenant rosters in the REIT industry with 53% of our annual rental revenue from investment-grade or large-cap publicly traded companies and an important statistic that should be noticed. And occupancy has been very strong and improving this year to 98.5%, up 80 basis points from the beginning of the year, excluding the impact from vacancy and recently acquired properties. 
Now importantly, 1.4 million rentable square feet of vacancy from recent acquisitions represents about 4.1% of our operating rentable square footage and is a significant opportunity to increase cash flows. Additionally, 41% of this 1.4 million rentable square feet of vacancy is leased or under lease negotiations. And as Joel has stated earlier, we are seeing increasing leasing demand in a number of our key life science cluster markets. 
Now same-property NOI growth was strong at 4.1% and 7.3% on a cash basis and headed toward the upper end of our ranges for 2021 guidance. Same-property NOI growth projected for the full year of 2021 is very solid, and is up 100 basis points and 70 basis points on a GAAP and cash basis, respectively, from our initial guidance for 2021, really highlighting the improvement in our outlook since the beginning of the year and once again, very proud of the strong internal growth engine we have. Leases executed in the 9 months ended September 30 at over 5.4 million rentable square feet another company record, and this leasing volume was completed with exceptional rental rate growth, up 39% and 22.3% on a cash basis. 
Now let me take a moment to highlight the seasonality of operating expenses related to higher utility expenses with warm summer weather. We had higher repairs and maintenance in the summer months versus what might occur during the winter months and higher property insurance premiums with our policy renewal, which took effect June 1. 
Now with 92% of our leases being triple net, these increases are generally recoverable from our tenants and therefore, have minimal impact on net operating income. However, the increase in operating expenses at a slight and only temporary negative 1% to 2% impact on operating and EBITDA margins for the quarter. Additionally, vacancy from recent acquisitions also slightly reduced margins. But it's important to recognize that our adjusted EBITDA margins remain 1 of the top within the REIT industry, and we expect to favorably resolve vacancy from recently acquired properties over the next number of quarters. 
Now turning to real estate. Our trusted partnership with key life science entities, our brand and operational excellence among many other items, is really standing out today, as highlighted by strong demand for our pipeline of development and redevelopment projects. We have 7.7 million rentable square feet, either under construction or construction commencing over the next 6 quarters with projects approximately 80% leased or under negotiation, highlighting continuing historic demand, 93% of which represents transactions with existing relationships, including a number of deals coming from our tenant base of over 750 entities. 
Now the 7.7 million rentable square foot pipeline is up 731,000 rentable square feet over June 30. And some of the key highlights in the quarter included and we commenced construction on 1.2 million rentable square feet that is on average 60% leased or under negotiation, including 325 Binney Street, which is 100% leased and 751 Gateway in South San Francisco, which is 100% under negotiation. 
And these are pretty amazing leasing statistics, and we just commenced construction. And in both cases, Stellar existing relationships resulted in full building users. Now we added approximately 480,000 rentable square feet of space targeted to commence construction over the next 6 quarters. That's about 20% of the space is under LOI negotiations today. And importantly, our team executed 1 million rentable square feet of leasing in the third quarter related to the development and redevelopment space, including the 462,000 rentable square foot lease for -- with Moderna for 100% of 325 Binney Street. 
And we expect demand from our development sites and projects will provide us the opportunity to commence construction of other development and redevelopment projects. Now turning to our venture investments. I just want to shout out a huge thank you to our science and technology team for their leadership in underwriting life science industry trends and high-quality investment opportunities. Now our venture investment cost basis only represents about 3.2% of gross assets and unrealized gains were $930 million on a cost basis of about $1 billion. 
In the third quarter, we realized individually significant gains from 3 separate transactions aggregating $52.4 million. And year-to-date through September 30, we realized individually significant gains from 6 separate transactions, aggregating $110.1 million. 
Now this represents over $100 million of capital that we did not anticipate at the beginning of the year that we were able to reinvest into our business. Now our team is very pleased for recognition of the overall improvement in our corporate credit profile. S&P just upgraded our rating to BBB+ with a positive outlook, highlighting our unique and differentiated business model, strong brand and execution high-quality cash flows and strong credit profile among many other items. So thank you to our entire team for continued solid execution across all areas of our business. We remain on track for net debt to adjusted EBITDA at 5.2x at fixed charges greater than 5x by the end of the year. 
As we close in on the end of 2021, we are focused on wrapping up several key partial interest sales in high-value, low cap rate transactions and other dispositions. Each transaction is moving along as expected, and we are targeting completions -- completion of the sales later this year, which will generate about $1.7 billion in capital. The timing of a couple of the key dispositions were subject to lease negotiations before we were able to put the deals in front of potential investors and therefore, are targeted to close in the fourth quarter. 
As our team continues to focus on making a positive and lasting impact on the world, they are very pleased for continued recognition of leadership in ESG. Now MSCI just released results, highlighting an A rating for Alexandria, representing 1 of the top ratings within the REIT industry. [indiscernible] also recently released results of their 2021 assessment, highlighting Alexandria as a global sector leader and a 5-star rating in the diversified sector for buildings and development and 1 of the top 2 in the science and technology sector for buildings and operation. 
And our team commenced construction to 325 Binney Street, which is the ground-up development fully leased to Moderna and is designed to be the most sustainable laboratory building in Cambridge. Now key items of the design include use of geothermal energy for heating and cooling, an innovative building envelope and building management system and other sustainable attributes that is designed to eliminate 95% or more of fossil fuels and achieve lead 0 energy. Now this building has also been designed to mitigate risk associated with flood precipitation under a business-as-usual scenario, and we are extremely excited to be an important strategic partner to Moderna for about a decade now, and super pleased that they select the team to assist them with their strategic priorities, including development of their next super innovative and sustainable lab building. 
Now turning to guidance. We updated our conservative guidance for 2021, including narrowing the range for EPS and FFO per share from a range of $0.08 to a range of $0.02 per share. Our 2021 guidance for EPS diluted is a range from $3.91 to $3.93 and FFO per share as adjusted diluted to a range of -- excuse me, $7.74 and the $7.76 with no change in the midpoint of $7.75. 
Now continued strong demand for space in our asset base has increased our outlook for rental rate growth on lease renewals and re-lease in the space by 2% and 1% on a GAAP and cash basis, respectively. And we also updated our 2021 guidance for dispositions and have 4 transactions in process that will generate $1.7 billion, as highlighted a moment ago. We updated construction spend for an increase of about $200 million at the midpoint, primarily due to acceleration of leasing intent space requirements related to our development and redevelopment projects. And as a reminder, we are about 5 weeks away from issuance of our detailed guidance for 2022, and therefore, we are unable to comment on 2022 guidance related matters. Let me end there and turn it back to Joel."

They're living and breathing by all biologics that will take constant tweaking until they can be gotten right. And so the tenants tend to need those facilities within even probably preferably 10, 20, 30-minute drive versus across the country or in an area where maybe there's cheap labor. So that's the opportunity for us and we've taken advantage of it and acquiring some properties that we'll do well for manufacturing. There's certain attributes to to a building that makes it better for manufacturing. But we've been also very careful in setting ourselves and putting ourselves in a good position to do that. by ensuring that where we're buying this real estate and the real estate that we're buying would also work well for R&D.
And so it's easy to do because, as I said, the tenants want these facilities to be very close to where they're doing the R&D now. And so down the line, if we have a building or [ 20 ] in a market that is being used for manufacturing and then they become available, they could also easily over to R&D down the road.

With me today are Jenna Foge",959,"Thank you, Paula, and welcome, everyone, to Alexandria's Third Quarter '21 Earnings Call and our seventh consecutive quarter into COVID-19, which for sure has forever changed our world and our lives in very fundamental ways. 
With me today are Jenna Foger, Peter Moglia, Steve Richardson and Dean Shigenaga. In honor of my favorite NCAA basketball coach and in his final year as head coach from Duke men's basketball, Coach K has said, ""Imagination has a great deal to do with winning."" And I'd like to say to our extraordinary Alexandria family, thank you from the bottom of our hearts for a spectacular third quarter and operational pace and execution tempo that really defines the terms operational excellence and for your great imagination, as Coach K said, in all things, big and small.  
Moving on, the keys to Alexandria's stellar third quarter performance by all metrics amid a historic demand environment, I think, and importantly, the best is yet to come, continuing historic high demand for Alexandria's best-in-class lab space, the niche, which we invented and are mission-critical and operationally excellent lab operations year-to-date, and others will talk about this. We've leased 5.4 million square feet and looking for a great fourth quarter to end the year.  
Alexandria is at the vanguard and the heart of meeting this historic high and unprecedented immediate lab space demand from many of our over 750 client tenants. Moderna is a prime example and another one, which Dean will talk about, a big tenant in South San Francisco for a full building as well as a critical path for future growth, which is so needed, thus the need for our acquisitions, redevelopment and developments. And has been repeated time and time again by life science tenants and their brokers, if any other company is going up against Alexandria for leasing space, the tenant will almost always pick Alexandria. 
We are proud to partner with Moderna on their Cambridge headquarters and core R&D facility. And as Dean and others will talk about, it will be the most sustainable lab building in Cambridge with very strong economics and really great value creation. We're very honored and proud that Alexandria has had very strategically significant tenant relationships and stellar brand reputation across all of our cluster markets. We're also very fortunate to continue to have to truly demonstrate and do demonstrate pricing power in each of our core cluster markets.  
And by the way, the war for talent like other industries in the life science industry is creating an even greater space need -- set of space needs and demands in the core key life science clusters, and that is very good for Alexandria. And we see an accelerating leasing demand, even above and beyond what we see this quarter in several of our key cluster markets continuing.  
Rental rate growth continues strongly and excess supply is not a current threat. Alexandria's differentiated expertise and unique platform with its compelling internal and external growth drivers and outlook translates into genuine earnings power.  As indicated in the press release and supplemental, our visible multiyear highly leased development pipeline is expected to generate approximately $615 million in future incremental revenue. And beyond that, the future leasing prospects really look extraordinary, as I've said.  
The biotech boom in historic life science demand driven by the strong industry fundamentals is evident. The 21st century is really the biological century as biology is in transition from an empirical science of trial and error to really an engineerable science with much more predictable and scalable outcomes.  We're witnessing the industrial revolution in biotech as we accelerate the application of new and innovative tools we will see an acceleration in value creation. Products will come to market faster for less capital and with fewer failures. The life science industry and its ecosystem and its positive impact on humanity is truly a crown jewel of the United States and a testament to the free enterprise system of innovation. I think it's important to remember, politically, those who seek to create a cradle to grave entitlement society should not use this industry as it's fully [ pulped ].  
And then finally, I want to turn to the second anniversary of our 115 project in Dayton, Ohio, which this month, we celebrate. Sad to say that overdoses have claimed a staggering 96,000 lives during the 12 months ended March of 2021, a 30% increase in the year before. 115 is an innovative, data-driven nonprofit evidence-based health care ecosystem dedicated to the full and sustained recovery of people with addiction. And, as I said, Dayton, Ohio, 115 is revolutionizing the way addiction is treated through its tech-enabled care platform, which applies analytics to measure the effectiveness of various treatments and choices throughout the full continuum of care and continuously evolves its approach based on insights derived. Since its opening in 2015, 115 has served almost 4,000 individuals struggling with addiction, and conducted over 9,000 telehealth visits since the start of COVID-19 pandemic. 
With our 115 partners, we're unwavering in our commitment to help people recover from addiction, live healthier lives while revitalizing the community. We would like to see this model replicated across the country, but politicians seem wholly ineffective, even given the large amount of capital that came to the cities and states during COVID-19. And our goal is not only to have 115 be a model for the success against opioid addiction in Dayton, Ohio, we hope to bring that model in a varied way to address the homeless crisis on the West Coast.  
And so with that, I'd like to turn it over to Jenna Foger, who is going to comment on some important COVID-19 matters, the NIH and the FDA. Take it away, Jenna."
365138,1679775708,2413144,"Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2021",2021-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.","Executives","Thank you so much, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. As we begin to turn a new corner on this COVID-19 pandemic, which I'll speak to in a moment, life science industry fundamentals, still highlighted, continued to be very strong and provide the industry",1706,"Thank you so much, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. As we begin to turn a new corner on this COVID-19 pandemic, which I'll speak to in a moment, life science industry fundamentals, still highlighted, continued to be very strong and provide the industry with the unique structural integrity to weather broader market volatility and cyclicality. The confluence of these drivers and key advances in our understanding of biology and next-generation modalities will continue to fuel life science demands well into the future.  
So as we spoke about last quarter, owing to the experience at which the industry and our tenants move to protect the country and the world, we now have the tools and a roadmap at our disposal and the pandemic, while also ushering in a historic new era for biotech and scientific innovation [indiscernible] none.  
So turning to our COVID-specific update. By the numbers, according to the World Health Organization, there have been a staggering 242 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. About 20% of these reported in the U.S. alone, including over 4.9 million cumulative deaths. In the U.S., the incidence of new COVID-19 cases has welcomingly declined over 55% from its recent September peak of over 160,000 new cases to now 70,000 new cases, and we hope to see this trend and decline continue, of course.  
Three of the most widely distributed vaccines worldwide and authorized by the FDA has been developed by ARE tenants: Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. And roughly 67% of the vaccine eligible population in our country, that's 12 and over, have been fully vaccinated. So this is just over 57% of the total U.S. population, and we hope with boosters and expanding the indications that this number of fully vaccinated individuals will continue to rise. As we saw last week, the FDA authorized the use of Moderna and Johnson & Johnson boosters in addition to Pfizer's already authorized booster shots as well as the mixing and matching of booster doses between Pfizer, Moderna and J&J in eligible population.  
In light of the evolving data on the duration of immunity and COVID-19 variants confirmed, including the common Delta variant and now the Delta Plus variant hitting U.S. soil, it's highly likely that COVID-19 vaccines will be required long term.  
With regard to vaccine efficacy and the study evaluating the real-world effectiveness of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines preventing symptomatic illness, the Moderna vaccine had an efficacy rate of 96% and Pfizer at 89%. So as we've all heard, breakthrough infections have occurred in a high single-digit percentage of vaccinated population. But while current vaccines may not entirely prevent transmission or contraction of COVID-19, they do significantly prevent severe disease and death, with over 90% of all hospitalized COVID cases represented by unvaccinated individual.  
With regard to vaccine safety, there has been very few vaccine-related adverse events, less than 7 per million reported overall, with nearly all cases resolving and without long-term side effects reported to date. Given such a strong efficacy and safety profile, the FDA granted full approval for Pfizer's mRNA-based vaccine for people 16 and over, and Moderna's mRNA-based vaccine is likely to achieve full approval for its vaccine for 18 and older in the fourth quarter.  
With regard to pregnancy and women of childbearing age, based on the safety data generated to date and how we know vaccines work in the body, the CDC and top health officials have encouraged any American who is pregnant, planning to become pregnant or currently breastfeeding to get vaccinated against the coronavirus as soon as possible. 
With regard to children, Pfizer reported that its COVID-19 vaccine for ages 5 to 11 was phased in nearly 91% effective. And on the basis of this data, the FDA is expected to authorize Pfizer's vaccine for this population in the fourth quarter.  
Moderna also just announced yesterday that its COVID vaccine is both safe and highly effective in children ages 6 to 11, which they will also submit to the FDA. For young children ages 6 months to 4 years, vaccine authorization will likely come in early 2022.  
So despite these advances in vaccines, given that COVID will likely remain on the planet for the foreseeable future, albeit as an endemic virus with seasonal and sporadic geographic peaks therapies are going to continue to be important in mitigating the severity of COVID-19. And so most notably, this past month, Alexandria and tenant Merck, in collaboration with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, submitted an EUA application to the FDA for its oral antiviral molnupiravir. This drug demonstrated a 50% reduction in hospitalization or death in patients with mild or moderate COVID-19. If authorized, molnupiravir will be the first oral antiviral therapy for COVID-19. This is a big deal. It's far easier and more cost-effective to administer broadly compared to current antibody treatments in the mild and moderate COVID-19 population.  
So despite the COVID hit peak that we all absolutely feel and the multitude of challenges that this pandemic has placed on our country, our society and the world, of course, the scientific advances achieved at an unprecedented speed is the one [indiscernible] grace of the strategic period in our history. The scientific aptitude and adaptability of so many of our tenants to translate their broad platforms and decades of work into safe and effective vaccines, therapies and testing in really a year's time is remarkable, and the application of these tools will forever transform the way we develop vaccines against novel target. It will also augment future surveillance testing and our nation's pandemic preparedness overall.  
So to touch on another topic on the NIH and FDA leadership, the pandemic has also underscored how critical these agencies are and that strong support for these key federal agencies is paramount for national security, for ensuring that the U.S. maintains its leadership in advancing scientific and biomedical innovation, and for maximizing our ability to address current and future health challenges.  
So interestingly, over the past several weeks, the leadership positions that these two agencies have exceeded increasing attention. On October 5, long-tenured NIH Director, Dr. Francis Collins, announced that he would be stepping down as the Director of the agency by the end of the year. Dr. Collins is the longest-serving presidentially appointed NIH Director, having served 3 U.S. Presidents over more than 12 years. During his tenure, the NIH has received increasing bipartisan support and the agency's budget grew from $30 billion in 2009 when he started to nearly $50 billion in the upcoming fiscal year. The Biden administration is undergoing a formal process to name Collins' replacement, which is expected later this year or more likely, early next, and we're optimistic that his successor will continue to bolster biomedical and public health research in this country. 
As for the FDA, Acting Commissioner, Dr. Janet Woodcock led the agency since the beginning of the Biden administration. Under her leadership, in addition to the COVID-related emergency authorizations that I just spoke about, the FDA CDER has approved 40 new molecular entities through the third quarter, putting the agency on pace to meet 2020's near record high of 53 approvals.  
So because Dr. Janet Woodcock [indiscernible] on November 15, the administration now needs to select and appoint a new Commissioner in the coming weeks. So similarly, on October 14, the Biden administration announced that its likely to nominate Dr. Robert Califf as the next Commissioner of the FDA. Dr. Califf is a Cardiologist by training and current Head of Clinical Policy and Strategy for Verily and Google Health. Dr. Califf also served as FDA Commissioner from 2016 to 2017 under the Obama administration after being appointed Deputy Commissioner in 2015. Dr. Califf is also very well known and dear to us at Alexandria as a regular participant in the Alexandria Summit for the past several years and a partner in our 115 project to adjust the opioid epidemic, as Joel just spoke about. Dr. Califf's nomination would be viewed very favorably by the life science industry key investors and stakeholders.  
Clearly, the strength of the FDA is instrumental for ensuring the continued pace and vitality of biomedical innovation in our country, and I just wanted to highlight that in addition to the COVID-19-related updates that we'll likely see in the fourth quarter, the FDA will also announce a handful of major approval decisions before the end of the year. Decisions that is positive will bring critical new drugs to patients as well as billions of dollars and additional revenue to the sector.  
For example, Eli Lilly is expected to submit an application for accelerated approval of an Alzheimer's therapy known as donanemab, and given all the controversies surrounding FDA's a positive approval of Biogen's addictive homes in the same indication, the approval of Lilly's drug will likely inform future approvals in this area. There's also a major decision regarding a new class of drug for severe atopic dermatitis from Pfizer and AbbVie and several other waited approvals for growing biotechs, including the approval of [indiscernible] for the treatment of bipolar disorder from long-standing Alexandria tenant and investment intracellular therapies.  
So just to wrap up before I turn it to Steve, I wanted to share a quote from former FDA Commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, in his new book, Uncontrolled Spread: Why COVID-19 Crushed Us and How We Can Defeat the Next Pandemic. In his book, Gottlieb writes, ""The brief history of COVID shows that innovation can't always be predicted. We don't know which platform will yield answers for future threats. As part of our national preparedness, it will be important to stockpile countermeasures to some of the known risks  but it's equally important to support the development of novel technology platforms that have brought applicability over a range of potential threats. The use of mRNA to customized synthetic vaccines showed the value of having agile competencies at the ready. These are the technologies we will need to produce our nation's vulnerability."" So it is this opportune focus and unique ability and responsibility of the life science industry that continue to reaffirm why Alexandria has dedicated our business, our passion and our purpose to help drive this mission-critical industry forward. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve. Thank you."
365138,1679775708,2413144,"Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2021",2021-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jenna.

Good afternoon, everyone. Alexandria's brand power in the market is not only delivering the exceptional results today that you've seen, but also provides clarity for the potential trajectory of the company's future growth and enhanced dominant position in the life science ecosystem. Peter and I just completed an intensive on-the-ground tour through a few of our cluster markets, and the energy and enthusiasm for Alexandria's entirety of offerings is an integral part of the life science ecosystem was abundantly evident. The Class A plus quality and the mission-critical nature of the facilities that is so important during this time of COVID-19, coupled with the creation of true renaissance like science centers on our mega campuses provides for a set of highly desirable and sought-after destinations. 
And the numbers of the team are posting bear-out this leadership position. The highlights include superb leasing milestones. Year-to-date leasing is 5.4 million square feet, the highest annual leasing run rate in the company's history achieved during just these first 3 quarters of 2021. And as noted earlier by Joel, featuring the largest lease in the company's history to Moderna at 325 Binney Street for their 462 square foot state-of-the-art headquarters. It's critical to note two important aspects of this leasing activity: one, it is occurring in our core submarkets where we have high barriers to entry, low vacancy and a first-mover advantage; and two, it is also occurring in the development and redevelopment pipeline at an accelerated rate with the 1 million square foot of leasing in the segment during Q3, reaching the second highest leasing level for development and redevelopment projects, further validating Alexandria's strategic and robust acquisition activity during 2021.  
Let's turn to the strategic expansion of our asset base. Q3 was a very productive quarter with completed acquisitions totaling 5.6 million square feet and a number of key aspects of this expansion of our asset base include the following: 4.9 million square feet of this total were highly accretive value creation opportunities. We are also able to continue either doubling down in our core submarkets as evidenced by 325 Binney Street or strategically expanding the boundaries of these submarkets. These critical decisions on acquisitions are informed by our unrivaled network of 750 tenants to meet their current needs and provide a path for future growth.  
And in total, we have now increased the total asset base from 47 million square feet to 64 million square feet during the past 4 quarters, a significant increase of 36%.  The core is also outperforming as renewal and releasing spreads of 19.3% cash and 35.3% gap during Q3 are impressive, but I also want to underscore and highlight that our mark-to-market across the portfolio has moved up to 25% on a cash basis today, nearly doubling significantly up from 13.6% in Q1 of 2019.  
AR balance of 99.4% in October continues our hard work there, and we really do have a dream team in the operational realm and a big shout out to the folks who make this happen every day. Occupancy is increasing. As we noted throughout the year, we expected occupancy to increase, excluding the recently acquired projects with vacancy, and we've delivered on those goals. We were at 97.1% as of June 2020, and we're now at 98.5%.  
Turning to market health. On the demand side, Joel and Jenna highlighted the key components driving demand in the life science industry. However, the seasoned executive life science management teams driving this demand are requiring high-quality facilities and deeply experienced operational teams as, clearly evidenced by our leasing volume and velocity. These companies are investing hundreds of millions of dollars in life-changing therapies and require exceptional performance from a world-class team and technically sophisticated facilities. Downtime or mistakes that may destroy experiments in years of work are unacceptable risks. Alexandria, as a pioneer of this life science niche, has earned a reputation as a trusted partner to provide operational excellence for these mission-critical facilities.  
On the supply side, as I mentioned earlier, Peter and I recently toured a few of our regions firsthand to also evaluate the competitive supply on a granular level. And it's clear that there is no aggregation of disruptive large-scale projects delivering during 2022, 2023 timeframe. There are, in fact, a handful of one-off buildings in the market, but we have seen our qualitatively superior mega campuses compete very well against this type of offering. We are also closely monitoring the potential for projects beyond this timeframe to definitively advance this genuine life science competition, but in many cases, they require many quarters or even years of entitlement, permitting and horizontal infrastructure work before any decision to go vertical might be made.  
So in conclusion, as we close towards the end of 2021, the first 3 quarters of this year have yielded a tremendously productive foundation to continue the company's integral and indispensable role in the life science ecosystem. 
With that, I'll hand it off to Peter."
365138,1679775708,2413144,"Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2021",2021-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and hello, everybody. I'm going to update you all on our high value creation development pipeline and construction cost trends, and then I'm going to comment on our recent partial interest sale in Mission Bay and some market activity that w",1255,"Thanks, Steve, and hello, everybody. I'm going to update you all on our high value creation development pipeline and construction cost trends, and then I'm going to comment on our recent partial interest sale in Mission Bay and some market activity that we believe represents overzealous behavior by new entrants in the life science real estate market that should lead to challenges for such groups. 
As Joel mentioned in his opening, historic demand for our differentiated life science campuses has continued in the third quarter, and we expect this to continue through at least the near to medium term as record levels of government venture capital and biopharma investment continued to disseminate into Alexandria's cluster markets to discover, develop and manufacture new modalities such as cell, gene and RNA and DNA therapies.  
The resulting growth of our underlying industry gives us high conviction to continue at an elevated pace of development and redevelopment and to acquire assets to backfill the pipeline we are advancing today. This historic demand, paired with our long-tenured development experience and expertise, resulted in another outstanding quarter for Alexandria. We delivered 238,163 square feet spread over 6 assets, including our [indiscernible] on the Charles and Watertown, which continues to be one of the hottest markets outside of Cambridge, 3160 Porter Drive, which is now materially oversubscribed with tenants looking to tap into this unique partnership we have with Stanford, and our 2 ground-up developments in Research Triangle, which are capitalizing on strong demand for research, development and manufacturing space from therapeutic and agricultural technology companies. These deliveries will contribute $14.3 million in NOI over the next year.  
And as Joel and Steve noted in their comments, during the quarter, we were very excited to add 325 Binney Street to our under construction pipeline. This new 462,000 square foot high-performance development, targeting LEED Zero Energy certification, showcases Alexandria's climate resilient design solutions as well as our mission-critical efforts to catalyze positive change to benefit human health and society. It is 100% leased to Moderna, an example of a highly disruptive and visionary company that has grown with Alexandria since shortly after it was founded. 
Early on, we identified the team and the transformational potential of its mRNA platform, and we have both invested and provided the company with mission-critical real estate over the past 10 years. This is truly a testament of our ability to recognize and become a trusted partner of the most impactful life science companies in the world.  
Including 325 Binney, we have added over 1.1 million square feet of new development to our pipeline, and net of deliveries increased assets under construction from 3.4 million square feet to 4.3 million square feet. This increase in our pipeline is warranted by the demand I mentioned previously and evidenced by the tremendous leasing activity of over 1 million square feet for the quarter, truly a historic demand from the life science industry and tremendous execution by our leasing professionals.  
I'll now comment on cost trends. As reported over the past two quarters, construction costs remain elevated, driven by supply and demand dynamics for materials, but two other factors have begun to exacerbate the problem: labor shortages; and supply chain problems. Nine months into 2021, previous year's projects that had been put on hold due to COVID and new 2021 projects have created a double barrel demand for construction resources at a time when fabrication shops are struggling to procure raw materials and restart due to labor shortages. The result has been record escalation for concrete, steel, wood, aluminum and glass.  
Most of these commodities are sourced from the United States, but there are still a number that come from foreign sources, such as steel from Canada, Asia, Mexico and Brazil, glass from Thailand and resins used for pipe and specialty products such as bench tops for labs from Asia and Europe. As we all know, there have been significant supply chain disruptions around the world, none more apparent than the backlog of cargo ships in Southern California, which, last Tuesday, reached an all-time high of over 100 ships waiting to unload thousands of containers outside the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, a bottleneck that is expected to continue into next year.  
In addition to supply disruptions, construction costs are being impacted by labor shortages. There is a lack of skilled workers to keep up with the accelerated demand caused by a number of factors, including GC finding that some of the workforce laid off or furloughed during COVID are not returning because of retirement or finding other jobs. And it could get worse if OSHA adopts vaccine mandates as the construction industry is one of the highest unvaccinated workforces.  
Unfortunately, higher costs are not the only consequence of material and labor shortages. Material shortages cause longer lead times that can delay deliveries. Based on our deep experience and expertise, lead times have generally increased by 6 to 8 weeks for most common materials, even longer for materials that are comprised of metal and PVC or have a need for computer ships such as building control.  
Alexandria is employing a number of mitigation measures to offset these impacts. And to date, we've been very successful in staying on budget and schedule with the vast majority of our projects. Increases in rents have enabled us to maintain our yields, but future projects may trend slightly lower as escalations and longer lead times impact our underwriting. However, we are fortunate in that the demand for life science real estate investments continue to drive lower cap rates for stabilized buildings, allowing us to maintain our spread. And speaking of cap rate compression, during the quarter, we sold additional interest in our 409/499 Illinois and 1500 Owens assets while recapitalizing them with a new partner. In our original recapitalization done in December 2015, we achieved a total valuation of $1,021 per square foot and a blended cap rate of 4.6%. In this transaction, we achieved a blended cap rate of 4.2% and a price per square foot of approximately $1,300 and -- $1,362, representing 33% appreciation over the whole period. To date, we've achieved a healthy unlevered IRR of 10.4% on those assets.  
Finally, an observation on those clamoring to position themselves to capture the growing life science real estate demand I referenced earlier. Citi office REIT sale of 2 parcels in Sorrento Mesa to Sterling Bay and Harrison Street for $576 million illustrates a gold rush mentality proliferating across our market. Citi REIT's announcement stated that the south portion of the site was allocated $181 million of purchase price. A rendering of the site shows a very tight 2.0 FAR density of development that would imply a purchase price of $261 per square foot of land. To give you some context, our basis in the recently acquired land at 6250 to 6460 Sequence Drive, a far superior location in the same Sorrento Mesa submarket would have a basis of approximately 25% of that if we were to build it to the same density. Our plans contemplate a much more inviting campus with open space and amenities. So our basis will be more like 50% of theirs, but you get the point.  
This is a great example of why we are an incredibly -- in an incredibly advantageous position to capture any tenant requirement we want to capture. We are highly disciplined and have superior locations, superior basis, superior execution and the superior brand. 
And with that, I'll pass it over to Dean."

Year-to-date, 2021 really has been an exceptional year of financial and operating performance for Alexandria. Our brand trusted partnerships with some of the most innovative life science entities, combined with operational excellence has allowed our team to generate strong results. Our internal growth has been very strong. Statistics from our pipeline of development and redevelopment projects are record-breaking and provide visibility for growth into the future. 
Total revenues, net operating income and adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter were very strong and were up 20%, 21% and 22%, respectively, over the third quarter of 2020, all really amazing and impactful results. And I should point out that these stats exclude the impact of the termination fee that was recognized in the third quarter of 2020. Now internal growth in operating results continue  to reflect the strength of our unique and differentiated business model and strength of our brand. Our same property performance represents one of the highest quality growth engines within the REIT industry, of which we are immensely proud. 
We have one of the highest quality tenant rosters in the REIT industry with 53% of our annual rental revenue from investment-grade or large-cap publicly traded companies, and an important statistic that should be noticed. And occupancy has been very strong and improving this year to 98.5%, up 80 basis points from the beginning of the year, excluding the impact from vacancy and recently acquired properties. 
Now importantly, 1.4 million rentable square feet of vacancy from recent acquisitions represents about 4.1% of our operating rentable square footage, and is a significant opportunity to increase cash flows. Additionally, 41% of this 1.4 million rentable square feet of vacancy is leased or under lease negotiations. And as Joel has stated earlier, we are seeing increasing leasing demand in a number of our key life science cluster markets. 
Now same-property NOI growth was strong at 4.1% and 7.3% on a cash basis, and headed toward the upper end of our ranges for 2021 guidance. Same-property NOI growth projected for the full year of 2021 is very solid and is up 100 basis points and 70 basis points on a GAAP and cash basis, respectively, from our initial guidance for 2021, really highlighting the improvement in our outlook since the beginning of the year, and once again, very proud of the strong internal growth engine we have. Leases executed in the 9 months ended September 30 at over 5.4 million rentable square feet, another company record. And this leasing volume was completed with exceptional rental rate growth, up 39% and 22.3% on a cash basis. 
Now let me take a moment to highlight the seasonality of operating expenses related to higher utility expenses with warm summer weather. We had higher repairs and maintenance in the summer months versus what might occur during the winter months and higher property insurance premiums with our policy renewal, which took effect June 1. 
Now with 92% of our leases being triple net, these increases are generally recoverable from our tenants and therefore, have minimal impact on net operating income. However, the increase in operating expenses at a slight and only temporary negative 1% to 2% impact on operating and EBITDA margins for the quarter. Additionally, vacancy from recent acquisitions also slightly reduced margins. But it's important to recognize that our adjusted EBITDA margins remain one of the top within the REIT industry, and we expect to favorably resolve vacancy from recently acquired properties over the next number of quarters. 
Now turning to real estate. Our trusted partnership with key life science entities, our brand and operational excellence among many other items, is really standing out today, as highlighted by strong demand for our pipeline of development and redevelopment projects. We have 7.7 million rentable square feet, either under construction or construction commencing over the next 6 quarters with projects approximately 80% leased or under negotiation, highlighting continuing historic demand, 93% of which represents transactions with existing relationships, including a number of deals coming from our tenant base of over 750 entities. 
Now the 7.7 million rentable square foot pipeline is up 731,000 rentable square feet over June 30. And some of the key highlights in the quarter included and we commenced construction on 1.2 million rentable square feet that is on average 60% leased or under negotiation, including 325 Binney Street, which is 100% leased and 751 Gateway in South San Francisco, which is 100% under negotiation. 
And these are pretty amazing leasing statistics, and we just commenced construction. And in both cases, Stellar existing relationships resulted in full building users. Now we added approximately 480,000 rentable square feet of space targeted to commence construction over the next 6 quarters. That's about 20% of the space is under LOI negotiations today. And importantly, our team executed 1 million rentable square feet of leasing in the third quarter related to the development and redevelopment space, including the 462,000 rentable square foot lease for -- with Moderna for 100% of 325 Binney Street. And we expect demand from our development sites and projects will provide us the opportunity to commence construction of other development and redevelopment projects. 
Now turning to our venture investments. I just want to shout out a huge thank you to our science and technology team for their leadership in underwriting life science industry trends and high-quality investment opportunities. Now our venture investment cost basis only represents about 3.2% of gross assets, and unrealized gains were $930 million on a cost basis of about $1 billion. In the third quarter, we realized individually significant gains from 3 separate transactions, aggregating $52.4 million. And year-to-date through September 30, we realized individually significant gains from 6 separate transactions, aggregating $110.1 million. 
Now this represents over $100 million of capital that we did not anticipate at the beginning of the year that we were able to reinvest into our business. Now our team is very pleased for recognition of the overall improvement in our corporate credit profile. S&P just upgraded our rating to BBB+ with a positive outlook, highlighting our unique and differentiated business model, strong brand and execution high-quality cash flows and strong credit profile among many other items. So thank you to our entire team for continued solid execution across all areas of our business. We remain on track for net debt to adjusted EBITDA at 5.2x at fixed charges greater than 5x by the end of the year. 
As we close in on the end of 2021, we are focused on wrapping up several key partial interest sales in high-value, low cap rate transactions and other dispositions. Each transaction is moving along as expected, and we are targeting completions -- completion of the sales later this year, which will generate about $1.7 billion in capital. The timing of a couple of the key dispositions were subject to lease negotiations before we were able to put the deals in front of potential investors and therefore, are targeted to close in the fourth quarter. 
As our team continues to focus on making a positive and lasting impact on the world, they are very pleased for continued recognition of leadership in ESG. Now MSCI just released results, highlighting an A rating for Alexandria, representing one of the top ratings within the REIT industry. GRESB also recently released results of their 2021 assessment, highlighting Alexandria as a Global Sector Leader and a 5-star rating in the Diversified Sector for buildings and development and one of the top 2 in the science and technology sector for buildings and operation. 
And our team commenced construction to 325 Binney Street, which is the ground-up development fully leased to Moderna and, is designed to be the most sustainable laboratory building in Cambridge. Now key items of the design include use of geothermal energy for heating and cooling, an innovative building envelope and building management system and other sustainable attributes that is designed to eliminate 95% or more of fossil fuels and achieve LEED Zero Energy. Now this building has also been designed to mitigate risk associated with flood precipitation under a business-as-usual scenario, and we are extremely excited to be an important strategic partner to Moderna for about a decade now, and super pleased that they select the team to assist them with their strategic priorities, including development of their next super innovative and sustainable lab building. 
Now turning to guidance. We updated our conservative guidance for 2021, including narrowing the range for EPS and FFO per share from a range of $0.08 to a range of $0.02 per share. Our 2021 guidance for EPS diluted is a range from $3.91 to $3.93 and FFO per share as adjusted diluted to a range of -- excuse me, $7.74 and the $7.76 with no change in the midpoint of $7.75. 
Now continued strong demand for space in our asset base has increased our outlook for rental rate growth on lease renewals and re-lease in the space by 2% and 1% on a GAAP and cash basis, respectively. And we also updated our 2021 guidance for dispositions, and have 4 transactions in process that will generate $1.7 billion, as highlighted a moment ago. We updated construction spend for an increase of about $200 million at the midpoint, primarily due to acceleration of leasing intent space requirements related to our development and redevelopment projects. And as a reminder, we are about 5 weeks away from issuance of our detailed guidance for 2022, and therefore, we are unable to comment on 2022 guidance related matters. Let me end there and turn it back to Joel."

But that's really not the opportunity we've been touting and the opportunity we've been telling is the next-generation manufacturing of cell and gene therapy type of or even DNA and RNA type of drugs like the Moderna manufacturers. -- those drugs need to be near the research. They're living and breathing by all biologics that will take constant tweaking until they can be gotten right. 
And so the tenants tend to need those facilities within even probably preferably 10, 20, 30-minute drive versus across the country or in an area where maybe there's cheap labor. So that's the opportunity for us and we've taken advantage of it and acquiring some properties that we'll do well for manufacturing. There's certain attributes to a building that makes it better for manufacturing. But we've been also very careful in setting ourselves and putting ourselves in a good position to do that. by ensuring that where we're buying this real estate and the real estate that we're buying would also work well for R&D.
And so it's easy to do because, as I said, the tenants want these facilities to be very close to where they're doing the R&D now. And so, down the line, if we have a building or 20 in a market that is being used for manufacturing and then they become available, they could also easily over to R&D down the road. Hopefully, that answers your question."
