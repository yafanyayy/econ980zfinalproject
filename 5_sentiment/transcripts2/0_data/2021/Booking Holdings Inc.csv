I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. Despite a travel environment that continues to be very challenging, we closed out 2020 by delivering fourth quarter results",1871,"Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' fourth quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. 
Despite a travel environment that continues to be very challenging, we closed out 2020 by delivering fourth quarter results that were a bit better than the expectations we talked about on our last earnings call. David will provide the details on the fourth quarter results in his remarks. For my time, I will first briefly reflect on our execution during the extremely difficult year of 2020. Then I will share our thoughts and strategic priorities for 2021 and beyond. 
Without a doubt, 2020 presented the biggest disruption to modern global travel the world has ever seen, and our results for full year 2020 were down substantially from 2019. However, travelers still built 355 million room nights through our platforms during 2020. And we remained profitable by generating approximately $880 million in adjusted EBITDA. Delivering these results during this unprecedented and unpredictable year is a credit to our team's relentless efforts to provide the best value and service to our traveler customers and to our supply partners, while all the time remaining incredibly focused on operating efficiently. 
When we spoke to you on our earnings call in May of 2020, we outlined a series of plans that would help us navigate through the COVID-19 crisis. First, we said we would stabilize the business from the immediate shock of the crisis. Second, we said we would optimize the business for the expected decrease in travel demand over the next few years. And third, we said we would position the business to be able to capture travel demand when it returns. 
Based on our accomplishments in 2020, I can confidently say that we executed well against these plans. In the beginning of the crisis, we successfully stabilized the business by taking several immediate steps, including quickly closing offices and smoothly transitioning to a distributed work environment to protect the health and safety of our employees, which was and continues to be a top priority; working closely with travelers and supply partners to process the unprecedented level of travel changes and cancellations; and bolstering liquidity and preserving cash by halting stock buybacks, cutting nonessential costs, and raising over $4 billion in capital through a debt offering. Then we began the process and have almost entirely completed our work to optimize the business for the decrease in travel demand through the restructuring actions we have taken at each of our brands across the company. 
As a result of these actions, our 2020 year-end head count decreased approximately 23% versus 2019, primarily in volume-related positions. We expect these reductions to result in annualized cost savings of about $370 million in personnel expenses, with about $110 million of savings recognized in 2020. While our work is never done in terms of finding opportunities for cost efficiencies, we believe that head count reductions needed to optimize the business for the current demand environment are now generally behind us. Finally, we believe we have positioned the business well for when travel demand returns. 
We continue to make progress against our key strategic priorities during 2020, and this progress has continued as we have moved into 2021. We remain active in performance marketing channels and are being agile and adapting our approach to this very uncertain environment. And we will leverage our learnings over the past year to continue to capture demand in these performance channels at appropriate ROIs. In addition, our marketing team has been working hard to develop campaigns and messaging that we will deploy when we believe the time is right to encourage people to travel once again and use our services. 
As we think ahead about 2021, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the exact shape and timing of the recovery for travel. The rate of recovery will depend heavily on the rate of new COVID-19 cases, including new potentially more transmissible and more dangerous variants, and on the timing of effective and broad-based vaccine distribution, which we believe will be a key step in helping people feel safe to travel again. We are tracking early signs of encouraging summer booking trends in Western Europe, primarily the U.K. and Germany, relative to what we are seeing globally, although in each case, gross booking levels are still below where we were at the same point in time in 2019. 
While seeing green shoots of the summer booking season is positive, it's uncertain whether these trends will continue and whether we'll see this summer booking strength expand to other countries and regions, and of course whether these advanced bookings will turn into stayed room nights or will be canceled. What would be most helpful will be continued government action around the world to accelerate vaccine distribution while providing direct and indirect support to the entire travel and hospitality industry. 
Additionally, international travel remains depressed, and a recovery will not be possible until government restrictions on international travel are lifted or modified so travelers who can show they are safe travelers are allowed to travel freely. As you know, our international business has been a great advantage for us historically, and we expect it will be in the future, but we anticipate this to be a longer recovery. 
We know that people have a very strong desire to travel. We saw this firsthand in 2020 where we witnessed a strong improvement in our booking trends from the lows in April through the peak summer travel season, driven in part by pent-up demand as people came out of lockdowns. The travel that was booked last year was much more domestic oriented than in prior years as many people adapted to the restrictive travel environment and still found a way to take a trip. With many travel restrictions now in place around the world, we believe there is once again a high level of pent-up demand for travel. But when this demand will be fully unlocked is, of course, difficult to predict and will depend on vaccination rates and other factors.
While the timing of the pickup in travel demand is beyond our control, we are focused on the things we can control, primarily better positioning our business by continuing to invest and execute against our key strategic priorities, including expanding the payment platform at Booking.com, building out our connected trip capabilities, and growing our market share in the United States. Our integrated payment platform at Booking.com provides payment options favored by both travelers and our supplier partners across hotels, alternative accommodations, cars, flights and attractions. It is strategically important as it enables merchandising capabilities that we haven't had access to historically at Booking.com, but we expect to utilize selectively in the future to help drive growth. In addition, this payment platform is foundational for enabling our connected trip strategy. 
We continue to make progress expanding the payment platform with approximately 22% of Booking.com's gross bookings in 2020 processed on the platform. This is up from approximately 15% in 2019 and was less than 4% back in 2017, so this is a dramatic shift in our large scale business. We are optimistic about recent improvements in our Booking.com U.S. payment platform, which will enable increased utilization of payments in this critical market. We expect to see a higher percentage of Booking.com's gross bookings processed on the payment platform in 2021 as compared to 2020 and expect these increases to continue beyond 2021. 
Our connected trip vision is a multiproduct offering, including accommodations, flight, ground transportation and attractions and dining, connected by our seamless payment network and ultimately supported by personalized intelligence, to provide a frictionless experience for our bookers all the way from the initial booking to experiencing their trip. We're building towards this vision because we believe the connected trip will drive increased loyalty and frequency and will enhance the growth of our accommodation business through additional customer acquisition and merchandising opportunities. 
Developing a robust flight product at Booking.com remains an important strategic component of the connected trip, as it gives us the ability to engage with flight bookers early in their travel journey and allows us an opportunity to cross-sell our accommodation and other products to those bookers. In the coming years, we expect flights will represent an increasing mix of our overall business, which will help drive incremental revenue and EBITDA dollars. 
As mentioned in the past, growing our share of the U.S. travel market remains a key strategic priority for our company, as the U.S. is one of the largest travel markets in the world and we have historically under-indexed there. We are taking several steps to increase our competitiveness in the U.S. market and are focused on making sure we are offering great value to our customers, improving our payments platform to enable bundling and merchandising opportunities, increasing overall consumer awareness of our Booking.com through marketing, and expanding our alternative accommodations supply. While we have built a large and competitive alternative accommodations business globally, we believe we have a significant opportunity for improvement in the United States, which will involve product improvements, supply acquisition and raising consumer awareness of this type of inventory on booking.com. 
Continuing to invest and execute against these 3 strategic priorities as well as capturing demand as travel recovers will be our focus in 2021. We believe successful implementation of these priorities is key to achieving higher growth rates, increasing market share, and eventually building a larger business with higher earnings than we had prior to COVID. We expect this larger business to have a higher mix of merchant transactions and non-accommodation products, both of which will negatively impact our EBITDA margin rates, but we expect to continue to lead the travel industry in this metric.
Finally, I want to address the European Commission's initial proposal for the Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act released in December. The European Commission has proposed regulations aimed at keeping markets fair and open, which is an ambition that we support. However, at the present time, it is not known for certain what the ultimate rules will be, how they might be applied, or what the impact will be on us and other market participants. We are engaged with stakeholders to work towards regulations that tackle the legitimate problems of the large gatekeepers in the digital account, of which we believe we are not one. We'll update you in the area during future calls. 
In conclusion, there are still tough days ahead of us and everyone in the travel industry. COVID case counts remain high, and the wider global distribution of vaccines is still too slow. However, I am more confident than ever in our long-term future, and we will at some point see a strong recovery in travel demand. I further believe that our company is very well positioned to capture this demand as it comes back. In the meantime, we will focus on what we can control, namely, investing in our business and executing against our strategic priorities to ensure we exit this crisis on a strong footing, which will enable us to build a larger and faster-growing business for the long run.
I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden."

I'll review our operating results for the fourth quarter, provide some color on the trends we've seen so far in the first quarter, and then discuss our expectations for 2021 and our longer-term operating model. To avo",2944,"Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I'll review our operating results for the fourth quarter, provide some color on the trends we've seen so far in the first quarter, and then discuss our expectations for 2021 and our longer-term operating model. To avoid the comparison to the initial spread of the pandemic in 2020, all growth rates for 2020 and 2021 are relative to comparable periods in 2019, unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. 
Now on to the results for the fourth quarter. On our November earnings call, we discussed the trends we saw throughout the third quarter and into early November, including the year-on-year decline in reported room nights worsening from about 43% in the third quarter to about 58% in October, and then further deteriorating to about 70% over the 7 days leading up to our November earnings call, driven by rising COVID case counts and many European countries and governments beginning to respond with impositions of travel restrictions. As a reminder, reported room nights include the impact of cancellations. 
The worsening trends we saw in early November [improved a little bit], resulting in our reported room nights declining 60% for the fourth quarter. November proved to be the low point for the quarter. The decline in room night growth rates versus Q3 were driven by Europe, where growth rates declined quite considerably. 
Looking across the other regions, North America were similar to Q3, and Asia and the rest of world both improved compared to Q3. North America was the strongest region in Q4 with a significantly lower year-on-year decline in room nights than the other regions. 
Mobile bookings, particularly through our apps, continued to gain share in the fourth quarter and represented over 2/3 of our total room nights in Q4 and about 2/3 of 2020. We continue -- we also continue to see growth in 50% of our total room nights come to us through the direct channel. 
Domestic room nights represented about 85% of our reported room nights in Q4, up significantly versus 2019, which was just below 50%. And our cancellation rates continue to be up year-over-year in the fourth quarter and also increased versus Q3. 
We continue to monitor other changes in Booking.com's customer booking behavior. The mix of customers booking alternative accommodations in Q4 were slightly lower than Q4 2019, while the full year was up slightly versus 2019. The slight decline in the overall mix of alternative combinations in Q4 was due to the underperformance of the European region, which is where we have our highest mix of alternative accommodations. The mix of alternative accommodations continues to increase year-over-year within Europe in Q4. Booking.com alternative accommodations represented about 30% of its reported room nights for the full year 2020. 
The booking window contracted versus 2019 in the fourth quarter at about the same rate as we saw in the third quarter, as customers continued to focus mainly on their short-term travel needs. Gross bookings declined 65% in Q4, with a great decline in reported room nights due to the average daily rates for accommodations decreasing about 15% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. 
Consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.2 billion and decreased 63% year-over-year. As we expected, revenue in the quarter was less negatively impacted than gross bookings due to the fact that revenue benefited from check-ins in Q4 from bookings received in the relatively strong third quarter. Our full year revenue is also significantly less impacted than our gross bookings, driven by the differences in the timing between bookings and revenue which is recognized at check-in, primarily related to 2019 bookings that checked in in Q1 2020. 
As a result of these timing factors, our full year revenue as a percent of gross bookings was 19.2%, which is significantly higher than the 15.6% in 2019 and 2018. If our revenue as a percentage of gross bookings in 2020 had been in line with 2019, revenue would have been more than $1 billion lower for the full year. The difference between 15.6% and 19.2% is all entirely explained by this timing difference. 
The 63% reduction in revenue resulted in an adjusted EBITDA loss of $38 million in the fourth quarter. While we significantly reduced our variable expense lines like marketing, sales and other, our more fixed expenses decreased to a lesser extent in Q4. As Glenn mentioned, we've almost entirely completed our restructuring actions to reduce personnel expenses to align our cost structure with the new demand environments. The [sales] recognized in our personnel expense line related to these actions was about $70 million in Q4 and about $110 million for the full year. We recorded charges of $74 million and $149 million related to these actions in the restructuring and other exit costs line for Q4 and the full year, respectively. 
Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line, decreased 61% year-over-year as we saw a significant reduction in demand in the paid channels. In addition, we substantially reduced our brand marketing spend in response to the diminished travel demand environment. Sales and other expenses decreased 45% year-over-year, primarily due to reduction in expenses associated with payment transactions, partially offset by a mix shift in customer service to outsourced call centers. 
Personnel expenses decreased 13% year-over-year, primarily due to restructuring actions I mentioned previously. G&A expenses decreased 36% year-over-year largely driven by reduced discretionary spend in such areas as T&E, lower indirect taxes, and lower office expenses due to employees working remotely. Information technology expenses were up 1% year-over-year in the fourth quarter due to investments in software license fees related to cybersecurity and privacy software.
Finally, we've broken out restructuring charges separately in operating expenses in the P&L. And I note that these restructuring charges are included in our non-GAAP results. 
We recorded a non-GAAP net loss of $23 million in the quarter. Our full year non-GAAP tax rate of 42% was meaningfully higher than our 2019 tax rate of 19% due to the greater impact of nontax deductible expenses on a lower base of earnings as well as the geographical distribution of earnings and losses. Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was driven by a change in our full year tax provision following better-than-expected pretax results in the fourth quarter. 
On a GAAP basis, we had an operating loss of $153 million in Q4. We recorded a GAAP net loss of $165 million in the quarter as the benefit from an unrealized $553 million pretax gain on our equity investments, primarily related to our investment in Meituan, was offset by income tax expenses of $410 million, $98 million of interest expense, and $61 million of FX remeasurement losses on our eurobond. We excluded the unrealized gains and the related losses from our non-GAAP results. 
The $410 million of income tax expenses is primarily due to the discrete tax expense related to the Meituan unrealized gain and the change in our full year tax provision following better-than-expected results in the fourth quarter. Our full year GAAP tax rate of 90% was meaningfully higher than our 2019 tax rate of 18% due to reasons mentioned for our non-GAAP tax rate, with the nondeductible goodwill impairment charge driving additional significant impacts. 
Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q4 ending cash and investment balance decreased to $14.8 billion from our September ending balance of $14.9 million due to an operating cash outflow, largely offset by the unrealized gains on our long-term investments. We had a $557 million operating cash outflow in the quarter driven primarily by changes in working capital, which represented a use of cash of about $400 million in the quarter as well as the net loss recorded in the quarter. The change in working capital was driven by seasonal effects that were amplified by the slowdown in bookings from Q3. 
We will continue to focus on maintaining a strong liquidation position, given the high level of uncertainty created by the [COVID pandemic]. And consistent with our comments last quarter, we've halted repurchases of our stock, and we will not initiate repurchases until we have better visibility into the shape and timing of a recovery. 
Now on our thoughts for the first quarter. And to remind you, we'll make comparisons with 2019 unless otherwise indicated. There continues to be considerable uncertainty about the shape and timing of the recovery for travel, which means we're unable to provide detailed guidance at this time. January room night declines were slightly worse than Q4, driven by the increasing spread of COVID-19, including the new strains with associated additional travel restrictions. 
However, starting in the middle of January, we saw an improvement in room night declines driven by domestic travel bookings in most parts of the world. And we've seen this improvement continue into February. In recent weeks, some regions have improved back to positive domestic room night growth. 
While difficult to predict with accuracy, if the domestic room night trends continue to improve, Q1 room night declines could be a few percentage points better than Q4. To give you a snapshot of what we're seeing recently, room night declines over the last 7 days were about 50%. 
In Q1, the overall booking window has contracted versus 2019, although to a lesser extent than we saw in the fourth quarter. In Western Europe in January, we saw an expansion of the booking window versus 2019. And we've seen this expansion continue into February as the share of further-out bookings, including those for summer travel, has increased. 
As Glenn noted in Western Europe particularly in the U.K. and Germany, we have recently seen stronger summer booking trends relative to what we're seeing globally. And in these countries, gross bookings for summer period are within 25% of where they were at the same time in 2019. These stronger booking trends in Western Europe are currently being offset by weaker near-term booking trends in the region due to extensive travel restrictions. And we remind you that the significant majority of summer bookings are cancelable. 
We're also encouraged to see that some countries are making notable progress with vaccinations, including Israel, UAE and the U.K. We are confident that when vaccinations are broadly available and when travel restrictions are listed, people will return to travel. We saw this happen recently in Israel, where vaccination rates are the highest in the world. And after the national lockdown within Israel was eased on February 7, we quickly saw domestic bookings return to solid double-digit growth versus the same period in 2019.
Turning to the income statement. As I said, we expect Q1 room nights -- Q1 room night declines could be a few percentage points better than Q4. We expect Q1 gross bookings to decline a few percentage points more than room nights due to continued pressure on local currency ADRs. We expect Q1 revenue to decline slightly more than gross bookings, assuming bookings continue to improve for the rest of the quarter. 
We expect margins in Q1 will decline at the same level as gross bookings. We expect sales and other expenses in Q1 will be similar to what they were in Q4 on a dollar basis, with some variability based upon where Q1 volumes land. 
We expect personnel expenses in Q1 will be slightly higher than they were in Q4 on a dollar basis, primarily due to increased SBC expenses and seasonal increase in benefit costs, partially offset by a higher amount of savings in Q1 related to restructuring actions we've taken. We expect that almost the full run rate from our personnel restructurings will be realized in Q1. 
We expect G&A expenses in Q1 will be about the same as they were in Q4 on a dollar basis. We expect the IT expenses will be higher than they were in Q4 on a dollar basis, primarily due to increased investments in security, data privacy and some operational system enhancements. 
We currently estimate the remaining restructuring charge related to actions in Booking.com will be about $40 million. And we expect to record more than half of these remaining charges in the first quarter. About half of the $40 million relates to personnel-related actions, and the other half relates to real estate. 
Given what we just explained, and reminding you that Q1 is our seasonally lowest-revenue quarter, we expect to report a greater EBITDA loss in Q1 than in Q4. 
For the full year 2021, I want to briefly walk you through some factors that will impact our top line operating margins for the year. We expect the environment of travel to improve during 2021, but the shape and timing that recovery remains uncertain. We expect occupancy rates to remain below where they were pre-COVID, putting continued negative pressure on ADRs, which will result in our gross bookings being lower than our room nights. 
As I noted earlier, our revenue was less negatively impacted than our gross bookings in 2020 due to timing factors, which benefited our 2020 revenue by more than $1 billion. The opposite dynamic will happen when we experience an acceleration in volumes, which will lead to our gross bookings recurring faster than revenue. Said another way, if we see this acceleration in 2021, there'll be more bookings made in 2021 that will check in in 2022, than there were bookings made in 2020 that check in in 2021. This timing factor could have a meaningfully negative impact on our revenue as a percentage of gross bookings. So exactly how meaningful this impact will be depends upon how quickly our room nights and gross bookings accelerate in 2021. 
Due to these differences in the timing of bookings versus check-in, we also expect deleverage in our marketing expenses in 2021 as we incur the majority of our market expenses at the time of booking. The most significant expense items in sales and other are payment processing costs and outsourced customer service expenses. We expect sales and other to be lower in 2021 than in 2019, but the reduction will be smaller than the reduction in revenue. 
A few thoughts to help you think about our less variable expenses for 2021 and how they'll most likely compare with 2019. We expect G&A to be down double digits versus 2019 driven by T&E, office and occupancy expenses, with some variability from GST taxes if new ones are enacted during the year. 
Personnel expenses are likely to be quite similar to 2019 on a dollar basis. To help you understand this better, there are a few factors that contribute towards this. Our personnel expense run rate immediately before COVID hit was about $200 million higher than 2019 actual personnel expenses. Less than half of this was the annualization of people expense we added during 2019. And the rest was from people expense added into the business in the first quarter of 2020.  
Our restructuring actions will reduce head count expenses by approximately $370 million. So the impact of these 2 together will be to reduce personnel expenses by $170 million versus 2019. As we continue to invest in the business, we expect 2021 year-end head count to be a little higher at the end of 2020, with a mix shift towards pro and technical positions. This will add about $100 million in personnel expenses in 2021. 
And finally, SBC is expected to be higher than 2019 due to a few factors, including the modification of some stock awards in Q1 2021 and the issuance of stock options in 2020. Finally, IT expenses in 2021 will be higher than in 2019 due to investments in security, privacy and operational system enhancements to support our connected trip strategy. 
As we think beyond 2021, we're looking forward to being a larger business with more diverse offerings and with more earnings than we have prior to COVID. We're also focused on the potential for higher growth and market share. We continue to believe that it would be years and not quarters before travel returns to pre-COVID-19 levels. And when considering the shape of the business at that time, I'd like to draw attention to 2 factors. 
The first is a mix shift within the business. The continued growth of payments and the growth of flights and other connected verticals will add revenue and EBITDA, but at much lower margin rates than traditional accommodations. Payments will add to revenue with offsetting expenses in sales and other, plus some additional personnel and other expenses. Flights and other connected trip verticals will add to bookings and revenue, but at lower take rates than accommodations, and will also require added personnel and other expenses as the business scales. 
The second is personnel. The restructuring actions we took in 2020 were mainly in volume-related functions, including customer service and credit collection. This means that as volumes grow beyond the levels we expect in 2021, we'll need to add expenses back to business. As we've mentioned before, we'll look to do this in cost-efficient ways, but the work will come back. We think it's important to include this consideration when thinking about the future shape of the business. As Glenn said, we expect to continue to have industry-leading EBITDA margin rates, albeit most likely at levels below those in 2019. 
In conclusion, we remain focused on what we can control and continue to execute against our strategic priorities. We're now more confident than ever that through these actions, we will emerge this crisis in a stronger position. 
We'll now take your questions. And Grace, I'll turn it over to you to open the line for questions."

But the thing I'd really focus on is that change can also be good. We believe that we have some of the best marketing people in the world in terms of digital marketing. So when changes happen, we can make adjustments. We can make changes. We can do things faster and better. And we have so much data to test with that we believe we can actually come out of these things sometimes better off than we were in the past. 
So right now, there's nothing I can say in terms of impact or not, except I'd go so far as to say we've been adapting and changing.

So in regards to the home or alternative accommodations as we like to call it into Europe, I don't think we've talked much about regional exact share, and I'm not going to here. But I certainly -- we talked a little bit how Europe is our stronghold",523,"Sure. So in regards to the home or alternative accommodations as we like to call it into Europe, I don't think we've talked much about regional exact share, and I'm not going to here. But I certainly -- we talked a little bit how Europe is our stronghold in that area. We're better there in the home area than other areas. 
But throughout the world, I think I can say to you that we are better in things that are less single property. We always want to increase the single property because we know that's an area where we can improve. So that is an issue right now. 
And with the pandemic, there certainly was a bit of a shift for some people that they wanted to be isolated away from other people. So certainly, there was more demand than in the past for the single home area. That showed up much more in the U.S. for us say than Europe. Because Europe, we do have a greater amount of our home supply is the single property than say in the U.S. 
it's now an area we're going to continue to focus on, and I do believe right now in the environment there is that is a great product to have up on the shelf. That being said, in the future, we'll see how much that maintains or things go back more towards they used to be, where there's a different split between homes and hotels. 
In regard to your second question about relationship with hotel suppliers, obviously we're doing everything we can to help our partners. And that's come up with new ways to come up with promotions that they want to do, telling them when we think there are spots in demand that they can come up with [indiscernible] of closed user group prices that can help get them more demand. Coming out with ways they can put together things in content in terms of safety and health, so that a traveler who looks on our site and sees their hotel and sees that is a safe place to go to. all different things with them to try and improve their business. 
It's very difficult right now as you know, though, because let's face it, unless there's a demand. You can have the greatest content in the world, but people don't feel time to travel, they're not going to travel. But we're going to continue to do that. 
I do believe in terms of relationships, certainly as a distributor, when there is less demand, we are more valuable as a partner to them. In a time when there's very, very high occupancy rates, any hotel will say, ""Well, I don't need the distributor nearly as much."" But when they don't have as much occupancy rate, then they start looking for demand, and we have the benefit of being the largest platform for hotel demand in the world. So we are the place for them to come and get some more of that incremental demand, and we're continuing to work with them to make sure they do their best to get it."

And that's something that we're going to continue on because in the end, it costs an awful lot of money, as we know, to get a new customer. It's cheaper to keep them.

In regards to your second question, one of the things I mentioned was how uncertain the world is right now. And one of the things you're trying always to do is make sure you're spending money, but that's to create revenue. One of the issues is you pay the money upfront. A person books. But because so much of the business nowadays being done on things that are cancelable, you don't know when change happens, all of a sudden money you've spent, it doesn't end up and increase the revenue you thought it was, and your ROIs are very different. So we have to look at this very carefully, and we are approaching it in a cautious way.
On the other hand, we don't want to be slow to the increase in demand. And something we look at all the data very, very closely. That's about the best I can say is that that's how we're handling it right now. We can't say anything more than because we don't know what the future is going to be quite yet."

Pricing of course has been selling air tickets since the start of the company. It's more than 2 decades ago. So it's easier, when you add 2 more of our brand selling air tickets that hadn't done it in the past, to have a positive number. 
And I want to point out, this is very early and these are very, very, very small numbers. So it's pleasant to see, but I wouldn't say too much except that we are on our journey. 
In regards to attractions for Booking.com, yes these are coming from third-party suppliers. We are partnering with them. They give us the inventory, so we sell it and we have a commercial relationship. And we're pleased that's the way to go forward.

But let me kind of clarify where we are on payments and the evolution of payment at Booking.com. So as we said in the prepared remarks, the percentage of our gross bookings processed on the payment platform at Booking.com was 22% last year. That's up meaningfully from the 15% in 2019. And that still means that the vast majority of bookings are not being processed via our payment transaction. They're still in the agency model. So we expect that payment adoption to continue to increase above the 22% this year and beyond. 
Payments is really super important for us for a number of reasons. Because we think we can deliver benefits to our customers, our partners, across all the different channels, hotels, alternative accommodations, flights, attractions, et cetera. It's also very important to enable merchandising, which will use on a selective basis in certain markets. And it's also fundamental to enabling the connected trip where we want to have everything be able to be paid in one place. 
I'll give you an update on where we are from an income statement point of view relative to the evolution of payments. I'm pleased to say that payments on Booking.com was approximately breakeven in 2020. We've said in prior years, we are still making some net investment in the platform. And we focus upon still scaling it out, but I expect to stay in that breakeven level as we scale out and grow the payments platform from here, obviously, with some potential minor differences year in year out.

And secondly, you guys mentioned that you're trying to pick the single home supply in the U.S. How would you describe the strategy there? Mostly investing behind your own sales force, or is it through acquisitions?"

Because one of the things I believe why were -- we didn't have that healthy profit, as you pointed out, was perhaps because we didn't have as much of a mix of a single home property. Because a single home property does cost more for the company because you do end up with more contacts. It's just by nature not as professionally run, and you do end up with more costs. So we do though know that it's a product that people want, and we need to have it and we need to have more of it, and that's absolutely correct. 
The great thing about this though is there is a trend towards more professionalization of the single home property, where the person in the past made out onto our platform and just signed up on their own and try to orchestrate it all by themselves, what you are seeing in the industry is more and more people who want to rent out their single properties going to different people who will do it for them, who will handle all the elements of it. And those people who are running these kind of -- we won't call them channel managers, but they're like a channel in says they are able to bring these different single property owners in [indiscernible] of this site, that then is able to direct that to provide that supply to us or to somebody else. The great thing about it is these people are much more perpetual and they are more easy to deal with. They are able to understand the right things that you need to do. So because of that professionalization of the industry, I believe we will be able to pick up more of the single home properties faster than we had to in the past. 
In regards to M&A, as you know, we don't comment on future M&A activity."

[That's not may there]. Let me say what I really think is happening here. 
So people who perhaps in the past never would have thought of using alternative accommodations, perhaps last summer they didn't use it or they looked at it or something. And now it is in a consideration set. So going forward, what has happened is now there's a much larger amount of supply for adding travelers to look at. And what that means is any individual supplier in the marketplace is now facing more competition. As a distributor, I talked about a little earlier why that is beneficial to the distributor now. 
And our business, which is so great because we have both a great amount of the home products and alternative accommodations, and we're one of the largest people [indiscernible]. So we have this great thing where the consumer, when they come, they can come to one place us, and they're able to compare and contrast all different types.

So I am pleased with the way this is happening. And we'll go back, what will happen, how much will the mix be of home in the future versus hotel? I don't know. I don't think anybody can really guess. I think over many years, we've seen the trend going more and more people interested in alternative accommodations. The pandemic stepped function up higher. I don't know that's now going to be a pause. Maybe a dip down or continue upward, I don't know. But from my point of view, it's not that relevant in the sense that we provide both we're going to keep getting both. So for me, I'm feeling pretty good about it."

I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. Despite a travel environment that continues to be very challenging, we closed out 2020 by delivering fourth quarter results",1868,"Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' Fourth Quarter Conference Call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. 
Despite a travel environment that continues to be very challenging, we closed out 2020 by delivering fourth quarter results that were a bit better than the expectations we talked about on our last earnings call. David will provide the details on the fourth quarter results in his remarks. For my time, I will first briefly reflect on our execution during the extremely difficult year of 2020. Then I will share our thoughts and strategic priorities for 2021 and beyond. 
Without a doubt, 2020 presented the biggest disruption to modern global travel the world has ever seen, and our results for full year 2020 were down substantially from 2019. However, travelers still booked 355 million room nights through our platforms during 2020, and we remained profitable by generating approximately $880 million in adjusted EBITDA. Delivering these results during this unprecedented and unpredictable year is a credit to our team's relentless efforts to provide the best value and service to our traveler customers and to our supply partners, while all the time remaining incredibly focused on operating efficiently. 
When we spoke to you on our earnings call in May of 2020, we outlined a series of plans that would help us navigate through the COVID-19 crisis. First, we said we would stabilize the business from the immediate shock of the crisis. Second, we said we would optimize the business for the expected decrease in travel demand over the next few years. And third, we said we would position the business to be able to capture travel demand when it returns. Based on our accomplishments in 2020, I can confidently say that we executed well against these plans. 
In the beginning of the crisis, we successfully stabilized the business by taking several immediate steps, including quickly closing offices and smoothly transitioning to a distributed work environment to protect the health and safety of our employees, which was and continues to be a top priority; working closely with travelers and supply partners to process the unprecedented level of travel changes and cancellations; and bolstering liquidity and preserving cash by halting stock buybacks, cutting nonessential costs and raising over $4 billion in capital through a debt offering. Then we began the process and have almost entirely completed our work to optimize the business for the decrease in travel demand through the restructuring actions we have taken at each of our brands across the company. 
As a result of these actions, our 2020 year-end headcount decreased approximately 23% versus 2019, primarily in volume-related positions. We expect these reductions to result in annualized cost savings of about $370 million in personnel expenses, with about $110 million of savings recognized in 2020. While our work is never done in terms of finding opportunities for cost efficiencies, we believe that headcount reductions needed to optimize the business for the current demand environment are now generally behind us. 
Finally, we believe we have positioned the business well for when travel demand returns. We continue to make progress against our key strategic priorities during 2020, and this progress has continued as we have moved into 2021. We remain active in performance marketing channels and are being agile and adapting our approach to this very uncertain environment. And we will leverage our learnings over the past year to continue to capture demand in these performance channels at appropriate ROIs. In addition, our marketing team has been working hard to develop campaigns and messaging that we will deploy when we believe the time is right to encourage people to travel once again and use our services. 
As we think ahead about 2021, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the exact shape and timing of the recovery for travel. The rate of recovery will depend heavily on the rate of new COVID-19 cases, including new potentially more transmissible and more dangerous variants, and on the timing of effective and broad-based vaccine distribution, which we believe will be a key step in helping people feel safe to travel again. 
We are tracking early signs of encouraging summer booking trends in Western Europe, primarily the U.K. and Germany, relative to what we are seeing globally, although in each case, gross booking levels are still below where we were at the same point in time in 2019. While seeing green shoots of the summer booking season's positive, it's uncertain whether these trends will continue and whether we'll see this summer booking strength expand into other countries and regions, and of course, whether these advanced bookings will turn into stayed room nights or will be canceled. What would be most helpful would be continued government action around the world to accelerate vaccine distribution while providing direct and indirect support to the entire travel and hospitality industry. 
Additionally, international travel remains extremely depressed, and a recovery will not be possible until government restrictions on international travel are lifted or modified so travelers, who can show they are safe travelers, are allowed to travel freely. As you know, our international business has been a great advantage for us historically, and we expect it will be in the future, but we anticipate this to be a longer recovery. 
We know that people have a very strong desire to travel. We saw this firsthand in 2020 when we witnessed a strong improvement in our booking trends from the lows in April through the peak summer travel season, driven in part by pent-up demand as people came out of lockdowns. The travel that was booked last year was much more domestic-oriented than in prior years as many people adapted to the restrictive travel environment and still found a way to take a trip. With many travel restrictions now in place around the world, we believe there is once again a high level of pent-up demand for travel. But when this demand will be fully unlocked is, of course, difficult to predict and will depend on vaccination rates and other factors. 
While the timing of the pickup in travel demand is beyond our control, we are focused on the things we can control, primarily better positioning our business by continuing to invest and execute against our key strategic priorities, including expanding the payment platform at Booking.com, building out our connected trip capabilities and growing our market share in the United States. Our integrated payment platform at Booking.com provides payment options favored by both travelers and our supplier partners across hotels, alternative accommodations, cars, flights and attractions. It is strategically important as it enables merchandising capabilities that we haven't had access to historically at Booking.com, but we expect to utilize selectively in the future to help drive growth. In addition, this payment platform is foundational for enabling our connected trip strategy. 
We continue to make progress expanding the payment platform with approximately 22% of Booking.com's gross bookings in 2020 processed on the platform. This is up from approximately 15% in 2019 and was less than 4% back in 2017, so this is a dramatic shift in our large-scale business. We are optimistic about recent improvements in our Booking.com U.S. payment platform, which will enable increased utilization of payments in this critical market. We expect to see a higher percentage of Booking.com's gross bookings processed on the payment platform in 2021 as compared to 2020 and expect these increases to continue beyond 2021. 
Our connected trip vision is a multiproduct offering, including accommodations, flight, ground transportation and attractions and dining, connected by our seamless payment network and ultimately supported by personalized intelligence, to provide a frictionless experience for our bookers all the way from the initial booking to experiencing their trip. We're building towards this vision because we believe the connected trip will drive increased loyalty and frequency and will enhance the growth of our accommodation business through additional customer acquisition and merchandising opportunities. Developing a robust flight product at Booking.com remains an important strategic component of the connected trip, as it gives us the ability to engage with flight bookers early in their travel journey and allows us an opportunity to cross-sell our accommodation and other products to those bookers. In the coming years, we expect flights will represent an increasing mix of our overall business, which will help drive incremental revenue and EBITDA dollars. 
As mentioned in the past, growing our share of the U.S. travel market remains a key strategic priority for our company, as the U.S. is one of the largest travel markets in the world and we have historically underindexed there. We are taking several steps to increase our competitiveness in the U.S. market and are focused on making sure we are offering great value to our customers, improving our payments platform to enable bundling and merchandising opportunities, increasing overall consumer awareness of our Booking.com through marketing and expanding our alternative accommodations supply. While we have built a large and competitive alternative accommodations business globally, we believe we have a significant opportunity for improvement in the United States, which will involve product improvements, supply acquisition and raising consumer awareness of this type of inventory on Booking.com. 
Continuing to invest and execute against these 3 strategic priorities as well as capturing demand as travel recovers will be our focus in 2021. We believe successful implementation of these priorities is key to achieving higher growth rates, increasing market share, and eventually building a larger business with higher earnings than we had prior to COVID. We expect this larger business to have a higher mix of merchant transactions and non-accommodation products, both of which will negatively impact our EBITDA margin rates, but we expect it to continue to lead the travel industry in this metric. 
Finally, I want to address the European Commission's initial proposal for the Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act released in December. The European Commission has proposed regulations aimed at keeping markets fair and open, which is an ambition that we support. However, at the present time, it is not known for certain what the ultimate rules will be, how they might be applied or what the impact will be on us and other market participants. We are engaged with stakeholders to work towards regulations that tackle the legitimate problems of the large gatekeepers in the digital economy, of which we believe we are not one. We'll update you in the area during future calls. 
In conclusion, there are still tough days ahead of us and everyone in the travel industry. COVID case counts remain high, and the wider global distribution of vaccines is still too slow. However, I am more confident than ever in our long-term future, and we will at some point see a strong recovery in travel demand. I further believe that our company is very well positioned to capture this demand as it comes back. In the meantime, we will focus on what we can control, namely, investing in our business and executing against our strategic priorities to ensure we exit this crisis on a strong footing, which will enable us to build a larger and faster-growing business for the long run. 
I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden."

I'll review our operating results for the fourth quarter, provide some color on the trends we've seen so far in the first quarter and then discuss our expectations for 2021 and our longer-term operating model. To avoi",2956,"Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I'll review our operating results for the fourth quarter, provide some color on the trends we've seen so far in the first quarter and then discuss our expectations for 2021 and our longer-term operating model. To avoid the comparison to the initial spread of the pandemic in 2020, all growth rates for 2020 and 2021 are relative to comparable periods in 2019, unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. Now on to the results for the fourth quarter. 
On our November earnings call, we discussed the trends we saw throughout the third quarter and into early November, including the year-on-year decline in reported room nights worsening from about 43% in the third quarter to about 58% in October, and then further deteriorating to about 70% over the 7 days leading up to our November earnings call, driven by rising COVID case counts and many European countries and governments beginning to respond with impositions of travel restrictions. As a reminder, reported room nights include the impact of cancellations. 
The worsening trends we saw in early November improved a little, resulting in our reported room nights declining 60% for the fourth quarter. November proved to be the low point for the quarter. The decline in room night growth rates versus Q3 were driven by Europe, where growth rates declined quite considerably. Looking across the other regions, North America were similar to Q3. And Asia and the rest of world both improved compared to Q3. North America was the strongest region in Q4 with a significantly lower year-on-year decline in room nights than the other regions. 
Mobile bookings, particularly through our apps, continued to gain share in the fourth quarter and represented over 2/3 of our total room nights in Q4 and about 2/3 of 2020. We continue to -- we also continue to see growth in 50% of our total room nights come to us through the direct channel. 
Domestic room nights represented about 85% of our reported room nights in Q4, up significantly versus 2019, which was just below 50%. Our cancellation rates continue to be up year-over-year in the fourth quarter and also increased versus Q3. 
We continue to monitor other changes in Booking.com's customer booking behavior. The mix of customers booking alternative accommodations in Q4 were slightly lower than Q4 2019, while the full year was up slightly versus 2019. The slight decline in the overall mix of alternative accommodations in Q4 was due to the underperformance of the European region, which is where we have our highest mix of alternative accommodations. The mix of alternative accommodations continues to increase year-over-year within Europe in Q4. Booking.com's alternative accommodations represented about 30% of its reported room nights for the full year 2020. 
The booking window contracted versus 2019 in the fourth quarter at about the same rate as we saw in the third quarter, as customers continued to focus mainly on their short-term travel needs. Gross bookings declined 65% in Q4, which is a great decline in reported room nights due to the average daily rates for accommodations decreasing about 15% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. 
Consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.2 billion and decreased 63% year-over-year. As we expected, revenue in the quarter was less negatively impacted than gross bookings due to the fact that revenue benefited from check-ins in Q4 from bookings we received in the relatively strong third quarter. 
Our full year revenue is also significantly less impacted than our gross bookings, driven by the differences in the timing between bookings and revenue, which is recognized at check-in, primarily related to 2019 bookings that checked in, in Q1 2020. As a result of these timing factors, our full year revenue as a percent of gross bookings was 19.2%, which is significantly higher than the 15.6% in 2019 and 2018. If our revenue as a percentage of gross bookings in 2020 had been in line with 2019, revenue would have been more than $1 billion lower for the full year. The difference between 15.6% and 19.2% is all entirely explained by this timing difference. 
The 63% reduction in revenue resulted in an adjusted EBITDA loss of $38 million in the fourth quarter. While we significantly reduced our variable expense lines like marketing, sales and other, our more fixed expenses decreased to a lesser extent in Q4. As Glenn mentioned, we've almost entirely completed our restructuring actions to reduce personnel expenses to align our cost structure with the new demand environments. The [ statements ] recognized in our personnel expense line related to these actions was about $70 million in Q4 and about $110 million for the full year. We recorded charges of $74 million and $149 million related to these actions in the restructuring and other exit costs line for Q4 and the full year, respectively. 
Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line, decreased 61% year-over-year as we saw a significant reduction in demand in the paid channels. In addition, we substantially reduced our brand marketing spend in response to the diminished travel demand environment. Sales and other expenses decreased 45% year-over-year, primarily due to reduction in expenses associated with payment transactions, partially offset by a mix shift in customer service to outsourced call centers. 
Personnel expenses decreased 13% year-over-year, primarily due to restructuring actions I mentioned previously. G&A expenses decreased 36% year-over-year largely driven by reduced discretionary spend in such areas as T&E, lower indirect taxes and lower office expenses due to employees working remotely. Information technology expenses were up 1% year-over-year in the fourth quarter due to investments in software license fees related to cybersecurity and privacy software. 
Finally, we've broken out restructuring charges separately in operating expenses in the P&L. And I note that these restructuring charges are included in our non-GAAP results. 
We recorded a non-GAAP net loss of $23 million in the quarter. Our full year non-GAAP tax rate of 42% was meaningfully higher than our 2019 tax rate of 19% due to the greater impact of nontax deductible expenses on a lower base of earnings as well as the geographical distribution of earnings and losses. Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was driven by a change in our full year tax provision following better-than-expected pretax results in the fourth quarter. 
On a GAAP basis, we had an operating loss of $153 million in Q4. We recorded a GAAP net loss of $165 million in the quarter as the benefit from an unrealized $553 million pretax gain on our equity investments, primarily related to our investment in Meituan, was offset by income tax expenses of $410 million, $98 million of interest expense, and $61 million of FX remeasurement losses on our Eurobond. We excluded the unrealized gains and the related losses from our non-GAAP results. 
The $410 million of income tax expenses is primarily due to the discrete tax expense related to the Meituan unrealized gain and the change in our full year tax provision following better-than-expected results in the fourth quarter. Our full year GAAP tax rate of 90% was meaningfully higher than our 2019 tax rate of 18% due to reasons mentioned for our non-GAAP tax rate, with the nondeductible goodwill impairment charge driving additional significant impacts. 
Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q4 ending cash and investment balance decreased to $14.8 billion from our September ending balance of $14.9 million due to an operating cash outflow, largely offset by the unrealized gains on our long-term investments. We had a $557 million operating cash outflow in the quarter driven primarily by changes in working capital, which represented a use of cash of about $400 million in the quarter as well as the net loss recorded in the quarter. The change in working capital driven by seasonal effects that were amplified by the slowdown in bookings from Q3. 
We will continue to focus on maintaining a strong liquidity position, given the high level of uncertainty created by the COVID pandemic. And consistent with our comments last quarter, we've halted repurchases of our stock, and we will not initiate repurchases until we have better visibility into the shape and timing of a recovery. 
Now onto our thoughts for the first quarter. And to remind you, we'll make comparisons with 2019 unless otherwise indicated. There continues to be considerable uncertainty about the shape and timing of the recovery for travel, which means we're unable to provide detailed guidance at this time. January room night declines were slightly worse than Q4, driven by the increasing spread of COVID-19, including the new strains with associated additional travel restrictions. However, starting in the middle of January, we saw an improvement in room night declines driven by domestic travel bookings in most parts of the world. And we've seen this improvement continue into February. In recent weeks, some regions have improved back to positive domestic room night growth. While difficult to predict with accuracy, if the domestic room night trends continue to improve, Q1 room night declines could be a few percentage points better than Q4. To give you a snapshot of what we're seeing recently, room night declines over the last 7 days were about 50%. 
In Q1, the overall booking window has contracted versus 2019, although to a lesser extent than we saw in the fourth quarter. In Western Europe, in January, we saw an expansion of the booking window versus 2019. And we've seen this expansion continue into February as the share of further out bookings, including those for summer travel, has increased. As Glenn noted in Western Europe, particularly in the U.K. and Germany, we have recently seen stronger summer booking trends relative to what we're seeing globally. And in these countries, gross bookings for summer period are within 25% of where they were at the same time in 2019. These stronger booking trends in Western Europe are currently being offset by weaker near-term booking trends in the region due to extensive travel restrictions. And we remind you that the significant majority of the summer bookings are cancelable. 
We're also encouraged to see that some countries are making notable progress with vaccinations, including Israel, UAE and the U.K. We are confident that when vaccinations are broadly available and when travel restrictions are lifted, people will return to travel. We saw this happen recently in Israel, where vaccination rates are the highest in the world. And after the national lockdown within Israel was eased on February 7, we quickly saw domestic bookings return to solid double-digit growth versus the same period in 2019. 
Turning to the income statement. As I said, we expect Q1 room nights -- Q1 room night declines could be a few percentage points better than Q4. We expect Q1 gross bookings to decline a few percentage points more than room nights due to continued pressure on local currency ADRs. We expect Q1 revenue to decline slightly more than gross bookings, assuming bookings continue to improve for the rest of the quarter. 
We expect margin expense in Q1 will decline at the same level as gross bookings. We expect sales and other expenses in Q1 will be similar to what they were in Q4 on a dollar basis, with some variability based upon where Q1 volumes land. 
We expect personnel expenses in Q1 will be slightly higher than they were in Q4 on a dollar basis, primarily due to increased SBC expenses and seasonal increase in benefit costs, partially offset by a higher amount of savings in Q1 related to restructuring actions we've taken. We expect that almost the full run rate from our personnel restructurings will be realized in Q1. 
We expect G&A expenses in Q1 will be about the same as they were in Q4 on a dollar basis. We expect the IT expenses will be higher than they were in Q4 on a dollar basis, primarily due to increased investments in security, data privacy and some operational system enhancements. We currently estimate the remaining restructuring charge related to actions in Booking.com will be about $40 million. And we expect to record more than half of these remaining charges in the first quarter. About half of the $40 million relates to personnel-related actions, and the other half relates to real estate. Given what we just explained, and reminding you that Q1 is our seasonally lowest-revenue quarter, we expect to report a greater EBITDA loss in Q1 than in Q4. 
For the full year 2021, I want to briefly walk you through some factors that we expect will impact our top line operating margins for the year. We expect the environment of travel to improve in -- during 2021, but the shape and timing of that recovery remains uncertain. We expect occupancy rates to remain below where they were pre-COVID, putting continued negative pressure on ADRs, which will result in our gross bookings being lower than our room nights. 
As I noted earlier, our revenue was less negatively impacted than our gross bookings in 2020 due to timing factors, which benefited our 2020 revenue by more than $1 billion. The opposite dynamic will happen when we experience an acceleration in volumes, which will lead to our gross bookings recurring faster than revenue. Said another way, if we see this acceleration in 2021, there will be more bookings made in 2021 that will check in, in 2022, than there were bookings made in 2020 that checked in, in 2021. This timing factor could have a meaningfully negative impact on our revenue as a percentage of gross bookings. So exactly how meaningful this impact will be depends upon how quickly our room nights and gross bookings accelerate in 2021. 
Due to these differences in the timing of bookings versus check-in, we also expect deleverage in our marketing expenses in 2021 as we incur the majority of our market expenses at the time of booking. The most significant expense items in sales and other are payment processing costs and outsourced customer service expenses. We expect sales and other to be lower in 2021 than in 2019, but the reduction will be smaller than the reduction in revenue. 
A few comments to help you think about our less variable expenses for 2021 and how they'll most likely compare with 2019. We expect G&A to be down double digits versus 2019 driven by T&E, office and occupancy expenses, with some variability from DST taxes if new ones are enacted during the year. 
Personnel expenses are likely to be quite similar to 2019 on a dollar basis. To help you understand this better, there are a few factors that contribute towards this. Our personnel expense run rate immediately before COVID hit was about $200 million higher than 2019 actual personnel expenses. Less than half of this was the annualization of people expense we added during 2019. And the rest was from people expense added into the business in the first quarter of 2020. 
Our restructuring actions will reduce headcount expenses by approximately $370 million. So the impact of these 2 together will be to reduce personnel expenses by $170 million versus 2019. As we continue to invest in the business, we expect 2021 year-end headcount to be a little higher than at the end of 2020, with a mix shift towards pro and technical positions. This will add about $100 million in personnel expenses in 2021. 
And finally, SBC is expected to be higher than 2019 due to a few factors, including the modification of some stock awards in Q1 2021 and the issuance of stock options in 2020. Finally, IT expenses in 2021 will be higher than in 2019 due to investments in security, privacy and operational system enhancements to support our connected trip strategy. 
As we think beyond 2021, we're looking forward to being a larger business with more diverse offerings and with more earnings than we have prior to COVID. We're also focused on the potential for higher growth and market share. We continue to believe that it would be years and not quarters before travel returns to pre-COVID-19 levels. And when considering the shape of the business at that time, I'd like to draw your attention to 2 factors. 
The first is a mix shift within the business. The continued growth of payments and the growth of flights and other connected verticals will add revenue and EBITDA, but at much lower margin rates than traditional accommodations. Payments will add to revenue with offsetting expenses in sales and other, plus some additional personnel and other expenses. Flights and other connected trip verticals will add to bookings and revenue, but at lower take rates than accommodations, and will also require added personnel and other expenses as this business scales. 
The second is personnel. The restructuring actions we took in 2020 were mainly in volume-related functions, including customer service and credit collection. This means that as volumes grow beyond the levels we expect in 2021, we'll need to add expenses back to business. As we've mentioned before, we'll look to do this in cost-efficient ways, but the work will come back. 
We think it's important to include these considerations when thinking about the future shape of the business. As Glenn said, we expect to continue to have industry-leading EBITDA margin rates, albeit most likely at levels below those in 2019. 
In conclusion, we remain focused on what we can control and continue to execute against our strategic priorities. We're now more confident than ever that through these actions, we will emerge in this crisis in a stronger position. 
We'll now take your questions. And Grace, I'll turn it over to you to open the line for questions."

As they come back, we will look at more efficient ways of getting that work done. The work will come back. It won't come back this year. We basically rightsized ourselves through what we think will be through 2021. But as volumes extend beyond what we think 2021 is likely to bring, those costs will come back. So we will look at more efficient ways to do some of those variable activities in terms of location, technology, what we do inside or where we deploy more partner resources, et cetera. 
And we also, Lloyd, continue to look at how we can drive efficiency in our fixed costs part of the business. That's not been the major focus for the last 12 months. The major focus has been surviving COVID. I think we've done a good job with that. But we do continue to kind of look at our costs across our personnel base, across our real estate, across our technology portfolios, across things like procurement, where we can continue to drive efficiencies within the business. So when we get to a more normalized environment, that's something else we can also take a look at driving as well.

So in regards to the home or alternative accommodations as we like to call it into Europe, I don't think we've talked much about regional exact share, and I'm not going to here.

So in regards to the home or alternative accommodations as we like to call it into Europe, I don't think we've talked much about regional exact share, and I'm not going to here. But I certainly -- we talked a little bit how Europe is our stronghold in that area. We're better there in the home area than other areas. 
But throughout the world, I think I can say to you that we are better in things that are less single property. We always want to increase the single property because we know that's an area where we can improve upon. So that is an issue right now. And with the pandemic, there certainly was a bit of a shift, for some people, that they wanted to be isolated away from other people. So certainly, there was more demand than in the past for the single-home area. That showed up much more in the U.S. for us, say, than Europe. Because Europe, we do have -- a greater amount of our home supply is the single property than, say, in the U.S. 
Look, it's an area we're going to continue to focus on, and I do believe right now in the environment there is that is a great product to have up on the shelf. That being said, in the future, we'll see how much that maintains or things go back more towards they used to be, where there's a different split between homes and hotels. 
In regard to your second question about relationship with hotel suppliers, obviously, we're doing everything we can to help our partners. And that's coming up with new ways to -- come up with promotions that they want to do. Telling them when we think there are spots in demand that they can come up with different types of closed user group prices that can help get them more demand. Coming out with ways that they can put together things in content in terms of safety and health, so that a traveler who looks on our site and sees their hotel and sees that it's a safe place to go. Do all different things with them to try and improve their business. 
It's very difficult right now as you know, though, because let's face it, unless there's [ sheer ] demand, that you can have the greatest content in the world, but people don't feel it's time to travel, they're not going to travel. But we're going to continue to do that. 
I do believe in terms of relationships, certainly as a distributor, when there is less demand, we are more valuable as a partner to them. In the time when there's very, very high occupancy rates, any hotel will say, ""Well, I don't need the distributor nearly as much."" But when they don't have as much occupancy rate, then they start looking for demand, and we have the benefit of being the largest platform for hotel demand in the world. So we are the place for them to come and get some more of that incremental demand, and we're continuing to work with them to make sure they do their best to get it."

So we have to look at this very carefully, and we are approaching it in a cautious way.
But on the other hand, we don't want to be slow to the increase in demand. It's something -- we look at all the data very, very closely. That's about the best I can say is that, that's how we're handling it right now. We can't say anything more than that because we don't know what the future is going to be quite yet."

Another thing that we continue to build out in our attractions area, not a lot of people are actually buying attractions right now. But we haven't stopped getting more and more places and more and more content, so that when people do come back, they'll have attractions they can buy from us. And what they obviously would see would be the way we're combining this, putting things together and the way we're trying to create value for our consumers. 
So I think that's part of it, and we're really still in the very, very early parts of this journey. But it's something that is pretty exciting to me as I begin to see it build out and seeing those people are buying flights and such. 
In regards to the subscriptions model that people are beginning to explore and such, I don't really have a lot of comments on that. It's something that different people are doing and such. We'll see how it plays out.

But yes, we were pleased to see that positive number there. One of the things to point is as I just talked about a little bit, though, in the past, we didn't have air tickets coming from Booking.com and from -- and also, by the way, our Agoda brand also sells air tickets, too. Priceline, of course, has been selling air tickets since the start of the company. It's more than 2 decades ago. So it's easier when you add 2 more of our brand selling air tickets that hadn't done it in the past to have a positive number. 
And I want to point out, this is very early and these are very, very, very small numbers. So it's pleasant to see, but I wouldn't [ say ] too much except that we are on our journey. 
In regards to attractions for Booking.com, so it's yes, these are coming from third-party suppliers. We are partnering with them. They give us the inventory, so we sell it. We have a commercial relationship. And we're pleased. That's the way to go forward. Again, one can be anything or -- and you need to decide which ones you want to do first, but it's a lot -- you can't be everything. So it's a lot easier when you want to do a lot more things to partner with other people for things -- for people who already set up the things you need to get, so I'm pretty pleased about that. Again, I'll be even more pleased when people actually are back to traveling and start buying attractions more. 
And David, I don't know if I missed anything on the air ticket -- air stuff."

And then as volume comes back, we need to bring people in to help cover it, but hopefully in a much more efficient way over time. So that thing.
In terms of being a hyper start-up, yes, we're -- look, we're always going incredibly hard in it and trying to get as much progress as we can on our strategic vision because we know that the travelers are going to come back, and we want to get ahead of that as fast as we can, so we can give them the greatest value and the greatest -- different types -- a way to travel as soon as we can.

But let me kind of clarify where we are on payments and the evolution of payment at Booking.com. So as we said in the prepared remarks, the percentage of our gross bookings processed on the payment platform at Booking.com was 22% last year. That's up meaningfully from the 15% in 2019. That still means that the vast majority of bookings are not being processed via our payment transaction, they're still in the agency model. So we expect that payment adoption to continue to increase above the 22% this year and beyond. 
Payments is really super important for us for a number of reasons because we think we can deliver benefits to our customers, our partners, across all the different channels, hotels, alternative accommodations, flights, attractions, et cetera. It's also very important to enable merchandising, which will use on a selective basis in certain markets. And it's also fundamental to enabling the connected trip where we want to have everything be -- able to be paid in one place. 
I'll give you an update on where we are from an income statement point of view relative to the evolution of payments. I'm pleased to say that payments on Booking.com was approximately breakeven in 2020. We've said it in prior years, we are still making some net investment in the platform. And we focus upon still scaling it out, but I expect to stay in that breakeven level as we scale out and grow the payments platform from here, obviously, with some potential minor differences year in, year out. We are now [ out of the ] breakeven situation on that payment platform, which is an update from where we were before."

Because a single-home property does cost more for the company because you do end up with more contacts. It's just by nature. It's not as professionally run, and you do end up with more costs. So we do, though, know that it's a product that people want, and we need to have it and we need to have more of it and that's absolutely correct. 
The great thing about this though is there is a trend towards more professionalization of the single-home property, where the person in the past may have gone onto a platform and just signed up on their own and tried to orchestrate it all by themselves. What you are seeing in the industry is more and more people, who want to rent out their single properties, going to different people who will do it for them, who will handle all the elements of it. And those people who are running these kind of -- we won't call them channel managers, but they're like a channel manager in a sense they are able to bring these different, single-property owners and put them onto this site, that then is able to direct that -- to provide that supply to us or to somebody else. The great thing about it is these people are much more professional, and they are more easy to deal with. They are able to understand the right things that you need to do. So because of that professionalization of the industry, I believe we will be able to pick up more of the single-home properties faster than we had to in the past.

So people who perhaps in the past never would have thought of using alternative accommodations, perhaps last summer they didn't use it or they looked at it or something. And now it is in a consideration set. So going forward, what has happened is now there's a much larger amount of supply for any travelers to go look at. And what that means is any individual supplier in the marketplace is now facing more competition. Now as a distributor, I talked about it a little earlier why that is beneficial to the distributor now. 
And our business, which is so great because we have both, a great amount of the home product, that alternative accommodations, and we're one of the largest people [ at the ] hotels. So we have this great thing where the consumer, when they come, they can come to one place, us. And they're able to compare and contrast all the different types, all the different prices, understand all the different comments and reviews being left by people who previously stayed there. That gives us a great, great benefit. 
So I am pleased with the way this is happening. And I -- will it go back? What will happen? How much will be -- mix be of home in the future versus hotel? I don't know. I don't think anybody can really guess. I think over many years, we've seen the trend going more and more people interested in alternative accommodations. The pandemic [ stepped function ] up higher. I don't know if that's now going to be a pause, maybe a dip down or continue upward. I don't know.

Delivering these results during this unprecedented and unpredictable year is a credit to our team's relentless efforts to provide the best value and service to our traveler customers and to our supply partners, while all the time remaining incredibly focused on operating efficiently. 
When we spoke to you on our earnings call in May of 2020, we outlined a series of plans that would help us navigate through the COVID-19 crisis. First, we said we would stabilize the business from the immediate shock of the crisis. Second, we said we would optimize the business for the expected decrease in travel demand over the next few years. And third, we said we would position the business to be able to capture travel demand when it returns. Based on our accomplishments in 2020, I can confidently say that we executed well against these plans. 
In the beginning of the crisis, we successfully stabilized the business by taking several immediate steps, including quickly closing offices and smoothly transitioning to a distributed work environment to protect the health and safety of our employees, which was and continues to be a top priority; working closely with travelers and supply partners to process the unprecedented level of travel changes and cancellations; and bolstering liquidity and preserving cash by halting stock buybacks, cutting nonessential costs and raising over $4 billion in capital through a debt offering. Then we began the process and have almost entirely completed our work to optimize the business for the decrease in travel demand through the restructuring actions we have taken at each of our brands across the company. 
As a result of these actions, our 2020 year-end headcount decreased approximately 23% versus 2019, primarily in volume-related positions. We expect these reductions to result in annualized cost savings of about $370 million in personnel expenses, with about $110 million of savings recognized in 2020. While our work is never done in terms of finding opportunities for cost efficiencies, we believe that headcount reductions needed to optimize the business for the current demand environment are now generally behind us. 
Finally, we believe we have positioned the business well for when travel demand returns. We continue to make progress against our key strategic priorities during 2020, and this progress has continued as we have moved into 2021. We remain active in performance marketing channels and are being agile and adapting our approach to this very uncertain environment. And we will leverage our learnings over the past year to continue to capture demand in these performance channels at appropriate ROIs. In addition, our marketing team has been working hard to develop campaigns and messaging that we will deploy when we believe the time is right to encourage people to travel once again and use our services. 
As we think ahead about 2021, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the exact shape and timing of the recovery for travel. The rate of recovery will depend heavily on the rate of new COVID-19 cases, including new potentially more transmissible and more dangerous variants, and on the timing of effective and broad-based vaccine distribution, which we believe will be a key step in helping people feel safe to travel again. 
We are tracking early signs of encouraging summer booking trends in Western Europe, primarily the U.K. and Germany, relative to what we are seeing globally, although in each case, gross booking levels are still below where we were at the same point in time in 2019. While seeing green shoots of the summer booking season's positive, it's uncertain whether these trends will continue and whether we'll see this summer booking strength expand into other countries and regions, and of course, whether these advanced bookings will turn into stayed room nights or will be canceled. What would be most helpful would be continued government action around the world to accelerate vaccine distribution while providing direct and indirect support to the entire travel and hospitality industry. 
Additionally, international travel remains extremely depressed, and a recovery will not be possible until government restrictions on international travel are lifted or modified so travelers, who can show they are safe travelers, are allowed to travel freely. As you know, our international business has been a great advantage for us historically, and we expect it will be in the future, but we anticipate this to be a longer recovery. 
We know that people have a very strong desire to travel. We saw this firsthand in 2020 when we witnessed a strong improvement in our booking trends from the lows in April through the peak summer travel season, driven in part by pent-up demand as people came out of lockdowns. The travel that was booked last year was much more domestic-oriented than in prior years as many people adapted to the restrictive travel environment and still found a way to take a trip. With many travel restrictions now in place around the world, we believe there is once again a high level of pent-up demand for travel. But when this demand will be fully unlocked is, of course, difficult to predict and will depend on vaccination rates and other factors. 
While the timing of the pickup in travel demand is beyond our control, we are focused on the things we can control, primarily better positioning our business by continuing to invest and execute against our key strategic priorities, including expanding the payment platform at Booking.com, building out our connected trip capabilities and growing our market share in the United States. Our integrated payment platform at Booking.com provides payment options favored by both travelers and our supplier partners across hotels, alternative accommodations, cars, flights and attractions. It is strategically important as it enables merchandising capabilities that we haven't had access to historically at Booking.com, but we expect to utilize selectively in the future to help drive growth. In addition, this payment platform is foundational for enabling our connected trip strategy. 
We continue to make progress expanding the payment platform with approximately 22% of Booking.com's gross bookings in 2020 processed on the platform. This is up from approximately 15% in 2019 and was less than 4% back in 2017, so this is a dramatic shift in our large-scale business. We are optimistic about recent improvements in our Booking.com U.S. payment platform, which will enable increased utilization of payments in this critical market. We expect to see a higher percentage of Booking.com's gross bookings processed on the payment platform in 2021 as compared to 2020 and expect these increases to continue beyond 2021. 
Our connected trip vision is a multiproduct offering, including accommodations, flight, ground transportation and attractions and dining, connected by our seamless payment network and ultimately supported by personalized intelligence, to provide a frictionless experience for our bookers all the way from the initial booking to experiencing their trip. We're building towards this vision because we believe the connected trip will drive increased loyalty and frequency and will enhance the growth of our accommodation business through additional customer acquisition and merchandising opportunities. Developing a robust flight product at Booking.com remains an important strategic component of the connected trip, as it gives us the ability to engage with flight bookers early in their travel journey and allows us an opportunity to cross-sell our accommodation and other products to those bookers. In the coming years, we expect flights will represent an increasing mix of our overall business, which will help drive incremental revenue and EBITDA dollars. 
As mentioned in the past, growing our share of the U.S. travel market remains a key strategic priority for our company, as the U.S. is one of the largest travel markets in the world and we have historically underindexed there. We are taking several steps to increase our competitiveness in the U.S. market and are focused on making sure we are offering great value to our customers, improving our payments platform to enable bundling and merchandising opportunities, increasing overall consumer awareness of our Booking.com through marketing and expanding our alternative accommodations supply. While we have built a large and competitive alternative accommodations business globally, we believe we have a significant opportunity for improvement in the United States, which will involve product improvements, supply acquisition and raising consumer awareness of this type of inventory on Booking.com. 
Continuing to invest and execute against these 3 strategic priorities as well as capturing demand as travel recovers will be our focus in 2021. We believe successful implementation of these priorities is key to achieving higher growth rates, increasing market share, and eventually building a larger business with higher earnings than we had prior to COVID. We expect this larger business to have a higher mix of merchant transactions and non-accommodation products, both of which will negatively impact our EBITDA margin rates, but we expect it to continue to lead the travel industry in this metric. 
Finally, I want to address the European Commission's initial proposal for the Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act released in December. The European Commission has proposed regulations aimed at keeping markets fair and open, which is an ambition that we support. However, at the present time, it is not known for certain what the ultimate rules will be, how they might be applied or what the impact will be on us and other market participants. We are engaged with stakeholders to work towards regulations that tackle the legitimate problems of the large gatekeepers in the digital economy, of which we believe we are not one. We'll update you in the area during future calls. 
In conclusion, there are still tough days ahead of us and everyone in the travel industry. COVID case counts remain high, and the wider global distribution of vaccines is still too slow. However, I am more confident than ever in our long-term future, and we will at some point see a strong recovery in travel demand. I further believe that our company is very well positioned to capture this demand as it comes back. In the meantime, we will focus on what we can control, namely, investing in our business and executing against our strategic priorities to ensure we exit this crisis on a strong footing, which will enable us to build a larger and faster-growing business for the long run. 
I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden."

I'll review our operating results for the fourth quarter, provide some color on the trends we've seen so far in the first quarter and then discuss our expectations for 2021 and our longer-term operating model. To avoi",2956,"Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I'll review our operating results for the fourth quarter, provide some color on the trends we've seen so far in the first quarter and then discuss our expectations for 2021 and our longer-term operating model. To avoid the comparison to the initial spread of the pandemic in 2020, all growth rates for 2020 and 2021 are relative to comparable periods in 2019, unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. Now on to the results for the fourth quarter. 
On our November earnings call, we discussed the trends we saw throughout the third quarter and into early November, including the year-on-year decline in reported room nights worsening from about 43% in the third quarter to about 58% in October, and then further deteriorating to about 70% over the 7 days leading up to our November earnings call, driven by rising COVID case counts and many European countries and governments beginning to respond with impositions of travel restrictions. As a reminder, reported room nights include the impact of cancellations. 
The worsening trends we saw in early November improved a little, resulting in our reported room nights declining 60% for the fourth quarter. November proved to be the low point for the quarter. The decline in room night growth rates versus Q3 were driven by Europe, where growth rates declined quite considerably. Looking across the other regions, North America were similar to Q3. And Asia and the rest of world both improved compared to Q3. North America was the strongest region in Q4 with a significantly lower year-on-year decline in room nights than the other regions. 
Mobile bookings, particularly through our apps, continued to gain share in the fourth quarter and represented over 2/3 of our total room nights in Q4 and about 2/3 of 2020. We continue to -- we also continue to see growth in 50% of our total room nights come to us through the direct channel. 
Domestic room nights represented about 85% of our reported room nights in Q4, up significantly versus 2019, which was just below 50%. Our cancellation rates continue to be up year-over-year in the fourth quarter and also increased versus Q3. 
We continue to monitor other changes in Booking.com's customer booking behavior. The mix of customers booking alternative accommodations in Q4 were slightly lower than Q4 2019, while the full year was up slightly versus 2019. The slight decline in the overall mix of alternative accommodations in Q4 was due to the underperformance of the European region, which is where we have our highest mix of alternative accommodations. The mix of alternative accommodations continues to increase year-over-year within Europe in Q4. Booking.com's alternative accommodations represented about 30% of its reported room nights for the full year 2020. 
The booking window contracted versus 2019 in the fourth quarter at about the same rate as we saw in the third quarter, as customers continued to focus mainly on their short-term travel needs. Gross bookings declined 65% in Q4, which is a great decline in reported room nights due to the average daily rates for accommodations decreasing about 15% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. 
Consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.2 billion and decreased 63% year-over-year. As we expected, revenue in the quarter was less negatively impacted than gross bookings due to the fact that revenue benefited from check-ins in Q4 from bookings we received in the relatively strong third quarter. 
Our full year revenue is also significantly less impacted than our gross bookings, driven by the differences in the timing between bookings and revenue, which is recognized at check-in, primarily related to 2019 bookings that checked in, in Q1 2020. As a result of these timing factors, our full year revenue as a percent of gross bookings was 19.2%, which is significantly higher than the 15.6% in 2019 and 2018. If our revenue as a percentage of gross bookings in 2020 had been in line with 2019, revenue would have been more than $1 billion lower for the full year. The difference between 15.6% and 19.2% is all entirely explained by this timing difference. 
The 63% reduction in revenue resulted in an adjusted EBITDA loss of $38 million in the fourth quarter. While we significantly reduced our variable expense lines like marketing, sales and other, our more fixed expenses decreased to a lesser extent in Q4. As Glenn mentioned, we've almost entirely completed our restructuring actions to reduce personnel expenses to align our cost structure with the new demand environments. The [ statements ] recognized in our personnel expense line related to these actions was about $70 million in Q4 and about $110 million for the full year. We recorded charges of $74 million and $149 million related to these actions in the restructuring and other exit costs line for Q4 and the full year, respectively. 
Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line, decreased 61% year-over-year as we saw a significant reduction in demand in the paid channels. In addition, we substantially reduced our brand marketing spend in response to the diminished travel demand environment. Sales and other expenses decreased 45% year-over-year, primarily due to reduction in expenses associated with payment transactions, partially offset by a mix shift in customer service to outsourced call centers. 
Personnel expenses decreased 13% year-over-year, primarily due to restructuring actions I mentioned previously. G&A expenses decreased 36% year-over-year largely driven by reduced discretionary spend in such areas as T&E, lower indirect taxes and lower office expenses due to employees working remotely. Information technology expenses were up 1% year-over-year in the fourth quarter due to investments in software license fees related to cybersecurity and privacy software. 
Finally, we've broken out restructuring charges separately in operating expenses in the P&L. And I note that these restructuring charges are included in our non-GAAP results. 
We recorded a non-GAAP net loss of $23 million in the quarter. Our full year non-GAAP tax rate of 42% was meaningfully higher than our 2019 tax rate of 19% due to the greater impact of nontax deductible expenses on a lower base of earnings as well as the geographical distribution of earnings and losses. Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was driven by a change in our full year tax provision following better-than-expected pretax results in the fourth quarter. 
On a GAAP basis, we had an operating loss of $153 million in Q4. We recorded a GAAP net loss of $165 million in the quarter as the benefit from an unrealized $553 million pretax gain on our equity investments, primarily related to our investment in Meituan, was offset by income tax expenses of $410 million, $98 million of interest expense, and $61 million of FX remeasurement losses on our Eurobond. We excluded the unrealized gains and the related losses from our non-GAAP results. 
The $410 million of income tax expenses is primarily due to the discrete tax expense related to the Meituan unrealized gain and the change in our full year tax provision following better-than-expected results in the fourth quarter. Our full year GAAP tax rate of 90% was meaningfully higher than our 2019 tax rate of 18% due to reasons mentioned for our non-GAAP tax rate, with the nondeductible goodwill impairment charge driving additional significant impacts. 
Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q4 ending cash and investment balance decreased to $14.8 billion from our September ending balance of $14.9 million due to an operating cash outflow, largely offset by the unrealized gains on our long-term investments. We had a $557 million operating cash outflow in the quarter driven primarily by changes in working capital, which represented a use of cash of about $400 million in the quarter as well as the net loss recorded in the quarter. The change in working capital driven by seasonal effects that were amplified by the slowdown in bookings from Q3. 
We will continue to focus on maintaining a strong liquidity position, given the high level of uncertainty created by the COVID pandemic. And consistent with our comments last quarter, we've halted repurchases of our stock, and we will not initiate repurchases until we have better visibility into the shape and timing of a recovery. 
Now onto our thoughts for the first quarter. And to remind you, we'll make comparisons with 2019 unless otherwise indicated. There continues to be considerable uncertainty about the shape and timing of the recovery for travel, which means we're unable to provide detailed guidance at this time. January room night declines were slightly worse than Q4, driven by the increasing spread of COVID-19, including the new strains with associated additional travel restrictions. However, starting in the middle of January, we saw an improvement in room night declines driven by domestic travel bookings in most parts of the world. And we've seen this improvement continue into February. In recent weeks, some regions have improved back to positive domestic room night growth. While difficult to predict with accuracy, if the domestic room night trends continue to improve, Q1 room night declines could be a few percentage points better than Q4. To give you a snapshot of what we're seeing recently, room night declines over the last 7 days were about 50%. 
In Q1, the overall booking window has contracted versus 2019, although to a lesser extent than we saw in the fourth quarter. In Western Europe, in January, we saw an expansion of the booking window versus 2019. And we've seen this expansion continue into February as the share of further out bookings, including those for summer travel, has increased. As Glenn noted in Western Europe, particularly in the U.K. and Germany, we have recently seen stronger summer booking trends relative to what we're seeing globally. And in these countries, gross bookings for summer period are within 25% of where they were at the same time in 2019. These stronger booking trends in Western Europe are currently being offset by weaker near-term booking trends in the region due to extensive travel restrictions. And we remind you that the significant majority of the summer bookings are cancelable. 
We're also encouraged to see that some countries are making notable progress with vaccinations, including Israel, UAE and the U.K. We are confident that when vaccinations are broadly available and when travel restrictions are lifted, people will return to travel. We saw this happen recently in Israel, where vaccination rates are the highest in the world. And after the national lockdown within Israel was eased on February 7, we quickly saw domestic bookings return to solid double-digit growth versus the same period in 2019. 
Turning to the income statement. As I said, we expect Q1 room nights -- Q1 room night declines could be a few percentage points better than Q4. We expect Q1 gross bookings to decline a few percentage points more than room nights due to continued pressure on local currency ADRs. We expect Q1 revenue to decline slightly more than gross bookings, assuming bookings continue to improve for the rest of the quarter. 
We expect margin expense in Q1 will decline at the same level as gross bookings. We expect sales and other expenses in Q1 will be similar to what they were in Q4 on a dollar basis, with some variability based upon where Q1 volumes land. 
We expect personnel expenses in Q1 will be slightly higher than they were in Q4 on a dollar basis, primarily due to increased SBC expenses and seasonal increase in benefit costs, partially offset by a higher amount of savings in Q1 related to restructuring actions we've taken. We expect that almost the full run rate from our personnel restructurings will be realized in Q1. 
We expect G&A expenses in Q1 will be about the same as they were in Q4 on a dollar basis. We expect the IT expenses will be higher than they were in Q4 on a dollar basis, primarily due to increased investments in security, data privacy and some operational system enhancements. We currently estimate the remaining restructuring charge related to actions in Booking.com will be about $40 million. And we expect to record more than half of these remaining charges in the first quarter. About half of the $40 million relates to personnel-related actions, and the other half relates to real estate. Given what we just explained, and reminding you that Q1 is our seasonally lowest-revenue quarter, we expect to report a greater EBITDA loss in Q1 than in Q4. 
For the full year 2021, I want to briefly walk you through some factors that we expect will impact our top line operating margins for the year. We expect the environment of travel to improve in -- during 2021, but the shape and timing of that recovery remains uncertain. We expect occupancy rates to remain below where they were pre-COVID, putting continued negative pressure on ADRs, which will result in our gross bookings being lower than our room nights. 
As I noted earlier, our revenue was less negatively impacted than our gross bookings in 2020 due to timing factors, which benefited our 2020 revenue by more than $1 billion. The opposite dynamic will happen when we experience an acceleration in volumes, which will lead to our gross bookings recurring faster than revenue. Said another way, if we see this acceleration in 2021, there will be more bookings made in 2021 that will check in, in 2022, than there were bookings made in 2020 that checked in, in 2021. This timing factor could have a meaningfully negative impact on our revenue as a percentage of gross bookings. So exactly how meaningful this impact will be depends upon how quickly our room nights and gross bookings accelerate in 2021. 
Due to these differences in the timing of bookings versus check-in, we also expect deleverage in our marketing expenses in 2021 as we incur the majority of our market expenses at the time of booking. The most significant expense items in sales and other are payment processing costs and outsourced customer service expenses. We expect sales and other to be lower in 2021 than in 2019, but the reduction will be smaller than the reduction in revenue. 
A few comments to help you think about our less variable expenses for 2021 and how they'll most likely compare with 2019. We expect G&A to be down double digits versus 2019 driven by T&E, office and occupancy expenses, with some variability from DST taxes if new ones are enacted during the year. 
Personnel expenses are likely to be quite similar to 2019 on a dollar basis. To help you understand this better, there are a few factors that contribute towards this. Our personnel expense run rate immediately before COVID hit was about $200 million higher than 2019 actual personnel expenses. Less than half of this was the annualization of people expense we added during 2019. And the rest was from people expense added into the business in the first quarter of 2020. 
Our restructuring actions will reduce headcount expenses by approximately $370 million. So the impact of these 2 together will be to reduce personnel expenses by $170 million versus 2019. As we continue to invest in the business, we expect 2021 year-end headcount to be a little higher than at the end of 2020, with a mix shift towards pro and technical positions. This will add about $100 million in personnel expenses in 2021. 
And finally, SBC is expected to be higher than 2019 due to a few factors, including the modification of some stock awards in Q1 2021 and the issuance of stock options in 2020. Finally, IT expenses in 2021 will be higher than in 2019 due to investments in security, privacy and operational system enhancements to support our connected trip strategy. 
As we think beyond 2021, we're looking forward to being a larger business with more diverse offerings and with more earnings than we have prior to COVID. We're also focused on the potential for higher growth and market share. We continue to believe that it would be years and not quarters before travel returns to pre-COVID-19 levels. And when considering the shape of the business at that time, I'd like to draw your attention to 2 factors. 
The first is a mix shift within the business. The continued growth of payments and the growth of flights and other connected verticals will add revenue and EBITDA, but at much lower margin rates than traditional accommodations. Payments will add to revenue with offsetting expenses in sales and other, plus some additional personnel and other expenses. Flights and other connected trip verticals will add to bookings and revenue, but at lower take rates than accommodations, and will also require added personnel and other expenses as this business scales. 
The second is personnel. The restructuring actions we took in 2020 were mainly in volume-related functions, including customer service and credit collection. This means that as volumes grow beyond the levels we expect in 2021, we'll need to add expenses back to business. As we've mentioned before, we'll look to do this in cost-efficient ways, but the work will come back. 
We think it's important to include these considerations when thinking about the future shape of the business. As Glenn said, we expect to continue to have industry-leading EBITDA margin rates, albeit most likely at levels below those in 2019. 
In conclusion, we remain focused on what we can control and continue to execute against our strategic priorities. We're now more confident than ever that through these actions, we will emerge in this crisis in a stronger position. 
We'll now take your questions. And Grace, I'll turn it over to you to open the line for questions."

As they come back, we will look at more efficient ways of getting that work done. The work will come back. It won't come back this year. We basically rightsized ourselves through what we think will be through 2021. But as volumes extend beyond what we think 2021 is likely to bring, those costs will come back. So we will look at more efficient ways to do some of those variable activities in terms of location, technology, what we do inside or where we deploy more partner resources, et cetera. 
And we also, Lloyd, continue to look at how we can drive efficiency in our fixed costs part of the business. That's not been the major focus for the last 12 months.

And do you think you'll be getting more promotional activity from suppliers, maybe better take rates? Anything we could think about on that front?"

So in regards to the home or alternative accommodations as we like to call it into Europe, I don't think we've talked much about regional exact share, and I'm not going to here. But I certainly -- we talked a little bit how Europe is our stronghold",531,"Sure. So in regards to the home or alternative accommodations as we like to call it into Europe, I don't think we've talked much about regional exact share, and I'm not going to here. But I certainly -- we talked a little bit how Europe is our stronghold in that area. We're better there in the home area than other areas. 
But throughout the world, I think I can say to you that we are better in things that are less single property. We always want to increase the single property because we know that's an area where we can improve upon. So that is an issue right now. And with the pandemic, there certainly was a bit of a shift, for some people, that they wanted to be isolated away from other people. So certainly, there was more demand than in the past for the single-home area. That showed up much more in the U.S. for us, say, than Europe. Because Europe, we do have -- a greater amount of our home supply is the single property than, say, in the U.S. 
Look, it's an area we're going to continue to focus on, and I do believe right now in the environment there is that is a great product to have up on the shelf. That being said, in the future, we'll see how much that maintains or things go back more towards they used to be, where there's a different split between homes and hotels. 
In regard to your second question about relationship with hotel suppliers, obviously, we're doing everything we can to help our partners. And that's coming up with new ways to -- come up with promotions that they want to do. Telling them when we think there are spots in demand that they can come up with different types of closed user group prices that can help get them more demand. Coming out with ways that they can put together things in content in terms of safety and health, so that a traveler who looks on our site and sees their hotel and sees that it's a safe place to go. Do all different things with them to try and improve their business. 
It's very difficult right now as you know, though, because let's face it, unless there's [ sheer ] demand, that you can have the greatest content in the world, but people don't feel it's time to travel, they're not going to travel. But we're going to continue to do that. 
I do believe in terms of relationships, certainly as a distributor, when there is less demand, we are more valuable as a partner to them. In the time when there's very, very high occupancy rates, any hotel will say, ""Well, I don't need the distributor nearly as much."" But when they don't have as much occupancy rate, then they start looking for demand, and we have the benefit of being the largest platform for hotel demand in the world. So we are the place for them to come and get some more of that incremental demand, and we're continuing to work with them to make sure they do their best to get it."

As we scaled the company over many, many years, we had a very global approach, and we tried not to make changes solely for any particular market. Really believing that scaling the business, keying everything the same was the best way to achieve a very, very large, global share of the business. That being said, we've come to a state where we recognize that we're continuing to be underindexed in the U.S. and maybe we need to make some changes there, which we are doing. And I think that we will make some progress in that.

And we've talked about this numerous times of how we believe getting people to come back to us directly is a critical part of the strategy going forward. 
And certainly one of the ways we do that is by providing our loyalty version, which is our Genius program, Booking.com, which really does, we believe, give some real value to consumers. And that's something that we're going to continue on because in the end, it costs an awful lot of money, as we know, to get a new customer. It's cheaper to keep them. So we're going to keep on doing all the things we can to keep people coming back direct.

In regards to your second question, one of the things I mentioned was how uncertain the world is right now. And one of the things you're trying always to do is make sure you're spending money, but that's to create revenue. One issue is you pay the money upfront, a person books, but because so much of the business nowadays is being done on things that are cancelable, you don't know when change happens, all of a sudden, money you've spent, it doesn't end up in -- and increase the revenue you thought it was, and your ROI ends up very different. So we have to look at this very carefully, and we are approaching it in a cautious way.
But on the other hand, we don't want to be slow to the increase in demand. It's something -- we look at all the data very, very closely. That's about the best I can say is that, that's how we're handling it right now. We can't say anything more than that because we don't know what the future is going to be quite yet."

Another thing that we continue to build out in our attractions area, not a lot of people are actually buying attractions right now. But we haven't stopped getting more and more places and more and more content, so that when people do come back, they'll have attractions they can buy from us.

But yes, we were pleased to see that positive number there. One of the things to point is as I just talked about a little bit, though, in the past, we didn't have air tickets coming from Booking.com and from -- and also, by the way, our Agoda brand also sells air tickets, too. Priceline, of course, has been selling air tickets since the start of the company. It's more than 2 decades ago. So it's easier when you add 2 more of our brand selling air tickets that hadn't done it in the past to have a positive number. 
And I want to point out, this is very early and these are very, very, very small numbers. So it's pleasant to see, but I wouldn't tell you too much except that we are on our journey. 
In regards to attractions for Booking.com, so it's yes, these are coming from third-party suppliers. We are partnering with them. They give us the inventory, so we sell it. We have a commercial relationship. And we're pleased. That's the way to go forward. Again, one can be anything or -- and you need to decide which ones you want to do first, but it's a lot -- you can't be everything. So it's a lot easier when you want to do a lot more things to partner with other people for things -- for people who already set up the things you need to get, so I'm pretty pleased about that. Again, I'll be even more pleased when people actually are back to traveling and start buying attractions more.

But let me kind of clarify where we are on payments and the evolution of payment at Booking.com. So as we said in the prepared remarks, the percentage of our gross bookings processed on the payment platform at Booking.com was 22% last year. That's up meaningfully from the 15% in 2019. That still means that the vast majority of bookings are not being processed via our payment transaction, they're still in the agency model. So we expect that payment adoption to continue to increase above the 22% this year and beyond. 
Payments is really super important for us for a number of reasons because we think we can deliver benefits to our customers, our partners, across all the different channels, hotels, alternative accommodations, flights, attractions, et cetera. It's also very important to enable merchandising, which will use on a selective basis in certain markets. And it's also fundamental to enabling the connected trip where we want to have everything be -- able to be paid in one place. 
I'll give you an update on where we are from an income statement point of view relative to the evolution of payments. I'm pleased to say that payments on Booking.com was approximately breakeven in 2020. We've said it in prior years, we are still making some net investment in the platform. And we focus upon still scaling it out, but I expect to stay in that breakeven level as we scale out and grow the payments platform from here, obviously, with some potential minor differences year in, year out.

Because a single-home property does cost more for the company because you do end up with more contacts. It's just by nature. It's not as professionally run, and you do end up with more costs. So we do, though, know that it's a product that people want, and we need to have it and we need to have more of it and that's absolutely correct. 
The great thing about this though is there is a trend towards more professionalization of the single-home property, where the person in the past may have gone onto a platform and just signed up on their own and tried to orchestrate it all by themselves. What you are seeing in the industry is more and more people, who want to rent out their single properties, going to different people who will do it for them, who will handle all the elements of it. And those people who are running these kind of -- we won't call them channel managers, but they're like a channel manager in a sense they are able to bring these different, single-property owners and put them onto this site, that then is able to direct that -- to provide that supply to us or to somebody else. The great thing about it is these people are much more professional, and they are more easy to deal with. They are able to understand the right things that you need to do. So because of that professionalization of the industry, I believe we will be able to pick up more of the single-home properties faster than we had to in the past.

Let's say what I really think is happening here ]. So people who perhaps in the past never would have thought of using alternative accommodations, perhaps last summer they didn't use it or they looked at it or something. And now it is in a consideration set. So going forward, what has happened is now there's a much larger amount of supply for any travelers to go look at. And what that means is any individual supplier in the marketplace is now facing more competition. Now as a distributor, I talked about it a little earlier why that is beneficial to the distributor now. 
And our business, which is so great because we have both, a great amount of the home product, that alternative accommodations, and we're one of the largest people [ at the ] hotels. So we have this great thing where the consumer, when they come, they can come to one place, us. And they're able to compare and contrast all the different types, all the different prices, understand all the different comments and reviews being left by people who previously stayed there. That gives us a great, great benefit. 
So I am pleased with the way this is happening. And I -- will it go back? What will happen? How much will be -- mix be of home in the future versus hotel? I don't know. I don't think anybody can really guess. I think over many years, we've seen the trend going more and more people interested in alternative accommodations. The pandemic step-function it up higher. I don't know if that's now going to be a pause, maybe a dip down or continue upward. I don't know. But from my point of view, it's not that relevant in the sense that we provide both and we're going to keep getting both. So for me, I'm feeling pretty good about it."

I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I am pleased to start by reporting further improvement in our accommodations business, with first quarter room nights declini",1477,"Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' First Quarter Conference Call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. 
I am pleased to start by reporting further improvement in our accommodations business, with first quarter room nights declining 54% versus Q1 2019, which was 6 percentage points better than our fourth quarter 2020 decline. This improvement was driven by solid signs of increasing travel demand in certain countries and by our team's strong execution. David will provide the details on our first quarter results in his remarks. 
As we have said before, we believe that the rate of recovery for travel will depend heavily on the rate and severity of new COVID-19 cases, the timing of effective and broad-based vaccine distribution and hopefully, even more effective treatments in the future. While the pace of vaccine distribution remains frustratingly slow in most places around the world, Israel, the U.K. and the U.S. are benefiting from successful vaccine distribution programs. In each of these countries, we have seen encouraging booking trends, which supports our view that vaccine distribution is a key to unlocking pent-up travel demand. 
In our own survey work earlier in the year, we found that over 70% of Americans said that the early distribution stage of COVID-19 vaccines made them feel more hopeful and optimistic about traveling in 2021. As countries ramp up vaccine distribution, which we are now starting to see in more European countries, we believe that we will start to see booking strength expand to more parts of the world. 
While there are encouraging signs of recovery in some countries right now, the current situation in other countries, such as India, where we are seeing staggering increases in COVID-19 cases and an enormous human tragedy happening, reminds us that recovery is not underway everywhere. And unfortunately, in some countries, the situation is getting worse. Last week, the World Health Organization warrant that the pace of the pandemic is accelerating. We are mindful that governments may continue to take actions, such as general area lockdowns or reintroducing travel restrictions, including barring people from high-infection locations from entering the country. Any of these actions can have an impact on our performance, and it's difficult to predict when and to what extent such actions may be taken in the future. Furthermore, international travel must recover for there to be a complete global travel recovery, and many governments may be cautious in fully opening international travel for some time. 
Focusing on the U.S. where the vaccination program is going well. I am very pleased with our first quarter results in the U.S. and the strong rebound in U.S. travel demand. For Q1 in the U.S., we had positive room night growth versus Q1 2019, and it was our strongest performing major country. These results were driven by domestic bookings as our international business is still very slow. We are pleased to see improvements in our U.S. room night trends each month in Q1 and these improvements continued into April. This strength in the market benefited all of our travel partners and can help drive the highest number of air tickets ever booked in a single quarter for our company, and we know that both Priceline and Booking.com had good U.S. results during the first quarter. 
In this improving environment, we continue to press ahead with one of our most important strategic strategies, strengthening the Booking.com brand in the U.S. You may have seen Booking.com's U.S. back-to-travel promotional campaign that we launched in April, which offered a $50 post state promotional travel credit for U.S. travelers with activated promotion in the Booking.com app and book travel by the end of May. This is just one example of the marketing methods that we will be employing to increase awareness of the Booking.com brand in the U.S. And in this case, drive further consumer engagement with our app. 
We also remain focused on expanding the supply of Booking.com's alternative accommodation offering in the U.S. and we targeted and signed new properties to the platform in the quarter. However, we recognize there is more work to be done to improve the breadth of this product in the U.S. During the first quarter, we continue to execute against other key strategic priorities, such as expanding Booking.com's payment platform and building the connected trip vision. 
Regarding our integrated payment platform at Booking.com, we have made recent progress primarily through increased adoption by our supply partners in the U.S. As I have mentioned previously, this platform provides payment options favored by both travelers and our supplier partners across hotels, alternative accommodations, cars, flight and attractions and is foundational for enabling our connected trip strategy. The connected trip is our vision of a multiproduct offering, including accommodations, flight, ground transportation, attractions and dining, connected by our payment network and ultimately supported by personalized intelligence to provide a friction with seamless experience for our bookers, all the way from first thinking about the initial booking to experiencing their trip to arriving back home. Building out our full connected trip vision will be a multiyear endeavor. However, we expect that our business will benefit from the steps we are taking to achieve this vision long before reaching the ultimate end state. 
For example, developing a robust flight product at Booking.com gives us the ability to engage with flight bookers early in their travel journey and allows us an opportunity to cross-sell our accommodation and other services to these bookers. We have not had these opportunities historically at Booking.com, given its accommodation only focus in the past. 
As we think about the journey for building the connected trip, this year, we'll be focused on enabling travelers to book the major elements of their trip in one place on Booking.com. This means we will be working to build up our non-accommodation products like flights, ground transportation and attractions by increasing supply as well as exposing more of our customers to these products.  
In Booking.com's flight offering, we are now live in 18 countries with the most recent launch in the U.K. We can now expose a large segment of customers to flight as these 18 countries collectively represented more than half of Booking.com's room nights booked in 2019. Booking.com's flight offering is now fully needed in the app and, long early, we are in the process of beginning to utilize marketing channels to bring potential customers to the product. 
On attractions, we have continued to expand the breadth of supply available to our travelers through our recent partnership with Viator along with our ongoing partnership with Musement that was announced last year. We see real benefits of a strong attraction offering, given the potential bundling opportunities as well as the ability to increase travel engagement with the app, while travelers are in destination. 
Across many of our key strategic priorities, I have mentioned the app, which indicates the importance of the app for our business. We've been investing in the app platform for some time, and we'll continue to invest as the app becomes the center of our connected trip experience. In addition, we see better customer loyalty, lower customer acquisition costs and more opportunities to engage directly with travelers through our app. Booking.com was the most downloaded travel app globally in the first quarter, according to a leading third-party research firm. We now see over 2/3 of our bookings come through the mobile devices, the majority of which are on the app. 
One of Booking Holdings' goals is to do well in the area of sustainability. I was very pleased to recently made public our 2020 Sustainability Report, and one achievement that I am particularly proud of is Booking Holdings becoming operational carbon-neutral in 2020. This is a significant milestone for our business and one, we are working towards even prior to the pandemic. We intend to remain carbon-neutral in our operations in the future and look forward to making progress on our sustainability strategy, including diversity and inclusion and sustainable travel. 
In conclusion, the exact shape and timing of the full recovery for travel remains uncertain. However, I'm encouraged by the signs of recovery we are seeing in some countries, and I'm confident that we will eventually see a strong recovery in travel demand globally. That being said, we are likely to experience volatility between now and then, with some countries recovering well, others beginning to recover and unfortunately, some getting worse. I'm proud of the actions that our teams across Booking Holdings continue to take to strengthen our company's position and execute against our strategic priorities. We are thinking about our business beyond just getting back to 2019 levels demand and we are focused on building a larger and faster-growing business that generates more earnings after the recovery and for the long run. 
I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden."

I'll review our operating results for the first quarter and provide some color on the trends we've seen so far in the second quarter. To avoid the comparison to the initial spread of the pandemic in 2020, all growth rates are relative to the comparable period in 2019, unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. I also want to remind you that during the period of bookings are recovering, revenue will recover more slower than bookings due to timing differences, and this will impact our booking to revenue take rates. 
Now on to our results for the first quarter. On our February earnings call, we discussed the improvements in trends we saw starting in the middle of January and continuing into February, driven by domestic travel in most parts of the world. The improving trends continued into March, resulting in our Q1 reported room nights declining 54% versus Q1 2019, which was a 6% improvement versus the decline we reported in Q4. As a reminder, reported room nights include the impact of cancellations. 
The improvements in the Q1 room night decline rate versus Q4 was driven by the U.S. and Europe. While Asia and rest of world declines were about the same in Q1 as they were in Q4. The U.S. was the strongest performing in major country in Q1 and had a positive room night growth versus 2019 for the full quarter. The trends in the U.S. improved through Q1 with very strong room night growth versus 2019 for the month of March. Spring break was a contributor to growth in March. U.S. domestic room nights growth was positive for each months month of the quarter with very strong growth for the full quarter. 
In Q1, other countries also experienced very strong domestic room night growth, including Russia and Australia, and we saw continued strengthening in domestic bookings in Israel. 
While Europe improved for the full quarter compared with Q4, we did see trends soften towards the end of March, driven by rising COVID case counts and new impositions of travel restrictions. Europe was the least recovered region in terms of room nights booked in Q4 and it remained the least recovered region in Q1. 
Mobile bookings, particularly through our apps, continue to represent over 2/3 of our total room nights. Our direct channel gained share both sequentially and year-on-year. Domestic room nights represented about 85% of our reported room nights in Q1, in line with our Q4 2020 mix of room nights and up significantly versus 2019. Our cancellation rates continue to be elevated versus 2019 in the quarter, but improved from levels we saw in Q4. 
The booking window at Booking.com remains shorter than it was in the first quarter of 2019 as we continue to see a higher mix of near-term bookings. However, the booking window contracted less than it did in the fourth quarter. As we noted on the last call, in January and February, we saw an expansion of the booking window versus 2019 in Western Europe and this expansion continued into March as the share of further out bookings, including those who saw in travel, increased versus the same time in 2019. Due to the situation in Europe with new COVID cases, vaccination rates and travel restrictions, bookings are generally either very near term or for the summer period. 
The overall mix of customers booking alternative accommodations on Booking.com in Q1 was about the same in Q1 -- as Q1 last year. As we noted last quarter, Europe is where we have our highest mix of alternative accommodations, and Europe was the slowest growing region in the first quarter, which negatively impacted our alternative accommodation mix on a global basis. The mix of alternative accommodation bookings in Europe increased by several percentage points year-over-year. 
Gross bookings declined 53% in Q1, which is less than the decline in reported room nights, primarily due to strong performance in our flights business and partially offset by a 1% decline in average daily rates for accommodations versus 2019. Airline tickets booked in the first quarter were up 49% versus 2019, and driven by strong growth at Priceline and by flight bookings at Booking.com and Agoda, both of which did not have flight products in Q1 2019. 
Our accommodations average day rates only declined 1% versus 2019, benefiting from a higher mix of North America, which is a higher ADR region. Excluding regional mix effects, ADRs were down approximately mid-single digits. ADRs in the quarter were helped by the higher mix of summer bookings in Western Europe, which typically have higher ADRs. 
Consolidated revenue for the first quarter was $1.1 billion and decreased 61% versus 2019. Revenue in the quarter declined more than gross bookings due to bookings made in the quarter that are expected to check in, in future quarters, at which point in time the revenue will be recognized. Take rates in Q1 were a little less than 10%, largely driven by these timing differences. As you recall, we discussed the impact of timing on take rates in 2020 and 2021 during our last call. We expect timing to impact take rates all year, assuming the booking growth continues to improve during the year. 
The 61% reduction in revenue resulted in an adjusted EBITDA loss of $195 million in the quarter. We significantly reduced our variable expense lines like marketing, sales and other, are more fixed expenses in Q1 were broadly in line with the commentary we provided on our last call. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line, decreased 61% versus 2019. Marketing expenses declined more than gross bookings due to an increase -- due to an increase in our direct mix and slightly higher ROIs in paid channels. Sales and other expenses in Q1 were lower than it were in Q4 on a dollar basis, which was slightly better than our expectations. Personnel expenses were in line with our expectations. Q1 expenses are higher they were in Q4 on a dollar basis due primarily to increased stock-based compensation expenses and seasonal increases in benefit costs, partially offset by a higher amount of savings in Q1 related to the restructuring actions we have taken. 
G&A expenses were lower in Q1 than they were in Q4 on a dollar basis versus our expectation for them to be about in line due to lower-than-expected personnel-related costs and professional fees. Information technology expenses were higher in Q1 than they were in Q4 on dollar basis, but were lower than our expectations due to timing of spend. Finally, we recorded $8 million of restructuring charges in Q1, which was lower than our prior expectations primarily due to timing of real estate restructuring charges. And note, these restructuring charges are included in our non-GAAP results. 
We recorded a non-GAAP net loss of $215 million in the quarter. Our Q1 non-GAAP tax rate of 38% was meaningfully higher than our 2019 tax rate of 19% due to the greater impact of non-tax deductible expenses on a lower base of earnings. On a GAAP basis, we had an operating loss of $311 million in Q1. We recorded a GAAP net loss of $55 million in the quarter, helped by an income tax benefit of $223 million. Our Q1 tax rate of 80% was meaningfully higher than our 2019 tax rate of 21% due to the impact of nontax deductible expenses on lower basis earnings and the impact of discrete items recorded in the quarter. 
Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q1 ending cash investment balance of $16.4 billion benefited from the $2 billion raised in our Eurobond offering completed in March. In April, we used all the proceeds from the Eurobond offering to redeem to higher coupon senior notes that we issued earlier in the pandemic last year. These refinancing actions we took will result in approximately $70 million of annualized interest rate expense savings and were NPV-positive transactions. 
Adjusting our Q1 ending cash investments for the redemption of the 2 senior notes that happened in April will result in a balance of $14.4 billion, which is down from our December ending balance of $14.8 billion. We had a $207 million operating cash flow -- operating cash outflow in the quarter, driven primarily by change in working capital, which represented a use of cash of about $216 million in the quarter. We will continue to focus on maintaining a strong liquidity position, given the high level of uncertainty created by the COVID pandemic. And consistent with our comments over the last year, we've halted our repurchases of our stock and will not initiate repurchases until we have better visibility into the shape and timing of a recovery. 
Now on to our thoughts for the second quarter. There continues to be considerable uncertainty about the shape and timing of recovery for travel, which means that we are unable to provide detailed guidance at this time. April room nights declined about 43% versus 2019, which was better than the decline in March. Domestic room night growth was about flat versus 2019 for the month of April, the best monthly result for domestic room nights since last summer. 
On a regional basis, the U.S. continued to have very strong room night growth in April and was above March levels. Europe room nights declines were better in April than in March, recovering from a softening of trends we saw at the end of March and the first week of April. Room night declines in Europe were down over 50% in April. Asia room night declines worsened in April versus March as outbreaks and new cases increases, increased vaccination progress has been slow and governments continue to impose restrictions on travel. Asia was the least recovered region in April. The rest of world declines were about the same in April as we were in Q1 and Q4. 
While difficult to predict with accuracy, if current trends continue, Q2 room night declines could be a few percentage points better than in April. To give you a snapshot of what we are seeing recently, room night declines over the last 7 days of April were about 38%. As I noted earlier, in Western Europe, the booking window expanded in Q1. This expansion continues into April, and we continue to see positive summer booking trends in Western Europe. Across all of Western Europe, gross bookings for the summer period are now within 30% of where they were at the same time in 2019. And for the U.K., they're now at about the same level as we were at the same time in 2019. We remind you that the significant majority of some of bookings are cancelable. 
Turning to the income statement. As I said, we expect Q2 room night declines could be a few percentage points better than the decline in April. We expect Q2 gross bookings to decline slightly less than room nights, driven by the same trends that we saw in the first quarter. We expect future revenue to decline more than gross bookings due to timing factors we have discussed. As a result, we expect our Q2 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings will improve from Q1, but will be a few percentage points lower than in Q2 of 2019. We expect marketing expenses in Q2 will decline a little more than gross bookings but less than revenue. We expect sales and other expenses in Q2 to be up significantly versus Q1 on a dollar basis and will be a higher potential of revenue due to higher gross booking volumes in the second quarter as well as an increase in the mix of gross bookings processed on a merchant basis. We expect personnel expenses in Q2 will be about the same as they were in Q1 on a dollar basis. Compared with Q1, SBC and expenses are expected to be less, but this is offset by an increase in bonus accruals, which are recorded proportional to revenue. 
We expect G&A expenses in Q2 will be higher than Q1 on a dollar basis, driven by higher personnel-related costs such recruiting and T&E as well as higher professional fees and digital service taxes. We expect IT expenses in Q2 will be higher than Q1 on a dollar basis due to increased investments in security, data privacy and some operational systems enhancements, including some deferred expenses from Q1. We expect -- we currently estimate the full year restructuring charge related to our actions at Booking.com will be approximately $30 million, and we expect to record about half of these charges in the second quarter. 
Given what we just explained, especially the timing difference between recovery of bookings and revenue, we expect to record an EBITDA loss in Q2, albeit less of a loss than recorded in Q1. Depending upon how demand develops during the quarter, this could potentially be a small EBITDA loss in Q2. 
For the full year 2021, we continue to expect that the overall environment for travel will improve during the year, but the shape and timing that improvement remained uncertain. As Glenn mentioned in his remarks, while we're seeing recovery and other encouraging signs in some countries, other countries and regions are struggling with a rapidly growing COVID wave. Globally, the number of new cases reported is increasing, with a record 5.7 million new cases recorded the week of April 19th. This is directly impacting our business across much of April -- of Asia. 
As a reminder, about the KAYAKs of our model during recovery, we continue to expect if we see continued recovery in 2021, there will be more bookings made in 2021 that will check in, in 2022 than there were bookings made in 2020 that checked in, in 2021. This timing factor could have a meaningfully negative impact on our revenue as a percentage of gross bookings and also drive deleverage in our marketing expenses in 2021 as we incurred the majority of our market expenses at the time of booking. To remind you, in 2018 and 2019, our revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was approximately 15.6%. This increased to 19.2% in 2020. We expect this percentage will be well below 15.6% in 2021, and the faster the recovery occurs, the lower this percentage will be. 
Before closing, there's been a lot of interest in our commentary in February about the longer-term model for our business. And I want to reiterate what we said previously and also provide some more color. We continue to believe it will be years, not quarters, before we see a full recovery of the travel market, especially international travel. Looking beyond 2021, we continue to look forward to being a larger business with more diverse offerings and with more earnings than we had prior to COVID. We also remain focused on the potential for higher growth and market share. We expect to continue to have industry-leading EBITDA margin rates albeit most likely levels below those in 2019, driven by mix shifts within the business, as I discussed on the last call. As a reminder, these mix shifts include the continued growth of payments and the growth of flights and other connected trip verticals, which will add revenue and EBITDA at much lower margin rates than traditional accommodations. 
As we think about the future shape of our accommodation business, there are a few factors to consider. As discussed on the last call, we expect our personnel expenses in 2021 to be about the same as in 2019 as the savings from restructuring actions taken in 2020 are expected to be offset by personnel run rate investments made pre COVID and personnel investments expected in 2021. Of course, some of these investments are to support payments and the connected trip. 
As we look beyond 2021, the $370 million in savings from our restructuring actions were mainly in volume-related functions, meaning that as volumes grow back, the levels which we expect -- which means as volumes grow beyond the levels we expect in 2021, we'll need to add expenses back to business. As we've mentioned before, we look to do this in cost-effective ways, but the work will come back. And when added to our 2021 personnel cost base, will put pressure on our accommodation business EBITDA margins relative to 2019 at the same level of volumes we had in 2019 and at the same growth rate. 
Of course, there are offsetting factors that could improve margins, including variable cost efficiencies from additional scale as we build grow beyond 2019 volumes from fixed cost efficiencies and from increased direct mix. 
The last thought I'd like to leave you with on this topic is that we believe that the recovery of the travel market will create opportunities to invest to gain share in accommodations, which could put pressure on margins during the period of share gains. In conclusion, we are pleased to see the recovery we discussed in February continued into March and April in some parts of the world, leading to improvement in our top line metrics. We're also watching the spread of COVID and the distribution of effective vaccines very carefully and realize that this may lead to volatility -- continued volatility ahead. We remain confident that we can emerge this crisis in a stronger position. 
With that, we'll take your questions, and Grace, we'll hand over to you to open the line for questions."

Justin, let me take that. So just to remind you of our historic mix. We have basically said that Europe is, of course, our largest region, historically, if you think kind of roughly 50% or maybe a little bit more, you wouldn't be far off being correct. Asia, we said historically, again, pre  COVID is -- was about 20%, with no single country being more than low single digits. And that means that you've really got 30% left for U.S. and rest of the world combined. So that is our pre-COVID mix. Obviously, that mix has changed a little bit with the dynamic of what's happened recently. Obviously, the U.S. has gone up as that's been the most recurrent marketplace. So that's the historic reference points. 
In terms of last summer, we saw a couple of things. We, of course, did see after the first wave came down, we saw people getting more confident with traveling. Of course, vaccines were still not available at that point in time. So people are kind of traveling quite carefully and traveling locally. What we have seen, and we saw it in several places, what we've seen so far is a very consistent trend that when cases come down, when the vaccination rates go up, when government restrictions start to lift, good things happen. We see that happening in the U.S. right now, we see that happening in Israel. We mentioned a couple of other areas that are doing better than average. So our expectation is that we'll see those positive trends start to occur in other parts of the world, particularly in Europe as things are starting to improve. As we mentioned, we are seeing things improving on April versus March, and Europe is now no longer the least recovered region."

So very strong plus. And then if you just kind of double-click down and look at just the domestic recognizing there is some substitution effect in there.

And I'll let David talk about the mix, and he can talk about because we have more in Europe, in the U.S., I'll let him go through that very certainly why we are where we are. In terms of the future, here's the situation. We have been saying for many, many years, and everyone is aware of this, that people have been more interested in the alternative accommodation. This is a global phenomenon. And it's been going up at a steady rate for some time. COVID created a step-functional change where people who may never have thought about an alternative accommodations, now they were thinking, I want to go to a home that's not near people, maybe near the beach or near the mountains, and I feel safer there. 
Now having tried that in the future, the question, as you just asked is, will people go back to their former habits of some people go into hotels, some people, homes, will it be going to be a more gradual increase and will it be a drop back first and then back up. I don't think anybody really knows. But I would make the guess that people having tried the alternative accommodations during the pandemic, will forever have it in their consideration set. And they may not always use it, they will choose what type of property fits their needs. But now because it is part of their consideration set, I think there is a functional change in increased mix in the long run. 
That being said, for us, we do both. We have the greatest selection of both hotels and non-hotel accommodations together combined so we feel we are very well positioned globally for that -- though I have spoken in the past, in some regions, we are definitely insufficient supply that we need to build up. And David, if you want to explain again about the issue because of mix in terms of geographies and the mix in properties."

If you just look out our business within Europe, you only look at that lens, you would see alternative accommodation mix in Q1 this last year, up a fair amount compared to Q1 of '20 and also versus Q1 of 2019. So within Europe, where we have our largest mix of alternative accommodations, we see an increase in mix. But you also remember, I said that Europe in Q1 was our lowest performing region. And of course, the highest performing region was the U.S., where we have a much lower mix of alterative accommodation. So that mix effect means that in total, our alternative accommodation mix did not increase, but in Europe, for example, where it's the largest, it did increase a fair amount. So mix effect is really the biggest reason. In total, in Q1, the mix also a combination was very similar to the 30% number we gave out for all of FY '20. But again, within different regions, there are mix shifts occurring."

So we don't give away -- I don't believe we ever talked about the actual attachment rates, but I will say that, that is an important reason we do flights. And that getting that booker upfront is important so that we can then get them to buy something that will have a higher margin. The 18 countries in that Booking.com is now working in. We are getting initial -- and we've been doing for some time now, we'll, I guess, a year now approximately. We are getting some learnings, how can we improve it, how we make it better. We really haven't marketed this at all in terms of the way we market our hotel offering because we want to get it right before we start spending a lot of money. We don't want to waste money, as you know. I am very pleased, though, with the very limited effort that we've done that people are using it, and we are getting feedback that people are coming back. 
So that's good. It's something that's important for the long run. And I want to emphasize how much this is a long game we're playing here. Because, as you know, the number is still very, very, very small. And this is very early. But we hope in the long run that this connected trip, which is not just the flights, but it's also the ground transportation and the attractions and the dining, and all the things that people do when they are traveling, to create something that makes them want to always use our app more than anything else. When they pick a travel, they come back to us. So it's critical that we have that first thing, which is important to a lot of people, flights. And now we're going to continue to make investments into it to make sure that it's absolutely a great, great service."

So people, in the short term, looking at the more flexible agency pay the hotel model because that has just an attractive proposition in time for this were flexibility becomes very important. 
We do expect a merchant business to actually increased during the year at Booking.com, where we have obviously the big mix shift happening. And we still think that the merchant business in total in 2021 will be a slightly higher mix than it was in 2020. But of course, flexibility is one of the factors that is important as people are bookings in this environment. So that's what's going on this year."

There are some incremental expenses, obviously, in our other lines as well related to running the payments program, but the biggest variable costs are sitting sales and other. And as we mentioned, in 2020, the payments business operated very close to breakeven when factoring, particularly the variable costs into account, which is an improvement from what it was before and it's obviously and enable the business, as Glenn just articulated. So we want to continue to grow the mix and maintain that breakeven profile as we're growing it out, recognizing -- in the future, we recognize there are monetization opportunities that can lead to incremental EBITDA from the payments business, which we expect, albeit at lower margin rates than core accommodations."

And on what's going on between the dynamic between room night growth and booking growth. There are a couple of factors going on here. One, I mentioned the fact that we're doing -- that we're seeing better booking growth performance from flights because of volume. And also, we're doing -- even though the units are down 4% to 6% in car, there's actually a fairly good increase in rates for cars. So total bookings, the TTV is down better for both flights and cars than it is for accommodations. But the biggest factor is really what's going on with ADRs, and there has been a bit of a shift in what we've seen even in the last couple of months. And we are -- saw that ADRs in the quarter were only down 1%. 
Now I would say there's a couple of things. The like-for-like ADRs are absolutely still under pressure due to lower occupancy rates. But there are some mix benefits that really impact the year-on-year comparison. The first mix benefit was the mix shift towards the U.S. as the U.S. actually start to accelerate, particularly in March. You saw a really fast pickup in rates in March that we were not forecasting when we last met. U.S. still have was a positive for room night growth but also for ADRs. And also in Europe, what's happening right now because there are still a lot of restrictions, people booking today are looking generally more often for the summer holiday and the summer holiday period in Europe as higher ADRs on most short-term stays. So those 2 mix effects are really helping the ADR picture. And we expect that both the phenomenon that I talked about in terms of air and car and ADRs are likely to go through to Q2 as well. But we do think that ADRs will start to be driven down again in the second half due to a couple of reasons. Again, the like-for-like ADRs are under pressure. As an example, our stayed ADRs in the first quarter were down mid-teens if you exclude regional mix, that's more of a kind of like-for-like comparison. So a like-for-like comparison is more likely to kind of be exposed in the second half. Regional mix may continue to help. But then we do think that this earlier booking of the summer benefit of -- or the summer bookings will fade and the reported ADRs will become more comparable with the underlying state ADRs, and those will converge back together more in the second half than they did in the first half. So some interesting phenomenas going on with mix and with booking window in Europe driving what we're going to see in Q1 and Q2,"

We can do things with merchandising. And we can also do things with things like promotions like back-to-travel, also their areas like brands. So there are multiple levers we can pull to drive growth above market where we believe there are opportunities to do so. And we believe that the recovery obviously presents a very dynamic environment for everybody. And we want to make sure that we are taking advantage of opportunities that we can either make or made for us and those are things that would, in the short term, impact margins.

I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden.  
I am pleased to start by reporting further improvement in our accommodations business, with first quarter room nights declining 54% versus Q1 2019, which was 6 percentage points better than our fourth quarter 2020 decline. This improvement was driven by solid signs of increasing travel demand in certain countries and by our team's strong execution. David will provide the details on our first quarter results in his remarks.
As we have said before, we believe that the rate of recovery for travel will depend heavily on the rate and severity of new COVID-19 cases, the timing of effective and broad-based vaccine distribution and hopefully, even more effective treatments in the future. While the pace of vaccine distribution remains frustratingly slow in most places around the world, Israel, the U.K. and the U.S. are benefiting from successful vaccine distribution programs. In each of these countries, we have seen encouraging booking trends, which supports our view that vaccine distribution is a key to unlocking pent-up travel demands.
In our own survey work earlier in the year, we found that over 70% of Americans said that the early distribution stage of COVID-19 vaccines made them feel more hopeful and optimistic about traveling in 2021. As countries ramp up vaccine distribution, which we are now starting to see in more European countries, we believe that we will start to see booking strength expand to more parts of the world.
While there are encouraging signs of recovery in some countries right now, the current situation in other countries, such as India, where we are seeing staggering increases in COVID-19 cases and an enormous human tragedy happening, reminds us that recovery is not underway everywhere. And unfortunately, in some countries, the situation is getting worse. 
Last week, the World Health Organization warned that the pace of the pandemic is accelerating. We are mindful that governments may continue to take actions, such as general area lockdowns or reintroducing travel restrictions, including barring people from high-infection locations from entering the country. Any of these actions can have an impact on our performance, and it's difficult to predict when and to what extent such actions may be taken in the future. Furthermore, international travel must recover for there to be a complete global travel recovery, and many governments may be cautious in fully opening international travel for some time.
Focusing on the U.S., where the vaccination program is going well. I am very pleased with our first quarter results in the U.S. and the strong rebound in U.S. travel demand. For Q1 in the U.S., we had positive room night growth versus Q1 2019, and it was our strongest performing major country. These results were driven by domestic bookings as our international business is still very slow. 
We were pleased to see improvements in our U.S. room night trends each month in Q1 and these improvements continued into April. This strength in the market benefited all of our travel products and helped drive the highest number of air tickets ever booked in a single quarter for our company, and we know that both Priceline and Booking.com had good U.S. results during the first quarter.
In this improving environment, we continue to press ahead with one of our most important strategic strategies, strengthening the Booking.com brand in the U.S. You may have seen Booking.com's U.S. back-to-travel promotional campaign that we launched in April, which offered a $50 post-stay promotional travel credit for U.S. travelers who activated promotion in the Booking.com app and booked travel by the end of May. This is just one example of the marketing methods that we will be employing to increase awareness of the Booking.com brand in the U.S. And in this case, drive further consumer engagement with our app.  
We also remain focused on expanding the supply of Booking.com's alternative accommodation offering in the U.S. and we targeted and signed new properties to the platform in the quarter. However, we recognize there is more work to be done to improve the breadth of this product in the U.S. During the first quarter, we continued to execute against other key strategic priorities, such as expanding Booking.com's payment platform and building the connected trip vision.  
Regarding our integrated payment platform at Booking.com, we have made recent progress primarily through increased adoption by our supply partners in the U.S. As I have mentioned previously, this platform provides payment options favored by both travelers and our supplier partners across hotels, alternative accommodations, cars, flight and attractions and is foundational for enabling our connected trip strategy. 
The connected trip is our vision of a multiproduct offering, including accommodations, flight, ground transportation, attractions and dining, connected by our payment network and ultimately supported by personalized intelligence to provide a friction with seamless experience for our bookers, all the way from first thinking about the initial booking to experiencing their trip, to arriving back home. Building out our full connected trip's vision will be a multiyear endeavor. 
However, we expect that our business will benefit from the steps we are taking to achieve this vision long before reaching the ultimate end state. For example, developing a robust flight product at Booking.com gives us the ability to engage with flight bookers early in their travel journey and allows us an opportunity to cross-sell our accommodation and other services to these bookers. We have not had these opportunities historically at Booking.com, given its accommodation-only focus in the past.
As we think about the journey for building the connected trip, this year, we'll be focused on enabling travelers to book the major elements of their trip in one place on Booking.com. This means we will be working to build up our non-accommodation products like flights, ground transportation and attractions by increasing supply as well as exposing more of our customers to these products.   
In Booking.com's flight offering, we are now live in 18 countries with the most recent launch in the U.K. We can now expose a large segment of customers to flight as these 18 countries collectively represented more than half of Booking.com's room nights booked in 2019. Booking.com's flight offering is now fully metered in the app, and while early, we are in the process of beginning to utilize marketing channels to bring potential customers to the product.  
On attractions, we have continued to expand the breadth of supply available to our travelers through our recent partnership with Viator along with our ongoing partnership with Musement that was announced last year. We see real benefits of a strong attractions offering, given the potential bundling opportunities as well as the ability to increase travel engagement with the app, while travelers are in destination.  
Across many of our key strategic priorities, I have mentioned the app, which indicates the importance of the app for our business. We've been investing in the app platform for some time, and we'll continue to invest as the app becomes the center of our connected trip experience. In addition, we see better customer loyalty, lower customer acquisition costs and more opportunities to engage directly with travelers through our app. 
Booking.com was the most downloaded travel app globally in the first quarter, according to a leading third-party research firm. We now see over 2/3 of our bookings come through the mobile devices, the majority of which are on the app. One of Booking Holdings' goals is to do well in the area of sustainability. I was very pleased to recently make public our 2020 Sustainability Report, and one achievement that I am particularly proud of is Booking Holdings becoming operationally carbon-neutral in 2020. 
This is a significant milestone for our business and one, we are working towards even prior to the pandemic. We intend to remain carbon-neutral in our operations in the future and look forward to making progress on our sustainability strategy, including diversity and inclusion and sustainable travel.
In conclusion, the exact shape and timing of the full recovery for travel remains uncertain. However, I'm encouraged by the signs of recovery we are seeing in some countries, and I'm confident that we will eventually see a strong recovery in travel demand globally. That being said, we are likely to experience volatility between now and then, with some countries recovering well, others beginning to recover and unfortunately, some getting worse. 
I'm proud of the actions that our teams across Booking Holdings continue to take to strengthen our company's position and execute against our strategic priorities. We are thinking about our business beyond just getting back to 2019 levels demand and we are focused on building a larger and faster-growing business that generates more earnings after the recovery and for the long run.  
I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden."

I'll review our operating results for the first quarter and provide some color on the trends we've seen so far in the second quarter. To avoid the comparison to the initial spread of the pandemic in 2020, all growth rates are relative to the comparable period in 2019, unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. 
I also want to remind you that during the period of bookings recovering, revenue will recover more slower than bookings due to timing differences, and this will impact our booking to revenue take rates.  
Now on to our results for the first quarter. On our February earnings call, we discussed the improvements in trends we saw starting in the middle of January and continuing into February, driven by domestic travel in most parts of the world. The improving trends continued into March, resulting in our Q1 reported room nights declining 54% versus Q1 2019, which was a 6% improvement versus the decline we reported in Q4. As a reminder, reported room nights include the impact of cancellations.  
The improvements in the Q1 room night decline rate versus Q4 was driven by the U.S. and Europe. While Asia and rest of world declines were about the same in Q1 as they were in Q4. The U.S. was the strongest performing in major country in Q1 and had a positive room night growth versus 2019 for the full quarter. The trends in the U.S. improved through Q1 with very strong room night growth versus 2019 for the month of March. Spring break was a contributor to growth in March. U.S. domestic room nights growth was positive for each month's month of the quarter, with very strong growth for the full quarter.  
In Q1, other countries also experienced very strong domestic room night growth, including Russia and Australia, and we saw continued strengthening in domestic bookings in Israel. While Europe improved for the full quarter compared with Q4, we did see trends soften towards the end of March, driven by rising COVID case counts and new impositions of travel restrictions. Europe was the least recovered region in terms of room nights booked in Q4 and it remained the least recovered region in Q1.
Mobile bookings, particularly through our apps, continued to represent over 2/3 of our total room nights. Our direct channel gained share both sequentially and year-on-year. Domestic room nights represented about 85% of our reported room nights in Q1, in line with our Q4 2020 mix of room nights and up significantly versus 2019. Our cancellation rates continued to be elevated versus 2019 in the quarter, but improved from levels we saw in Q4.
The booking window at Booking.com remains shorter than it was in the first quarter 2019 as we continued to see a higher mix of near-term bookings. However, the booking window contracted less than it did in the fourth quarter. As we noted on the last call, in January and February, we saw an expansion of the booking window versus 2019 in Western Europe and this expansion continued into March as the share of further out bookings, including those we saw in travel, increased versus the same time in 2019. Due to the situation in Europe with new COVID cases, vaccination rates and travel restrictions, bookings are generally either very near term or for the summer period.  
The overall mix of customers booking alternative accommodations on Booking.com in Q1 was about the same in -- as Q1 last year. As we noted last quarter, Europe is where we have our highest mix of alternative accommodations, and Europe was the slowest growing region in the first quarter, which negatively impacted our alternative accommodation mix on a global basis. The mix of alternative accommodation bookings in Europe increased by several percentage points year-over-year.
Gross bookings declined 53% in Q1, which is less than the decline in reported room nights, primarily due to strong performance in our flights business and partially offset by a 1% decline in average daily rates for accommodations versus 2019. Airline tickets booked in the first quarter were up 49% versus 2019, driven by strong growth at Priceline and by flight bookings at Booking.com and Agoda, both of which did not have flight products in Q1 2019.  
Our accommodations' average day rates only declined 1% versus 2019, benefiting from a higher mix of North America, which is a higher ADR region. Excluding regional mix effects, ADRs were down approximately mid-single digits. ADRs in the quarter were helped by the higher mix of summer bookings in Western Europe, which typically have higher ADRs.  
Consolidated revenue for the first quarter was $1.1 billion and decreased 61% versus 2019. Revenue in the quarter declined more than gross bookings due to bookings made in the quarter that are expected to check in, in future quarters, at which point in time the revenue will be recognized. 
Take rates in Q1 were a little less than 10%, largely driven by these timing differences. As you recall, we discussed the impact of timing on take rates in 2020 and 2021 during our last call. We expect timing to impact take rates all year, assuming the booking growth continues to improve during the year.
The 61% reduction in revenue resulted in an adjusted EBITDA loss of $195 million in the quarter. We significantly reduced our variable expense lines like marketing, sales and other, are more fixed expenses in Q1 were broadly in line with the commentary we provided on our last call. 
Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line, decreased 61% versus 2019. Marketing expenses declined more than gross bookings due to an increase -- due to an increase in our direct mix and slightly higher ROIs in paid channels. 
Sales and other expenses in Q1 were lower than they were in Q4 on a dollar basis, which was slightly better than our expectations. Personnel expenses were in line with our expectations. Q1 expenses were higher than they were in Q4 on a dollar basis, due primarily to increased stock-based compensation expenses and seasonal increases in benefit costs, partially offset by a higher amount of savings in Q1 relating to restructuring actions we have taken.  
G&A expenses were lower in Q1 than they were in Q4 on a dollar basis versus our expectation for them to be about in line due to lower-than-expected personnel-related costs and professional fees. Information technology expenses were higher in Q1 than they were in Q4 on a dollar basis, but were lower than our expectations due to timing of spend. 
Finally, we recorded $8 million of restructuring charges in Q1, which was lower than our prior expectations primarily due to timing of real estate restructuring charges. And note, these restructuring charges are included in our non-GAAP results.
We recorded a non-GAAP net loss of $215 million in the quarter. Our Q1 non-GAAP tax rate of 38% was meaningfully higher than our 2019 tax rate of 19% due to the greater impact of non-tax deductible expenses on a lower base of earnings. On a GAAP basis, we had an operating loss of $311 million in Q1. We recorded a GAAP net loss of $55 million in the quarter, helped by an income tax benefit of $223 million. Our Q1 tax rate of 80% was meaningfully higher than our 2019 tax rate of 21% due to the impact of nontax deductible expenses on lower base of earnings and the impact of discrete items recorded in the quarter. 
Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q1 ending cash investment balance of $16.4 billion benefited from the $2 billion raised in our Eurobond offering completed in March. In April, we used all the proceeds from the Eurobond offering to redeem to higher coupon senior notes that we issued earlier in the pandemic last year. These refinancing actions we took will result in approximately $70 million of annualized interest rate expense savings and were NPV-positive transactions.  
Adjusting our Q1 ending cash investments for the redemption of the 2 senior notes that happened in April will result in a balance of $14.4 billion, which is down from our December ending balance of $14.8 billion. We had a $207 million operating cash flow -- operating cash outflow in the quarter, driven primarily by change in working capital, which represented a use of cash of about $216 million in the quarter. 
We will continue to focus on maintaining a strong liquidity position, given the high level of uncertainty created by the COVID pandemic. And consistent with our comments over the last year, we've halted our repurchases of our stock and will not initiate repurchases until we have better visibility into the shape and timing of a recovery.  
Now on to our thoughts for the second quarter. There continues to be considerable uncertainty about the shape and timing of recovery for travel, which means that we are unable to provide detailed guidance at this time. April room nights declined about 43% versus 2019, which was better than the decline in March. Domestic room night growth was about flat versus 2019 for the month of April, the best monthly result for domestic room nights since last summer.
On a regional basis, the U.S. continued to have very strong room night growth in April and was above March levels. Europe room nights declines were better in April than in March, recovering from a softening of trends we saw at the end of March and the first week of April. Room night declines in Europe were down over 50% in April. 
Asia room night declines worsened in April versus March as outbreaks in new cases increases -- increased, vaccination progress has been slow and governments continued to impose restrictions on travel. Asia was the least recovered region in April. The rest of world declines were about the same in April as they were in Q1 and Q4.  
While difficult to predict with accuracy, if current trends continue, Q2 room night declines could be a few percentage points better than in April. To give you a snapshot of what we are seeing recently, room night declines over the last 7 days of April were about 38%. As I noted earlier, in Western Europe, the booking window expanded in Q1. This expansion continues into April, and we continue to see positive summer booking trends in Western Europe. Across all of Western Europe, gross bookings for the summer period are now within 30% of where they were at the same time in 2019. And for the U.K., they're now at about the same level as we were at the same time in 2019. We remind you that the significant majority of the summer bookings are cancelable.  
Turning to the income statements. As I said, we expect Q2 room night declines could be a few percentage points better than the decline in April. We expect Q2 gross bookings to decline slightly less than room nights, driven by the same trends that we saw in the first quarter. 
We expect future revenue to decline more than gross bookings due to timing factors we have discussed. As a result, we expect our Q2 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings will improve from Q1, but will be a few percentage points lower than in Q2 of 2019. We expect marketing expenses in Q2 will decline a little more than gross bookings, but less than revenue. We expect sales and other expenses in Q2 to be up significantly versus Q1 on a dollar basis and will be a higher percentage of revenue due to higher gross booking volumes in the second quarter as well as an increase in the mix of gross bookings processed on a merchant basis. 
We expect personnel expenses in Q2 will be about the same as they were in Q1 on a dollar basis. Compared with Q1, SBC and benefit expenses are expected to be less, but this is offset by an increase in bonus accruals, which are recorded proportional to revenue.  
We expect G&A expenses in Q2 will be higher than Q1 on a dollar basis, driven by higher personnel-related costs such as recruiting and T&E as well as higher professional fees and digital service taxes. We expect IT expenses in Q2 will be higher than Q1 on a dollar basis due to increased investments in security, data privacy and some operational systems enhancements, including some deferred expenses from Q1. We expect -- we currently estimate the full year restructuring charge related to our actions at Booking.com will be approximately $30 million, and we expect to record about half of these charges in the second quarter.  
Given what we just explained, especially the timing difference between recovery of bookings and revenue, we expect to record an EBITDA loss in Q2, albeit less of a loss than recorded in Q1. Depending upon how demand develops during the quarter, this could potentially be a small EBITDA loss in Q2.  
For the full year 2021, we continue to expect that the overall environment for travel will improve during the year, but the shape and timing of that improvement remained uncertain. As Glenn mentioned in his remarks, while we're seeing recovery and other encouraging signs in some countries, other countries and regions are struggling with a rapidly growing COVID wave. 
Globally, the number of new cases reported is increasing, with a record 5.7 million new cases recorded the week of April 19th. This is directly impacting our business across much of April -- of Asia.
As a reminder, about the [ kinks ] of our model during the recovery, we continue to expect if we see continued recovery in 2021, there'll be more bookings made in 2021 that will check in, in 2022 than there were bookings made in 2020 that checked in, in 2021. This timing factor could have a meaningfully negative impact on our revenue as a percentage of gross bookings and also drive deleverage in our marketing expenses in 2021 as we incurred the majority of our market expenses at the time of booking. 
To remind you, in 2018 and 2019, our revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was approximately 15.6%. This increased to 19.2% in 2020. We expect this percentage will be well below 15.6% in 2021, and the faster the recovery occurs, the lower this percentage will be.  
Before closing, there's been a lot of interest in our commentary in February about the longer-term model for our business. And I want to reiterate what we said previously and also provide some more color. We continue to believe it will be years, not quarters, before we see a full recovery of the travel market, especially international travel. 
Looking beyond 2021, we continue to look forward to being a larger business with more diverse offerings and with more earnings than we had prior to COVID. We also remain focused on the potential for higher growth and market share. We expect to continue to have industry-leading EBITDA margin rates albeit most likely at levels below those in 2019, driven by mix shifts within the business, as I discussed on the last call.
As a reminder, these mix shifts include the continued growth of payments and the growth of flights and other connected trip verticals, which will add revenue and EBITDA at much lower margin rates than traditional accommodations.  
As we think about the future shape of our accommodation business, there are a few factors to consider. As discussed on the last call, we expect our personnel expenses in 2021 to be about the same as in 2019 as the savings from restructuring actions taken in 2020 are expected to be offset by personnel run rate investments made pre-COVID and personnel investments expected in 2021. Of course, some of these investments are to support payments and the connected trip.  
As we look beyond 2021, the $370 million in savings from our restructuring actions were mainly in volume-related functions, meaning that as volumes grow back, the levels which we expect -- which means as volumes go beyond the levels we expect in 2021, we'll need to add expenses back to business. 
As we've mentioned before, we look to do this in cost-effective ways, but the work will come back. And when added to our 2021 personnel cost base, will put pressure on our accommodation business EBITDA margins relative to 2019 at the same level of volumes we had in 2019 and at the same growth rate.
Of course, there are offsetting factors that could improve margins, including variable cost efficiencies from additional scale as we grow beyond 2019 volumes from fixed cost efficiencies and from increased direct mix.  
The last thought I'd like to leave you with on this topic is that we believe that the recovery of the travel market will create opportunities to invest to gain share in accommodations, which could put pressure on margins during the period of share gains. 
In conclusion, we are pleased to see the recovery we discussed in February continued into March and April in some parts of the world, leading to improvement in our top line metrics. We're also watching the spread of COVID and the distribution of effective vaccines very carefully and realize that this may lead to volatility -- continued volatility ahead. We remain confident that we can emerge from this crisis in a stronger position.
With that, we'll take your questions. And Grace, we'll hand over to you to open the line for questions."

We have basically said that Europe is, of course, our largest region. Historically, if you think kind of roughly 50% or maybe a little bit more, you wouldn't be far off being correct. Asia, we said historically, again, pre-COVID is -- was about 20%, with no single country being more than low single digits. And that means that you've really got 30% left for U.S. and rest of the world combined. So that is our pre-COVID mix. 
Obviously, that mix has changed a little bit with the dynamic of what's happened recently. Obviously, the U.S. has gone up as that's been the most recovered marketplace. So that's the historic reference points.
In terms of last summer, we saw a couple of things. We, of course, did see after the first wave came down, we saw people getting more confident with traveling. Of course, vaccines were still not available at that point in time. So people were kind of traveling quite carefully and traveling locally.
What we have seen, and we saw it in several places, what we've seen so far is a very consistent trend that when cases come down, when the vaccination rates go up, when government restrictions start to lift, good things happen. We see that happening in the U.S. right now, we see that happening in Israel. 
We mentioned a couple of other areas that are doing better than average. So our expectation is that we'll see those positive trends start to occur in other parts of the world, particularly in Europe as things are starting to improve. As we mentioned, we are seeing things improving on April versus March, and Europe is now no longer the least recovered region."

Do you expect it to recover back? Or do you expect it to revert back to where it was before that is alternative accommodations as a percentage of your lodging mix? Or would you expect it to be somewhat elevated post-COVID just because of the greater exposure that a lot of consumers had to that during the crisis?"

And I'll let David talk about the mix, and he can talk about because we have more in Europe than in the U.S. I'll let him go through that, to very certainly why we are where we are. 
In terms of the future, here's the situation. We have been saying for many, many years, and everyone is aware of this, that people have been more interested in the alternative accommodation. This is a global phenomenon. And it's been going up at a steady rate for some time. COVID created a step-functional change where people who may never have thought about an alternative accommodations, now they were thinking, I want to go to a home that's not near people, maybe near the beach or near the mountains, and I feel safer there.
Now having tried that in the future, the question, as you just asked is, will people go back to their former habits of some people going to hotels, some people go home, will it be going to be a more gradual increase and will it be a drop back first and then back up? I don't think anybody really knows. 
But I would make the guess that people having tried the alternative accommodations during the pandemic, will forever have it in their consideration set. And they may not always use it, they will choose what type of property fits their needs. But now because it is part of their consideration set, I think there is a functional change in increased mix in the long run.
That being said, for us, we do both. We have the greatest selection of both hotels and non-hotel accommodations together combined so we feel we are very well positioned globally for that -- though I have spoken in the past, in some regions, we are definitely insufficient supply that we need to build up. 
And David, if you want to explain again about the issue because of mix in terms of geographies and the mix in properties."

Mark, let me just explain that maybe in a slightly different way. So starting with Europe. If you just looked out our business within Europe, you only looked at that lens, you would see alternative accommodation mix in Q1 this last year, up a fair amount compared to Q1 of '20 and also versus Q1 of 2019. 
So within Europe, where we have our largest mix of alternative accommodations, we see an increase in mix. But you also remember, I said that Europe in Q1 was our lowest performing region. And of course, the highest performing region was the U.S., where we have a much lower mix of alterative accommodation. So that mix effect means that in total, our alternative accommodation mix did not increase, but in Europe, for example, where it's the largest, it did increase a fair amount. So mix effect is really the biggest reason. 
In total, in Q1, the mix also of accommodation will be very similar to the 30% number we gave out for all of FY '20. But again, within different regions, there are mix shifts occurring."

There are some incremental expenses, obviously, in our other lines as well related to running the payments program, but the biggest variable costs are sitting sales and other. And as we mentioned, in 2020, the payments business operated very close to breakeven when factoring, particularly the variable costs into account, which is an improvement from what it was before and it's obviously an enabler of the business, as Glenn just articulated.

And on what's going on between the dynamic between room night growth and booking growth. There are a couple of factors going on here. One, I mentioned the fact that we're doing -- that we're seeing better booking growth performance from flights because of volume. And also, we're doing -- even though the units are down 4% to 6% in car, there's actually a fairly good increase in rates for cars. So total bookings, the TTV is down better for both flights and cars than it is for accommodations. 
But the biggest factor is really what's going on with ADRs, and there has been a bit of a shift in what we've seen even in the last couple of months. And we are -- saw that ADRs in the quarter were only down 1%. 
Now I would say there's a couple of things. The like-for-like ADRs are absolutely still under pressure due to lower occupancy rates. But there are some mix benefits that really impacting the year-on-year comparison. The first mix benefit was the mix shift towards the U.S. as the U.S. really starts to accelerate, particularly in March. You saw a really fast pickup in growth rates in March that we were not forecasting when we last met. U.S. until that was a positive for room night growth but also for ADRs. And also in Europe, what's happening is right now because there are still a lot of restrictions, people booking today are booking generally more often for the summer holiday and the summer holiday period in Europe as higher ADRs than most short-term stays. 
So those 2 mix effects are really helping the ADR picture. And we expect that both the phenomenon that I talked about in terms of air and car and ADRs are likely to go through to Q2 as well. But we do think that ADRs will start to be driven down again in the second half due to a couple of reasons. Again, the like-for-like ADRs are under pressure. 
As an example, our stayed ADRs in the first quarter were down mid-teens if you exclude regional mix, that's more of a kind of like-for-like comparison. So a like-for-like comparison is more likely to kind of be exposed in the second half. Regional mix may continue to help. But then we do think that this earlier booking of the summer benefit of -- or the summer bookings will fade and the reported ADRs will become more comparable with the underlying state ADRs, and those will converge back together more in the second half than they did in the first half. 
So some interesting phenomena going on with mix and with booking window in Europe, driving what we're going to see in Q1 and Q2."

I mean, clearly, in a business like ours, there's always a trade-off between growth and profitability or growth in margins, particularly in the short term. And the areas that we would expect to be leaning into, there are a number of initiatives that we can drive to lean into to drive further growth. 
Obviously, we need to be smart. We need to be nimble. We need to look at where the pockets of opportunity are. But we continue to be, I think, a very good marketer in the paid channels and look at those demand opportunities and really have the opportunity to lean into that where we think we can and where we think we can actually gain incremental traffic.
We can do things with merchandising. And we can also do things with things like promotions like back-to-travel, also there are areas like brands. So there are multiple levers we can pull to drive growth above market where we believe there are opportunities to do so. And we believe that the recovery, obviously, presents a very dynamic environment for everybody. And we want to make sure that we are taking advantage of opportunities that we can either make or made for us and those are the things that would, in the short term, impact margins.
Bear in mind, as we talked about what's happening this year, during periods of time when bookings are growing faster than revenue, that impacts the business because generally, our expenses are associated upfront with capturing the booking and the revenue comes later. So those are all the things that go into the dynamic around growth versus margin in the accommodation business."

I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. Despite a travel environment that continues to be very challenging, we closed out 2020 by delivering fourth quarter results",1868,"Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' Fourth Quarter Conference Call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. 
Despite a travel environment that continues to be very challenging, we closed out 2020 by delivering fourth quarter results that were a bit better than the expectations we talked about on our last earnings call. David will provide the details on the fourth quarter results in his remarks. For my time, I will first briefly reflect on our execution during the extremely difficult year of 2020. Then I will share our thoughts and strategic priorities for 2021 and beyond. 
Without a doubt, 2020 presented the biggest disruption to modern global travel the world has ever seen, and our results for full year 2020 were down substantially from 2019. However, travelers still booked 355 million room nights through our platforms during 2020, and we remained profitable by generating approximately $880 million in adjusted EBITDA. Delivering these results during this unprecedented and unpredictable year is a credit to our team's relentless efforts to provide the best value and service to our traveler customers and to our supply partners, while all the time remaining incredibly focused on operating efficiently. 
When we spoke to you on our earnings call in May of 2020, we outlined a series of plans that would help us navigate through the COVID-19 crisis. First, we said we would stabilize the business from the immediate shock of the crisis. Second, we said we would optimize the business for the expected decrease in travel demand over the next few years. And third, we said we would position the business to be able to capture travel demand when it returns. Based on our accomplishments in 2020, I can confidently say that we executed well against these plans. 
In the beginning of the crisis, we successfully stabilized the business by taking several immediate steps, including quickly closing offices and smoothly transitioning to a distributed work environment to protect the health and safety of our employees, which was and continues to be a top priority; working closely with travelers and supply partners to process the unprecedented level of travel changes and cancellations; and bolstering liquidity and preserving cash by halting stock buybacks, cutting nonessential costs and raising over $4 billion in capital through a debt offering. Then we began the process and have almost entirely completed our work to optimize the business for the decrease in travel demand through the restructuring actions we have taken at each of our brands across the company. 
As a result of these actions, our 2020 year-end headcount decreased approximately 23% versus 2019, primarily in volume-related positions. We expect these reductions to result in annualized cost savings of about $370 million in personnel expenses, with about $110 million of savings recognized in 2020. While our work is never done in terms of finding opportunities for cost efficiencies, we believe that headcount reductions needed to optimize the business for the current demand environment are now generally behind us. 
Finally, we believe we have positioned the business well for when travel demand returns. We continue to make progress against our key strategic priorities during 2020, and this progress has continued as we have moved into 2021. We remain active in performance marketing channels and are being agile and adapting our approach to this very uncertain environment. And we will leverage our learnings over the past year to continue to capture demand in these performance channels at appropriate ROIs. In addition, our marketing team has been working hard to develop campaigns and messaging that we will deploy when we believe the time is right to encourage people to travel once again and use our services. 
As we think ahead about 2021, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the exact shape and timing of the recovery for travel. The rate of recovery will depend heavily on the rate of new COVID-19 cases, including new potentially more transmissible and more dangerous variants, and on the timing of effective and broad-based vaccine distribution, which we believe will be a key step in helping people feel safe to travel again. 
We are tracking early signs of encouraging summer booking trends in Western Europe, primarily the U.K. and Germany, relative to what we are seeing globally, although in each case, gross booking levels are still below where we were at the same point in time in 2019. While seeing green shoots of the summer booking season's positive, it's uncertain whether these trends will continue and whether we'll see this summer booking strength expand into other countries and regions, and of course, whether these advanced bookings will turn into stayed room nights or will be canceled. What would be most helpful would be continued government action around the world to accelerate vaccine distribution while providing direct and indirect support to the entire travel and hospitality industry. 
Additionally, international travel remains extremely depressed, and a recovery will not be possible until government restrictions on international travel are lifted or modified so travelers, who can show they are safe travelers, are allowed to travel freely. As you know, our international business has been a great advantage for us historically, and we expect it will be in the future, but we anticipate this to be a longer recovery. 
We know that people have a very strong desire to travel. We saw this firsthand in 2020 when we witnessed a strong improvement in our booking trends from the lows in April through the peak summer travel season, driven in part by pent-up demand as people came out of lockdowns. The travel that was booked last year was much more domestic-oriented than in prior years as many people adapted to the restrictive travel environment and still found a way to take a trip. With many travel restrictions now in place around the world, we believe there is once again a high level of pent-up demand for travel. But when this demand will be fully unlocked is, of course, difficult to predict and will depend on vaccination rates and other factors. 
While the timing of the pickup in travel demand is beyond our control, we are focused on the things we can control, primarily better positioning our business by continuing to invest and execute against our key strategic priorities, including expanding the payment platform at Booking.com, building out our connected trip capabilities and growing our market share in the United States. Our integrated payment platform at Booking.com provides payment options favored by both travelers and our supplier partners across hotels, alternative accommodations, cars, flights and attractions. It is strategically important as it enables merchandising capabilities that we haven't had access to historically at Booking.com, but we expect to utilize selectively in the future to help drive growth. In addition, this payment platform is foundational for enabling our connected trip strategy. 
We continue to make progress expanding the payment platform with approximately 22% of Booking.com's gross bookings in 2020 processed on the platform. This is up from approximately 15% in 2019 and was less than 4% back in 2017, so this is a dramatic shift in our large-scale business. We are optimistic about recent improvements in our Booking.com U.S. payment platform, which will enable increased utilization of payments in this critical market. We expect to see a higher percentage of Booking.com's gross bookings processed on the payment platform in 2021 as compared to 2020 and expect these increases to continue beyond 2021. 
Our connected trip vision is a multiproduct offering, including accommodations, flight, ground transportation and attractions and dining, connected by our seamless payment network and ultimately supported by personalized intelligence, to provide a frictionless experience for our bookers all the way from the initial booking to experiencing their trip. We're building towards this vision because we believe the connected trip will drive increased loyalty and frequency and will enhance the growth of our accommodation business through additional customer acquisition and merchandising opportunities. Developing a robust flight product at Booking.com remains an important strategic component of the connected trip, as it gives us the ability to engage with flight bookers early in their travel journey and allows us an opportunity to cross-sell our accommodation and other products to those bookers. In the coming years, we expect flights will represent an increasing mix of our overall business, which will help drive incremental revenue and EBITDA dollars. 
As mentioned in the past, growing our share of the U.S. travel market remains a key strategic priority for our company, as the U.S. is one of the largest travel markets in the world and we have historically underindexed there. We are taking several steps to increase our competitiveness in the U.S. market and are focused on making sure we are offering great value to our customers, improving our payments platform to enable bundling and merchandising opportunities, increasing overall consumer awareness of our Booking.com through marketing and expanding our alternative accommodations supply. While we have built a large and competitive alternative accommodations business globally, we believe we have a significant opportunity for improvement in the United States, which will involve product improvements, supply acquisition and raising consumer awareness of this type of inventory on Booking.com. 
Continuing to invest and execute against these 3 strategic priorities as well as capturing demand as travel recovers will be our focus in 2021. We believe successful implementation of these priorities is key to achieving higher growth rates, increasing market share, and eventually building a larger business with higher earnings than we had prior to COVID. We expect this larger business to have a higher mix of merchant transactions and non-accommodation products, both of which will negatively impact our EBITDA margin rates, but we expect it to continue to lead the travel industry in this metric. 
Finally, I want to address the European Commission's initial proposal for the Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act released in December. The European Commission has proposed regulations aimed at keeping markets fair and open, which is an ambition that we support. However, at the present time, it is not known for certain what the ultimate rules will be, how they might be applied or what the impact will be on us and other market participants. We are engaged with stakeholders to work towards regulations that tackle the legitimate problems of the large gatekeepers in the digital economy, of which we believe we are not one. We'll update you in the area during future calls. 
In conclusion, there are still tough days ahead of us and everyone in the travel industry. COVID case counts remain high, and the wider global distribution of vaccines is still too slow. However, I am more confident than ever in our long-term future, and we will at some point see a strong recovery in travel demand. I further believe that our company is very well positioned to capture this demand as it comes back. In the meantime, we will focus on what we can control, namely, investing in our business and executing against our strategic priorities to ensure we exit this crisis on a strong footing, which will enable us to build a larger and faster-growing business for the long run. 
I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden."

I'll review our operating results for the fourth quarter, provide some color on the trends we've seen so far in the first quarter and then discuss our expectations for 2021 and our longer-term operating model. To avoi",2957,"Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I'll review our operating results for the fourth quarter, provide some color on the trends we've seen so far in the first quarter and then discuss our expectations for 2021 and our longer-term operating model. To avoid the comparison to the initial spread of the pandemic in 2020, all growth rates for 2020 and 2021 are relative to comparable periods in 2019, unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. Now on to the results for the fourth quarter. 
On our November earnings call, we discussed the trends we saw throughout the third quarter and into early November, including the year-on-year decline in reported room nights worsening from about 43% in the third quarter to about 58% in October, and then further deteriorating to about 70% over the 7 days leading up to our November earnings call, driven by rising COVID case counts and many European countries and governments beginning to respond with impositions of travel restrictions. As a reminder, reported room nights include the impact of cancellations. 
The worsening trends we saw in early November improved a little, resulting in our reported room nights declining 60% for the fourth quarter. November proved to be the low point for the quarter. The decline in room night growth rates versus Q3 were driven by Europe, where growth rates declined quite considerably. Looking across the other regions, North America were similar to Q3. And Asia and the rest of world both improved compared to Q3. North America was the strongest region in Q4 with a significantly lower year-on-year decline in room nights than the other regions. 
Mobile bookings, particularly through our apps, continued to gain share in the fourth quarter and represented over 2/3 of our total room nights in Q4 and about 2/3 of 2020. We continue to -- we also continue to see growth in 50% of our total room nights come to us through the direct channel. 
Domestic room nights represented about 85% of our reported room nights in Q4, up significantly versus 2019, which was just below 50%. Our cancellation rates continue to be up year-over-year in the fourth quarter and also increased versus Q3. 
We continue to monitor other changes in Booking.com's customer booking behavior. The mix of customers booking alternative accommodations in Q4 were slightly lower than Q4 2019, while the full year was up slightly versus 2019. The slight decline in the overall mix of alternative accommodations in Q4 was due to the underperformance of the European region, which is where we have our highest mix of alternative accommodations. The mix of alternative accommodations continues to increase year-over-year within Europe in Q4. Booking.com's alternative accommodations represented about 30% of its reported room nights for the full year 2020. 
The booking window contracted versus 2019 in the fourth quarter at about the same rate as we saw in the third quarter, as customers continued to focus mainly on their short-term travel needs. Gross bookings declined 65% in Q4, which is a great decline in reported room nights due to the average daily rates for accommodations decreasing about 15% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. 
Consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.2 billion and decreased 63% year-over-year. As we expected, revenue in the quarter was less negatively impacted than gross bookings due to the fact that revenue benefited from check-ins in Q4 from bookings we received in the relatively strong third quarter. 
Our full year revenue is also significantly less impacted than our gross bookings, driven by the differences in the timing between bookings and revenue, which is recognized at check-in, primarily related to 2019 bookings that checked in, in Q1 2020. As a result of these timing factors, our full year revenue as a percent of gross bookings was 19.2%, which is significantly higher than the 15.6% in 2019 and 2018. If our revenue as a percentage of gross bookings in 2020 had been in line with 2019, revenue would have been more than $1 billion lower for the full year. The difference between 15.6% and 19.2% is all entirely explained by this timing difference. 
The 63% reduction in revenue resulted in an adjusted EBITDA loss of $38 million in the fourth quarter. While we significantly reduced our variable expense lines like marketing, sales and other, our more fixed expenses decreased to a lesser extent in Q4. As Glenn mentioned, we've almost entirely completed our restructuring actions to reduce personnel expenses to align our cost structure with the new demand environments. The [ savings ] recognized in our personnel expense line related to these actions was about $70 million in Q4 and about $110 million for the full year. We recorded charges of $74 million and $149 million related to these actions in the restructuring and other exit costs line for Q4 and the full year, respectively. 
Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line, decreased 61% year-over-year as we saw a significant reduction in demand in the paid channels. In addition, we substantially reduced our brand marketing spend in response to the diminished travel demand environment. Sales and other expenses decreased 45% year-over-year, primarily due to reduction in expenses associated with payment transactions, partially offset by a mix shift in customer service to outsourced call centers. 
Personnel expenses decreased 13% year-over-year, primarily due to restructuring actions I mentioned previously. G&A expenses decreased 36% year-over-year largely driven by reduced discretionary spend in such areas as T&E, lower indirect taxes and lower office expenses due to employees working remotely. Information technology expenses were up 1% year-over-year in the fourth quarter due to investments in software license fees related to cybersecurity and privacy software. 
Finally, we've broken out restructuring charges separately in operating expenses in the P&L. And I note that these restructuring charges are included in our non-GAAP results. 
We recorded a non-GAAP net loss of $23 million in the quarter. Our full year non-GAAP tax rate of 42% was meaningfully higher than our 2019 tax rate of 19% due to the greater impact of nontax deductible expenses on a lower base of earnings as well as the geographical distribution of earnings and losses. Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was driven by a change in our full year tax provision following better-than-expected pretax results in the fourth quarter. 
On a GAAP basis, we had an operating loss of $153 million in Q4. We recorded a GAAP net loss of $165 million in the quarter as the benefit from an unrealized $553 million pretax gain on our equity investments, primarily related to our investment in Meituan, was offset by income tax expenses of $410 million, $98 million of interest expense, and $61 million of FX remeasurement losses on our Eurobond. We excluded the unrealized gains and the related losses from our non-GAAP results. 
The $410 million of income tax expenses is primarily due to the discrete tax expense related to the Meituan unrealized gain and the change in our full year tax provision following better-than-expected results in the fourth quarter. Our full year GAAP tax rate of 90% was meaningfully higher than our 2019 tax rate of 18% due to reasons mentioned for our non-GAAP tax rate, with the nondeductible goodwill impairment charge driving additional significant impacts. 
Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q4 ending cash and investment balance decreased to $14.8 billion from our September ending balance of $14.9 billion due to an operating cash outflow, largely offset by the unrealized gains on our long-term investments. We had a $557 million operating cash outflow in the quarter driven primarily by changes in working capital, which represented a use of cash of about $400 million in the quarter as well as the net loss recorded in the quarter. The change in working capital driven by seasonal effects that were amplified by the slowdown in bookings from Q3. 
We will continue to focus on maintaining a strong liquidity position, given the high level of uncertainty created by the COVID pandemic. And consistent with our comments last quarter, we've halted repurchases of our stock, and we will not initiate repurchases until we have better visibility into the shape and timing of a recovery. 
Now onto our thoughts for the first quarter. And to remind you, we'll make comparisons with 2019 unless otherwise indicated. There continues to be considerable uncertainty about the shape and timing of the recovery for travel, which means we're unable to provide detailed guidance at this time. January room night declines were slightly worse than Q4, driven by the increasing spread of COVID-19, including the new strains with associated additional travel restrictions. However, starting in the middle of January, we saw an improvement in room night declines driven by domestic travel bookings in most parts of the world. And we've seen this improvement continue into February. In recent weeks, some regions have improved back to positive domestic room night growth. While difficult to predict with accuracy, if the domestic room night trends continue to improve, Q1 room night declines could be a few percentage points better than Q4. To give you a snapshot of what we're seeing recently, room night declines over the last 7 days were about 50%. 
In Q1, the overall booking window has contracted versus 2019, although to a lesser extent than we saw in the fourth quarter. In Western Europe, in January, we saw an expansion of the booking window versus 2019. And we've seen this expansion continue into February as the share of further out bookings, including those for summer travel, has increased. As Glenn noted in Western Europe, particularly in the U.K. and Germany, we have recently seen stronger summer booking trends relative to what we're seeing globally. And in these countries, gross bookings for summer period are within 25% of where they were at the same time in 2019. These stronger booking trends in Western Europe are currently being offset by weaker near-term booking trends in the region due to extensive travel restrictions. And we remind you that the significant majority of the summer bookings are cancelable. 
We're also encouraged to see that some countries are making notable progress with vaccinations, including Israel, UAE and the U.K. We are confident that when vaccinations are broadly available and when travel restrictions are lifted, people will return to travel. We saw this happen recently in Israel, where vaccination rates are the highest in the world. And after the national lockdown within Israel was eased on February 7, we quickly saw domestic bookings return to solid double-digit growth versus the same period in 2019. 
Turning to the income statement. As I said, we expect Q1 room nights -- Q1 room night declines could be a few percentage points better than Q4. We expect Q1 gross bookings to decline a few percentage points more than room nights due to continued pressure on local currency ADRs. We expect Q1 revenue to decline slightly more than gross bookings, assuming bookings continue to improve for the rest of the quarter. 
We expect margin expense in Q1 will decline at the same level as gross bookings. We expect sales and other expenses in Q1 will be similar to what they were in Q4 on a dollar basis, with some variability based upon where Q1 volumes land. 
We expect personnel expenses in Q1 will be slightly higher than they were in Q4 on a dollar basis, primarily due to increased SBC expenses and seasonal increase in benefit costs, partially offset by a higher amount of savings in Q1 related to restructuring actions we've taken. We expect that almost the full run rate from our personnel restructurings will be realized in Q1. 
We expect G&A expenses in Q1 will be about the same as they were in Q4 on a dollar basis. We expect the IT expenses will be higher than they were in Q4 on a dollar basis, primarily due to increased investments in security, data privacy and some operational system enhancements. We currently estimate the remaining restructuring charge related to actions in Booking.com will be about $40 million. And we expect to record more than half of these remaining charges in the first quarter. About half of the $40 million relates to personnel-related actions, and the other half relates to real estate. Given what we just explained, and reminding you that Q1 is our seasonally lowest-revenue quarter, we expect to report a greater EBITDA loss in Q1 than in Q4. 
For the full year 2021, I want to briefly walk you through some factors that we expect will impact our top line operating margins for the year. We expect the environment of travel to improve in -- during 2021, but the shape and timing of that recovery remains uncertain. We expect occupancy rates to remain below where they were pre-COVID, putting continued negative pressure on ADRs, which will result in our gross bookings being lower than our room nights. 
As I noted earlier, our revenue was less negatively impacted than our gross bookings in 2020 due to timing factors, which benefited our 2020 revenue by more than $1 billion. The opposite dynamic will happen when we experience an acceleration in bookings, which will lead to our gross bookings recurring faster than revenue. Said another way, if we see this acceleration in 2021, there will be more bookings made in 2021 that will check in, in 2022, than there were bookings made in 2020 that checked in, in 2021. This timing factor could have a meaningfully negative impact on our revenue as a percentage of gross bookings. So exactly how meaningful this impact will be depends upon how quickly our room nights and gross bookings accelerate in 2021. 
Due to these differences in the timing of bookings versus check in, we also expect deleverage in our marketing expenses in 2021 as we incur the majority of our market expenses at the time of booking. The most significant expense items in sales and other are payment processing costs and outsourced customer service expenses. We expect sales and other to be lower in 2021 than in 2019, but the reduction will be smaller than the reduction in revenue. 
A few comments to help you think about our less variable expenses for 2021 and how they'll most likely compare with 2019. We expect G&A to be down double digits versus 2019 driven by T&E, office and occupancy expenses, with some variability from DST taxes if new ones are enacted during the year. 
Personnel expenses are likely to be quite similar to 2019 on a dollar basis. To help you understand this better, there are a few factors that contribute towards this. Our personnel expense run rate immediately before COVID hit was about $200 million higher than 2019 actual personnel expenses. Less than half of this was the annualization of people expense we added during 2019. And the rest was from people expense added into the business in the first quarter of 2020. 
Our restructuring actions will reduce headcount expenses by approximately $370 million. So the impact of these 2 together will be to reduce personnel expenses by $170 million versus 2019. As we continue to invest in the business, we expect 2021 year-end headcount to be a little higher than at the end of 2020, with a mix shift towards pro and technical positions. This will add about $100 million in personnel expenses in 2021. 
And finally, SBC is expected to be higher than 2019 due to a few factors, including the modification of some stock awards in Q1 2021 and the issuance of stock options in 2020. Finally, IT expenses in 2021 will be higher than in 2019 due to investments in security, privacy and operational system enhancements to support our connected trip strategy. 
As we think beyond 2021, we're looking forward to being a larger business with more diverse offerings and with more earnings than we have prior to COVID. We're also focused on the potential for higher growth and market share. We continue to believe that it would be years and not quarters before travel returns to pre-COVID-19 levels. And when considering the shape of the business at that time, I'd like to draw your attention to 2 factors. 
The first is a mix shift within the business. The continued growth of payments and the growth of flights and other connected verticals will add revenue and EBITDA, but at much lower margin rates than traditional accommodations. Payments will add to revenue with offsetting expenses in sales and other, plus some additional personnel and other expenses. Flights and other connected trip verticals will add to bookings and revenue, but at lower take rates than accommodations, and will also require added personnel and other expenses as this business scales. 
The second is personnel. The restructuring actions we took in 2020 were mainly in volume-related functions, including customer service and credit collection. This means that as volumes grow beyond the levels we expect in 2021, we'll need to add expenses back to business. As we've mentioned before, we'll look to do this in cost-efficient ways, but the work will come back. 
We think it's important to include these considerations when thinking about the future shape of the business. As Glenn said, we expect to continue to have industry-leading EBITDA margin rates, albeit most likely at levels below those in 2019. 
In conclusion, we remain focused on what we can control and continue to execute against our strategic priorities. We're now more confident than ever that through these actions, we will emerge from this crisis in a stronger position. 
We'll now take your questions. And Grace, I'll turn it over to you to open the line for questions."

So on the efficiency side, we're always looking for ways to become more efficient within the business. As I mentioned, we have reduced these variable costs to the tune of about $370 million. As they come back, we will look at more efficient ways of getting that work done. The work will come back. It won't come back this year. We basically rightsized ourselves through what we think will be through 2021. But as volumes extend beyond what we think 2021 is likely to bring, those costs will come back. So we will look at more efficient ways to do some of those variable activities in terms of location, technology, what we do inside or where we deploy more partner resources, et cetera. 
And we also, Lloyd, continue to look at how we can drive efficiency in our fixed costs part of the business. That's not been the major focus for the last 12 months. The major focus has been surviving COVID. I think we've done a good job with that. But we do continue to kind of look at our costs across our personnel base, across our real estate, across our technology portfolios, across things like procurement, where we can continue to drive efficiencies within the business. So when we get to a more normalized environment, that's something else we can also take a look at driving as well.

So when changes happen, we can make adjustments. We can make changes. We can do things faster and better. And we have so much data to test with that we believe we can actually come out of these things sometimes better off than we were in the past.

So in regards to the home or alternative accommodations as we like to call it in Europe, I don't think we've talked much about regional exact share, and I'm not going to here. But I certainly -- we talked a little bit how Europe is our stronghold in that area. We're better there in the home area than other areas. 
But throughout the world, I think I can say to you that we are better in things that are less single property. We always want to increase the single property because we know that's an area where we can improve upon. So that is an issue right now. And with the pandemic, there certainly was a bit of a shift, for some people, that they wanted to be isolated away from other people. So certainly, there was more demand than in the past for the single-home area. That showed up much more in the U.S. for us, say, than Europe. Because Europe, we do have -- a greater amount of our home supply is the single property than, say, in the U.S. 
Look, it's an area we're going to continue to focus on, and I do believe right now in the environment there is that is a great product to have up on the shelf. That being said, in the future, we'll see how much that maintains or things go back more towards they used to be, where there's a different split between homes and hotels. 
In regard to your second question about relationship with hotel suppliers, obviously, we're doing everything we can to help our partners. And that's coming up with new ways to -- come up with promotions that they want to do. Telling them when we think there are spots in demand that they can come up with different types of closed user group prices that can help get them more demand. Coming out with ways that they can put together things in content in terms of safety and health, so that a traveler who looks on our site and sees their hotel and sees that it's a safe place to go, do all different things with them to try and improve their business. 
It's very difficult right now as you know, though, because let's face it, unless there's demand, you can have the greatest content in the world, but if people don't feel it's time to travel, they're not going to travel. But we're going to continue to do that. 
I do believe in terms of relationships, certainly as a distributor, when there is less demand, we are more valuable as a partner to them. In the time when there's very, very high occupancy rates, any hotel will say, ""Well, I don't need the distributor nearly as much."" But when they don't have as much occupancy rate, then they start looking for demand, and we have the benefit of being the largest platform for hotel demand in the world. So we are the place for them to come and get some more of that incremental demand, and we're continuing to work with them to make sure they do their best to get it."

As we scaled the company over many, many years, we had a very global approach, and we tried not to make changes solely for any particular market. Really believing that scaling the business, keeping everything the same was the best way to achieve a very, very large, global share of the business. That being said, we've come to a state where we recognize that we're continuing to be underindexed in the U.S. and maybe we need to make some changes there, which we are doing.

And we've talked about this numerous times of how we believe getting people to come back to us directly is a critical part of the strategy going forward. 
And certainly one of the ways we do that is by providing our loyalty version, which is our Genius program on Booking.com, which really does, we believe, give some real value to consumers. And that's something that we're going to continue on because in the end, it costs an awful lot of money, as we know, to get a new customer. It's cheaper to keep them. So we're going to keep on doing all the things we can to keep people coming back direct.

In regards to your second question, one of the things I mentioned was how uncertain the world is right now. And one of the things you're trying always to do is make sure you're spending money, but that's to create revenue. One issue is you pay the money upfront, a person books, but because so much of the business nowadays is being done on things that are cancelable, you don't know when change happens, all of a sudden, money you've spent, it doesn't end up in -- and increase the revenue you thought it was, and your ROI ends up very different. So we have to look at this very carefully, and we are approaching it in a cautious way.
But on the other hand, we don't want to be slow to the increase in demand. It's something -- we look at all the data very, very closely. That's about the best I can say is that, that's how we're handling it right now. We can't say anything more than that because we don't know what the future is going to be quite yet."

Another thing that we continue to build out in our attractions area, not a lot of people are actually buying attractions right now. But we haven't stopped getting more and more places and more and more content, so that when people do come back, they'll have attractions they can buy from us.

But yes, we were pleased to see that positive number there. One of the things to point out is as I just talked about a little bit, though, in the past, we didn't have air tickets coming from Booking.com and from -- and also, by the way, our Agoda brand also sells air tickets, too. Priceline, of course, has been selling air tickets since the start of the company. It's more than 2 decades ago. So it's easier when you add 2 more of our brand selling air tickets that hadn't done it in the past to have a positive number. 
And I want to point out, this is very early and these are very, very, very small numbers. So it's pleasant to see, but I wouldn't tell you too much except that we are on our journey. 
In regards to attractions for Booking.com, so it's yes, these are coming from third-party suppliers. We are partnering with them. They give us the inventory, so we sell it. We have a commercial relationship. And we're pleased. That's the way to go forward. Again, one can be anything or -- and you need to decide which ones you want to do first, but it's a lot -- you can't be everything. So it's a lot easier when you want to do a lot more things to partner with other people for things -- for people who already set up the things you need to get, so I'm pretty pleased about that. Again, I'll be even more pleased when people actually are back to traveling and start buying attractions more.

In terms of people, I -- we talked about this. We've been through the restructuring. I think we both said in our prepared remarks how we are satisfied for where we are right now. But we also made a very important point, how much of the restructuring dealt with jobs that are related to volume. And then as volume comes back, we need to bring people in to help cover it, but hopefully in a much more efficient way over time. So that thing.
In terms of being a hyper start-up, yes, we're -- look, we're always going incredibly hard in it and trying to get as much progress as we can on our strategic vision because we know that the travelers are going to come back, and we want to get ahead of that as fast as we can, so we can give them the greatest value and the greatest -- different types -- a way to travel as soon as we can.

On payments, let me clarify because I wasn't quite sure what you said upfront. But let me kind of clarify where we are on payments and the evolution of payment at Booking.com. So as we said in the prepared remarks, the percentage of our gross booking",294,"Yes. On payments, let me clarify because I wasn't quite sure what you said upfront. But let me kind of clarify where we are on payments and the evolution of payment at Booking.com. So as we said in the prepared remarks, the percentage of our gross bookings processed on the payment platform at Booking.com was 22% last year. That's up meaningfully from the 15% in 2019. That still means that the vast majority of bookings are not being processed via our payment transaction, they're still in the agency model. So we expect that payment adoption to continue to increase above the 22% this year and beyond. 
Payments is really super important for us for a number of reasons because we think we can deliver benefits to our customers, our partners, across all the different channels, hotels, alternative accommodations, flights, attractions, et cetera. It's also very important to enable merchandising, which we will use on a selective basis in certain markets. And it's also fundamental to enabling the connected trip where we want to have everything be -- able to be paid in one place. 
I'll give you an update on where we are from an income statement point of view relative to the evolution of payments. I'm pleased to say that payments on Booking.com was approximately breakeven in 2020. We've said it in prior years, we are still making some net investment in the platform. And we focus upon still scaling it out, but I expect to stay in that breakeven level as we scale out and grow the payments platform from here, obviously, with some potential minor differences year in, year out. We are now out of the breakeven situation on that payment platform, which is an update from where we were before."

Because a single-home property does cost more for the company because you do end up with more contacts. It's just by nature. It's not as professionally run, and you do end up with more costs. So we do, though, know that it's a product that people want, and we need to have it and we need to have more of it and that's absolutely correct. 
The great thing about this though is there is a trend towards more professionalization of the single-home property, where the person in the past may have gone onto a platform and just signed up on their own and tried to orchestrate it all by themselves. What you are seeing in the industry is more and more people, who want to rent out their single properties, going to different people who will do it for them, who will handle all the elements of it. And those people who are running these kind of -- we won't call them channel managers, but they're like a channel manager in a sense, they are able to bring these different, single-property owners and put them onto this site, that then is able to direct that -- to provide that supply to us or to somebody else. The great thing about it is these people are much more professional, and they are more easy to deal with. They are able to understand the right things that you need to do. So because of that professionalization of the industry, I believe we will be able to pick up more of the single-home properties faster than we had to in the past.

So people who perhaps in the past never would have thought of using alternative accommodations, perhaps last summer they didn't use it or they looked at it or something. And now it is in a consideration set. So going forward, what has happened is now there's a much larger amount of supply for any travelers to go look at. And what that means is any individual supplier in the marketplace is now facing more competition. Now as a distributor, I talked about it a little earlier why that is beneficial to the distributor now. 
And our business, which is so great because we have both, a great amount of the home product, that alternative accommodations, and we're one of the largest people at the hotels. So we have this great thing where the consumer, when they come, they can come to one place, us. And they're able to compare and contrast all the different types, all the different prices, understand all the different comments and reviews being left by people who previously stayed there. That gives us a great, great benefit. 
So I am pleased with the way this is happening. And I -- will it go back? What will happen? How much will be -- mix be of home in the future versus hotel? I don't know. I don't think anybody can really guess. I think over many years, we've seen the trend going more and more people interested in alternative accommodations. The pandemic step-function it up higher. I don't know if that's now going to be a pause, maybe a dip down or continue upward. I don't know. But from my point of view, it's not that relevant in the sense that we provide both and we're going to keep getting both. So for me, I'm feeling pretty good about it."

I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. Despite a travel environment that continues to be very challenging, we closed out 2020 by delivering fourth quarter results",1868,"Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' Fourth Quarter Conference Call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. 
Despite a travel environment that continues to be very challenging, we closed out 2020 by delivering fourth quarter results that were a bit better than the expectations we talked about on our last earnings call. David will provide the details on the fourth quarter results in his remarks. For my time, I will first briefly reflect on our execution during the extremely difficult year of 2020. Then I will share our thoughts and strategic priorities for 2021 and beyond. 
Without a doubt, 2020 presented the biggest disruption to modern global travel the world has ever seen, and our results for full year 2020 were down substantially from 2019. However, travelers still booked 355 million room nights through our platforms during 2020, and we remained profitable by generating approximately $880 million in adjusted EBITDA. Delivering these results during this unprecedented and unpredictable year is a credit to our team's relentless efforts to provide the best value and service to our traveler customers and to our supply partners, while all the time remaining incredibly focused on operating efficiently. 
When we spoke to you on our earnings call in May of 2020, we outlined a series of plans that would help us navigate through the COVID-19 crisis. First, we said we would stabilize the business from the immediate shock of the crisis. Second, we said we would optimize the business for the expected decrease in travel demand over the next few years. And third, we said we would position the business to be able to capture travel demand when it returns. Based on our accomplishments in 2020, I can confidently say that we executed well against these plans. 
In the beginning of the crisis, we successfully stabilized the business by taking several immediate steps, including quickly closing offices and smoothly transitioning to a distributed work environment to protect the health and safety of our employees, which was and continues to be a top priority; working closely with travelers and supply partners to process the unprecedented level of travel changes and cancellations; and bolstering liquidity and preserving cash by halting stock buybacks, cutting nonessential costs and raising over $4 billion in capital through a debt offering. Then we began the process and have almost entirely completed our work to optimize the business for the decrease in travel demand through the restructuring actions we have taken at each of our brands across the company. 
As a result of these actions, our 2020 year-end headcount decreased approximately 23% versus 2019, primarily in volume-related positions. We expect these reductions to result in annualized cost savings of about $370 million in personnel expenses, with about $110 million of savings recognized in 2020. While our work is never done in terms of finding opportunities for cost efficiencies, we believe that headcount reductions needed to optimize the business for the current demand environment are now generally behind us. 
Finally, we believe we have positioned the business well for when travel demand returns. We continue to make progress against our key strategic priorities during 2020, and this progress has continued as we have moved into 2021. We remain active in performance marketing channels and are being agile and adapting our approach to this very uncertain environment. And we will leverage our learnings over the past year to continue to capture demand in these performance channels at appropriate ROIs. In addition, our marketing team has been working hard to develop campaigns and messaging that we will deploy when we believe the time is right to encourage people to travel once again and use our services. 
As we think ahead about 2021, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the exact shape and timing of the recovery for travel. The rate of recovery will depend heavily on the rate of new COVID-19 cases, including new potentially more transmissible and more dangerous variants, and on the timing of effective and broad-based vaccine distribution, which we believe will be a key step in helping people feel safe to travel again. 
We are tracking early signs of encouraging summer booking trends in Western Europe, primarily the U.K. and Germany, relative to what we are seeing globally, although in each case, gross booking levels are still below where we were at the same point in time in 2019. While seeing green shoots of the summer booking season's positive, it's uncertain whether these trends will continue and whether we'll see this summer booking strength expand into other countries and regions, and of course, whether these advanced bookings will turn into stayed room nights or will be canceled. What would be most helpful would be continued government action around the world to accelerate vaccine distribution while providing direct and indirect support to the entire travel and hospitality industry. 
Additionally, international travel remains extremely depressed, and a recovery will not be possible until government restrictions on international travel are lifted or modified so travelers, who can show they are safe travelers, are allowed to travel freely. As you know, our international business has been a great advantage for us historically, and we expect it will be in the future, but we anticipate this to be a longer recovery. 
We know that people have a very strong desire to travel. We saw this firsthand in 2020 when we witnessed a strong improvement in our booking trends from the lows in April through the peak summer travel season, driven in part by pent-up demand as people came out of lockdowns. The travel that was booked last year was much more domestic-oriented than in prior years as many people adapted to the restrictive travel environment and still found a way to take a trip. With many travel restrictions now in place around the world, we believe there is once again a high level of pent-up demand for travel. But when this demand will be fully unlocked is, of course, difficult to predict and will depend on vaccination rates and other factors. 
While the timing of the pickup in travel demand is beyond our control, we are focused on the things we can control, primarily better positioning our business by continuing to invest and execute against our key strategic priorities, including expanding the payment platform at Booking.com, building out our connected trip capabilities and growing our market share in the United States. Our integrated payment platform at Booking.com provides payment options favored by both travelers and our supplier partners across hotels, alternative accommodations, cars, flights and attractions. It is strategically important as it enables merchandising capabilities that we haven't had access to historically at Booking.com, but we expect to utilize selectively in the future to help drive growth. In addition, this payment platform is foundational for enabling our connected trip strategy. 
We continue to make progress expanding the payment platform with approximately 22% of Booking.com's gross bookings in 2020 processed on the platform. This is up from approximately 15% in 2019 and was less than 4% back in 2017, so this is a dramatic shift in our large-scale business. We are optimistic about recent improvements in our Booking.com U.S. payment platform, which will enable increased utilization of payments in this critical market. We expect to see a higher percentage of Booking.com's gross bookings processed on the payment platform in 2021 as compared to 2020 and expect these increases to continue beyond 2021. 
Our connected trip vision is a multiproduct offering, including accommodations, flight, ground transportation and attractions and dining, connected by our seamless payment network and ultimately supported by personalized intelligence, to provide a frictionless experience for our bookers all the way from the initial booking to experiencing their trip. We're building towards this vision because we believe the connected trip will drive increased loyalty and frequency and will enhance the growth of our accommodation business through additional customer acquisition and merchandising opportunities. Developing a robust flight product at Booking.com remains an important strategic component of the connected trip, as it gives us the ability to engage with flight bookers early in their travel journey and allows us an opportunity to cross-sell our accommodation and other products to those bookers. In the coming years, we expect flights will represent an increasing mix of our overall business, which will help drive incremental revenue and EBITDA dollars. 
As mentioned in the past, growing our share of the U.S. travel market remains a key strategic priority for our company, as the U.S. is one of the largest travel markets in the world and we have historically underindexed there. We are taking several steps to increase our competitiveness in the U.S. market and are focused on making sure we are offering great value to our customers, improving our payments platform to enable bundling and merchandising opportunities, increasing overall consumer awareness of our Booking.com through marketing and expanding our alternative accommodations supply. While we have built a large and competitive alternative accommodations business globally, we believe we have a significant opportunity for improvement in the United States, which will involve product improvements, supply acquisition and raising consumer awareness of this type of inventory on Booking.com. 
Continuing to invest and execute against these 3 strategic priorities as well as capturing demand as travel recovers will be our focus in 2021. We believe successful implementation of these priorities is key to achieving higher growth rates, increasing market share, and eventually building a larger business with higher earnings than we had prior to COVID. We expect this larger business to have a higher mix of merchant transactions and non-accommodation products, both of which will negatively impact our EBITDA margin rates, but we expect it to continue to lead the travel industry in this metric. 
Finally, I want to address the European Commission's initial proposal for the Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act released in December. The European Commission has proposed regulations aimed at keeping markets fair and open, which is an ambition that we support. However, at the present time, it is not known for certain what the ultimate rules will be, how they might be applied or what the impact will be on us and other market participants. We are engaged with stakeholders to work towards regulations that tackle the legitimate problems of the large gatekeepers in the digital economy, of which we believe we are not one. We'll update you in the area during future calls. 
In conclusion, there are still tough days ahead of us and everyone in the travel industry. COVID case counts remain high, and the wider global distribution of vaccines is still too slow. However, I am more confident than ever in our long-term future, and we will at some point see a strong recovery in travel demand. I further believe that our company is very well positioned to capture this demand as it comes back. In the meantime, we will focus on what we can control, namely, investing in our business and executing against our strategic priorities to ensure we exit this crisis on a strong footing, which will enable us to build a larger and faster-growing business for the long run. 
I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden."

On our November earnings call, we discussed the trends we saw throughout the third quarter and into early November, including the year-on-year decline in reported room nights worsening from about 43% in the third quarter to about 58% in October, and then further deteriorating to about 70% over the 7 days leading up to our November earnings call, driven by rising COVID case counts and many European countries and governments beginning to respond with impositions of travel restrictions. As a reminder, reported room nights include the impact of cancellations. 
The worsening trends we saw in early November improved a little, resulting in our reported room nights declining 60% for the fourth quarter. November proved to be the low point for the quarter. The decline in room night growth rates versus Q3 were driven by Europe, where growth rates declined quite considerably. Looking across the other regions, North America were similar to Q3. And Asia and the rest of world both improved compared to Q3. North America was the strongest region in Q4 with a significantly lower year-on-year decline in room nights than the other regions. 
Mobile bookings, particularly through our apps, continued to gain share in the fourth quarter and represented over 2/3 of our total room nights in Q4 and about 2/3 of 2020. We continue to -- we also continue to see growth in 50% of our total room nights come to us through the direct channel. 
Domestic room nights represented about 85% of our reported room nights in Q4, up significantly versus 2019, which was just below 50%. Our cancellation rates continue to be up year-over-year in the fourth quarter and also increased versus Q3. 
We continue to monitor other changes in Booking.com's customer booking behavior. The mix of customers booking alternative accommodations in Q4 were slightly lower than Q4 2019, while the full year was up slightly versus 2019. The slight decline in the overall mix of alternative accommodations in Q4 was due to the underperformance of the European region, which is where we have our highest mix of alternative accommodations. The mix of alternative accommodations continues to increase year-over-year within Europe in Q4. Booking.com's alternative accommodations represented about 30% of its reported room nights for the full year 2020. 
The booking window contracted versus 2019 in the fourth quarter at about the same rate as we saw in the third quarter, as customers continued to focus mainly on their short-term travel needs. Gross bookings declined 65% in Q4, which is a great decline in reported room nights due to the average daily rates for accommodations decreasing about 15% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. 
Consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.2 billion and decreased 63% year-over-year. As we expected, revenue in the quarter was less negatively impacted than gross bookings due to the fact that revenue benefited from check-ins in Q4 from bookings we received in the relatively strong third quarter. 
Our full year revenue is also significantly less impacted than our gross bookings, driven by the differences in the timing between bookings and revenue, which is recognized at check-in, primarily related to 2019 bookings that checked in, in Q1 2020. As a result of these timing factors, our full year revenue as a percent of gross bookings was 19.2%, which is significantly higher than the 15.6% in 2019 and 2018. If our revenue as a percentage of gross bookings in 2020 had been in line with 2019, revenue would have been more than $1 billion lower for the full year. The difference between 15.6% and 19.2% is all entirely explained by this timing difference. 
The 63% reduction in revenue resulted in an adjusted EBITDA loss of $38 million in the fourth quarter. While we significantly reduced our variable expense lines like marketing, sales and other, our more fixed expenses decreased to a lesser extent in Q4. As Glenn mentioned, we've almost entirely completed our restructuring actions to reduce personnel expenses to align our cost structure with the new demand environments. The [ savings ] recognized in our personnel expense line related to these actions was about $70 million in Q4 and about $110 million for the full year. We recorded charges of $74 million and $149 million related to these actions in the restructuring and other exit costs line for Q4 and the full year, respectively. 
Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line, decreased 61% year-over-year as we saw a significant reduction in demand in the paid channels. In addition, we substantially reduced our brand marketing spend in response to the diminished travel demand environment. Sales and other expenses decreased 45% year-over-year, primarily due to reduction in expenses associated with payment transactions, partially offset by a mix shift in customer service to outsourced call centers. 
Personnel expenses decreased 13% year-over-year, primarily due to restructuring actions I mentioned previously. G&A expenses decreased 36% year-over-year largely driven by reduced discretionary spend in such areas as T&E, lower indirect taxes and lower office expenses due to employees working remotely. Information technology expenses were up 1% year-over-year in the fourth quarter due to investments in software license fees related to cybersecurity and privacy software. 
Finally, we've broken out restructuring charges separately in operating expenses in the P&L. And I note that these restructuring charges are included in our non-GAAP results. 
We recorded a non-GAAP net loss of $23 million in the quarter. Our full year non-GAAP tax rate of 42% was meaningfully higher than our 2019 tax rate of 19% due to the greater impact of nontax deductible expenses on a lower base of earnings as well as the geographical distribution of earnings and losses. Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was driven by a change in our full year tax provision following better-than-expected pretax results in the fourth quarter. 
On a GAAP basis, we had an operating loss of $153 million in Q4. We recorded a GAAP net loss of $165 million in the quarter as the benefit from an unrealized $553 million pretax gain on our equity investments, primarily related to our investment in Meituan, was offset by income tax expenses of $410 million, $98 million of interest expense, and $61 million of FX remeasurement losses on our Eurobond. We excluded the unrealized gains and the related losses from our non-GAAP results. 
The $410 million of income tax expenses is primarily due to the discrete tax expense related to the Meituan unrealized gain and the change in our full year tax provision following better-than-expected results in the fourth quarter. Our full year GAAP tax rate of 90% was meaningfully higher than our 2019 tax rate of 18% due to reasons mentioned for our non-GAAP tax rate, with the nondeductible goodwill impairment charge driving additional significant impacts. 
Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q4 ending cash and investment balance decreased to $14.8 billion from our September ending balance of $14.9 billion due to an operating cash outflow, largely offset by the unrealized gains on our long-term investments. We had a $557 million operating cash outflow in the quarter driven primarily by changes in working capital, which represented a use of cash of about $400 million in the quarter as well as the net loss recorded in the quarter. The change in working capital driven by seasonal effects that were amplified by the slowdown in bookings from Q3. 
We will continue to focus on maintaining a strong liquidity position, given the high level of uncertainty created by the COVID pandemic. And consistent with our comments last quarter, we've halted repurchases of our stock, and we will not initiate repurchases until we have better visibility into the shape and timing of a recovery. 
Now onto our thoughts for the first quarter. And to remind you, we'll make comparisons with 2019 unless otherwise indicated. There continues to be considerable uncertainty about the shape and timing of the recovery for travel, which means we're unable to provide detailed guidance at this time. January room night declines were slightly worse than Q4, driven by the increasing spread of COVID-19, including the new strains with associated additional travel restrictions. However, starting in the middle of January, we saw an improvement in room night declines driven by domestic travel bookings in most parts of the world. And we've seen this improvement continue into February. In recent weeks, some regions have improved back to positive domestic room night growth. While difficult to predict with accuracy, if the domestic room night trends continue to improve, Q1 room night declines could be a few percentage points better than Q4. To give you a snapshot of what we're seeing recently, room night declines over the last 7 days were about 50%. 
In Q1, the overall booking window has contracted versus 2019, although to a lesser extent than we saw in the fourth quarter. In Western Europe, in January, we saw an expansion of the booking window versus 2019. And we've seen this expansion continue into February as the share of further out bookings, including those for summer travel, has increased. As Glenn noted in Western Europe, particularly in the U.K. and Germany, we have recently seen stronger summer booking trends relative to what we're seeing globally. And in these countries, gross bookings for summer period are within 25% of where they were at the same time in 2019. These stronger booking trends in Western Europe are currently being offset by weaker near-term booking trends in the region due to extensive travel restrictions. And we remind you that the significant majority of the summer bookings are cancelable. 
We're also encouraged to see that some countries are making notable progress with vaccinations, including Israel, UAE and the U.K. We are confident that when vaccinations are broadly available and when travel restrictions are lifted, people will return to travel. We saw this happen recently in Israel, where vaccination rates are the highest in the world. And after the national lockdown within Israel was eased on February 7, we quickly saw domestic bookings return to solid double-digit growth versus the same period in 2019. 
Turning to the income statement. As I said, we expect Q1 room nights -- Q1 room night declines could be a few percentage points better than Q4. We expect Q1 gross bookings to decline a few percentage points more than room nights due to continued pressure on local currency ADRs. We expect Q1 revenue to decline slightly more than gross bookings, assuming bookings continue to improve for the rest of the quarter. 
We expect margin expense in Q1 will decline at the same level as gross bookings. We expect sales and other expenses in Q1 will be similar to what they were in Q4 on a dollar basis, with some variability based upon where Q1 volumes land. 
We expect personnel expenses in Q1 will be slightly higher than they were in Q4 on a dollar basis, primarily due to increased SBC expenses and seasonal increase in benefit costs, partially offset by a higher amount of savings in Q1 related to restructuring actions we've taken. We expect that almost the full run rate from our personnel restructurings will be realized in Q1. 
We expect G&A expenses in Q1 will be about the same as they were in Q4 on a dollar basis. We expect the IT expenses will be higher than they were in Q4 on a dollar basis, primarily due to increased investments in security, data privacy and some operational system enhancements. We currently estimate the remaining restructuring charge related to actions in Booking.com will be about $40 million. And we expect to record more than half of these remaining charges in the first quarter. About half of the $40 million relates to personnel-related actions, and the other half relates to real estate. Given what we just explained, and reminding you that Q1 is our seasonally lowest-revenue quarter, we expect to report a greater EBITDA loss in Q1 than in Q4. 
For the full year 2021, I want to briefly walk you through some factors that we expect will impact our top line operating margins for the year. We expect the environment of travel to improve in -- during 2021, but the shape and timing of that recovery remains uncertain. We expect occupancy rates to remain below where they were pre-COVID, putting continued negative pressure on ADRs, which will result in our gross bookings being lower than our room nights. 
As I noted earlier, our revenue was less negatively impacted than our gross bookings in 2020 due to timing factors, which benefited our 2020 revenue by more than $1 billion. The opposite dynamic will happen when we experience an acceleration in bookings, which will lead to our gross bookings recurring faster than revenue. Said another way, if we see this acceleration in 2021, there will be more bookings made in 2021 that will check in, in 2022, than there were bookings made in 2020 that checked in, in 2021. This timing factor could have a meaningfully negative impact on our revenue as a percentage of gross bookings. So exactly how meaningful this impact will be depends upon how quickly our room nights and gross bookings accelerate in 2021. 
Due to these differences in the timing of bookings versus check in, we also expect deleverage in our marketing expenses in 2021 as we incur the majority of our market expenses at the time of booking. The most significant expense items in sales and other are payment processing costs and outsourced customer service expenses. We expect sales and other to be lower in 2021 than in 2019, but the reduction will be smaller than the reduction in revenue. 
A few comments to help you think about our less variable expenses for 2021 and how they'll most likely compare with 2019. We expect G&A to be down double digits versus 2019 driven by T&E, office and occupancy expenses, with some variability from DST taxes if new ones are enacted during the year. 
Personnel expenses are likely to be quite similar to 2019 on a dollar basis. To help you understand this better, there are a few factors that contribute towards this. Our personnel expense run rate immediately before COVID hit was about $200 million higher than 2019 actual personnel expenses. Less than half of this was the annualization of people expense we added during 2019. And the rest was from people expense added into the business in the first quarter of 2020. 
Our restructuring actions will reduce headcount expenses by approximately $370 million. So the impact of these 2 together will be to reduce personnel expenses by $170 million versus 2019. As we continue to invest in the business, we expect 2021 year-end headcount to be a little higher than at the end of 2020, with a mix shift towards pro and technical positions. This will add about $100 million in personnel expenses in 2021. 
And finally, SBC is expected to be higher than 2019 due to a few factors, including the modification of some stock awards in Q1 2021 and the issuance of stock options in 2020. Finally, IT expenses in 2021 will be higher than in 2019 due to investments in security, privacy and operational system enhancements to support our connected trip strategy. 
As we think beyond 2021, we're looking forward to being a larger business with more diverse offerings and with more earnings than we have prior to COVID. We're also focused on the potential for higher growth and market share. We continue to believe that it would be years and not quarters before travel returns to pre-COVID-19 levels. And when considering the shape of the business at that time, I'd like to draw your attention to 2 factors. 
The first is a mix shift within the business. The continued growth of payments and the growth of flights and other connected verticals will add revenue and EBITDA, but at much lower margin rates than traditional accommodations. Payments will add to revenue with offsetting expenses in sales and other, plus some additional personnel and other expenses. Flights and other connected trip verticals will add to bookings and revenue, but at lower take rates than accommodations, and will also require added personnel and other expenses as this business scales. 
The second is personnel. The restructuring actions we took in 2020 were mainly in volume-related functions, including customer service and credit collection. This means that as volumes grow beyond the levels we expect in 2021, we'll need to add expenses back to business. As we've mentioned before, we'll look to do this in cost-efficient ways, but the work will come back. 
We think it's important to include these considerations when thinking about the future shape of the business. As Glenn said, we expect to continue to have industry-leading EBITDA margin rates, albeit most likely at levels below those in 2019. 
In conclusion, we remain focused on what we can control and continue to execute against our strategic priorities. We're now more confident than ever that through these actions, we will emerge from this crisis in a stronger position. 
We'll now take your questions. And Grace, I'll turn it over to you to open the line for questions."

As they come back, we will look at more efficient ways of getting that work done. The work will come back. It won't come back this year. We basically rightsized ourselves through what we think will be through 2021. But as volumes extend beyond what we think 2021 is likely to bring, those costs will come back. So we will look at more efficient ways to do some of those variable activities in terms of location, technology, what we do inside or where we deploy more partner resources, et cetera. 
And we also, Lloyd, continue to look at how we can drive efficiency in our fixed costs part of the business. That's not been the major focus for the last 12 months. The major focus has been surviving COVID. I think we've done a good job with that. But we do continue to kind of look at our costs across our personnel base, across our real estate, across our technology portfolios, across things like procurement, where we can continue to drive efficiencies within the business. So when we get to a more normalized environment, that's something else we can also take a look at driving as well.

And that can impact companies certainly in the short term, and we're all just looking and trying to evaluate what do we think this will mean for any one of these things and [ how we do it ]. 
But the thing I'd really focus on is that change can also be good. We believe that we have some of the best marketing people in the world in terms of digital marketing.

And we have so much data to test with that we believe we can actually come out of these things sometimes better off than we were in the past.

So in regards to the home or alternative accommodations as we like to call it in Europe, I don't think we've talked much about regional exact share, and I'm not going to here. But I certainly -- we talked a little bit how Europe is our stronghold in that area. We're better there in the home area than other areas. 
But throughout the world, I think I can say to you that we are better in things that are less single property. We always want to increase the single property because we know that's an area where we can improve upon. So that is an issue right now. And with the pandemic, there certainly was a bit of a shift, for some people, that they wanted to be isolated away from other people. So certainly, there was more demand than in the past for the single-home area. That showed up much more in the U.S. for us, say, than Europe. Because Europe, we do have -- a greater amount of our home supply is the single property than, say, in the U.S. 
Look, it's an area we're going to continue to focus on, and I do believe right now in the environment there is that is a great product to have up on the shelf. That being said, in the future, we'll see how much that maintains or things go back more towards they used to be, where there's a different split between homes and hotels. 
In regard to your second question about relationship with hotel suppliers, obviously, we're doing everything we can to help our partners. And that's coming up with new ways to -- come up with promotions that they want to do. Telling them when we think there are spots in demand that they can come up with different types of closed user group prices that can help get them more demand. Coming out with ways that they can put together things in content in terms of safety and health, so that a traveler who looks on our site and sees their hotel and sees that it's a safe place to go, do all different things with them to try and improve their business. 
It's very difficult right now as you know, though, because let's face it, unless there's demand, you can have the greatest content in the world, but if people don't feel it's time to travel, they're not going to travel. But we're going to continue to do that. 
I do believe in terms of relationships, certainly as a distributor, when there is less demand, we are more valuable as a partner to them. In the time when there's very, very high occupancy rates, any hotel will say, ""Well, I don't need the distributor nearly as much."" But when they don't have as much occupancy rate, then they start looking for demand, and we have the benefit of being the largest platform for hotel demand in the world. So we are the place for them to come and get some more of that incremental demand, and we're continuing to work with them to make sure they do their best to get it."

I'd love to get your thoughts there, Glenn.

And we've talked about this numerous times of how we believe getting people to come back to us directly is a critical part of the strategy going forward. 
And certainly one of the ways we do that is by providing our loyalty version, which is our Genius program on Booking.com, which really does, we believe, give some real value to consumers. And that's something that we're going to continue on because in the end, it costs an awful lot of money, as we know, to get a new customer. It's cheaper to keep them. So we're going to keep on doing all the things we can to keep people coming back direct. 
And you're right about first cookie -- first-party, could mean third party, all these different ways that we worry about how we're going to get people to come in the future. Certainly important to get new customers, but also real important to keep them coming back. 
In regards to your second question, one of the things I mentioned was how uncertain the world is right now. And one of the things you're trying always to do is make sure you're spending money, but that's to create revenue. One issue is you pay the money upfront, a person books, but because so much of the business nowadays is being done on things that are cancelable, you don't know when change happens, all of a sudden, money you've spent, it doesn't end up in -- and increase the revenue you thought it was, and your ROI ends up very different. So we have to look at this very carefully, and we are approaching it in a cautious way.
But on the other hand, we don't want to be slow to the increase in demand. It's something -- we look at all the data very, very closely. That's about the best I can say is that, that's how we're handling it right now. We can't say anything more than that because we don't know what the future is going to be quite yet."

Another thing that we continue to build out in our attractions area, not a lot of people are actually buying attractions right now. But we haven't stopped getting more and more places and more and more content, so that when people do come back, they'll have attractions they can buy from us. And what they obviously would see would be the way we're combining this, putting things together and the way we're trying to create value for our consumers. 
So I think that's part of it, and we're really still in the very, very early parts of this journey. But it's something that is pretty exciting to me as I begin to see it build out and seeing those people are buying flights and such. 
In regards to the subscriptions model that people are beginning to explore and such, I don't really have a lot of comments on that. It's something that different people are doing and such. We'll see how it plays out.

But yes, we were pleased to see that positive number there. One of the things to point out is as I just talked about a little bit, though, in the past, we didn't have air tickets coming from Booking.com and from -- and also, by the way, our Agoda brand also sells air tickets, too. Priceline, of course, has been selling air tickets since the start of the company. It's more than 2 decades ago. So it's easier when you add 2 more of our brand selling air tickets that hadn't done it in the past to have a positive number. 
And I want to point out, this is very early and these are very, very, very small numbers. So it's pleasant to see, but I wouldn't tell you too much except that we are on our journey. 
In regards to attractions for Booking.com, so it's yes, these are coming from third-party suppliers. We are partnering with them. They give us the inventory, so we sell it. We have a commercial relationship. And we're pleased. That's the way to go forward. Again, one can be anything or -- and you need to decide which ones you want to do first, but it's a lot -- you can't be everything. So it's a lot easier when you want to do a lot more things to partner with other people for things -- for people who already set up the things you need to get, so I'm pretty pleased about that. Again, I'll be even more pleased when people actually are back to traveling and start buying attractions more. 
And David, I don't know if I missed anything on the air ticket -- air stuff."

But let me kind of clarify where we are on payments and the evolution of payment at Booking.com. So as we said in the prepared remarks, the percentage of our gross bookings processed on the payment platform at Booking.com was 22% last year. That's up meaningfully from the 15% in 2019. That still means that the vast majority of bookings are not being processed via our payment transaction, they're still in the agency model. So we expect that payment adoption to continue to increase above the 22% this year and beyond. 
Payments is really super important for us for a number of reasons because we think we can deliver benefits to our customers, our partners, across all the different channels, hotels, alternative accommodations, flights, attractions, et cetera. It's also very important to enable merchandising, which we will use on a selective basis in certain markets. And it's also fundamental to enabling the connected trip where we want to have everything be -- able to be paid in one place. 
I'll give you an update on where we are from an income statement point of view relative to the evolution of payments. I'm pleased to say that payments on Booking.com was approximately breakeven in 2020. We've said it in prior years, we are still making some net investment in the platform. And we focus upon still scaling it out, but I expect to stay in that breakeven level as we scale out and grow the payments platform from here, obviously, with some potential minor differences year in, year out. We are now out of the breakeven situation on that payment platform, which is an update from where we were before."

Because a single-home property does cost more for the company because you do end up with more contacts. It's just by nature. It's not as professionally run, and you do end up with more costs. So we do, though, know that it's a product that people want, and we need to have it and we need to have more of it and that's absolutely correct. 
The great thing about this though is there is a trend towards more professionalization of the single-home property, where the person in the past may have gone onto a platform and just signed up on their own and tried to orchestrate it all by themselves. What you are seeing in the industry is more and more people, who want to rent out their single properties, going to different people who will do it for them, who will handle all the elements of it. And those people who are running these kind of -- we won't call them channel managers, but they're like a channel manager in a sense, they are able to bring these different, single-property owners and put them onto this site, that then is able to direct that -- to provide that supply to us or to somebody else. The great thing about it is these people are much more professional, and they are more easy to deal with. They are able to understand the right things that you need to do. So because of that professionalization of the industry, I believe we will be able to pick up more of the single-home properties faster than we had to in the past.

And what that means is any individual supplier in the marketplace is now facing more competition. Now as a distributor, I talked about it a little earlier why that is beneficial to the distributor now. 
And our business, which is so great because we have both, a great amount of the home product, that alternative accommodations, and we're one of the largest people at the hotels. So we have this great thing where the consumer, when they come, they can come to one place, us. And they're able to compare and contrast all the different types, all the different prices, understand all the different comments and reviews being left by people who previously stayed there. That gives us a great, great benefit. 
So I am pleased with the way this is happening. And I -- will it go back? What will happen? How much will be -- mix be of home in the future versus hotel? I don't know. I don't think anybody can really guess. I think over many years, we've seen the trend going more and more people interested in alternative accommodations. The pandemic step-function it up higher. I don't know if that's now going to be a pause, maybe a dip down or continue upward. I don't know. But from my point of view, it's not that relevant in the sense that we provide both and we're going to keep getting both. So for me, I'm feeling pretty good about it."

So in closing, I want to note that it's been a little more than a year since the pandemic began. And we have sadly lost 500,000 mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters, grandparents and so tragically, children, in the United States alone. And globally, more than 2.4 million lives have been lost. Our hearts go out to all who mourn. 
I also want to reiterate my deepest condolences to the family and friends of Arne Sorenson as well as to the entire Marriott organization. He left a profound mark on the travel industry and will be greatly missed. And it is so sad he will not see the recovery in the industry that he dedicated his life to. And this travel industry will recover, and we are working so very hard to bring travel back as fast as we can. 
So I want to end by giving one last thank you to our partners, our customers and most of all, to our dedicated employees, who throughout the horrible year of 2020, rose to the challenge, met it and got us to where we are today, well positioned for a better tomorrow.

I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I'm encouraged by another quarter of meaningful improvement in our accommodations business with Q2 room nights up sequentially",1803,"Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' Second Quarter Conference Call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I'm encouraged by another quarter of meaningful improvement in our accommodations business with Q2 room nights up sequentially 59% versus Q1. This compares very favorably to our pre-pandemic historical pattern of a slight decline in Q2 room nights versus Q1. Compared with 2019, a Q2 room nights were down 26%, which was significantly better than the 43% decline we previously reported for the month of April and a 54% decline in Q1. 
The acceleration in the second quarter was primarily driven by domestic and international booking trends in Europe following a ramp-up in vaccination rates and the relaxation of many travel restrictions in the region. The growth of international bookings in Europe was mainly from bookings within the European region. The very strong room night growth in the United States that we saw in April and highlighted on our last earnings call continued in May and June, resulting in very strong U.S. room night growth for the full quarter versus Q2 2019. And David will provide additional details on our second quarter results in his remarks. 
We are, of course, closely monitoring the impact of the Delta variant on the rising COVID case counts around the world as well as some newly imposed travel restrictions which have led to a modest pullback in our booking trends in the month of July relative to June. However, the July booking trends were improved from our full Q2 results. While the rise of the Delta variant demonstrates the volatility and uncertainty around the exact timing and shape of the recovery for travel, we remain confident that we will eventually see a strong recovery in travel demand globally. 
The sharp return to growth initially in the U.S. and many of the European markets that we have witnessed this year shows us clearly that leisure travelers are eager to get back to booking trips on our platform when restrictions are lifted and customers are able to travel. We expect to be much closer to our 2019 revenue levels in Q3 and than we were in Q2, driven by the strong booking improvements we have seen in the last few months. 
As we have done throughout the pandemic, we will continue to build on the strengths of our core accommodation business and support its long-term growth. The strength of our core business comes from the flywheel effect we get from our 2-sided marketplace, where we drive benefits to our traveler customers and our supply partners alike. For our customers, we strive to deliver the best choice of accommodations, offer the most value and provide the easiest booking experience, all backed by excellent customer service and support. By addressing these critical needs of choice, value and ease, we create a superior booking experience and strengthen the relationships with our customers. 
I'm pleased to report that at Booking.com, we are seeing pre-pandemic customers coming back to us to book their trips while also attracting new customers. And the current mix of prior and new customers is not significantly different than prior to the pandemic. 
One of the ways we drive value to our large customer base at Booking.com is through our Genius loyalty program. This program provides discounts for Genius members at hundreds of thousands of properties on our platform and also offers value in other benefits like complementary breakfast, free room upgrades and more recently, discounted airport taxes, just to name a few. We will continue innovating and adding to the ways we provide value to our Genius customers who have historically had a higher repeat rate and a higher mix of direct bookings when compared to non-Genius customers. 
Our app is an important way we deliver an easier booking experience to our customers. Globally, in Q2, Booking.com was the #1 downloaded OTA app according to a third-party research firm. In the U.S. in Q2, we were the most downloaded major OTA app as downloads of the Booking.com app in the second quarter significantly increased sequentially. We also saw U.S. app users in Q2 meaningfully surpassed the prior peak observed before the COVID pandemic. 
In the second quarter, we again saw a higher mix of our customers booking directly with us than in the comparable period in 2019. It is encouraging to see these gains even as we look for opportunities to lean into performance marketing channels where we see attractive ROIs. We have a long history of effectively managing our performance marketing channels to bring bookers to our platform profitably. We plan to continue with this proven approach in the future. 
In addition, we're leveraging our marketing expertise and ROI focus as we test into other channels like social and digital media as well as when we deploy promotional campaigns like our Back to Travel campaign, which we ran first in the U.S. and then launched in the U.K. and across Europe. We will continue to expand the diversity of our marketing and customer acquisition channels as we aim to drive incremental traffic to our platform and increased consumer awareness of our brands. 
While we will remain focused on our efforts to grow and retain our customer base, we believe we will continue to benefit from the secular tailwind of more people booking their trips online instead of offline. Historically, the accommodation industry has seen a steady increase in online share each year. And looking ahead, we believe this trend will continue for the foreseeable future. 
In April, McKinsey published a 24-country survey with results showing that across 11 major consumer-facing industries, travel had the greatest percentage of customers that plan to increase their usage of digital channels after the pandemic. 
On the other side of our marketplace, we are focused on helping our supply partners reach a broader audience of potential customers. Our scale and global reach allows us to connect our supply partners with a significant amount of demand around the world, demonstrated by the 845 million room nights booked across our platforms in 2019. 
In addition to being a large demand channel for our partners, we add value to our accommodation partners in other ways by providing customer service support for travelers in over 40 languages, localized partner service support teams, market intelligence and data, product innovations in response to new traveler trends and fraud liability shift and access to alternative team and methods for payment-enabled transactions. Whether an alternative accommodation or an independent hotel or a large global hotel chain, we strive to be a valuable partner to all types of accommodations on our platform. 
In the second quarter, we saw the first sequential increase in the number of properties on Booking.com and the lowest number of properties coming off of our platform in the quarter since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of June 30, we had over 28 million reported listings on Booking.com, of which 6.6 million were for alternative accommodation properties. Within alternative accommodations in the U.S., Booking.com continued to add targeted new properties in the quarter and also saw encouraging share gains with some of our larger professional managers. 
While these are positive early developments, we recognize there is much work ahead to improve and grow our alternative accommodations product in the U.S. market. Our alternative accommodations business in Europe was strong in the quarter and represented an increasing share of our European accommodations business. 
I want to move to our key strategic priorities of expanding Booking.com's payment platform and building the connected trip vision, both of which we believe will further enhance the strength of our core accommodation business and support its continued growth. On our integrated payment platform at Booking.com, we have made continued progress with increased the adoption of payments by our supply partners in the U.S., including adding some major hotel chains in the second quarter. Around 24% of Booking.com's total gross bookings in Q2 were processed through its payment platform, which is up from about 22% for the full year 2020. 
We recently announced the organization of all of our payments initiatives and efforts into a new fintech unit at Booking.com. First, the fintech unit will be focused on a mainly bookings core business to run better, faster and more efficiently for both customers and our supply partners. In addition, we recognize that we have opportunities to better monetize our overall transaction flows. In 2019, we did almost $100 billion of transaction value and we believe setting up a separate fintech unit to better capitalize on these flows will benefit us in the long run. 
On our connected trip vision, I mentioned on our last earnings call that the development of the connected trip this year will be focused on enabling travelers to book the major elements of their trip in one place on Booking.com. The top priority of this -- on this front has been to scale up a robust flight platform on Booking.com, which will give us the ability to engage with flight bookers fully in their travel journey and allow us an opportunity to cross-sell our accommodation and other services to these bookers. Since our last earnings call, we have launched our flight product in 6 new markets and they're now live in 24 countries. 
Inter tickets booked through Booking's flight offering have continued to meaningfully exceed our expectations. However, these still represented a small portion of our total reported air tickets, which were up 120% in Q2 versus Q2 2019. Primarily, this was driven by Priceline. While it remains early days for booking a flight product, we are seeing positive data indicating we are getting entirely new customers for Booking.com. In addition, we are seeing an encouraging attach rate of accommodation bookings from these new customers. These early data points help demonstrate that our flight offering creates a new funnel to bring incremental customers to the platform and they cross-sell an accommodation to these new customers. We expect to continue to build on the early success we are seeing with flight at Booking.com. 
In conclusion, I am encouraged by the signs of recovery we are seeing in some parts of the world, and I'm confident that we will eventually see a strong recovery in travel demand globally. We continue with our most important work to strengthen our company's position and execute against our strategic priorities and our teams are working hard to support the strong summer travel season this year in North America and Europe. As I said before, we are thinking about our business beyond just getting back to 2019 levels of demand, and we are focused on building a larger and faster-growing business that generates more earnings after the full recovery and for the long run. 
I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden. David?"

I'll review our operating results for the second quarter and provide some color on trends we've seen so far in the third quarter. To avoid comparison to pandemic impacted peers in 2020, all growth rates will be relati",2396,"Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I'll review our operating results for the second quarter and provide some color on trends we've seen so far in the third quarter. To avoid comparison to pandemic impacted peers in 2020, all growth rates will be relative to comparable period in 2019, unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. Now on to our results for the second quarter. 
On our last earnings call, we discussed the improvement in trends in Q1, which continued into April, driven by strong results in the U.S. and improvements in Europe. Following the earnings call, we saw the overall improvements in our trends accelerate in May and continue to get better in June, which resulted in our Q2 reported room nights declining 26% versus Q2 2019, which was significantly ahead of the 54% decline in Q1 but 43% decline we saw in April and our expectations in May. 
The improvement in Q2 room nights growth rate versus Q1 was driven by Europe and the U.S. as well as better results in Rest of World. Europe showed the greatest level of recovery in the quarter and actually achieved slight room night growth versus 2019 in June. Booking trends in Europe clearly benefited from a notable improvement in vaccination rates as well as loosening travel restrictions. 
The U.S. was again the strongest reporting major country in Q2 and had very strong room night growth versus 2019 for the full quarter. Asia partially offset the improvements in other regions with greater room night declines in Q2 than in Q1 due to the increase in COVID outbreaks with related travel restrictions. 
In the month of June, our room nights were down 13%, and our monthly active unique customer accounts at Booking.com reached about 90% of the level we saw in June 2019. As Glenn mentioned, we are pleased to see the solid rebound in our customer base at Booking.com as well as a healthy mix of new customers, which is only a little lower than the mix of new customers in Q2 2019. 
Mobile bookings, particularly through our apps, represented over 60% of our total room nights. Our app continues to represent an increased percentage of our mobile bookings. Our direct channel increased as a percentage of our room nights year-on-year and relative to Q2 2019. Domestic room nights grew in the mid-teens in Q2, while international room nights remained down significantly versus 2019, we saw a sequential improvement in our international bookings resulting in the international mix of our room nights increasing to about 25% in Q2 from about 15% in Q1. 
Our cancellation rates improved in Q1 and were in line with Q2 2019 levels in the quarter. The percentage of our Q2 2021 bookings made with flexible cancellation policies remained significantly higher than in Q2 2019. The booking window Booking.com remained shorter than it was in the second quarter of 2019 as we continue to see a higher mix of near-term bookings. However, the booking window contracted less than it did in the prior 3 quarters. 
The mix of alternative accommodation room nights on Booking.com in Q2 was 32%, which is 3 points higher than Q1. In June, our alternative accommodation room night growth was flat versus June 2019, the first time we've reached 2019 levels for this segment since the solid cover. The sequential improvement from Q1 to Q2 was due primarily to the overall improvement in room night growth in Europe in the quarter. As we noted last quarter, Europe is where we have our highest mix of alternative accommodations. Within Europe, -- Our mixed alternative accommodations remained about the same as Q1. This represents a continued increase from 2019 to 2020 and into 2021. 
Gross bookings declined 12% in Q2, which is less than the decline in reported room nights due to an increase in average day rates for accommodations of 11% versus 2019 on a constant currency basis and also due to a few points of changes in FX rates and strong performance in our flights business. Our accommodation constant currency ADR benefited by about 7% from an increased mix of business in North America, which is the high ADR region, and a decrease in mix of business in Asia, which is a lower ADR region. Excluding regional mix effects, constant currency ADRs were up approximately 4%, driven mainly by rate increases in North America and in Europe. The increase in North America were driven by high levels of demand for beach-oriented leisure destinations. And in Europe, were driven by a higher mix of summer bookings, which have higher ADRs. 
Airline tickets booked in the second quarter were up 120% versus 2019, driven by strong growth at Priceline and by flights bookings at Booking.com and Agoda, neither of which had flight crops in Q2 2019. We are encouraged to see another record freight quarter for air tickets booked for our flights business, which is a key component of our multiproduct connected trip strategy. 
Consolidated revenue for the second quarter was $2.2 billion and decreased 44% versus 2019, which is better than our expectations. Revenue in the quarter declined meaningfully more than gross bookings due to bookings made in the quarter that are expected to check in, in future quarters at which point the revenue will be recognized. 
Take rates in Q2 were about 10%, largely driven by these timing differences. As you'll recall, we discussed the impact of timing on take rates in Q1, Q2 and for the full year during our last call. We continue to expect these timing factors to impact full year take rates, although the second half of the year will be less negatively impacted than the first half of the year. Removing the impact of timing, our take rates on accommodation bookings in Q2 was stable versus Q2 2019. 
The better-than-expected top line performance resulted in adjusted EBITDA of $48 million in the second quarter, which came in better than our expectations. With the exception of Q3 last year, this is the first EBITDA positive quarter since the first wave of COVID. 
Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line, decreased 29% versus 2019. Marketing expense declined more than gross bookings due to higher ROIs in the pay channels and the increase in our direct mix. 
Sales and other expense in Q2 were significantly higher than they were in Q1 on a dollar basis. Sales and other expenses as a [indiscernible] of revenue in Q2 was better than our expectations due to lower-than-expected bad debt and customer service-related expenses. 
Personnel expenses in Q2 were higher than they were in Q1 on a dollar basis primarily due to the $136 million of expenses related to our decision to repay the government aid in the second quarter. Excluding this repayment, personnel expenses in Q2 would have been in line with our expectations. 
G&A and IT expenses were both higher in Q2 than they were in Q1 on a dollar basis and were in line with our expectations. We recorded a non-GAAP loss of $105 million in the quarter. 
On a GAAP basis, we had an operating loss of $56 million in Q2. We recorded a GAAP net loss of $167 million in the quarter, which includes income tax expense of $126 million. On a GAAP and non-GAAP basis in Q2, we recorded a tax expense on a pretax loss due to higher earnings expectations for the full year relative to our expectations for Q1. For the full year, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be slightly higher than in 2019. 
Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q2 ending cash and investment balance of $16.1 billion was down versus our Q1 ending balance of $16.4 billion. However, our Q1 ending balance benefited from the timing of the $2 billion raised in our Eurobond offering, which we completed in March and the subsequent redemption of the 2 higher coupon senior notes occurring in April. Adjusting our Q1 ending cash balance for the redemption of the 2 notes that happened in April would have resulted in an adjusted Q1 cash balance of $14.4 billion. Our Q2 ending balance was higher than this adjusted Q on balance primarily due to operating cash flow of $1.2 billion and a $0.5 billion unrealized gain on our long-term investments. 
$0.2 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter was driven almost entirely by a change in working capital. Change in working capital represented a source of cash of $1.2 billion in the quarter due to the increase in our deferred merchant bookings and other current liabilities, partially offset by the increase in our account receivable. 
We will continue to focus on maintaining a strong liquidity position, given the continued uncertainty created by the COVID pandemic. Of the $16.1 billion of cash and investments in the end of Q2, $4.3 billion was related to our long-term strategic investments and $11.7 billion was cash and short-term investments. We ended the quarter with about $12.3 billion in debt, which is about $3.6 billion higher than our pre-pandemic levels. We have a $1 billion convertible note maturing in Q3. 
While return of capital to shareholders will be an important component of our value creation strategy in the future, we remain on pause and we'll wait to reinitiate until we believe each of our 3 major regions is beyond the risk of a significant reversal in trends due to COVID. We're not there yet, given the current trends we're seeing in Asia and with our current close watch on how things are developing in Europe. 
Now on to our pause for the third quarter. With the recent rising taste counts driven by Delta by the Delta variants in many countries, some governments around the world have responded with new travel and leisure restrictions as well as some stricter vaccination and testing requirements for tourists. However, there are indications that optimization rates are lagging the recent increases in case counts, particularly in countries with high vaccination rates, which could be an important factor in how governments plan their responses to the recent increase in COVID cases. 
We're closely watching the U.K. where the vaccination rate is high and the government has moved forward with relaxing travel restriction despite rising case counts in the country, which are among the highest in Europe. We're encouraged by the recent decline in new case counts and by the continued lower level of hospitalizations in the U.K. compared with other outbreaks. We saw booking trends improve in the U.K. in July, leading up to and after travel restrictions were lifted on July 19. 
Our July room nights declined about 22% versus 2019, which was a modest pullback from a 13% decline in June, primarily to softening booking trends in Europe. Looking within Europe, we saw reductions in room nights in July across several key countries, including Germany, France and Italy. But despite the recent pullback in these countries at the end of July, we had a higher amount of gross bookings on the books for the remaining summer period in Europe than we did at this same point in time in 2019. 
Outside of Europe, the U.S. continued to have a very strong room night growth in July, although modestly below Q2 levels. While Asia and rest of world room night declines were about the same in July as we were in June. Asia continues to be the least recovered region in July and continues to be down significantly from 2019 levels. 
The change in growth rates from June to July were similar for domestic and international room nights, with domestic remaining positive and international room nights remaining down significantly versus 2019. Given the recent additional uncertainty around COVID, driven primarily by the Delta variant, it's difficult to predict exactly how room nights in August and September will compare with the 22% reduction we saw in July. 
Turning to the income statement, we expect Q3 gross bookings to decline several points less than room nights, driven by expected improvements in reported ADRs and by flight bookings. We expect that the Q3 revenue decline will significantly improve from Q2, reflecting the strong improvement in bookings in the last few months. I just mentioned we have more gross bookings for the summer than at this time in 2019 for Europe. The same is also true for North America. We expect our Q3 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings will increase meaningfully from Q2 due to the high concentration of check ins expected in the third quarter and will be about in line with Q3 2019. As a reminder, the exact relationship between revenue and gross bookings in Q3 will be impacted by how our bookings trend in August and September. 
We expect marketing expenses in Q3 will decline several points less than gross bookings as we expect to invest in capturing demand and increasing awareness during the peak travel season and ahead of the continued global recovery of travel demand. We expect sales and other expenses in Q3 to be up significantly versus Q2 on dollar basis due to higher gross booking volumes in the third quarter as well as a mix as well -- as an increase in the mix of gross booking process on a merchant basis. However, we expect sales and other as a percentage of revenue in Q3 will be a bit lower than in Q2. 
We expect our more fixed expense categories in Q3 in aggregate to be about in line with Q2 on a dollar basis. We expect Q3 EBITDA will be the highest since Q3 2019. 
In conclusion, we are pleased with our better-than-expected results in Q2, which benefited from a recovery in travel demand and also reflects the strong fundamentals of our business and a good execution by our teams. We remain confident in the eventual full recovery of travel demand globally. And we're looking forward to a strong summer travel season this year in North America and Europe. We'll continue to responsibly invest in our business to ensure we're well positioned for the full recovery of travel and for building a larger and faster-growing business that generates more earnings than prior to the pandemic. We'll now take your questions. Maria, if you could open the line to questions, please."

In regards to your other questions about how we're doing adding share, I think we spoke a little bit about that when I did the prepared remarks and what I just said now, is a lot of this is just working hard with people who are the property owners or the managers, people who have inventory they want to get it built. It's a wonderful thing in this business that everybody knows an empty bed at night is zero revenue. To fill that bed and you get an incredible margin on it. And they want to fill up their properties. So we're there to make sure that they know we're there to help fill that and do all the things I mentioned before, making sure that we can bring in that demand.

Let me talk a little bit about marketing what was going on. I think I understood the question. But basically, what you see was in Q2, our marketing expense, the decline of our gross bookings, which is the way to look at it. Because if you look at it versus revenue, you've got all the different books to say timing and things in there. So look at it as a potential of growth bookings. That ratio improved in the second quarter. So said differently, our marketing expenses declined more than our gross bookings did. Two factors, we did see higher ROIs across many of our paid channels that we store a couple of years ago, but we also saw a nice increase in mix towards direct as well. So the more we have direct mix and obviously then the less we're paying for marketing to attract those new customers. So I'd say nothing particularly unique to fall out in that. The market environment is built -- I'd say isn't fully stackable yet, clearly. We're still going through a stage of recovery in the industry. So not all factors are directly comparable with where we were with 2019. But we were pleased to see that the ROI did improve. Now bear in mind what I said about the Q3 implies that the opposite is likely to happen in Q3. Obviously, we're only a month into Q3, but we are setting up our marketing spend in Q3. It is historically, the quarter where we spend the most is the peak season. We want to really capture demand, the customers that are out there. We'll also be increasing our spend, brand spend in Q3 relative to Q2. So that's one of the contributors to essentially what will be some deleverage in marketing spend relative to gross bookings in Q3. So we'll see how the quarter developed, but that's what we expect to happen in the third quarter. But in the first 2 quarters, we did see that benefit in ROI helping us create some leverage on the marketing line."

So assuming that cancellation rates stay the same, then that would potentially result in more revenue in those markets for the summer months for the remaining months. Now I did not -- I did also point out that we will have -- that we have a higher percentage of cancelable bookings out there or refundable bookings out there than we had at the same time in 2019 as well. So there's obviously some risk that more of those bookings cancel than they would have done in the same period of time. It means basically that our potential revenue base for the summer is higher now in those 2 markets than it was in 2019. Now obviously, the offset there is what's happening in Europe -- sorry, in Asia and what's happening in rest of world. we don't have that situation.

So it's coming up with things like providing better FX tools. It's things, for example, making sure that if somebody wants to pay in an alternative payment method, that we're able to provide that. It means making sure that we can do a better job with different types of regulations in terms of making sure that any type of transaction is not fraudulent. It's all sorts of things as a player at scale -- We can do things that many, many on their partners, that our partners could not do, and it's also providing conveniences to our customers who want it, but our suppliers can't do it on their own.

Even things as simple as our Fintech unit setting something up like our e-Wallet, an electronic wallet that enables us to easily provide value to that customer, which can come from a supplier or it can be some that were promoting ourselves, all different things.

Of course, we also look at what the developed demand is and when there are time to get leading versus leading more. We are certainly looking at this as an opportunity to win customers onto our platform and get new customers, and we mentioned a very healthy mix of new customers on -- in the business quite similar to the mixture that it was in Q2 '19. So we're pleased with how things are going. We like the way that we're bringing back existing customers, we like the way we're winning new customers.

But I will add a little bit more -- I'll add a little more to that. In a sense, I'm very pleased because we haven't been out really marketing this yet new customers are coming to the site. And then we're seeing them get an attractive cross-sell that I really like seeing that as a sign that this is the right direction that we're going. And now I had a good sense that was going to happen anyway because we didn't see that happen in Priceline for 2 decades where that's been happening. So I have good confidence that this would happen. But it's something that I believe we want to have a lot more data before we start coming back, you will start showing you here's what the tax rates are here as it compares to Priceline's. Here's what we see versus industry and how many new people are coming from the air funnel versus the others? I would just lead everyone with the sense that we're very pleased this is bringing us new customers. New customers who are buying not just flight tickets, but some of them are buying hotels, too. this is proving out a little bit of our long-term vision of this connected trip. Now do I expect that to happen with something like activities. I'm not really think a lot of people are going to come for an activity first, then they're going to buy a flight or then they're going to buy a hotel. It's -- that's going to be a lot more the other way in helping produce the loyalty and the repeat business that we talked about. And then goes into all the things I was talking about in terms of using a wallet, so we can get credits and have different suppliers be able to promote different offerings in different ways to different customers. All that spins together, increasing that flywheel. And that's what we're trying to achieve, and it's just so great to see it start happening right now, even though it's very early."

Let me give generalities about what I think about leisure versus business and the core business in general, what I think is going to be happening in the future. And David go back and talk about what we've disclosed in the past about the mix. So you'r",573,"Yes. Let me give generalities about what I think about leisure versus business and the core business in general, what I think is going to be happening in the future. And David go back and talk about what we've disclosed in the past about the mix. So you're right in the sense that we are much more leisure oriented. And much of our business travel is small business people. These are people who are doing their own travel. This is not part of the big travel management company operation. So it's a little bit different when we have business travelers and they act somewhat similar to leisure sometimes. The fact is we've all seen is that leisure is out of the gate much faster than any business travel, which makes perfect sense. Because on one hand, you have business people who say there's a risk factor when you put people in travel, et cetera. And there's also the issue of cost. Why have people travel when you don't have to. That second part, I think, is very key for the future of the business. I believe that there's still going to be resistance by CFOs, other people who are cost conscious in their businesses about, gee, do we really have to have the travel we did in the past? Maybe not because with these new technologies and such, we seem to be pretty effective without having to send somebody from New York to $115,000 through a 1-day meeting. And I think that's going to somewhat change how the business of travel is done in sense there'll be fewer people upfront in the plane and spending a lot of money on those very high-cost 5-star hotels, et cetera, which will change things a little bit. For us, we're leisure. So it's not going to impact us negatively so much. In fact, they help us as there's more availability that needs to get filled up. The other thing you mentioned, though, in which intel plays out, though, with more people being able to work from home and siding, I think Friday, I'm going to work with somewhere else and have a Friday, Saturday, Sunday or a Thursday, Friday Carry Sunday many holidays somewhere working on Thursday, Friday, but in a different location. How much is that going to actually build more travel uncertainty at this time since everybody is still shifting around, what's the way to work in the future, how many days are we in offices, how many days are we not in offices. Nobody knows the answer to that yet, and it's going to take a long time to play out. But I do hope that we'll hopefully build out more travel, we like more travel. So there's a lot of uncertainty about and nobody really knows. And even as much as I've heard, the encouraging signs from some of the suppliers, particularly some of the airlines, I saw a Deloitte report came out a couple of days ago, maybe yesterday, in which the expectation of corporate travel was not is optimistic in the near term. So I think we have to say we don't know. We'll find out as it rolls out. And Dave, I don't know if you want to give anything more to that in terms of the numbers for us in business trial because I heard a now where he quoted, I'm not sure those was right or not."

I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I'm encouraged by another quarter of meaningful improvement in our accommodations business with Q2 room nights up sequential",1799,"Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' second quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. 
I'm encouraged by another quarter of meaningful improvement in our accommodations business with Q2 room nights up sequentially 59% versus Q1. This compares very favorably to our pre-pandemic historical pattern of a slight decline in Q2 room nights versus Q1. Compared with 2019, Q2 room nights were down 26%, which was significantly better than the 43% decline we previously reported for the month of April and a 54% decline in Q1.
The acceleration in the second quarter was primarily driven by domestic and international booking trends in Europe following a ramp-up in vaccination rates and the relaxation of many travel restrictions in the region. The growth of international bookings in Europe was mainly from bookings within the European region. The very strong room night growth in the United States that we saw in April and highlighted on our last earnings call continued in May and June, resulting in very strong U.S. room night growth for the full quarter versus Q2 2019. And David will provide additional details on our second quarter results in his remarks.  
We are, of course, closely monitoring the impact of the Delta variant on the rising COVID case counts around the world as well as some newly imposed travel restrictions which have led to a modest pullback in our booking trends in the month of July relative to June. However, the July booking trends were improved from our full Q2 results. While the rise of the Delta variant demonstrates the volatility and uncertainty around the exact timing and shape of the recovery for travel, we remain confident that we will eventually see a strong recovery in travel demand globally.  
The sharp return to growth initially in the U.S. and many of the European markets that we have witnessed this year shows us clearly that leisure travelers are eager to get back to booking trips on our platform when restrictions are lifted and customers are able to travel. We expect to be much closer to our 2019 revenue levels in Q3 than we were in Q2, driven by the strong booking improvements we have seen in the last few months.
As we have done throughout the pandemic, we will continue to build on the strengths of our core accommodation business and support its long-term growth. The strength of our core business comes from the flywheel effect we get from our 2-sided marketplace, where we drive benefits to our traveler customers and our supply partners alike. 
For our customers, we strive to deliver the best choice of accommodations, offer the most value and provide the easiest booking experience, all backed by excellent customer service and support. By addressing these critical needs of choice, value and ease, we create a superior booking experience and strengthen the relationships with our customers.  
I'm pleased to report that at Booking.com, we are seeing pre-pandemic customers coming back to us to book their trips while also attracting new customers. And the current mix of prior and new customers is not significantly different than prior to the pandemic. One of the ways we drive value to our large customer base at Booking.com is through our Genius loyalty program. 
This program provides discounts for Genius members at hundreds of thousands of properties on our platform and also offers value in other benefits like complimentary breakfast, free room upgrades and more recently, discounted airport taxes, just to name a few. We will continue innovating and adding to the ways we provide value to our Genius customers who have historically had a higher repeat rate and a higher mix of direct bookings when compared to non-Genius customers.
Our app is an important way we deliver an easier booking experience to our customers. Globally, in Q2, Booking.com was the #1 downloaded OTA app according to a third-party research firm. In the U.S. in Q2, we were the most downloaded major OTA app as downloads of the Booking.com app in the second quarter significantly increased sequentially. We also saw U.S. app users in Q2 meaningfully surpassed the prior peak observed before the COVID pandemic.
In the second quarter, we again saw a higher mix of our customers booking directly with us than in the comparable period in 2019. It is encouraging to see these gains even as we look for opportunities to lean into performance marketing channels where we see attractive ROIs. We have a long history of effectively managing our performance marketing channels to bring bookers to our platform profitably. We plan to continue with this proven approach in the future.  
In addition, we're leveraging our marketing expertise and ROI focus as we test into other channels like social and digital media as well as when we deploy promotional campaigns like our Back to Travel campaign, which we ran first in the U.S. and then launched in the U.K. and across Europe. We will continue to expand the diversity of our marketing and customer acquisition channels as we aim to drive incremental traffic to our platform and increased consumer awareness of our brands.
While we will remain focused on our efforts to grow and retain our customer base, we believe we will continue to benefit from the secular tailwind of more people booking their trips online instead of off-line. Historically, the accommodation industry has seen a steady increase in online share each year. And looking ahead, we believe this trend will continue for the foreseeable future.
In April, McKinsey published a 24-country survey with results showing that across 11 major consumer-facing industries, travel had the greatest percentage of customers that plan to increase their usage of digital channels after the pandemic. On the other side of our marketplace, we are focused on helping our supply partners reach a broader audience of potential customers. Our scale and global reach allows us to connect our supply partners with a significant amount of demand from around the world, demonstrated by the 845 million room nights booked across our platforms in 2019. 
In addition to being a large demand channel for our partners, we add value to our accommodation partners in other ways, by providing customer service support for travelers in over 40 languages, localized partner service support teams, market intelligence and data, product innovations in response to new traveler trends and fraud liability shift and access to alternative payment methods for payment-enabled transactions. Whether an alternative accommodation or an independent hotel or a large global hotel chain, we strive to be a valuable partner to all types of accommodations on our platform.  
In the second quarter, we saw the first sequential increase in the number of properties on Booking.com and the lowest number of properties coming off of our platform in the quarter since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of June 30, we had over 28 million reported listings on Booking.com, of which 6.6 million were for alternative accommodation properties. Within alternative accommodations in the U.S., Booking.com continued to add targeted new properties in the quarter and also saw encouraging share gains with some of our larger professional managers.  
While these are positive early developments, we recognize there is much work ahead to improve and grow our alternative accommodations product in the U.S. market. Our alternative accommodations business in Europe was strong in the quarter and represented an increasing share of our European accommodations business.  
I want to move to our key strategic priorities of expanding Booking.com's payment platform and building the connected tradition, both of which we believe will further enhance the strength of our core accommodation business and support its continued growth. On our integrated payment platform at Booking.com, we have made continued progress with increased the adoption of payments by our supply partners in the U.S., including adding some major hotel chains in the second quarter. Around 24% of Booking.com's total gross bookings in Q2 were processed through its payment platform, which is up from about 22% for the full year 2020.
We recently announced the organization of all of our payments initiatives and efforts into a new fintech unit at Booking.com. First, the Fintech unit will be focused on a mainly bookings core business to run better, faster and more efficiently for both customers and our supply partners. In addition, we recognize that we have opportunities to better monetize our overall transaction flows. In 2019, we did almost $100 billion of transaction value and we believe setting up a separate fintech unit to better capitalize on these flows will benefit us in the long run.  
On our connected trip vision, I mentioned on our last earnings call that the development of the connected trip this year will be focused on enabling travelers to book the major elements of their trip in one place on Booking.com. The top priority of this -- on this front has been to scale up a robust flight platform on Booking.com, which will give us the ability to engage with flight bookers fully in their travel journey and allow us an opportunity to cross-sell our accommodation and other services to these bookers. Since our last earnings call, we have launched our flight product in 6 new markets and they're now live in 24 countries.  
Inter tickets booked through Booking's flight offering have continued to meaningfully exceed our expectations. However, they still represented a small portion of our total reported air tickets, which were up 120% in Q2 versus Q2 2019. Primarily, this was driven by Priceline. While it remains early days for Booking's flight product we are seeing positive data indicating we are getting entirely new customers for Booking.com. 
In addition, we are seeing an encouraging attach rate of accommodation bookings from these new customers. These early data points help demonstrate that our flight offering creates a new funnel to bring incremental customers to the platform and they cross-sell an accommodation to these new customers. We expect to continue to build on the early success we are seeing with flight at Booking.com.  
In conclusion, I am encouraged by the signs of recovery we are seeing in some parts of the world, and I'm confident that we will eventually see a strong recovery in travel demand globally. We continue with our most important work, to strengthen our company's position and execute against our strategic priorities and our teams are working hard to support the strong summer travel season this year in North America and Europe. 
As I said before, we are thinking about our business beyond just getting back to 2019 levels of demand. and we are focused on building a larger and faster-growing business that generates more earnings after the full recovery and for the long run.  
I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden. David?"

I'll review our operating results for the second quarter and provide some color on trends we've seen so far in the third quarter. To avoid comparison to pandemic impacted peers in 2020, all growth rates will be relative to comparable periods in 2019, unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. 
Now on to our results for the second quarter. On our last earnings call, we discussed the improvement in trends in Q1, which continued into April, driven by strong results in the U.S. and improvements in Europe. Following the earnings call, we saw the overall improvements in our trends accelerate in May and continue to get better in June, which resulted in our Q2 reported room nights declining 26% versus Q2 2019, which was significantly ahead of the 54% decline in Q1, but 43% decline we saw in April and our expectations in May.  
The improvement in Q2 room nights growth rate versus Q1 was driven by Europe and the U.S. as well as better results in Rest of World. Europe showed the greatest level of recovery in the quarter and actually achieved slight room night growth versus 2019 in June. Booking trends in Europe clearly benefited from a notable improvement in vaccination rates as well as loosening travel restrictions.  
The U.S. was again the strongest reporting major country in Q2 and had very strong room night growth versus 2019 for the full quarter. Asia partially offset the improvements in other regions with greater room night declines in Q2 than in Q1 due to the increase in COVID outbreaks with related travel restrictions.  
In the month of June, our room nights were down 13%, and our monthly active unique customer accounts at Booking.com reached about 90% of the level we saw in June 2019. As Glenn mentioned, we are pleased to see the solid rebound in our customer base at Booking.com as well as a healthy mix of new customers, which is only a little lower than the mix of new customers in Q2 2019.  
Mobile bookings, particularly through our apps, represented over 60% of our total room nights. Our app continues to represent an increased percentage of our mobile bookings. Our direct channel increased as a percentage of our room nights year-on-year and relative to Q2 2019. Domestic room nights grew in the mid-teens in Q2, while international room nights remained down significantly versus 2019, we saw a sequential improvement in our international bookings resulting in the international mix of our room nights increasing to about 25% in Q2 and from about 15% in Q1.
Our cancellation rates improved in Q1 and were in line with Q2 2019 levels in the quarter. The percentage of our Q2 2021 bookings made with flexible cancellation policies remained significantly higher than in Q2 2019. The booking window at Booking.com remained shorter than it was in the second quarter of 2019 as we continued to see a higher mix of near-term bookings. However, the booking window contracted less than it did in the prior 3 quarters.  
The mix of alternative accommodation room nights on Booking.com in Q2 was 32%, which is 3 points higher than Q1. In June, our alternative accommodation room night growth was flat versus June 2019, the first time we've reached 2019 levels for this segment since the start of COVID. The sequential improvement from Q1 to Q2 was due primarily to the overall improvement in room night growth in Europe in the quarter. 
As we noted last quarter, Europe is where we have our highest mix of alternative accommodations. Within Europe, -- Our mixed alternative accommodations remained about the same as Q1, and this represents a continued increase from 2019 to 2020 and into 2021. 
Gross bookings declined 12% in Q2, which is less than the decline in reported room nights due to an increase in average day rates for accommodations of 11% versus 2019 on a constant currency basis and also due to a few points of changes in FX rates and strong performance in our flights business. Our accommodation constant currency ADR benefited by about 7% from an increased mix of business in North America, which is the high ADR region, and a decrease in mix of business in Asia, which is a lower ADR region. 
Excluding regional mix effects, constant currency ADRs were up approximately 4%, driven mainly by rate increases in North America and in Europe. The increase in North America were driven by high levels of demand for beach-oriented leisure destinations. And in Europe, were driven by a higher mix of summer bookings, which have higher ADRs.  
Airline tickets booked in the second quarter were up 120% versus 2019, driven by strong growth at Priceline and by flights bookings at Booking.com and Agoda, neither of which had flight crops in Q2 2019. We are encouraged to see another record freight quarter for air tickets booked through our flights business, which is a key component of our multiproduct connected trip strategy.  
Consolidated revenue for the second quarter was $2.2 billion and decreased 44% versus 2019, which is better than our expectations. Revenue in the quarter declined meaningfully more than gross bookings due to bookings made in the quarter that are expected to check in, in future quarters at which point the revenue will be recognized. 
Take rates in Q2 were about 10%, largely driven by these timing differences. As you'll recall, we discussed the impact of timing on take rates in Q1, Q2 and for the full year during our last call. We continue to expect these timing factors to impact full year take rates, although the second half of the year will be less negatively impacted than the first half of the year. Removing the impact of timing, our take rates on accommodation bookings in Q2 was stable versus Q2 2019.  
The better-than-expected top line performance resulted in adjusted EBITDA of $48 million in the second quarter, which came in better than our expectations. With the exception of Q3 last year, this is the first EBITDA positive quarter since the first wave of COVID.  
Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line, decreased 29% versus 2019. Marketing expense declined more than gross bookings due to higher ROIs in the pay channels and the increase in our direct mix. Sales and other expense in Q2 were significantly higher than they were in Q1 on a dollar basis. Sales and other expenses as a factor of revenue in Q2 was better than our expectations due to lower-than-expected bad debt and customer service-related expenses.  
Personnel expenses in Q2 were higher than they were in Q1 on a dollar basis primarily due to the $136 million of expenses related to our decision to repay the government aid in the second quarter. Excluding this repayment, personnel expenses in Q2 would have been in line with our expectations. G&A and IT expenses were both higher in Q2 than they were in Q1 on a dollar basis and were in line with our expectations. We recorded a non-GAAP loss of $105 million in the quarter.  
On a GAAP basis, we had an operating loss of $56 million in Q2. We recorded a GAAP net loss of $167 million in the quarter, which includes income tax expense of $126 million. On a GAAP and non-GAAP basis in Q2, we recorded a tax expense on a pretax loss due to higher earnings expectations for the full year relative to our expectations for Q1. For the full year, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be slightly higher than in 2019.  
Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q2 ending cash and investment balance of $16.1 billion was down versus our Q1 ending balance of $16.4 billion. However, our Q1 ending balance benefited from the timing of the $2 billion raised in our Eurobond offering, which we completed in March and the subsequent redemptions of the 2 higher coupon senior notes occurring in April. 
Adjusting our Q1 ending cash balance for the redemption of the 2 notes that happened in April would have resulted in an adjusted Q1 cash balance of $14.4 billion. Our Q2 ending balance was higher than this adjusted Q on balance, primarily due to operating cash flow of $1.2 billion and a $0.5 billion unrealized gain on our long-term investments.
$0.2 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter was driven almost entirely by a change in working capital. Change in working capital represented a source of cash of $1.2 billion in the quarter due to the increase in our deferred merchant bookings and other current liabilities, partially offset by the increase in our accounts receivable.  
We will continue to focus on maintaining a strong liquidity position, given the continued uncertainty created by the COVID pandemic. Of the $16.1 billion of cash and investments at the end of Q2, $4.3 billion was related to our long-term strategic investments and $11.7 billion was cash and short-term investments. We ended the quarter with about $12.3 billion in debt, which is about $3.6 billion higher than our pre-pandemic levels. We have a $1 billion convertible note maturing in Q3.  
While return of capital to shareholders will be an important component of our value creation strategy in the future, we remain on pause and we'll wait to reinitiate until we believe each of our 3 major regions is beyond the risk of a significant reversal in trends due to COVID. We're not there yet, given the current trends we're seeing in Asia and with our current close watch on how things are developing in Europe.  
Now on to our force for the third quarter. With the recent rising case counts driven by Delta -- by the Delta variants in many countries, some governments around the world have responded with new travel and leisure restrictions as well as some stricter vaccination and testing requirements for tourists. However, there are indications that optimization rates are lagging the recent increases in case counts, particularly in countries with high vaccination rates, which could be an important factor in how governments plan their responses to the recent increase in COVID cases. 
We're closely watching the U.K. where the vaccination rate is high and the government has moved forward with relaxing travel restriction despite rising case counts in the country, which are among the highest in Europe. We're encouraged by the recent decline in new case counts and by the continued lower level of hospitalizations in the U.K. compared with other outbreaks. We saw booking trends improve in the U.K. in July, leading up to and after travel restrictions were lifted on July 19.  
Our July room nights declined about 22% versus 2019, which was a modest pullback from the 13% decline in June, primarily to softening booking trends in Europe. Looking within Europe, we saw reductions in room nights in July across several of our key countries, including Germany, France and Italy. But despite the recent pullback in these countries at the end of July, we had a higher amount of gross bookings on the books for the remaining summer period in Europe than we did at this same point in time in 2019.  
Outside of Europe, the U.S. continued to have a very strong room night growth in July, although modestly below Q2 levels. While Asia and rest of world room night declines were about the same in July as they were in June. Asia continues to be the least recovered region in July and continues to be down significantly from 2019 levels.  
The change in growth rates from June to July were similar for domestic and international room nights, with domestic remaining positive and international room nights remaining down significantly versus 2019. Given the recent additional uncertainty around COVID, driven primarily by the Delta variant, it's difficult to predict exactly how room nights in August and September will compare with the 22% reduction we saw in July.  
Turning to the income statement, we expect Q3 gross bookings to decline several points less than room nights, driven by expected improvements in reported ADRs and by flight bookings. We expect that the Q3 revenue decline will significantly improve from Q2, reflecting the strong improvement in bookings in the last few months. 
I just mentioned we have more gross bookings for the summer than at this time in 2019 for Europe. The same is also true for North America. We expect our Q3 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings will increase meaningfully from Q2 due to the high concentration of check-ins expected in the third quarter and will be about in line with Q3 2019. As a reminder, the exact relationship between revenue and gross bookings in Q3 will be impacted by how our bookings trend in August and September. 
We expect marketing expenses in Q3 will decline several points less than gross bookings as we expect to invest in capturing demand and increasing awareness during the peak travel season and ahead of the continued global recovery of travel demand. We expect sales and other expenses in Q3 to be up significantly versus Q2 on dollar basis due to higher gross booking volumes in the third quarter as well as a mix -- as well as an increase in the mix of gross bookings process on a merchant basis. However, we expect sales and other as a percentage of revenue in Q3 will be a bit lower than in Q2.  
We expect our more fixed expense categories in Q3 in aggregate to be about in line with Q2 on a dollar basis. We expect Q3 EBITDA will be the highest since Q3 2019. In conclusion, we are pleased with our better-than-expected results in Q2, which benefited from a recovery in travel demand and also reflects the strong fundamentals of our business and a good execution by our teams. 
We remain confident in the eventual full recovery of travel demand globally and we're looking forward to a strong summer travel season this year in North America and Europe. We'll continue to responsibly invest in our business to ensure we're well positioned for the full recovery of travel and for building a larger and faster-growing business that generates more earnings than prior to the pandemic.

I think we spoke a little bit about that when I did the prepared remarks and what I just said now, is a lot of this is just working hard with people who are the property owners or the managers, people who have inventory, they want to get it built.

Let me talk a little bit about marketing what was going on. I think I understood the question. But basically, what you see was in Q2, our marketing expense, the decline of our gross bookings, which is the way to look at it. Because if you look at it versus revenue, you've got all the different books to say timing and things in there. So look at it as a potential of growth bookings. 
That ratio improved in the second quarter. So said differently, our marketing expenses declined more than our gross bookings did. Two factors, we did see higher ROIs across many of our paid channels that we store a couple of years ago, but we also saw a nice increase in mix towards direct as well. So the more we have direct mix and obviously then the less we're paying for marketing to attract those new customers. 
So I'd say nothing particularly unique to call out in that. The market environment is built -- I'd say isn't fully stackable yet, clearly. We're still going through a stage of recovery in the industry. So not all factors are directly comparable with where we were with 2019, but we were pleased to see that the ROI did improve. Now bear in mind what I said about the Q3 implies that the opposite is likely to happen in Q3. Obviously, we're only a month into Q3, but we are stepping up our marketing spend in Q3. It is historically, the quarter where we spend the most is the peak season. 
We want to really capture demand, the customers that are out there. We'll also be increasing our spend -- brand spend in Q3 relative to Q2. So that's one of the contributors to essentially what will be some deleverage in marketing spend relative to gross bookings in Q3. 
So we'll see how the quarter developed, but that's what we expect to happen in the third quarter. But in the first 2 quarters, we did see that benefit in ROI helping us create some leverage on the marketing line."

But we always do it with the knowledge that it's got to be cost effective. It's got to produce, in the long run, because it takes longer for a brand to actually produce results, so we recognize that.

So assuming that cancellation rates stay the same, then that would potentially result in more revenue in those markets for the summer months, for the remaining months. Now I did notice -- I did also point out that we will have -- that we have a higher percentage of cancelable bookings out there or refundable bookings out there than we had at the same time in 2019 as well. So there's obviously some risk that more of those bookings cancel than they would have done in the same period of time. 
So it means basically that our potential revenue base for the summer is higher now in those 2 markets than it was in 2019. Now obviously, the offset there is what's happening in Europe -- sorry, in Asia and what's happening in rest of world. We don't have that situation.

And then second one for David. A follow-up question on the sales and marketing ROI. You guys had called out higher ROIs last quarter and again this quarter. So I was curious if this is a result of something that you're doing differently? Or is this just more of an outcome due to the competitive dynamic on the performance advertising channels?"

We know that there are ways that we can save money for the consumers and the suppliers on both sides, and we can make good money on it, too, in the long run. 
So it's coming up with things like providing better FX tools. It's things, for example, making sure that if somebody wants to pay in an alternative payment method, that we're able to provide that. It means making sure that we can do a better job with different types of regulations in terms of making sure that any type of transaction is not fraudulent. It's all sorts of things. 
As a player at scale -- we can do things that many, many on their partners, that our partners could not do, and it's also providing conveniences to our customers who want it, but our suppliers can't do it on their own. And there are lots of different things that we can do. Even things as simple as our Fintech unit setting something up like our e-Wallet, an electronic wallet that enables us to easily provide value to that customer, which can come from a supplier or it can be something that we're promoting ourselves, all different things. 
So what I see is not only the basics that we need to make our connected trip work, which, of course, you have to have that if you want to create a connected trip with a single price point, one person pays one amount. But it's all these other types of things that we can provide that others really can't do on their own right now."

And then on the second quarter ROIs, our playbook really has not changed, and our strategy in the performance marketing channels have not changed. We continue to seek high-quality traffic at the right price. And to us, high quality means high converting traffic, lower probability cancellation, which we watch very carefully, high probability is coming back to us on a direct basis. And those are the things that are kind of going to our bidding strategy plus all the dynamics that occur in each of those marketplaces.
So we expect there'll be ROI volatility throughout the recovery. Of course, we also look at what the available demand is and when there are time to kind of lean into this and lean in more. We are certainly looking at this as an opportunity to win customers onto our platform and get new customers, and we mentioned a very healthy mix of new customers on -- in the business quite similar to the mixture it was in Q2 '19. 
So we're pleased with how things are going. We like the way that we're bringing back existing customers. We like the way we're winning new customers. We're pleased to see the existing customers come back generally much more directly than the new customers, which you expect as part of the playbook. 
So I'd say many factors go into those ROI calculations, including cost per click, conversion rates, cancellation rates, and we're still in a period of relatively high volatility in each of those compared to where we were in 2019."

And there are so many things that need to be done to really improve the air product at Booking.com.

We got to have -- talked a little bit before, before you start really marketing, so make sure you got the product the way you want it. 
So it's so encouraging that we're doing well with it right now, even though I see a lot of things that still need to be done to improve that product. And something that we're really pleased with is seeing the attachment rate, again, is something that we obviously, the reason that we want to do this is not just to sell the flight ticket, it's to actually get some that is higher margin, those accommodations and build out that connected trip.

There's some customers who don't book quite as much, and we kind of love them all, but we want to make sure we kind of see it differently. And I'd say that's part of the reason why we have our Genius program. Of course, the more often you work with us or book with us on Booking.com, the higher you move up the Genius ladder and you get more benefits from the Genius program, which is I think a nice way of driving loyalty.

Now I had a good sense that was going to happen anyway because we've been seeing that happen in Priceline for 2 decades where that's been happening. So I have good confidence that this would happen. But it's something that I believe we want to have a lot more data before we start coming back here, we start showing you, here's what the attachment rates are. Here as it compares to Priceline's. Here's what we see versus industry and how many new people are coming from the air funnel versus the others? 
I would just lead everyone with the sense that we're very pleased this is bringing us new customers. New customers who are buying not just flight tickets, but some of them are buying hotels, too. this is proving out a little bit of our long-term vision of this connected trip. 
Now do I expect that to happen with something like activities? I'm not really think a lot of people are going to come for an activity first, then they're going to buy a flight or then they're going to buy a hotel. It's -- that's going to be a lot more the other way in helping produce the loyalty and the repeat business that we talked about.

But just curious how you think about leisure over the long run? And then the second part is on the corporate side. Any early indications of recovery there and how you think that evolves through the second half of this year?"

Let me give generalities about what I think about leisure versus business and the core business in general, what I think is going to be happening in the future. And David go back and talk about what we've disclosed in the past about the mix. 
So you're right in the sense that we are much more leisure oriented. And much of our business travel is small business people. These are people who are doing their own travel. This is not part of the big travel management company operation. So it's a little bit different when we have business travelers and they act somewhat similar to leisure sometimes. 
The fact is and we've all seen is that leisure is out of the gate much faster than any business travel, which makes perfect sense. Because on the one hand, you have business people who say there's a risk factor when you put people in travel, et cetera. And there's also the issue of cost. Why have people travel if you don't have to? 
That second part, I think, is very key for the future of the business. I believe that there's still going to be resistance by CFOs, other people who are cost conscious in their businesses about, gee, do we really have to have all the traveling we did in the past? Maybe not because with these new technology and such, we seem to be pretty effective without having to send somebody from New York to London at $15,000 for a 1-day meeting. 
And I think that's going to somewhat change how the business of travel is done and hence there'll be fewer people upfront in the plane and spending a lot of money on those very high-cost 5-star hotels, et cetera, which will change things a little bit. For us, we're leisure. So it's not going to impact us negatively so much. In fact, they help us as there's more availability that needs to get filled up. 
The other thing you mentioned, though, which usually how it plays out, though, with more people being able to work from home and deciding, gee, I think, Friday, I'm going to work from somewhere else and have a Friday, Saturday, Sunday or a Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday mini holiday summer working on Thursday, Friday, but in a different location. How much is that going to actually build more travel? Uncertain at this time since everybody is still shifting around, what's the way to work in the future? How many days are we in offices? How many days are we not in offices? Nobody knows the answer to that yet, and it's going to take a long time to play out. 
But I do hope that we'll, hopefully, build out more travel, we like more travel. So there's a lot of uncertainty about this and nobody really knows. And even as much as I've heard, the encouraging signs from some of the suppliers, particularly some of the airlines, I saw a Deloitte report came out a couple of days ago, maybe yesterday, in which the expectation of corporate travel was not as optimistic in the near term. 
So I think we have to say we don't know. We'll find out as it rolls out. And David, I don't know if you want to give anything more to that in terms of the numbers for us in business travel because I heard a number he quoted, I'm not sure if that was right or not."

I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden.I am pleased to be reporting strong results today for our peak travel season. Compared with 2019, Q3 room nights were down 18%",2028,"Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' third quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden.
I am pleased to be reporting strong results today for our peak travel season. Compared with 2019, Q3 room nights were down 18%, which was an improvement from the 22% decline we previously reported for the month of July and the 26% decline in Q2. The improvement since July was primarily driven by stronger rent trends in Europe. In the United States, room night growth in Q3 was strong but lower than Q2. These are room night declines in Q3 were about in line with Q2 and remained down significantly versus 2019. 
International travel, which is important to our business, drove the overall sequential improvement in room night trends from Q2 to Q3. Nevertheless, our international room night remains significantly depressed versus 2019. 
Q3 consolidated revenue of $4.7 billion was more than double the amount of revenue in Q2. The third quarter was also our most profitable quarter since Q3 2019, with $2.1 billion of adjusted EBITDA and a 45% adjusted EBITDA margin. 
Moving into the fourth quarter. We have seen a further improvement in our room night trends in October, including early signs of a pickup in room night trends in Asia. However, recently rising COVID case counts in many countries, including several important European countries, adds to the uncertainty around how November and December trends will progress. David will provide additional details on our third quarter results and what we are seeing so far in the fourth quarter in his remarks. 
The improvement in trends we saw in the third quarter and so far in the fourth quarter following the negative -- following a negative impact from the Delta variant in July and August, once again demonstrates the resilience of leisure travelers who are looking to travel when it is safe to do so and restrictions are lifted. We are confident that we are on the path to the eventual strong recovery in travel demand globally. 
As the global recovery continues, we are making progress strengthening our core accommodation business to support its long-term growth. As I said before, the strength of our core business comes from driving benefits to our traveler customers and our supply partners alike. 
For our customers, we are aiming to create a superior booking experience and build stronger relationships, which we believe is accomplished by addressing our customers' critical needs of value, choice and ease of use. We continue to see Booking.com's pre-pandemic customers coming back and booking with us while we're also attracting new customers. Importantly, we see our top customers from before the pandemic returning to us at a meaningfully higher frequency than other customers. 
Providing attractive prices on accommodations is a key component of offering value for our customers. We work closely with our supply partners to increase participation in our targeted rate programs to ensure that compelling prices are available to our customers. Our Genius loyalty program at Booking.com is a great example of a program where hundreds of thousands of our property partners are participating to offer lower rates and other benefits such as complementary practice, room upgrades and discounted airport taxis to our large customer base. 
In addition to offering lower rates on accommodations, we have recently extended lower rates on rental cars to our Genius customers. This is just one example of the way we continue to innovate and add value for our Genius members. 
With about 2/3 of our room nights booked on mobile devices and the majority of those booked through the app, it's critical that we provide our customers with a positive booking experience on our app. The app is an important platform as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers. And ultimately, we see it as the center of our connected trip experience. 
In the third quarter, Booking.com was once again the #1 downloaded OTA app globally according to a third-party research firm. Also in the third quarter, we surpassed 100 million monthly active app users for the first time. The recent growth of Booking.com's app is encouraging, and we are working hard to continue to build on this success. 
In the third quarter, we saw a higher mix of our customers booking directly with us than in the third quarter of 2019. Our direct mix improved even as we leaned into performance marketing channels during our peak travel season. While we will continue to invest in performance marketing, we will also look to expand the diversity of our marketing and customer acquisition channels as we aim to drive incremental traffic to our platform and increase consumer awareness of our brands. 
For example, with our ambition to acquire more customers in the medium intent space, we've made progress in strengthening our foundations for digital marketing, including in social channels, though our spend so far has been small. However, we're increasingly confident in the potential for these channels. And as we see positive results, we expect to raise our level of participation there. 
Remaining active and investing effectively across marketing channels is made even more important by the opportunity to acquire bookers who are new to online booking channels. Travel, like many industries during pandemic, has seen a meaningful shift from offline to online according to third-party data, and this has increased our addressable market. 
For our supply partners, we are focused on bringing incremental demand to their properties from the broad audience of the tender customers on our platform. In a survey of 600 small and medium hoteliers in Europe conducted earlier this year, 85% of response agreed that online platforms are a cost-efficient way to increase the reach of their hotel and source more diverse guests. 
We agree with this statement and believe it applies more broadly. Whether we are working with a small and medium hotel in Europe for an alternative accommodation or a large global hotel chain, we strive to be a valuable partner to all accommodation types on our platform. 
With our chain hotel partners, we are continuing to see increased engagement relative to 2019 levels, which shows up in higher levels of participation in our programs that enable them to differentiate and promote themselves on our platform. 
For our alternative accommodations, the global mix of room nights in Q3 of about 30% was up slightly from Q3 2019. This increase in alternative combination share of our business in the quarter was less than it was in Q2 as we saw a greater sequential improvement in demand for hotel room nights in Europe from Q2 to Q3. Our property count of about 2.4 million and reported listings of over 28 million on Booking.com remained stable relative to the prior quarter. 
Let me talk more about some of our key strategic priorities, payments and the connected trip, both of which we believe will further enhance the strength of our core accommodations business and support its continued growth. 
Turning to payments at Booking.com. Last quarter, we spoke about the organization of all of our payments initiatives and efforts within a new Fintech unit at Booking.com. The recently established Fintech unit enables Booking.com to have a dedicated focus on enhancing payments in our core business for both customers and partners as well as monetizing our overall transaction flows via new payments-related products and services. 
Adoption of our payment solutions by our supply partners in both the U.S. and Europe continues to grow. Adoption in the U.S. has seen significant increases recently, driven by the additions of some major hotel chains in the second and third quarters, which we will look to build on in the fourth quarter. 
In Europe, more customers are choosing to pay using Booking.com's payment platform when finalizing their booking as attractive and localized options are provided. This is a result in nearly 1/3 of Booking.com's total gross bookings in Q3 being processed through our payment platform, which is up from about 22% for the full year 2020. 
The Fintech unit is also driving continued payments innovation to ensure that growth is sustained into the future. This includes offering low-cost payout choices to our suppliers as well as partnering with third parties to provide payment solutions to our bookers, such as Buy Now, Pay Later. We believe these efforts help position Booking.com as an attractive and trusted payment intermediary for all parties on our platform. 
On our connected trip vision, we have been focused this year on enabling travelers to book the major elements of their trip in one place on Booking.com. We continue to work on scaling up a robust flight platform on Booking.com, which will give us the ability to engage with flight bookers early in their travel journey and allow us an opportunity to cross-sell our accommodation and other services to these bookers. Booking.com's product is now live in 27 countries. 
Total company air tickets in the third quarter was up 131% versus Q3 2019, primarily driven by strength at Priceline, but also helped by Booking.com's life offering, which continues to meaningfully exceed our expectations. While it remains early days for Booking's flight product, we are seeing that over 25% of Booking's flight bookers are entirely new customers. With these new customers, we are seeing an encouraging attach rate of accommodation bookings. 
However, there is more work to be done to further optimize the cross-sell opportunity. The early signals help demonstrate though that a flight offering can drive incremental new customers to the platform to which we can cross-sell our accommodation product. 
We are beginning to test initiatives targeting these new flight customers, including, for example, encouraging account creation to activate Genius status and in some cases, offering additional incentives for them to book accommodations. We remain focused on continuing to test and innovate in order to build on the early successes we are seeing with flights at Booking.com. We're also continuing to run tests using offerings from our verticals like Rentalcars and taxis. 
Now before closing, I do want to note that as world leaders assembled this week in Glasgow for the COP26 Summit, discussing the urgency of tackling the global climate crisis, I cannot overstate the importance for our industry to come together to work for the goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. Decarbonization is a major challenge for the entire industry and solving this challenge requires the commitment of all stakeholders. 
I am proud to say that our company, Booking Holdings, is committed to addressing this challenge. We recently released a report that recommissioned with EY partner that looks into what will it take to get the accommodations industry specifically to a carbon-neutral future. While a big task, data shows it is achievable. At Booking.com, we are working on making it easier for travelers to find and choose sustainable combination options with booking their travel. 
In addition, we're working with our accommodation of supply partners by sharing guidance, insights and best practices to enhance sustainability initiatives at the property level. Of course, there is much more that must be done. But we believe that we are taking important steps to contribute to a more sustainable future for our industry. And finally, we plan on publishing a Booking Holdings Climate Transition Plan in early 2022, which we'll speak more about at that time. 
In conclusion, we executed well and produced strong results in our peak travel season, which is a credit to the hard work and support provided by the many teams across our company. I'm encouraged by the signs of recovery we are seeing in many parts of the world, and I'm confident that we are on the path to an eventual strong recovery in travel demand globally. 
We continue with our important work to strengthen our company's position and execute against our strategic priorities. As I've said before, we were thinking about our business beyond just getting back to 2019 levels of demand and we are focused on building a larger and faster-growing business that generates more earnings after the full recovery and for the long run. 
I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden. David? David, is dialing back in, I think."

Thank you, off and I'm back in again. So thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I'll review our results for the third quarter to provide some color on the trends we've seen so far in the fourth quarter. To avoid the comparison to the pandemic-impacted periods in 2020. All growth rates are relative to compare period in 2019, unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. 
Now on to our results for the third quarter. On our last earnings call, we discussed the improvement in trends that we saw throughout the second quarter driven by the U.S. and Europe, followed by a mass pullback in July. After our earnings call, we saw our overall trends improve in August and continue to get better in September, which resulted in Q3 reported room nights declining 18% versus Q3 2019, which was ahead of the 26% decline in Q2 and the 22% decline in July. September was the strongest month in the third quarter, with room nights declining 14%, about the same level as June. 
The improvements in the Q3 room night decline versus Q2 was driven primarily by Europe, which benefited from strong cross-border travel within the region. In Q3, room nights in Europe were down mid-single digits versus 2019, with room nights trends improving in August versus July. September was similar to August. You will recall the room night growth pulled back from June to July in Europe due to concerns over the Delta variants. 
Rest of World also improved from Q2 to Q3. In the U.S., we -- Q2 to Q3. However, the U.S. still had strong growth in the quarter and remained our strongest performing major country in Q3. Within the U.S., we saw a meaningful slowdown in August from the very strong growth we experienced in July, followed by a recovery to strong growth in September. The slowdown in the U.S. in August was due to concerns about the Delta variants. Asian room night declines in Q3 were about in line with Q2. Room nights in Asia was still down significantly from 2019 levels. 
Mobile bookings, primarily through our apps, represent about 2/3 of our total room nights. Our apps continue to represent an increasing percentage of our mobile bookings. In Q3, as Glenn mentioned, we achieved an important milestone in the use of our Appetbooking.com, surpassing 100 million monthly active users. 
We're also pleased to see the number of unique customers booking via our app in the quarter grew strongly compared with Q3 2019. Our direct channel as a percentage of our room nights year-on-year and relative to Q3 2019 increased. 
While international room nights remain downwards in 2019, we saw another sequential improvement in our international trends, with the international mix of our room nights increasing to about 33% in Q3 from about 25% in Q2 and about 15% in Q1. Most of this improvement in international room nights came from bookings for travel within Europe. We continue to see double-digit growth in domestic room nights in Q3, but at a slightly lower level than in Q2. 
The pickup in international travel in the quarter was a driver of the improvements in overall room night trends from Q2 to Q3. However, international room nights were down almost 50% compared with Q3 2019 levels. 
Our Q3 cancellation rate was slightly above Q3 2019 levels. However, cancellation rates improved in the quarter, and September was slightly better than 2019 for the month. Percentage of our -- of our Q3 2021 bookings made with flexible cancellation policies remained significantly higher than in Q3 2019. 
The booking window of Booking.com remain shorter than it was in the third quarter of 2019 and contracted more than it did in Q2 as we saw a high mix of near-term bookings during our peak summer season. All regions had a shorter booking window in Q3 than in Q3 2019. 
For our alternative accommodations, the global mix of room nights in Q3 of about 30% was up slightly from Q3 2019. The increase in mixed alternative accommodations in the quarter was less than it was in Q2 as we saw a great -- a greater sequential improvement in demand for hotel room nights in Europe from Q2 to Q3. Our alternative accommodation room nights in Europe grew slightly in August and September versus 2019, and for the quarter, were about in line with Q3 2019. We believe we benefited from the strength of our portfolio in Europe, where we can respond to solid demand for alternative accommodations and an improving demand for hotels. 
Gross bookings declined 6% in Q3, which is less than the decline in room nights due to the increase in average day rates for accommodations of about 10% versus 2019 on a constant currency basis and also due to a couple of points of benefit from changes in FX rates and strong performance in our flight business. 
Our combination of constant currency ADR benefited by just over 5 percentage points for an increased mix of business in North America, which is a high ADR region and a decrease of mix in Asia, which is a low ADR region. Excluding regional mix effects, constant currency ADRs were up just over 4%, driven mainly by rate increases in Europe and North America across many destination types with notable strength in beach-oriented leisure destinations. 
[indiscernible] booked in the third quarter were up 131% versus 2019, driven by very strong growth of Priceline and by flight bookings at Booking.com. We're encouraged to see another quarter of triple-digit growth from our flights business, which is a key component of our multiproduct connected trip strategy. 
Consolidated revenue for the third quarter was $4.7 billion, which was 7% below Q3 2019 and was more than double the amount of revenue in Q2 2021, a far greater sequential improvement than in 2019. Our Q3 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was about in line with Q3 2019, which was in line with our expectations. We experienced even more revenue seasonality in Q3 2021 than normal due to the concentration of stays in Q3 from bookings made in the quarter and also from bookings [indiscernible] when customers could book at combinations, but could not stay due to restrictions and other COVID-related concerns. 
The strong top line performance resulted in adjusted EBITDA of $2.1 billion in the third quarter, which was 15% below Q3 2019. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense item, decreased 3% versus Q3 2019. Marketing expense declined by a few points less than gross bookings due to slightly lower ROIs in paid channels as we invested into capturing demand during the peak travel season. 
Sales to our expenses in Q3 were significantly higher than they were in Q2 on a dollar basis due to higher volume of merchant gross bookings, which increased as a percentage of total gross bookings in the third quarter. At Booking.com, the amount of gross bookings processed through our payment platform in Q3 was over $6 billion, which was almost 1/3 of Booking.com's business, up from about 1/4 in Q2. 
Our more fixed expense categories in Q3 in aggregate came in 3% lower than Q2, as the $136 million of personnel expense in the second quarter related to our decision to repay the government aid was mostly offset by an increase from Q2 to Q3 in our bonus accruals and digital service tax expense, both of which are accrued proportional to revenue. 
Our non-GAAP EPS was $37.70, down 17% versus Q3 2019. Non-GAAP net income of $1.6 billion reflects a non-GAAP tax rate of 21%, which is higher than the 19% in Q3 2019 due to a higher proportion of non-tax expenses in relation to lower pretax income versus 2019. 
On a GAAP basis, we had operating income of $2 billion in Q3. We recorded GAAP net income of $769 million in the quarter, which includes a $1 billion pretax unrealized loss on our equity investments, primarily related to our investment in Meituan as well as income tax expense of $199 million. 
Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q3 ending cash investment balance of $15.4 billion was down versus our Q2 ending balance of $16.1 billion as the $1.5 billion of free cash flow was more than offset by the repayment of a $1 billion convertible note maturing in Q3 and the $1 billion unrealized loss on our equity investments. 
The return of capital to shareholders has and will be an important component of our value creation strategy. Throughout the COVID pandemic, we said that we restart returning capital to shareholders when we saw that our 3 largest regions were no longer a meaningful risk of a major reversal due to COVID and has also become more predictable. 
Assuming that travel recovery continues, we plan to restart returning capital in early 2022 under our remaining authorization. Assuming continued recovery, we'd expect to complete this organization within 3 years from restarting. 
Now on to our thoughts for the fourth quarter. October room nights declined 10% versus 2019, which is better than the 14% decline in September. The improvement in October was driven mainly by Asia, although the region remains down considerably versus 2019. The improvement in Asia was led by domestic travel within many countries and was driven by improving vaccination progress and governments easing restrictions on travel. 
Room night growth in the U.S. improved a little from September to October and remained strong in October. Rest of World also improved a little in October and was back close to 2019 levels. Room night declines in Europe were about the same in October as they were in September, but weakened towards the end of the month. This resulted in overall room night declines being higher in the last week of October than the average for the month. The slowdown at the end of October in Europe was driven by a number of countries that have seen recent increases in COVID infections, including Germany, Russia and Italy. 
Given the ongoing uncertainty around COVID, it's difficult to predict how room nights in November, December will compare with the 10% reduction you saw in October. Looking forward to November and December, the rising case counts across many important Western European countries and across much of Eastern Europe as well at the start of the winter season in the Northern Hemisphere, which in 2020 contributed to an increase in COVID cases, creates unpredictability. Also pre pandemic, the contribution of Asia to total room nights were highest in November and December, and Asia is still our least recovered region. 
On a more positive note, since the U.S. announced in late September plans to ease travel restrictions in November for international travels to have vaccinated, we've seen a significant improvement in room nights booked by Europeans that travel to the U.S. as well as the reverse. Also, we're pleased to see more gross bookings on the books for the Christmas, New Year period than we saw at this time in 2019 in the U.S. and Western Europe. 
Turning to the income statement. We expect Q4 gross bookings to decline by a few points less than room nights, driven by higher reported ADRs and flight bookings versus 2019. We expect less of an increase in our ADRs in Q4 than Q3 due to less of a benefit from regional mix as the Asia region continues to recover, but also due to lower occupancy rates after the peak travel season. 
We expect Q4 revenue to decline more than gross bookings due to a couple of factors. The first is that due to short booking window in Q3, a lower percentage of Q3 bookings and normal will stay in Q4. The second is due to our expectation that the booking window will contract less in Q4 than it did in Q3, resulting in more bookings made in the quarter that are expected to check in, in future quarters. As a result, we expect our revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be more than 1% below Q4 2019. This also means we expect Q4 revenue to have a greater sequential decrease from Q3 that we saw in 2019, and we expect Q4 revenue to decline more than it did in Q3. 
We expect Q4 marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings increased slightly versus 2019 as we expect to invest in capturing demand and increasing awareness during the continued global recovery of travel demand. We expect Q4 sales and other expenses to be lower than they were in Q3 due to lower merchant transaction volumes. However, we expect sales and expense in the fourth quarter to be higher than in Q4 2019 due to higher merchant volumes and mix. 
We expect our more fixed expense carries in Q4 in aggregate to be down in line with Q3 on a dollar basis. We expect Q4 EBITDA to be positive but driven largely by the higher -- driven largely by the higher than normal seasonal decrease in revenue, we expect a much greater seasonal sequential decrease in EBITDA from Q3 to Q4 than normal. 
In conclusion, we are pleased with our recovery in the top line in Q3, which led to strong financial results for the quarter. The financial strength we saw in Q3 was helped by the concentration of stays in the quarter, which will lead to some differences in the comparison of Q4 to Q3 relative to what we've seen in prior years. 
October room night trends improved relative to September driven by some encouraging trends in Asia. However, recently, the rising case counts across Europe increases the uncertainty about how trends will progress in November and December. 
In closing, we're confident in our ability to capture demand as the global recovery continues and to execute against our strategic priorities. 
With that, I'll now take your questions. And Eli, I turn it over to you to open the line for questions."

So I don't think it's a very hard answer really what we need. What we need is obviously more of a recovery against this pandemic because that's clearly what's driving the problem in many industries, ours particularly. For us, we've talked about this a few times. We talked about our business has done well with international. And international generally has been hard hit, albeit we are seeing some better things, but that the long haul is still a problem. 
Yes, we're seeing some numbers coming up in Asia. Great. I love it. The fact that people are getting more vaccinated in Asia, that's great. The fact that vaccines are being distributed more broadly and getting around, that's great. The fact that the pharmaceutical companies are coming out with new ways to combat against this terrible virus with pills now that can help people who have caught it, but end up being hopefully healthier quicker. 
All the things, but what we need really is for everyone who can get a vaccine to please go out and get that vaccine if you're medically able to and you're capable of getting it, please get. That will help hasten the recovery for not only the travel industry, but the entire world. And that's what we hope will happen. Obviously, we're doing everything we can. So we're prepared when that day comes, which it will. We can't say when, but we know it will come. 
And we're preparing by doing all the things that Dave and I have been talking about, preparing with our partners and getting our marketing prepared and doing all the steps that you know we've been doing to make sure that when travel comes back to above 2019, we're getting the share we want to be getting. And David, do you want to add -- or you can answer the second question and add to mine too."

Justin, we've actually been for this before, so I'll be relatively quick on the puts and takes in the core accommodation business. Our underlying take rates have been solid. And obviously, the reported take rates are a function of timing. So that continues to go well for us. As we get to -- back to 2019 levels, there will be some inflationary pressure on the personnel line. Everybody knows there's a war for tech talent out there, and we've had 2 or 3 years worth of merit increases and other expenses and other increases in our cost base. Of course, we did take expenses out, but there are variable expenses. So they will come back with some efficiency over time, but there will be some pressure on the personnel line. 
But there are other things that are in the model that we can use to offset that pressure. We can get extra economies of scale as the business grows beyond 2019 levels on both the fixed costs and on the variable cost side as well. There are opportunities in our direct mix, which, of course, is very important. And of course, a key element of this will draw happens to our overall ROI on the performance marketing side where we saw some increases in the first half of the year, we saw some small compression in the second half of this year, but those markets are very variable and very dynamic, and we're pleased with how we're doing in those markets. 
The last thing I want to leave you with on that topic is that within our core business, there's always a trade-off between growth, market share and profitability. So to the extent we see opportunities, we're leaning in, we want to try and drive market share increases where we think that we can that will pressure the business in the short term as we lean into making that investment and also the investment in marketing and other areas will basically be a leading indicator relative to revenue. 
So there will -- and we do believe that there are opportunity for us to gain share in accommodations through this recovery and beyond. So that would be an additional factor in the mix of how we think about the long-term business margins in accommodations."

So that's positive. It really -- something that we -- I'd say that was more what we did because we expected that to be the outcome. 
Of course, these markets are dynamic and as recovery continues, more and more players will come back into the marketplace, but basically what happened in Q3 was very much in line with what we told you a quarter ago would happen. The mix in between brands and the performance has not materially changed. If you recall back in 2019, we were over 90% or around 90% of our marketing spend was in force marketing. We are looking to move up -- to move the brand spend up a little bit over time. But of course, brand has been very much shut down in 2020, is now coming back on in 2021. 
And we're not in a very different position than where we were in 2019, but we do see the opportunity to continue to trend a little bit more towards brands, some of which might go at the mid-funnel market opportunities that Glenn talked about. And then Glenn, I'll hand over to you to talk about the third one."

The reason why we built out and are continuing to build out our payments platform at Booking.com is making sure that we're able to compete and provide great value to our customers. And what's really important is not doing just out of our own pocket, but working with our partners, coming up with the right time to the right consumer, the right offer and helping them, our supply partners, also provide some of that, let's say, added value. 
So for example, we may do flat sales. You may hopefully you've seen some home, some hope you actually book some of them. That's an example. One of the things, for example, when somebody is getting in a combination, and we're able to offer them either lower cost or even free sometimes is drive from the airport to the hotel. And a real different variations that we can do with the different verticals and coming up with the best combination trying to do as much as we can with our suppliers' money but sometimes using our own, too, to come up what really is an attractive offer, so the consumer knows that when they come to our site, they're getting the best value because value really is one of the key strategic objectives for us always to be providing that."

So we know it's there. Absolutely. 
Now, how much? We don't have a way to quantify it. But we do know if you look at, particularly in the U.S., when you look at what people's savings rates are right now, we have been able to save a lot of money during the pandemic, and they want to spend it. And one of the things people have not been able to do as much they want to is go travel. So I believe there is a significant amount of demand, they're just waiting to come out. But of course, it has to -- we have to have these restrictions for the long haul international travel open up.

Then I'll talk a little bit about IDFA, and I'll let David what he wants to say about our app and I'm not sure I'll let him be as free if he wants to be or not about what we see in terms of profitability, et cetera. So you're absolutely right about the air business, very exciting for us, of course, and we've been working on it. And it's interesting because I happen to have noticed that in the first quarter call, in 2020, just as things started going very bad for the whole world, we are talking about the -- just starting out in the air business at Booking.com in the fourth quarter 2019. 
And I mentioned about we are striving to get to that 50% coverage of Booking.com customers. I was looking forward to hopefully doing that for 2020. And of course, that didn't quite happen exactly what we wanted. But the question, and it wasn't from you, Mark, who was another analyst who asked why not 100%. And I said, well, the 50% was just when I want to get to that year, I think, of course, we want to get to 100%, and that still is the same thing. Yes, we're in 27 countries. Of course, we want to get to every single country that anybody we currently deal with, we want to be able to provide them with an air ticket. 
But it takes time. So it's not something you just flip a switch. You have to actually go through regulations to get licensing and all those sorts of things. So we're rolling it out as we can, as we should, and we will get to 100% at some point. Now I do want to point out that we are at that -- over that 50% number right now. So I am pleased with where we are with that. 
I also want to say, though, it's still so early. We're not doing big marketing yet, real big marketing. There are a lot of opportunities to get a much higher number of people coming to this air product. And the reason that we like is not only the 25% of the new customers, which, of course, is fantastic, but is that attachment rate which I haven't given a number, but I'm pleased with where we are with that right now. And again, that's something we have not optimized yet. There's a lot of opportunity there to optimize that and get an even higher attach rate. 
And that's part of the overall vision of being able to bring new customers in from different verticals, in different ways than we've done in the past, which we primarily pay for performance marketing and be able to bring a lot more customer. And as we talked a little bit earlier in a previous answer about being able to provide them with a lot more value. 
Your first question about IDFA, look, these privacy-related changes, they only impact a small part of our marketing and it's obviously not unique to our company. We know that I'm, very common. We can manage through this. And as we know -- as you know, most of our marketing, primarily -- it's paid marketing channels like PPC and meta and that's not going to be directly impacted by any of these kinds of changes. Our focus is always our first-party data. We want to leverage the data in the marketing and any of these changes to privacy like the IDFA, this does not really impact us. 
And I think you would know, we chose not to show us the app tracking up in back in April -- April '21, this year, April. While the IDFA specifically decided not to do that, and of course, you've seen our results since then, so I really don't think this is a big deal for us. I'm very proud of the team in our whole marketing. They will be able to work and come up with, I would say, privacy-oriented ways to continue to be able to market with good tracking and ROIs. And David, I think you had number 2, which is about the monthly active users for mobile."

There's direct customers using the app, direct customers that come to us on the mobile web, there are customers who come to us on desktop. 
And perhaps not too surprisingly, the direct customers on the app measured by the metrics I just talked about are our most loyal cohort of direct customers. So it's a good thing.

Curious what your view is on how the landscape on both the supply and the demand side might evolve as we move into a post-pandemic world and aim towards summer of 2022? And how you think about making investments on supply to match up the way in which there might be a more normalized travel environment in '22?"

So we saw before the pandemic an increase in the alternative accommodations business as it became a larger and larger share of the total accommodations business and it was going on a pretty steady rate going up. And dynamic happens and you get a step-change as people desire safety, being away from crowd and they go there. 
And now we've seen for ourselves, we've seen people liking hotels in that. I think the long-term trend, though, will continue. And I think if you look 5 years in the future, I think alternative accommodations will be a higher share. So that means, of course, for us is we've talked about this in the past, how important it is that we go out and make sure we get the best supply we can get. And that aims working hard on that and making sure that the people who own these properties see us as a platform that they want to use that's first in their mind that this is a great way to fill up their properties. And that's something that we are working on, absolutely. 
The demand side is similar. Go to Europe, and we've talked about them in the past, and say, ""Where can I get a villa in the south of France, people will say, I think Booking.com is a great place. We went to the U.S., and he said, ""Hey, I need a vacation, a place to ski, they may not think of Booking.com first. We got to get that awareness up and I've talked about that in the past, and that's something we have to do also. 
But one of the truly great things about Booking.com is we offer more of both. Nobody offers, you put together hotels and alternative accommodations. You put that together, we're the ones who have both of those. And I really believe that's a superior way for somebody to decide what they're going to choose in terms of accommodation . And we see this in our data. We see people come, they look first start looking at one type and then they end up booking another type, and they're able to compare and contrast both to see the reviews on both. Look at the prices on both. What are they going to get for one, what are they going to get from the other. And that's why we believe we have a superior offering to the consumer. 
And I do believe, though, that it is something that absolutely is going to continue. But on the other side, you all see the hotels, they're making some moves themselves, and they're coming up with ways to offer a better offering, providing some of the benefits of an alternative accommodation to a consumer, ,particularly so they are prepared as people work in a new way in the future and want to have both the benefits of the hotel but perhaps more room or more services that you can get in terms of making sure you have good WiFi or a place you can do your work at. And that's something I see also, hotels are definitely going to be getting into that space. David, I don't know if you want to say anything more to that?"

And also, just rising ability for you guys to merchandise as you do more of the connected trip, opens up a greater opportunity for you guys to run promos and change prices and hence, flex your gross margins up and down to drive growth on top of what has always been more of a performance marketing driven growth. So is there still a pretty material gap in ROI from doing one versus the other at this point in terms of what you've perceived?"

I'll let David talk about ROIs on our merchandising approach and how we're doing that. You're absolutely right. If somebody doesn't have an ability to pay for something because they don't have the appropriate payment method, then they're not going to be able to buy from that person or that company like us. So we always have to do that. 
So if you are in Southeast Asia, and let's say somebody is using most of say, Grab, who's a partner of ours, and they're saying GrabPay. Well, if we're not able to use GrapPay for the hotel, taking the money in the consumer, that person is not going to use us. They're going to use somebody else. And we have, obviously, GrabPay, a partner working on that. 
Or if you look at other ways, people who say they go and look, it's not their favor, they can use it another way, they still decide not to use us. There's something else we've seen, which is really interesting, is that just having more ways to accept payments seems to increase conversion. Sometimes I don't know why, I can't give you a science. I just see data this is , that's interesting. The other side is making sure we're paying the supplier the way they want to get the money because sometimes they say, I don't want to get it the way you're doing it with a virtual credit card. Or I don't want to get it in terms of the bank transfer. I want to get it some other way. So we've got to be able to do that, and that improves our relationship with the suppliers. And particularly improves with the supplier when the method that we can get the money to them is cheaper than the method they are currently using. 
That's a great thing when we can do that as another value add to that hotel or any other type of supplier. Lots of ways that we're going to do that, and there are all other things we're working -- the fintech part of our business that we're just starting out. We talked last time about setting up that unit. There are a lot of opportunities there. And we talked about how in 2019, we did over $100 billion worth of gross bookings. And our idea is to let's find ways that we can monetize that better, and let's find ways we can flag value to both consumers and suppliers. And David, I don't know if you want to talk a little bit about ROIs and how we're doing the merchandise."

So it's no longer just kind of we think as an add-on, it really is solving problems for both of them in cost-effective ways and risk reduction ways that they couldn't do as efficiently themselves. So that's why it's growing so rapidly, as we say of our mix. 
Now you're right, Stephen, that once we're on payments, we can participate in merchandising. Of course, the most efficient way to get rates is to source great rates, which Glenn talked about a fair amount in his point. But if we need to participate over and above the sourcing and driving  promotional targeting particular use in particular markets, we can with the payments platform. And we now have enough experience under ability instrumentation around that, that we can treat that, as you mentioned, as a marketing investment and look at it in a very similar way to the way that we look at our spend in the performance channels, for example, can compare ROIs one versus the other and decide what the right mix is. 
So correct with payments becoming a bigger piece of our proposition, where we can, when we need to, when we think it makes sense, we can look at merchandising through a strong ROI lens, we can be quite proactive in that area and compare it directly with other forms of spending on marketing."

First of all, remember, a lot of bookings in Q1, Q2 that weren't always stayed in Q1, Q2 stayed in Q3. So we got that benefit compared to normal Q3. On top of that, in the quarter, more bookings in Q3 than normal stayed in Q3. So because booking window was so short so Q3 got topped up 2 ways from Q1, Q2 and in Q3. 
So now when you think of Q4 and you're now comparing it against a very top-up Q3, and some of that top-up in Q3, directly impacts Q4. So Q4 gets impacted by comparing against a strong Q3, but I think some of those Q3 bookings are normally would say Q4 stay in Q3. So you've now got, if you like, a double factor driving the comparison between Q3 and Q4. 
Also, we believe the booking window will start to expand in Q4. So more of the bookings in Q4 will actually leak out of Q4 than did in Q3 relatively. So you've got these 2 factors kind of driving a very unusual comparison between Q3 and Q4. So a fair amount more sequential revenue decline, it's all timing and all mechanics. But think of it as a Q4 comparing Q3 on steroids. And some of the reason why Q3 was on steroids will directly impact Q4. So that's what's going on."

I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden.I am pleased to be reporting strong results today for our peak travel season. Compared with 2019, Q3 room nights were down 18%",2028,"Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' third quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden.
I am pleased to be reporting strong results today for our peak travel season. Compared with 2019, Q3 room nights were down 18%, which was an improvement from the 22% decline we previously reported for the month of July and the 26% decline in Q2. The improvement since July was primarily driven by stronger rent trends in Europe. In the United States, room night growth in Q3 was strong but lower than Q2. These are room night declines in Q3 were about in line with Q2 and remained down significantly versus 2019. 
International travel, which is important to our business, drove the overall sequential improvement in room night trends from Q2 to Q3. Nevertheless, our international room night remains significantly depressed versus 2019. 
Q3 consolidated revenue of $4.7 billion was more than double the amount of revenue in Q2. The third quarter was also our most profitable quarter since Q3 2019, with $2.1 billion of adjusted EBITDA and a 45% adjusted EBITDA margin. 
Moving into the fourth quarter. We have seen a further improvement in our room night trends in October, including early signs of a pickup in room night trends in Asia. However, recently rising COVID case counts in many countries, including several important European countries, adds to the uncertainty around how November and December trends will progress. David will provide additional details on our third quarter results and what we are seeing so far in the fourth quarter in his remarks. 
The improvement in trends we saw in the third quarter and so far in the fourth quarter following the negative -- following a negative impact from the Delta variant in July and August, once again demonstrates the resilience of leisure travelers who are looking to travel when it is safe to do so and restrictions are lifted. We are confident that we are on the path to the eventual strong recovery in travel demand globally. 
As the global recovery continues, we are making progress strengthening our core accommodation business to support its long-term growth. As I said before, the strength of our core business comes from driving benefits to our traveler customers and our supply partners alike. 
For our customers, we are aiming to create a superior booking experience and build stronger relationships, which we believe is accomplished by addressing our customers' critical needs of value, choice and ease of use. We continue to see Booking.com's pre-pandemic customers coming back and booking with us while we're also attracting new customers. Importantly, we see our top customers from before the pandemic returning to us at a meaningfully higher frequency than other customers. 
Providing attractive prices on accommodations is a key component of offering value for our customers. We work closely with our supply partners to increase participation in our targeted rate programs to ensure that compelling prices are available to our customers. Our Genius loyalty program at Booking.com is a great example of a program where hundreds of thousands of our property partners are participating to offer lower rates and other benefits such as complementary practice, room upgrades and discounted airport taxis to our large customer base. 
In addition to offering lower rates on accommodations, we have recently extended lower rates on rental cars to our Genius customers. This is just one example of the way we continue to innovate and add value for our Genius members. 
With about 2/3 of our room nights booked on mobile devices and the majority of those booked through the app, it's critical that we provide our customers with a positive booking experience on our app. The app is an important platform as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers. And ultimately, we see it as the center of our connected trip experience. 
In the third quarter, Booking.com was once again the #1 downloaded OTA app globally according to a third-party research firm. Also in the third quarter, we surpassed 100 million monthly active app users for the first time. The recent growth of Booking.com's app is encouraging, and we are working hard to continue to build on this success. 
In the third quarter, we saw a higher mix of our customers booking directly with us than in the third quarter of 2019. Our direct mix improved even as we leaned into performance marketing channels during our peak travel season. While we will continue to invest in performance marketing, we will also look to expand the diversity of our marketing and customer acquisition channels as we aim to drive incremental traffic to our platform and increase consumer awareness of our brands. 
For example, with our ambition to acquire more customers in the medium intent space, we've made progress in strengthening our foundations for digital marketing, including in social channels, though our spend so far has been small. However, we're increasingly confident in the potential for these channels. And as we see positive results, we expect to raise our level of participation there. 
Remaining active and investing effectively across marketing channels is made even more important by the opportunity to acquire bookers who are new to online booking channels. Travel, like many industries during pandemic, has seen a meaningful shift from offline to online according to third-party data, and this has increased our addressable market. 
For our supply partners, we are focused on bringing incremental demand to their properties from the broad audience of the tender customers on our platform. In a survey of 600 small and medium hoteliers in Europe conducted earlier this year, 85% of response agreed that online platforms are a cost-efficient way to increase the reach of their hotel and source more diverse guests. 
We agree with this statement and believe it applies more broadly. Whether we are working with a small and medium hotel in Europe for an alternative accommodation or a large global hotel chain, we strive to be a valuable partner to all accommodation types on our platform. 
With our chain hotel partners, we are continuing to see increased engagement relative to 2019 levels, which shows up in higher levels of participation in our programs that enable them to differentiate and promote themselves on our platform. 
For our alternative accommodations, the global mix of room nights in Q3 of about 30% was up slightly from Q3 2019. This increase in alternative combination share of our business in the quarter was less than it was in Q2 as we saw a greater sequential improvement in demand for hotel room nights in Europe from Q2 to Q3. Our property count of about 2.4 million and reported listings of over 28 million on Booking.com remained stable relative to the prior quarter. 
Let me talk more about some of our key strategic priorities, payments and the connected trip, both of which we believe will further enhance the strength of our core accommodations business and support its continued growth. 
Turning to payments at Booking.com. Last quarter, we spoke about the organization of all of our payments initiatives and efforts within a new Fintech unit at Booking.com. The recently established Fintech unit enables Booking.com to have a dedicated focus on enhancing payments in our core business for both customers and partners as well as monetizing our overall transaction flows via new payments-related products and services. 
Adoption of our payment solutions by our supply partners in both the U.S. and Europe continues to grow. Adoption in the U.S. has seen significant increases recently, driven by the additions of some major hotel chains in the second and third quarters, which we will look to build on in the fourth quarter. 
In Europe, more customers are choosing to pay using Booking.com's payment platform when finalizing their booking as attractive and localized options are provided. This is a result in nearly 1/3 of Booking.com's total gross bookings in Q3 being processed through our payment platform, which is up from about 22% for the full year 2020. 
The Fintech unit is also driving continued payments innovation to ensure that growth is sustained into the future. This includes offering low-cost payout choices to our suppliers as well as partnering with third parties to provide payment solutions to our bookers, such as Buy Now, Pay Later. We believe these efforts help position Booking.com as an attractive and trusted payment intermediary for all parties on our platform. 
On our connected trip vision, we have been focused this year on enabling travelers to book the major elements of their trip in one place on Booking.com. We continue to work on scaling up a robust flight platform on Booking.com, which will give us the ability to engage with flight bookers early in their travel journey and allow us an opportunity to cross-sell our accommodation and other services to these bookers. Booking.com's product is now live in 27 countries. 
Total company air tickets in the third quarter was up 131% versus Q3 2019, primarily driven by strength at Priceline, but also helped by Booking.com's life offering, which continues to meaningfully exceed our expectations. While it remains early days for Booking's flight product, we are seeing that over 25% of Booking's flight bookers are entirely new customers. With these new customers, we are seeing an encouraging attach rate of accommodation bookings. 
However, there is more work to be done to further optimize the cross-sell opportunity. The early signals help demonstrate though that a flight offering can drive incremental new customers to the platform to which we can cross-sell our accommodation product. 
We are beginning to test initiatives targeting these new flight customers, including, for example, encouraging account creation to activate Genius status and in some cases, offering additional incentives for them to book accommodations. We remain focused on continuing to test and innovate in order to build on the early successes we are seeing with flights at Booking.com. We're also continuing to run tests using offerings from our verticals like Rentalcars and taxis. 
Now before closing, I do want to note that as world leaders assembled this week in Glasgow for the COP26 Summit, discussing the urgency of tackling the global climate crisis, I cannot overstate the importance for our industry to come together to work for the goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. Decarbonization is a major challenge for the entire industry and solving this challenge requires the commitment of all stakeholders. 
I am proud to say that our company, Booking Holdings, is committed to addressing this challenge. We recently released a report that recommissioned with EY partner that looks into what will it take to get the accommodations industry specifically to a carbon-neutral future. While a big task, data shows it is achievable. At Booking.com, we are working on making it easier for travelers to find and choose sustainable combination options with booking their travel. 
In addition, we're working with our accommodation of supply partners by sharing guidance, insights and best practices to enhance sustainability initiatives at the property level. Of course, there is much more that must be done. But we believe that we are taking important steps to contribute to a more sustainable future for our industry. And finally, we plan on publishing a Booking Holdings Climate Transition Plan in early 2022, which we'll speak more about at that time. 
In conclusion, we executed well and produced strong results in our peak travel season, which is a credit to the hard work and support provided by the many teams across our company. I'm encouraged by the signs of recovery we are seeing in many parts of the world, and I'm confident that we are on the path to an eventual strong recovery in travel demand globally. 
We continue with our important work to strengthen our company's position and execute against our strategic priorities. As I've said before, we were thinking about our business beyond just getting back to 2019 levels of demand and we are focused on building a larger and faster-growing business that generates more earnings after the full recovery and for the long run. 
I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden. David? David, is dialing back in, I think."

All growth rates are relative to compare period in 2019, unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. 
Now on to our results for the third quarter. On our last earnings call, we discussed the improvement in trends that we saw throughout the second quarter driven by the U.S. and Europe, followed by a mass pullback in July. After our earnings call, we saw our overall trends improve in August and continue to get better in September, which resulted in Q3 reported room nights declining 18% versus Q3 2019, which was ahead of the 26% decline in Q2 and the 22% decline in July. September was the strongest month in the third quarter, with room nights declining 14%, about the same level as June. 
The improvements in the Q3 room night decline versus Q2 was driven primarily by Europe, which benefited from strong cross-border travel within the region. In Q3, room nights in Europe were down mid-single digits versus 2019, with room nights trends improving in August versus July. September was similar to August. You will recall the room night growth pulled back from June to July in Europe due to concerns over the Delta variants. 
Rest of World also improved from Q2 to Q3. In the U.S., we -- Q2 to Q3. However, the U.S. still had strong growth in the quarter and remained our strongest performing major country in Q3. Within the U.S., we saw a meaningful slowdown in August from the very strong growth we experienced in July, followed by a recovery to strong growth in September. The slowdown in the U.S. in August was due to concerns about the Delta variants. Asian room night declines in Q3 were about in line with Q2. Room nights in Asia was still down significantly from 2019 levels. 
Mobile bookings, primarily through our apps, represent about 2/3 of our total room nights. Our apps continue to represent an increasing percentage of our mobile bookings. In Q3, as Glenn mentioned, we achieved an important milestone in the use of our Appetbooking.com, surpassing 100 million monthly active users. 
We're also pleased to see the number of unique customers booking via our app in the quarter grew strongly compared with Q3 2019. Our direct channel as a percentage of our room nights year-on-year and relative to Q3 2019 increased. 
While international room nights remain downwards in 2019, we saw another sequential improvement in our international trends, with the international mix of our room nights increasing to about 33% in Q3 from about 25% in Q2 and about 15% in Q1. Most of this improvement in international room nights came from bookings for travel within Europe. We continue to see double-digit growth in domestic room nights in Q3, but at a slightly lower level than in Q2. 
The pickup in international travel in the quarter was a driver of the improvements in overall room night trends from Q2 to Q3. However, international room nights were down almost 50% compared with Q3 2019 levels. 
Our Q3 cancellation rate was slightly above Q3 2019 levels. However, cancellation rates improved in the quarter, and September was slightly better than 2019 for the month. Percentage of our -- of our Q3 2021 bookings made with flexible cancellation policies remained significantly higher than in Q3 2019. 
The booking window of Booking.com remain shorter than it was in the third quarter of 2019 and contracted more than it did in Q2 as we saw a high mix of near-term bookings during our peak summer season. All regions had a shorter booking window in Q3 than in Q3 2019. 
For our alternative accommodations, the global mix of room nights in Q3 of about 30% was up slightly from Q3 2019. The increase in mixed alternative accommodations in the quarter was less than it was in Q2 as we saw a great -- a greater sequential improvement in demand for hotel room nights in Europe from Q2 to Q3. Our alternative accommodation room nights in Europe grew slightly in August and September versus 2019, and for the quarter, were about in line with Q3 2019. We believe we benefited from the strength of our portfolio in Europe, where we can respond to solid demand for alternative accommodations and an improving demand for hotels. 
Gross bookings declined 6% in Q3, which is less than the decline in room nights due to the increase in average day rates for accommodations of about 10% versus 2019 on a constant currency basis and also due to a couple of points of benefit from changes in FX rates and strong performance in our flight business. 
Our combination of constant currency ADR benefited by just over 5 percentage points for an increased mix of business in North America, which is a high ADR region and a decrease of mix in Asia, which is a low ADR region. Excluding regional mix effects, constant currency ADRs were up just over 4%, driven mainly by rate increases in Europe and North America across many destination types with notable strength in beach-oriented leisure destinations. 
[indiscernible] booked in the third quarter were up 131% versus 2019, driven by very strong growth of Priceline and by flight bookings at Booking.com. We're encouraged to see another quarter of triple-digit growth from our flights business, which is a key component of our multiproduct connected trip strategy. 
Consolidated revenue for the third quarter was $4.7 billion, which was 7% below Q3 2019 and was more than double the amount of revenue in Q2 2021, a far greater sequential improvement than in 2019. Our Q3 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was about in line with Q3 2019, which was in line with our expectations. We experienced even more revenue seasonality in Q3 2021 than normal due to the concentration of stays in Q3 from bookings made in the quarter and also from bookings [indiscernible] when customers could book at combinations, but could not stay due to restrictions and other COVID-related concerns. 
The strong top line performance resulted in adjusted EBITDA of $2.1 billion in the third quarter, which was 15% below Q3 2019. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense item, decreased 3% versus Q3 2019. Marketing expense declined by a few points less than gross bookings due to slightly lower ROIs in paid channels as we invested into capturing demand during the peak travel season. 
Sales to our expenses in Q3 were significantly higher than they were in Q2 on a dollar basis due to higher volume of merchant gross bookings, which increased as a percentage of total gross bookings in the third quarter. At Booking.com, the amount of gross bookings processed through our payment platform in Q3 was over $6 billion, which was almost 1/3 of Booking.com's business, up from about 1/4 in Q2. 
Our more fixed expense categories in Q3 in aggregate came in 3% lower than Q2, as the $136 million of personnel expense in the second quarter related to our decision to repay the government aid was mostly offset by an increase from Q2 to Q3 in our bonus accruals and digital service tax expense, both of which are accrued proportional to revenue. 
Our non-GAAP EPS was $37.70, down 17% versus Q3 2019. Non-GAAP net income of $1.6 billion reflects a non-GAAP tax rate of 21%, which is higher than the 19% in Q3 2019 due to a higher proportion of non-tax expenses in relation to lower pretax income versus 2019. 
On a GAAP basis, we had operating income of $2 billion in Q3. We recorded GAAP net income of $769 million in the quarter, which includes a $1 billion pretax unrealized loss on our equity investments, primarily related to our investment in Meituan as well as income tax expense of $199 million. 
Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q3 ending cash investment balance of $15.4 billion was down versus our Q2 ending balance of $16.1 billion as the $1.5 billion of free cash flow was more than offset by the repayment of a $1 billion convertible note maturing in Q3 and the $1 billion unrealized loss on our equity investments. 
The return of capital to shareholders has and will be an important component of our value creation strategy. Throughout the COVID pandemic, we said that we restart returning capital to shareholders when we saw that our 3 largest regions were no longer a meaningful risk of a major reversal due to COVID and has also become more predictable. 
Assuming that travel recovery continues, we plan to restart returning capital in early 2022 under our remaining authorization. Assuming continued recovery, we'd expect to complete this organization within 3 years from restarting. 
Now on to our thoughts for the fourth quarter. October room nights declined 10% versus 2019, which is better than the 14% decline in September. The improvement in October was driven mainly by Asia, although the region remains down considerably versus 2019. The improvement in Asia was led by domestic travel within many countries and was driven by improving vaccination progress and governments easing restrictions on travel. 
Room night growth in the U.S. improved a little from September to October and remained strong in October. Rest of World also improved a little in October and was back close to 2019 levels. Room night declines in Europe were about the same in October as they were in September, but weakened towards the end of the month. This resulted in overall room night declines being higher in the last week of October than the average for the month. The slowdown at the end of October in Europe was driven by a number of countries that have seen recent increases in COVID infections, including Germany, Russia and Italy. 
Given the ongoing uncertainty around COVID, it's difficult to predict how room nights in November, December will compare with the 10% reduction you saw in October. Looking forward to November and December, the rising case counts across many important Western European countries and across much of Eastern Europe as well at the start of the winter season in the Northern Hemisphere, which in 2020 contributed to an increase in COVID cases, creates unpredictability. Also pre pandemic, the contribution of Asia to total room nights were highest in November and December, and Asia is still our least recovered region. 
On a more positive note, since the U.S. announced in late September plans to ease travel restrictions in November for international travels to have vaccinated, we've seen a significant improvement in room nights booked by Europeans that travel to the U.S. as well as the reverse. Also, we're pleased to see more gross bookings on the books for the Christmas, New Year period than we saw at this time in 2019 in the U.S. and Western Europe. 
Turning to the income statement. We expect Q4 gross bookings to decline by a few points less than room nights, driven by higher reported ADRs and flight bookings versus 2019. We expect less of an increase in our ADRs in Q4 than Q3 due to less of a benefit from regional mix as the Asia region continues to recover, but also due to lower occupancy rates after the peak travel season. 
We expect Q4 revenue to decline more than gross bookings due to a couple of factors. The first is that due to short booking window in Q3, a lower percentage of Q3 bookings and normal will stay in Q4. The second is due to our expectation that the booking window will contract less in Q4 than it did in Q3, resulting in more bookings made in the quarter that are expected to check in, in future quarters. As a result, we expect our revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be more than 1% below Q4 2019. This also means we expect Q4 revenue to have a greater sequential decrease from Q3 that we saw in 2019, and we expect Q4 revenue to decline more than it did in Q3. 
We expect Q4 marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings increased slightly versus 2019 as we expect to invest in capturing demand and increasing awareness during the continued global recovery of travel demand. We expect Q4 sales and other expenses to be lower than they were in Q3 due to lower merchant transaction volumes. However, we expect sales and expense in the fourth quarter to be higher than in Q4 2019 due to higher merchant volumes and mix. 
We expect our more fixed expense carries in Q4 in aggregate to be down in line with Q3 on a dollar basis. We expect Q4 EBITDA to be positive but driven largely by the higher -- driven largely by the higher than normal seasonal decrease in revenue, we expect a much greater seasonal sequential decrease in EBITDA from Q3 to Q4 than normal. 
In conclusion, we are pleased with our recovery in the top line in Q3, which led to strong financial results for the quarter. The financial strength we saw in Q3 was helped by the concentration of stays in the quarter, which will lead to some differences in the comparison of Q4 to Q3 relative to what we've seen in prior years. 
October room night trends improved relative to September driven by some encouraging trends in Asia. However, recently, the rising case counts across Europe increases the uncertainty about how trends will progress in November and December. 
In closing, we're confident in our ability to capture demand as the global recovery continues and to execute against our strategic priorities. 
With that, I'll now take your questions. And Eli, I turn it over to you to open the line for questions."

So I don't think it's a very hard answer really what we need. What we need is obviously more of a recovery against this pandemic because that's clearly what's driving the problem in many industries, ours particularly. For us, we've talked about this a few times. We talked about our business has done well with international. And international generally has been hard hit, albeit we are seeing some better things, but that the long haul is still a problem. 
Yes, we're seeing some numbers coming up in Asia. Great. I love it. The fact that people are getting more vaccinated in Asia, that's great. The fact that vaccines are being distributed more broadly and getting around, that's great. The fact that the pharmaceutical companies are coming out with new ways to combat against this terrible virus with pills now that can help people who have caught it, but end up being hopefully healthier quicker. 
All the things, but what we need really is for everyone who can get a vaccine to please go out and get that vaccine if you're medically able to and you're capable of getting it, please get. That will help hasten the recovery for not only the travel industry, but the entire world. And that's what we hope will happen. Obviously, we're doing everything we can. So we're prepared when that day comes, which it will. We can't say when, but we know it will come. 
And we're preparing by doing all the things that Dave and I have been talking about, preparing with our partners and getting our marketing prepared and doing all the steps that you know we've been doing to make sure that when travel comes back to above 2019, we're getting the share we want to be getting. And David, do you want to add -- or you can answer the second question and add to mine too."

Justin, we've actually been for this before, so I'll be relatively quick on the puts and takes in the core accommodation business. Our underlying take rates have been solid. And obviously, the reported take rates are a function of timing. So that continues to go well for us. As we get to -- back to 2019 levels, there will be some inflationary pressure on the personnel line. Everybody knows there's a war for tech talent out there, and we've had 2 or 3 years worth of merit increases and other expenses and other increases in our cost base. Of course, we did take expenses out, but there are variable expenses. So they will come back with some efficiency over time, but there will be some pressure on the personnel line. 
But there are other things that are in the model that we can use to offset that pressure. We can get extra economies of scale as the business grows beyond 2019 levels on both the fixed costs and on the variable cost side as well. There are opportunities in our direct mix, which, of course, is very important. And of course, a key element of this will draw happens to our overall ROI on the performance marketing side where we saw some increases in the first half of the year, we saw some small compression in the second half of this year, but those markets are very variable and very dynamic, and we're pleased with how we're doing in those markets. 
The last thing I want to leave you with on that topic is that within our core business, there's always a trade-off between growth, market share and profitability. So to the extent we see opportunities, we're leaning in, we want to try and drive market share increases where we think that we can that will pressure the business in the short term as we lean into making that investment and also the investment in marketing and other areas will basically be a leading indicator relative to revenue. 
So there will -- and we do believe that there are opportunity for us to gain share in accommodations through this recovery and beyond. So that would be an additional factor in the mix of how we think about the long-term business margins in accommodations."

And actually, the ROIs came out very much where we expected them to. Actually, our direct mix was slightly better than we expected in Q3, and that's why there was less of a compression in the difference between gross bookings and marketing than we actually expected in Q3. So that's positive. It really -- something that we -- I'd say that was more what we did because we expected that to be the outcome. 
Of course, these markets are dynamic and as recovery continues, more and more players will come back into the marketplace, but basically what happened in Q3 was very much in line with what we told you a quarter ago would happen. The mix in between brands and the performance has not materially changed. If you recall back in 2019, we were over 90% or around 90% of our marketing spend was in force marketing. We are looking to move up -- to move the brand spend up a little bit over time. But of course, brand has been very much shut down in 2020, is now coming back on in 2021. 
And we're not in a very different position than where we were in 2019, but we do see the opportunity to continue to trend a little bit more towards brands, some of which might go at the mid-funnel market opportunities that Glenn talked about. And then Glenn, I'll hand over to you to talk about the third one."

So for example, we may do flat sales. You may hopefully you've seen some home, some hope you actually book some of them. That's an example. One of the things, for example, when somebody is getting in a combination, and we're able to offer them either lower cost or even free sometimes is drive from the airport to the hotel. And a real different variations that we can do with the different verticals and coming up with the best combination trying to do as much as we can with our suppliers' money but sometimes using our own, too, to come up what really is an attractive offer, so the consumer knows that when they come to our site, they're getting the best value because value really is one of the key strategic objectives for us always to be providing that."

So we know it's there. Absolutely. 
Now, how much? We don't have a way to quantify it. But we do know if you look at, particularly in the U.S., when you look at what people's savings rates are right now, we have been able to save a lot of money during the pandemic, and they want to spend it. And one of the things people have not been able to do as much they want to is go travel. So I believe there is a significant amount of demand, they're just waiting to come out. But of course, it has to -- we have to have these restrictions for the long haul international travel open up.

Then I'll talk a little bit about IDFA, and I'll let David what he wants to say about our app and I'm not sure I'll let him be as free if he wants to be or not about what we see in terms of profitability, et cetera. So you're absolutely right about the air business, very exciting for us, of course, and we've been working on it. And it's interesting because I happen to have noticed that in the first quarter call, in 2020, just as things started going very bad for the whole world, we are talking about the -- just starting out in the air business at Booking.com in the fourth quarter 2019. 
And I mentioned about we are striving to get to that 50% coverage of Booking.com customers. I was looking forward to hopefully doing that for 2020. And of course, that didn't quite happen exactly what we wanted. But the question, and it wasn't from you, Mark, who was another analyst who asked why not 100%. And I said, well, the 50% was just when I want to get to that year, I think, of course, we want to get to 100%, and that still is the same thing. Yes, we're in 27 countries. Of course, we want to get to every single country that anybody we currently deal with, we want to be able to provide them with an air ticket. 
But it takes time. So it's not something you just flip a switch. You have to actually go through regulations to get licensing and all those sorts of things. So we're rolling it out as we can, as we should, and we will get to 100% at some point. Now I do want to point out that we are at that -- over that 50% number right now. So I am pleased with where we are with that. 
I also want to say, though, it's still so early. We're not doing big marketing yet, real big marketing. There are a lot of opportunities to get a much higher number of people coming to this air product. And the reason that we like is not only the 25% of the new customers, which, of course, is fantastic, but is that attachment rate which I haven't given a number, but I'm pleased with where we are with that right now. And again, that's something we have not optimized yet. There's a lot of opportunity there to optimize that and get an even higher attach rate. 
And that's part of the overall vision of being able to bring new customers in from different verticals, in different ways than we've done in the past, which we primarily pay for performance marketing and be able to bring a lot more customer. And as we talked a little bit earlier in a previous answer about being able to provide them with a lot more value. 
Your first question about IDFA, look, these privacy-related changes, they only impact a small part of our marketing and it's obviously not unique to our company. We know that I'm, very common. We can manage through this. And as we know -- as you know, most of our marketing, primarily -- it's paid marketing channels like PPC and meta and that's not going to be directly impacted by any of these kinds of changes. Our focus is always our first-party data. We want to leverage the data in the marketing and any of these changes to privacy like the IDFA, this does not really impact us. 
And I think you would know, we chose not to show us the app tracking up in back in April -- April '21, this year, April. While the IDFA specifically decided not to do that, and of course, you've seen our results since then, so I really don't think this is a big deal for us. I'm very proud of the team in our whole marketing. They will be able to work and come up with, I would say, privacy-oriented ways to continue to be able to market with good tracking and ROIs. And David, I think you had number 2, which is about the monthly active users for mobile."

There's direct customers using the app, direct customers that come to us on the mobile web, there are customers who come to us on desktop. 
And perhaps not too surprisingly, the direct customers on the app measured by the metrics I just talked about are our most loyal cohort of direct customers. So it's a good thing.

So we saw before the pandemic an increase in the alternative accommodations business as it became a larger and larger share of the total accommodations business and it was going on a pretty steady rate going up. And dynamic happens and you get a step-change as people desire safety, being away from crowd and they go there. 
And now we've seen for ourselves, we've seen people liking hotels in that. I think the long-term trend, though, will continue. And I think if you look 5 years in the future, I think alternative accommodations will be a higher share. So that means, of course, for us is we've talked about this in the past, how important it is that we go out and make sure we get the best supply we can get. And that aims working hard on that and making sure that the people who own these properties see us as a platform that they want to use that's first in their mind that this is a great way to fill up their properties. And that's something that we are working on, absolutely. 
The demand side is similar. Go to Europe, and we've talked about them in the past, and say, ""Where can I get a villa in the south of France, people will say, I think Booking.com is a great place. We went to the U.S., and he said, ""Hey, I need a vacation, a place to ski, they may not think of Booking.com first. We got to get that awareness up and I've talked about that in the past, and that's something we have to do also. 
But one of the truly great things about Booking.com is we offer more of both. Nobody offers, you put together hotels and alternative accommodations. You put that together, we're the ones who have both of those. And I really believe that's a superior way for somebody to decide what they're going to choose in terms of accommodation . And we see this in our data. We see people come, they look first start looking at one type and then they end up booking another type, and they're able to compare and contrast both to see the reviews on both. Look at the prices on both. What are they going to get for one, what are they going to get from the other. And that's why we believe we have a superior offering to the consumer. 
And I do believe, though, that it is something that absolutely is going to continue. But on the other side, you all see the hotels, they're making some moves themselves, and they're coming up with ways to offer a better offering, providing some of the benefits of an alternative accommodation to a consumer, ,particularly so they are prepared as people work in a new way in the future and want to have both the benefits of the hotel but perhaps more room or more services that you can get in terms of making sure you have good WiFi or a place you can do your work at. And that's something I see also, hotels are definitely going to be getting into that space. David, I don't know if you want to say anything more to that?"

So we always have to do that. 
So if you are in Southeast Asia, and let's say somebody is using most of say, Grab, who's a partner of ours, and they're saying GrabPay. Well, if we're not able to use GrapPay for the hotel, taking the money in the consumer, that person is not going to use us. They're going to use somebody else. And we have, obviously, GrabPay, a partner working on that. 
Or if you look at other ways, people who say they go and look, it's not their favor, they can use it another way, they still decide not to use us. There's something else we've seen, which is really interesting, is that just having more ways to accept payments seems to increase conversion. Sometimes I don't know why, I can't give you a science. I just see data this is , that's interesting. The other side is making sure we're paying the supplier the way they want to get the money because sometimes they say, I don't want to get it the way you're doing it with a virtual credit card. Or I don't want to get it in terms of the bank transfer. I want to get it some other way. So we've got to be able to do that, and that improves our relationship with the suppliers. And particularly improves with the supplier when the method that we can get the money to them is cheaper than the method they are currently using. 
That's a great thing when we can do that as another value add to that hotel or any other type of supplier. Lots of ways that we're going to do that, and there are all other things we're working -- the fintech part of our business that we're just starting out. We talked last time about setting up that unit. There are a lot of opportunities there. And we talked about how in 2019, we did over $100 billion worth of gross bookings. And our idea is to let's find ways that we can monetize that better, and let's find ways we can flag value to both consumers and suppliers. And David, I don't know if you want to talk a little bit about ROIs and how we're doing the merchandise."

So as Glenn said, payments is increasingly becoming part of the core value proposition that we offer at Booking.com, in particular, to both customers and partners. So it's no longer just kind of we think as an add-on, it really is solving problems for both of them in cost-effective ways and risk reduction ways that they couldn't do as efficiently themselves. So that's why it's growing so rapidly, as we say of our mix. 
Now you're right, Stephen, that once we're on payments, we can participate in merchandising. Of course, the most efficient way to get rates is to source great rates, which Glenn talked about a fair amount in his point. But if we need to participate over and above the sourcing and driving  promotional targeting particular use in particular markets, we can with the payments platform. And we now have enough experience under ability instrumentation around that, that we can treat that, as you mentioned, as a marketing investment and look at it in a very similar way to the way that we look at our spend in the performance channels, for example, can compare ROIs one versus the other and decide what the right mix is. 
So correct with payments becoming a bigger piece of our proposition, where we can, when we need to, when we think it makes sense, we can look at merchandising through a strong ROI lens, we can be quite proactive in that area and compare it directly with other forms of spending on marketing."

And I don't want to give too much in terms of the sales, how we're doing what we're doing, but I'm feeling good about how we're building it up.

I feel good about where we are now. There's a great thing about our business, our company, the way we think is we're not dogmatic.

So Q3 was very strong. it was almost artificially strong from a revenue point of view because you've got 2 things unnaturally helping it. First of all, remember, a lot of bookings in Q1, Q2 that weren't always stayed in Q1, Q2 stayed in Q3. So we got that benefit compared to normal Q3. On top of that, in the quarter, more bookings in Q3 than normal stayed in Q3. So because booking window was so short so Q3 got topped up 2 ways from Q1, Q2 and in Q3. 
So now when you think of Q4 and you're now comparing it against a very top-up Q3, and some of that top-up in Q3, directly impacts Q4. So Q4 gets impacted by comparing against a strong Q3, but I think some of those Q3 bookings are normally would say Q4 stay in Q3. So you've now got, if you like, a double factor driving the comparison between Q3 and Q4. 
Also, we believe the booking window will start to expand in Q4. So more of the bookings in Q4 will actually leak out of Q4 than did in Q3 relatively. So you've got these 2 factors kind of driving a very unusual comparison between Q3 and Q4. So a fair amount more sequential revenue decline, it's all timing and all mechanics. But think of it as a Q4 comparing Q3 on steroids. And some of the reason why Q3 was on steroids will directly impact Q4. So that's what's going on."

I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I am pleased to be reporting strong results today for our peak travel season. Compared with 2019, Q3 room nights were down 18",2028,"Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' third quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. 
I am pleased to be reporting strong results today for our peak travel season. Compared with 2019, Q3 room nights were down 18%, which was an improvement from the 22% decline we previously reported for the month of July and the 26% decline in Q2. The improvement since July was primarily driven by stronger room night trends in Europe. In the United States, room night growth in Q3 was strong but lower than Q2. These room night declines in Q3 were about in line with Q2 and remained down significantly versus 2019.  
International travel, which is important to our business, drove the overall sequential improvement in room night trends from Q2 to Q3. Nevertheless, our international room night remains significantly depressed versus 2019.  
Q3 consolidated revenue of $4.7 billion was more than double the amount of revenue in Q2. The third quarter was also our most profitable quarter since Q3 2019, with $2.1 billion of adjusted EBITDA and a 45% adjusted EBITDA margin.  
Moving into the fourth quarter. We have seen a further improvement in our room night trends in October, including early signs of a pickup in room night trends in Asia. However, recently rising COVID case counts in many countries, including several important European countries, adds to the uncertainty around how November and December trends will progress. David will provide additional details on our third quarter results and what we are seeing so far in the fourth quarter in his remarks.  
The improvement in trends we saw in the third quarter and so far in the fourth quarter following the negative -- following a negative impact from the Delta variant in July and August once again demonstrates the resilience of leisure travelers who are looking to travel when it is safe to do so and restrictions are lifted. We are confident that we are on the path to the eventual strong recovery in travel demand globally.  
As the global recovery continues, we are making progress strengthening our core accommodation business to support its long-term growth. As I said before, the strength of our core business comes from driving benefits to our traveler customers and our supply partners alike.  
For our customers, we are aiming to create a superior booking experience and build stronger relationships, which we believe is accomplished by addressing our customers' critical needs of value, choice and ease of use. We continue to see Booking.com's pre-pandemic customers coming back and booking with us while we're also attracting new customers. Importantly, we see our top customers from before the pandemic returning to us at a meaningfully higher frequency than other customers.  
Providing attractive prices on accommodations is a key component of offering value for our customers. We work closely with our supply partners to increase participation in our targeted rate programs to ensure that compelling prices are available to our customers. Our Genius loyalty program at Booking.com is a great example of a program where hundreds of thousands of our property partners are participating to offer lower rates and other benefits such as complementary practice, room upgrades and discounted airport taxis to our large customer base.  
In addition to offering lower rates on accommodations, we have recently extended lower rates on rental cars to our Genius customers. This is just one example of the way we continue to innovate and add value for our Genius members.  
With about 2/3 of our room nights booked on mobile devices and the majority of those booked through the app, it's critical that we provide our customers with a positive bookings experience on our app. The app is an important platform as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers. And ultimately, we see it as the center of our connected trip experience.  
In the third quarter, Booking.com was once again the #1 downloaded OTA app globally according to a third-party research firm. Also in the third quarter, we surpassed 100 million monthly active app users for the first time. The recent growth of Booking.com's app is encouraging, and we are working hard to continue to build on this success.  
In the third quarter, we saw a higher mix of our customers booking directly with us than in the third quarter of 2019. Our direct mix improved even as we leaned into performance marketing channels during our peak travel season. While we will continue to invest in performance marketing, we will also look to expand the diversity of our marketing and customer acquisition channels as we aim to drive incremental traffic to our platform and increase consumer awareness of our brands.  
For example, with our ambition to acquire more customers in the medium intent space, we've made progress in strengthening our foundations for digital marketing, including in social channels, though our spend so far has been small. However, we're increasingly confident in the potential for these channels. And as we see positive results, we expect to raise our level of participation there.  
Remaining active and investing effectively across marketing channels is made even more important by the opportunity to acquire bookers who are new to online booking channels. Travel, like many industries during pandemic, has seen a meaningful shift from offline to online according to third-party data, and this has increased our addressable market.  
For our supply partners, we are focused on bringing incremental demand to their properties from the broad audience of potentianl customers on our platform. In a survey of 600 small and medium hoteliers in Europe conducted earlier this year, 85% of response agreed that online platforms are a cost-efficient way to increase the reach of their hotel and source more diverse guests.  
We agree with this statement and believe it applies more broadly. Whether we are working with a small and medium hotel in Europe for an alternative accommodation or a large global hotel chain, we strive to be a valuable partner to all accommodation types on our platform.  
With our chain hotel partners, we are continuing to see increased engagement relative to 2019 levels, which shows up in higher levels of participation in our programs that enable them to differentiate and promote themselves on our platform.  
For our alternative accommodations, the global mix of room nights in Q3 of about 30% was up slightly from Q3 2019. This increase in alternative combination share of our business in the quarter was less than it was in Q2 as we saw a greater sequential improvement in demand for hotel room nights in Europe from Q2 to Q3. Our property count of about 2.4 million and reported listings of over 28 million on Booking.com remained stable relative to the prior quarter.  
Let me talk more about some of our key strategic priorities, payments and the connected trip, both of which we believe will further enhance the strength of our core accommodations business and support its continued growth.  
Turning to payments at Booking.com. Last quarter, we spoke about the organization of all of our payments initiatives and efforts within a new fintech unit at Booking.com. The recently established fintech unit enables Booking.com to have a dedicated focus on enhancing payments in our core business for both customers and partners as well as monetizing our overall transaction flows via new payments-related products and services.  
Adoption of our payment solutions by our supply partners in both the U.S. and Europe continues to grow. Adoption in the U.S. has seen significant increases recently, driven by the additions of some major hotel chains in the second and third quarters, which we will look to build on in the fourth quarter.  
In Europe, more customers are choosing to pay using Booking.com's payment platform when finalizing their booking as attractive and localized options are provided. This is a result in nearly 1/3 of Booking.com's total gross bookings in Q3 being processed through our payment platform, which is up from about 22% for the full year 2020.  
The fintech unit is also driving continued payments innovation to ensure that growth is sustained into the future. This includes offering low-cost payout choices to our suppliers as well as partnering with third parties to provide payment solutions to our bookers, such as Buy Now, Pay Later. We believe these efforts help position Booking.com as an attractive and trusted payment intermediary for all parties on our platform.  
On our connected trip vision, we have been focused this year on enabling travelers to book the major elements of their trip in one place on Booking.com. We continue to work on scaling up a robust flight platform on Booking.com, which will give us the ability to engage with flight bookers early in their travel journey and allow us an opportunity to cross-sell our accommodation and other services to these bookers. Booking.com's product is now live in 27 countries.  
Total company air tickets in the third quarter was up 131% versus Q3 2019, primarily driven by strength at Priceline, but also helped by Booking.com's life offering, which continues to meaningfully exceed our expectations. While it remains early days for Booking's flight product, we are seeing that over 25% of Booking's flight bookers are entirely new customers. With these new customers, we are seeing an encouraging attach rate of accommodation bookings.  
However, there is more work to be done to further optimize the cross-sell opportunity. The early signals help demonstrate though that a flight offering can drive incremental new customers to the platform to which we can cross-sell our accommodation product.  
We are beginning to test initiatives targeting these new flight customers, including, for example, encouraging account creation to activate Genius status and in some cases, offering additional incentives for them to book accommodations. We remain focused on continuing to test and innovate in order to build on the early successes we are seeing with flights at Booking.com. We're also continuing to run tests using offerings from our verticals like rental cars and taxis.  
Now before closing, I do want to note that as world leaders assembled this week in Glasgow for the COP26 Summit, discussing the urgency of tackling the global climate crisis, I cannot overstate the importance for our industry to come together to work for the goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. Decarbonization is a major challenge for the entire industry and solving this challenge requires the commitment of all stakeholders.  
I am proud to say that our company, Booking Holdings, is committed to addressing this challenge. We recently released a report that we commissioned with EY Parthenon that looks into what will it take to get the accommodations industry specifically to a carbon-neutral future. While a big task, data shows it is achievable. At Booking.com, we are working on making it easier for travelers to find and choose sustainable accommodation options when booking their travel.  
In addition, we're working with our accommodation supply partners by sharing guidance, insights and best practices to enhance sustainability initiatives at the property level. Of course, there is much more that must be done. But we believe that we are taking important steps to contribute to a more sustainable future for our industry. And finally, we plan on publishing a Booking Holdings climate transition plan in early 2022, which we'll speak more about at that time.  
In conclusion, we executed well and produced strong results in our peak travel season, which is a credit to the hard work and support provided by the many teams across our company. I'm encouraged by the signs of recovery we are seeing in many parts of the world, and I'm confident that we are on the path to an eventual strong recovery in travel demand globally.  
We continue with our important work to strengthen our company's position and execute against our strategic priorities. As I've said before, we were thinking about our business beyond just getting back to 2019 levels of demand and we are focused on building a larger and faster-growing business that generates more earnings after the full recovery and for the long run.  
I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden. David? David, is dialing back in, I think."

Thank you, I was cut off and I'm back in again. So thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I'll review our results for the third quarter to provide some color on the trends we've seen so far in the fourth quarter. To avoid the comparison to the pandemic-impacted periods in 2020, all growth rates are relative to comparable periods in 2019, unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. 
Now on to our results for the third quarter. On our last earnings call, we discussed the improvement in trends that we saw throughout the second quarter driven by the U.S. and Europe, followed by a mass pullback in July. After our earnings call, we saw our overall trends improve in August and continue to get better in September, which resulted in Q3 reported room nights declining 18% versus Q3 2019, which was ahead of the 26% decline in Q2 and the 22% decline in July. September was the strongest month in the third quarter, with room nights declining 14%, about the same level as June. 
The improvements in the Q3 room night decline versus Q2 were driven primarily by Europe, which benefited from strong cross-border travel within the region. In Q3, room nights in Europe were down mid-single digits versus 2019, with room nights trends improving in August versus July. September was similar to August. You will recall the room night growth pulled back from June to July in Europe due to concerns over the Delta variant.
Rest of world also improved from Q2 to Q3. In the U.S., we -- Q2 to Q3. However, the U.S. still had strong growth in the quarter and remained our strongest performing major country in Q3. Within the U.S., we saw a meaningful slowdown in August from the very strong growth we experienced in July, followed by a recovery to strong growth in September. The slowdown in the U.S. in August was due to concerns about the Delta variants. Asian room night declines in Q3 were about in line with Q2. Room nights in Asia was still down significantly from 2019 levels. 
Mobile bookings, primarily through our apps, represented about 2/3 of our total room nights. Our apps continue to represent an increasing percentage of our mobile bookings. In Q3, as Glenn mentioned, we achieved an important milestone in the use of our app Booking.com, surpassing 100 million monthly active users. 
We're also pleased to see the number of unique customers booking via our app in the quarter grew strongly compared with Q3 2019. Our direct channel as a percentage of our room nights year-on-year and relative to Q3 2019 increased. 
While international room nights remain downwards in 2019, we saw another sequential improvement in our international trends, with the international mix of our room nights increasing to about 33% in Q3 from about 25% in Q2 and about 15% in Q1. Most of this improvement in international room nights came from bookings for travel within Europe. We continue to see double-digit growth in domestic room nights in Q3 but at a slightly lower level than in Q2. 
The pickup in international travel in the quarter was a driver of the improvements in overall room night trends from Q2 to Q3. However, international room nights were down almost 50% compared with Q3 2019 levels. 
Our Q3 cancellation rate was slightly above Q3 2019 levels. However, cancellation rates improved in the quarter, and September was slightly better than 2019 for the month. Percentage of our -- of our Q3 2021 bookings made with flexible cancellation policies remained significantly higher than in Q3 2019. 
The booking window of Booking.com remain shorter than it was in the third quarter of 2019 and contracted more than it did in Q2 as we saw a high mix of near-term bookings during our peak summer season. All regions had a shorter booking window in Q3 than in Q3 2019. 
For our alternative accommodations, the global mix of room nights in Q3 of about 30% was up slightly from Q3 2019. The increase in mixed alternative accommodations in the quarter was less than it was in Q2 as we saw a great -- a greater sequential improvement in demand for hotel room nights in Europe from Q2 to Q3. Our alternative accommodation room nights in Europe grew slightly in August and September versus 2019 and for the quarter were about in line with Q3 2019. We believe we benefited from the strength of our portfolio in Europe, where we can respond to solid demand for alternative accommodations and an improving demand for hotels. 
Gross bookings declined 6% in Q3, which is less than the decline in room nights due to the increase in average day rates for accommodations of about 10% versus 2019 on a constant currency basis and also due to a couple of points of benefit from changes in FX rates and strong performance in our flight business. 
Our accommodation constant currency ADR benefited by just over 5 percentage points from an increased mix of business in North America, which is a high ADR region and a decrease of mix in Asia, which is a low ADR region. Excluding regional mix effects, constant currency ADRs were up just over 4%, driven mainly by rate increases in Europe and North America across many destination types with notable strength in beach-oriented leisure destinations. 
Airline tickets booked in the third quarter were up 131% versus 2019, driven by very strong growth of Priceline and by flight bookings at Booking.com. We're encouraged to see another quarter of triple-digit growth from our flights business, which is a key component of our multiproduct connected trip strategy. 
Consolidated revenue for the third quarter was $4.7 billion, which was 7% below Q3 2019 and was more than double the amount of revenue in Q2 2021, a far greater sequential improvement than in 2019. Our Q3 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was about in line with Q3 2019, which was in line with our expectations. We experienced even more revenue seasonality in Q3 2021 than normal due to the concentration of stays in Q3 from bookings made in the quarter and also from bookings [indiscernible] when customers could book at combinations but could not stay due to restrictions and other COVID-related concerns. 
The strong top line performance resulted in adjusted EBITDA of $2.1 billion in the third quarter, which was 15% below Q3 2019. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense item, decreased 3% versus Q3 2019. Marketing expense declined by a few points less than gross bookings due to slightly lower ROIs in paid channels as we invested into capturing demand during the peak travel season. 
Sales -- our expenses in Q3 were significantly higher than they were in Q2 on a dollar basis due to higher volume of merchant gross bookings, which increased as a percentage of total gross bookings in the third quarter. At Booking.com, the amount of gross bookings processed through our payment platform in Q3 was over $6 billion, which was almost 1/3 of Booking.com's business, up from about 1/4 in Q2. 
Our more fixed expense categories in Q3 in aggregate came in 3% lower than Q2, as the $136 million of personnel expense in the second quarter related to our decision to repay the government aid was mostly offset by an increase from Q2 to Q3 in our bonus accruals and digital service tax expense, both of which are accrued proportional to revenue. 
Our non-GAAP EPS was $37.70, down 17% versus Q3 2019. Non-GAAP net income of $1.6 billion reflects a non-GAAP tax rate of 21%, which is higher than the 19% in Q3 2019 due to a higher proportion of nontax expenses in relation to lower pretax income versus 2019. 
On a GAAP basis, we had operating income of $2 billion in Q3. We recorded GAAP net income of $769 million in the quarter, which includes a $1 billion pretax unrealized loss on our equity investments, primarily related to our investment in Meituan as well as income tax expense of $199 million. 
Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q3 ending cash investment balance of $15.4 billion was down versus our Q2 ending balance of $16.1 billion as the $1.5 billion of free cash flow was more than offset by the repayment of a $1 billion convertible note maturing in Q3 and the $1 billion unrealized loss on our equity investments. 
The return of capital to shareholders has and will be an important component of our value creation strategy. Throughout the COVID pandemic, we said that we restart returning capital to shareholders when we saw that our 3 largest regions were no longer at meaningful risk of a major reversal due to COVID and has also become more predictable. Assuming that travel recovery continues, we plan to restart returning capital in early 2022 under our remaining authorization. Assuming continued recovery, we'd expect to complete this organization within 3 years from restarting. 
Now on to our thoughts for the fourth quarter. October room nights declined 10% versus 2019, which is better than the 14% decline in September. The improvement in October was driven mainly by Asia, although the region remains down considerably versus 2019. The improvement in Asia was led by domestic travel within many countries and was driven by improving vaccination progress and governments easing restrictions on travel. 
Room night growth in the U.S. improved a little from September to October and remained strong in October. Rest of World also improved a little in October and was back close to 2019 levels. Room night declines in Europe were about the same in October as they were in September, but weakened towards the end of the month. This resulted in overall room night declines being higher in the last week of October than the average for the month. The slowdown at the end of October in Europe was driven by a number of countries that have seen recent increases in COVID infections, including Germany, Russia and Italy. 
Given the ongoing uncertainty around COVID, it's difficult to predict how room nights in November, December will compare with the 10% reduction you saw in October. Looking forward to November and December, the rising case counts across many important Western European countries and across much of Eastern Europe as well at the start of the winter season in the Northern Hemisphere, which in 2020 contributed to an increase in COVID cases, creates unpredictability. Also pre-pandemic, the contribution of Asia to total room nights were highest in November and December, and Asia is still our least recovered region. 
On a more positive note, since the U.S. announced in late September plans to ease travel restrictions in November for international travelers who are vaccinated, we've seen a significant improvement in room nights booked by Europeans that travel to the U.S. as well as the reverse. Also, we're pleased to see more gross bookings on the books for the Christmas, New Year period than we saw at this time in 2019 in the U.S. and Western Europe. 
Turning to the income statement. We expect Q4 gross bookings to decline by a few points less than room nights, driven by higher reported ADRs and flight bookings versus 2019. We expect less of an increase in our ADRs in Q4 than Q3 due to less of a benefit from regional mix as the Asia region continues to recover but also due to lower occupancy rates after the peak travel season. 
We expect Q4 revenue to decline more than gross bookings due to a couple of factors. The first is that due to short booking window in Q3, a lower percentage of Q3 bookings than normal will stay in Q4. The second is due to our expectation that the booking window will contract less in Q4 than it did in Q3, resulting in more bookings made in the quarter that are expected to check in, in future quarters. As a result, we expect our revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be more than 1% below Q4 2019. This also means we expect Q4 revenue to have a greater sequential decrease from Q3 than we saw in 2019, and we expect Q4 revenue to decline more than it did in Q3. 
We expect Q4 marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings to increase slightly versus 2019 as we expect to invest in capturing demand and increasing awareness during the continued global recovery of travel demand. We expect Q4 sales and other expenses to be lower than they were in Q3 due to lower merchant transaction volumes. However, we expect sales and other expenses in the fourth quarter to be higher than in Q4 2019 due to higher merchant volumes and mix. 
We expect our more fixed expense carries in Q4 in aggregate to be about in line with Q3 on a dollar basis. We expect Q4 EBITDA to be positive driven largely by the higher -- but driven largely by the higher-than-normal seasonal decrease in revenue, we expect a much greater seasonal sequential decrease in EBITDA from Q3 to Q4 than normal. 
In conclusion, we are pleased with our recovery in the top line in Q3, which led to strong financial results for the quarter. The financial strength we saw in Q3 was helped by the concentration of stays in the quarter, which will lead to some differences in the comparison of Q4 to Q3 relative to what we've seen in prior years. 
October room night trends improved relative to September driven by some encouraging trends in Asia. However, recently, the rising case counts across Europe increases the uncertainty about how trends will progress in November and December. 
In closing, we're confident in our ability to capture demand as the global recovery continues and to execute against our strategic priorities. 
With that, I'll now take your questions. And Eli, I turn it over to you to open the line for questions."

For us, we've talked about this a few times. We talked about our business has done well with international. And international generally has been hard hit, albeit we are seeing some better things, but that the long haul is still a problem. 
Yes, we're seeing some numbers coming up in Asia. Great. I love it. The fact that people are getting more vaccinated in Asia, that's great. The fact that vaccines are being distributed more broadly and getting around, that's great. The fact that the pharmaceutical companies are coming out with new ways to combat against this terrible virus with pills now that can help people who have caught it end up being hopefully healthier quicker. 
All the things, but what we need really is for everyone who can get a vaccine to please go out and get that vaccine if you're medically able to and you're capable of getting it, please get it. That will help hasten the recovery for not only the travel industry, but the entire world. And that's what we hope will happen. Obviously, we're doing everything we can. So we're prepared when that day comes, which it will. We can't say when, but we know it will come. 
And we're preparing by doing all the things that Dave and I have been talking about, preparing with our partners and getting our marketing prepared and doing all the steps that you know we've been doing to make sure that when travel comes back to above 2019, we're getting the share we want to be getting.

Justin, we've actually beat this before, so I'll be relatively quick on the puts and takes in the core accommodation business. Our underlying take rates have been solid. And obviously, the reported take rates are a function of timing. So that continues to go well for us. As we get to -- back to 2019 levels, there will be some inflationary pressure on the personnel line. Everybody knows there's a war for tech talent out there, and we've had 2, 3 years worth of merit increases and other expenses -- and other increases in our cost base. Of course, we did take expenses out, but there are variable expenses. So they will come back with some efficiency over time, but there will be some pressure on the personnel line. 
But there are other things that aren't in the model that we can use to offset that pressure. We can get extra economies of scale as the business grows beyond 2019 levels on both the fixed costs and on the variable cost side as well. There are opportunities in our direct mix, which, of course, is very important. And of course, a key element of this all happens to our overall ROI on the performance marketing side where we saw some increases in the first half of the year. We saw some small compression in the second half of this year, but those markets are very variable and very dynamic, and we're pleased with how we're doing in those markets. 
The last thing I want to leave you with on that topic is that within our core business, there's always a trade-off between growth, market share and profitability. So to the extent we see opportunities, we're leaning in. We want to try and drive market share increases where we think that we can. That will pressure the business in the short term as we lean into making that investment, and also the investment in marketing and other areas will basically be a leading indicator relative to revenue. 
So there will -- and we do believe that there are opportunity for us to gain share in accommodations through this recovery and beyond. So that would be an additional factor in the mix of how we think about the long-term business margins in accommodations."

So that's positive. It really -- something that we -- I'd say that was more what we did because we expected that to be the outcome. 
Of course, these markets are dynamic and as recovery continues, more and more players will come back into the marketplace. But basically what happened in Q3 was very much in line with what we told you a quarter ago would happen. The mix in between brands and the performance has not materially changed. If you recall back in 2019, we were over 90% -- or around 90% of our marketing spend was in performance marketing. We are looking to move up -- to move the brand spend up a little bit over time. But of course, brand has been very much shut down in 2020 is now coming back on in 2021. 
So we're not in a very different position than where we were in 2019, but we do see the opportunity to continue to trend a little bit more towards brands, some of which might go at the mid-funnel market opportunities that Glenn talked about.

Then I'll talk a little bit about IDFA, and I'll let David what he wants to say about our app and I'm not sure I'll let him be as free as he wants to be or not about what we see in terms of profitability, et cetera. So you're absolutely right about the air business, very exciting for us, of course, and we've been working on it. And it's interesting because I happen to have noticed that in the first quarter call, in 2020, just as things started going very bad for the whole world, we were talking about the -- just starting out in the air business at Booking.com in the fourth quarter of 2019. 
And I mentioned about we are striving to get to that 50% coverage of Booking.com customers. I was looking forward to hopefully doing that for 2020. And of course, that didn't quite happen, exactly what we wanted. But the question, and it wasn't from you, Mark, who was another analyst who asked about why not 100%. And I said, well, the 50% was just what I want to get to that year. Of course, we want to get to 100%, and that still is the same thing. Yes, we're in 27 countries. Of course, we want to get to every single country that anybody we currently deal with, we want to be able to provide them with an air ticket. 
But it takes time. So it's not something you just flip a switch. You have to actually go through regulations to get licensing and all those sorts of things. So we're rolling it out as we can, as we should, and we will get to 100% at some point. Now I do want to point out that we are at that -- over that 50% number right now. So I am pleased with where we are with that. 
I also want to say, though, it's still so early. We're not doing big marketing yet, real big marketing. There are a lot of opportunities to get a much higher number of people coming to this air product. And the reason that we like it, not only the 25% of the new customers, which, of course, is fantastic, but is that attachment rate, which I haven't given a number, but I'm pleased with where we are with that right now. And again, that's something we have not optimized yet. There's a lot of opportunity there to optimize that and get an even higher attach rate. 
And that's part of the overall vision of being able to bring new customers in from different verticals in different ways than we've done in the past, which we primarily pay for performance marketing and being able to bring a lot more customer and as we talked a little bit earlier in a previous answer about being able to provide them with a lot more value. 
Your first question about IDFA, look, these privacy-related changes, they only impact a small part of our marketing and it's obviously not unique to our company. We know that's very common. We can manage through this. And as we know -- as you know, most of our marketing, primarily -- it's paid marketing channels like PPC and meta, and that's not going to be directly impacted by any of these kinds of changes. 
Our focus is always first-party data. We want to leverage the data in the marketing. And any of these changes to privacy like the IDFA, this does not really impact us. 
And I think you would know, we chose not to show the app -- tracking app back in April -- April '21, this year, April, while the IDFA specifically decided not to do that, and of course, you've seen our results since then, so I really don't think this is a big deal for us. I'm very proud of the team in our whole marketing. They will be able to work and come up with, I would say, privacy-oriented ways to continue to be able to market with good tracking and ROIs. And David, I think you had number 2, which is about the monthly active users for mobile."

Curious what your view is on how the landscape on both the supply and the demand side might evolve as we move into a post-pandemic world and aim towards summer of 2022. And how you think about making investments on supply to match up the way in which there might be a more normalized travel environment in '22?"
33254,1684972787,2423945,"Booking Holdings Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2021",2021-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Booking Holdings Inc.","Executives","I'll give my first comments, and I'll let -- David can always add, if he'd like.

So we saw before the pandemic an increase in the alternative accommodations business as it became a larger and larger share of the total accommodations business and it was going on a pretty steady rate going up. And dynamic happens and you get a step change. And as people desire safety, being away from crowd, and they go there. 
And now we've seen for ourselves, we've seen people liking hotels and that. I think the long-term trend, though, will continue. And I think if you look 5 years in the future, I think alternative accommodations will be a higher share. So that means, of course, for us, is we've talked about this in the past, how important it is that we go out and make sure we get the best supply we can get. And that means working hard on that and making sure that the people who own these properties see us as a platform that they want to use that's first in their mind that this is a great way to fill up their properties. And that's something that we are working on, absolutely. 
The demand side is similar. Go to Europe, and we've talked about them in the past, and say, where can I get a villa in the south of France, people will say, I think Booking.com is a great place. He went to the U.S., and he said, hey, I need a vacation, a place to ski, they may not think of Booking.com first. We got to get that awareness up. And I've talked about that in the past, and that's something we have to do also. 
But one of the truly great things about Booking.com is we offer more of both. Nobody offers -- you put together hotels and alternative accommodations. You put that together, we're the ones who have both of those. And I really believe that's a superior way for somebody to decide what they're going to choose in terms of accommodation. And we see this in our data. We see people come. They look -- first start looking at one type and then they end up booking another type, and they're able to compare and contrast, both to see the reviews on both, look at the prices on both. What are they going to get for one, what are they going to get from the other. And that's why we believe we have a superior offering to the consumer. 
And I do believe, though, that it is something that absolutely is going to continue. But on the other side, you all see the hotels, they're making some moves themselves, and they're coming up with ways to offer a better offering, providing some of the benefits of an alternative accommodation to a consumer, particularly so they are prepared as people work in a new way in the future and want to have both the benefits of the hotel but perhaps more room or more services that you can get in terms of making sure you have good WiFi or a place you can do your work at. And that's something I see also, hotels are definitely going to be getting into that space. David, I don't know if you want to say anything more to that?"

So Glenn, I think in the past, we've talked about your payments product helping to expand your TAM by onboarding those users who may not necessarily be using credit cards and instead online payment services. Given the overall, I guess, depressed state of travel in Asia, maybe much of that value unlocked is still in front of us. But are you seeing evidence in other regions of the world that this is helping to bring in that incremental user? And also, just rising ability for you guys to merchandise as you do more of the connected trip opens up a greater opportunity for you guys to run promos and change prices, and hence, flex your gross margins up and down to drive growth on top of what has always been more of a performance marketing-driven growth. So is there still a pretty material gap in ROI from doing one versus the other at this point in terms of what you've perceived?"

I'll let David talk about ROIs on our merchandising approach and how we're doing that. So you're absolutely right. If somebody doesn't have an ability to pay for something because they don't have the appropriate payment method, then they're not going to be able to buy from that person and/or that company like us. So we always have to do that. 
So if you are in Southeast Asia, and let's say somebody is using, let's say, Grab, who's a partner of ours, and they're saying GrabPay. Well, if we're not able to use GrabPay for the hotel, taking the money in from the consumer, that person is not going to use us. They're going to use somebody else. And we have, obviously, GrabPay, a partner working on that. 
Or if you look at other ways, people who say they go and look, it's not in their favor, they can use another way, they still decide not to use up. There's something else we've seen, which is really interesting, is that just having more ways to accept payments seems to increase conversion sometimes. I don't know why. I can't give you a science. I just see data, and this is -- that's interesting. 
The other side is making sure we're paying the supplier the way they want to get the money because sometimes they say, I don't want to get it the way you're doing it with a virtual credit card or I don't want to get it in terms of the bank transfer. I want to get it some other way. So we've got to be able to do that, and that improves our relationship with the suppliers. And particularly improves with the supplier when the method that we can get the money to them is cheaper than the method they are currently using. 
That's a great thing when we can do that, that's another value add to that hotel or any other type of supplier. Lots of ways that we're going to do that, and there are all other things we're working -- the fintech part of our business that we're just starting out. We talked last time about setting up that unit. There are a lot of opportunities there. And we talked about how in 2019, we did over $100 billion worth of gross bookings. And our idea is to let's find ways that we can monetize that better, and let's find ways we can [ flag ] value to both consumers and suppliers. And David, I don't know if you want to talk a little bit about ROIs and how we're doing the merchandise."

So as Glenn said, payments is increasingly becoming part of the core value proposition that we offer at Booking.com, in particular, to both customers and partners. So it's no longer just kind of we think as an add-on. It really is solving problems for both of them in cost-effective ways and risk-reduction ways that they couldn't do as efficiently themselves. So that's why it's growing so rapidly of our mix. 
Now you're right, Stephen, that once we're on payments, we can participate in merchandising. Of course, the most efficient way to get rates is to source great rates, which Glenn talked about a fair amount in his point. But if we need to participate over and above the sourcing and driving  promotional targeting, particular use in particular markets, we can with the payments platform. 
And we now have enough experience under our belt in instrumentation around that, that we can treat that, as you mentioned, as a marketing investment and look at it in a very similar way to the way that we look at our spend in the performance channels, for example. Compare ROIs one versus the other and decide what the right mix is. 
So correct, with payments becoming a bigger piece of our proposition, where we can, when we need to, when we think it makes sense, we can look at merchandising through a strong ROI lens. We can be quite proactive in that area and compare it directly with other forms of spending on marketing."

Doug, let me explain that -- reexplain that whole seasonality thing because this is quite important, and we can explain it at a kind of high level. So Q3 was very strong. it was almost artificially strong from a revenue point of view because you've got 2 things unnaturally helping it. First of all, remember, a lot of bookings in Q1, Q2 that weren't always -- stayed in Q1, Q2 stayed in Q3. So we got that benefit compared to normal Q3. On top of that, in the quarter, more bookings in Q3 than normal stayed in Q3. So because booking window was so short, so Q3 got topped up 2 ways from Q1, Q2 and in Q3. 
So now when you think of Q4 and you're now comparing it against a very top-up Q3, and some of that top-up in Q3 directly impacts Q4. So Q4 gets impacted by comparing against a strong Q3, but I think some of those Q3 bookings that normally would stay in Q4 stayed in Q3. So you've now got, if you like, a double factor driving the comparison between Q3 and Q4. 
Also, we believe the booking window will start to expand in Q4. So more of the bookings in Q4 will actually leak out of Q4 than did in Q3 relatively. So you've got these 2 factors kind of driving a very unusual comparison between Q3 and Q4. So a fair amount more sequential revenue decline. It's all timing and all mechanics. But think of it as a Q4 comparing Q3 on steroids. And some of the reason why Q3 was on steroids will directly impact Q4. So that's what's going on."
