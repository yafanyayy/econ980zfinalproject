And just thinking about, obviously, things have been pulled back quite dramatically in 2020. And as we think about 2021, I'm just curious in terms of your discussions with retailers, how you're talking about trade spending, one of the things that we've been looking at is kind of this reset of price sensitivity, given that no promotions have effectively been in the market for the past 9 to 10 months. So I just wanted to get your thoughts on that. And then the other question is just you can give us a kind of a roundup of the innovation program that has already been announced just so we can get a sense for the program in 2021?"

Our levels for the year were pretty consistent with prior year. So we were basically flat. The IRI data will support that. So I think there's a little bit of a disconnect in the Nielsen data. So we don't really expect any material changes as we go into next year as well. And then as you look at innovation, certainly, I think some of the bigger items we have, Kit-Kat flavor, which has done exceptionally well for Kit Kat on a global basis, we have the stuff Reis's products and our re-innovation tends to also always be quite strong for us. We have a permissible line of products to really address that benefit of better-for-you that we are underdeveloped in across our portfolio, and that will include kit Kat in which is in addition to what has been an already launch of a successful platform with REIT spin. We are also relaunching our sugar-free line to zero sugar, really focusing on Hershey and Reef and launching Hershey and Reese organic product. So those are the highlights for the year. And I would say, overall, if you looked at our innovation, the level of innovation is about comparable to prior year."

So on the media side, I'll say media and sand in general, we're probably looking at something like mid-single digits across those pieces on the media side. Clearly, we want to defend and extend our share gains. And so we were thoughtful in how we deployed media last year, we made some reductions kind of midyear, we actually turned it up a little bit towards the end of the year. And we want to make sure as we go into this year that we've got enough to defend and extend share. On the SG&A side, we kind of think about it in 2 buckets. And I'll say things like normal corporate expense, travel, will be very tight year-over-year. And there, we use zero-based budgeting format. We watch headcount, all of that. And then we talk about the investment side. And on the investment side, we do have some capabilities that we want to continue to fortify S-4 the ERP program, drive some OpEx through the SG&A areas. More expansion of our digital capabilities, which came into play quite a bit over the course of last year. And then the analytics and insights. But again, we talked a lot about that last year as well, but continuing to extend our capabilities. In those spaces. And so could it flex up or down. I think as we get into the year and we see how the shape of the P&L, and we see how the top line delivered we probably have some latitude and flexibility there, but I would say we have pretty firm investment plans, at least in those areas as we start the year."

But as we know, hedging held smooth impacts over time at the end of the day, as the lid flows through and sticks, then eventually, that's going to come into play into cost.

Part of what's offsetting that is the hedges we had even possibly prior to the bid going in or taking advantage of dislocations in supply and demand throughout the course of 2020. There were times when the Cocoa market had come down for beans and things like that. So that's really there. Just to be fully clear, the late is 100% in the cost base for 2021, but you have some of those hedges with supply and demand imbalances as well as that cocoa butter dynamic, which is really where the offset is. And so as you think about 22, those will be the 2 variables to kind of keep an eye on of what could cause those costs to change more so than the Lindt."

One was we did have retailers requesting early shipments so that they could make sure that they had adequate supply as they came into 2021. And so those shipments were incremental. And then we also had exceptionally strong sell through, both for Halloween and for holiday, and that has kind of a knock-on effect where we then have left discounting required post the holiday and less cannibalization of the everyday business, so you kind of get back to the everyday business even more quickly.

So I think our share gains really are, as you mentioned, the factor of many different components coming together. For -- with consumers and families right now. So certainly, this past year, there were a lot of those at-home occasions, things like somers, where people were staying home being with their family at home in a smaller environment, doing movie nights, products like Twizzlers and seasons were turned out to be incredibly important for consumers during this very difficult time where they wanted to cling to as much normalcy as possible, and the Seasons is really about traditions and rituals and connections with family and close friends. As you mentioned, we also made strong investments over the past several years in a lot of capabilities that allowed us to understand consumers, improved our ability to forecast where consumers were going to go and then really execute well in our supply chain, apply data and analytics to our sales and retail coverage, data and analytics to our media in ways that we believe some others can't. Early on, we had discussed with all of you that we made that decision to lean in and capture opportunities as much as possible during Covid take the opportunity to create new occasions for consumers and really partner with our retailers to make sure we were there for them when they needed us with our retail sales folks in-store stocking shelves, and meeting their product needs when some others couldn't. So clearly, all of those things together were really important for us. Now as we look at that, I would say we are, in the past, typically might being 10, 20 basis points of share in a year.
Obviously, this year, 160 basis points of share and [ 130 ] on our chocolate business, where we already have a 45% market share. So as we look into 2021 we believe that the share growth will continue prior to the last, which is really basically up to Easter.

I mean, it is difficult in a year like this past year to precisely pinpoint exact amount to any one factor just because there was so much going on. I mean, clearly, we know supply chain was a piece of it. Frankly, though, we also believe how we pivoted our portfolio and really shifted spending and shifted focus to -- on our portfolio to the exact right items that consumers were looking for the role that we were able to focus on with seasons and how much that resonated with consumers during that time. So it is -- it's difficult to pinpoint. There were opportunities for products on shelf. And so I guess I would say I think it's fair to say some of that was probably short-term benefit, and then there are other components that have somewhat of a longer-lasting effect. So for example, if you do well in a season in one year and your sell-through is quite strong.
Typically, the buy that you get from retailers to next year tends to be pretty strong as well. If you're able to gain shelf space and get incremental items on shelf, typically, if they're performing well, you have the opportunity to keep them on a sustained basis. So while some of the benefits, I think, are short term, others will have that enduring effect."

I'm wondering at this point, after many years of declining, not just for Hershey, but for the industry, ad spend has come down as efficiency was more of the focus do you think that you can get to a point where you can get a flywheel going where you spend as much or maybe even lean in on advertising as a percentage of sales as you get a better sense of the returns on these types of spendings?"

I mean, our approach on media spend is this is a category, and we have brands that are incredibly responsive to media. And if you look at ROIs on media being driven by scale, profit margin and lift responsiveness. We win on all 3 of those. So we are one of the highest spenders on advertising as a percent of net sales within the industry, and we really believe in that. At the same time, we challenge ourselves constantly to get more from our money. And so over the years, we have transitioned from 100% television advertising probably 12-years ago to -- we are now down to probably 40%. I think about 60%, 65% of our spending is digital. Now the other factor that kind of plays in, in addition to being more efficient through digital, which has enabled us to do a lot of very targeted things, such as targeting media based on how sell-through is during the season or targeting ZIP codes, et cetera. You have the other factor going on, which is media, the cost of media in the marketplace and inflation and kind of playing through that. If you think about 2020, our spending was down a little bit because we pulled back on some parts of the portfolio that we thought just weren't relevant like refreshment this year. And so part of our increase is restoring some spend levels in some of those areas. And that's part of what's driving up some of our spending as well."

Mexico really is the market that's contended -- or has tended to have continued Covid pressure. Where the category sales have remained soft, even though that they are improving.

Store declines, traditional trade, store closures, and less of those family celebrations where chocolate has traditionally played such an important role. So it's a little bit of a tail of multiple cities as we look at each piece around the world, but in totality, will lead to modest growth."

So when we think about packaging innovation, we think about pack types, which are designed to meet specific consumer occasions. So this is -- for me, I would encompass it as part of kind of price pack architecture, which is as we look to capture incremental consumer occasions, how do we have certain packs that enable that. So that there's a value to the consumer that our products now better meet an occasion or a need. If you go back and look at -- we went through a laydown to standup bags, not only was it easier to shop on-shelf but it was also once it got into the home, in the pantry, much easier to use, much easier to see, less messy, those types of things. We will look at pack configurations in terms of size, like is there a smaller size that is used for certain occasions or certain demographics versus a larger pack. And we'll do that on a brand-by-brand basis. So I would say that our pipeline is largely kind of focused on what we would say price pack architecture. And so as such, what we try and do from a strategic perspective is make sure that we are at least margin neutral. I mean, that would be our goal. If we can get price realization, obviously, that's the focus. But short of that, we want to be margin neutral."

But then also saying kind of given those discussions with retailers, the expectation is that kind of broadly speaking, as you look at that bar category relative to protein shake powders. Are those conversations with retailers like fairly pointed such that they are suggesting, oh, this is what we're doing for this period of time, but as we get through, let's say, Q2 or what have you, we would look to reallocate back to certain brands and certain bars. Or is this kind of more of a -- yes, it's going to probably come back, let's kind of wait and see how everything develops.

You've mentioned before touching potentially increasingly into bake snacks. So I guess, Michelle, the question is, as you step back, right? It seems like Hershey continues to evolve, right, and more of a broader snacking business, obviously, outside of the core chocolate infection. So as we get to '21 and we think about '22, like very simplistically, would you argue that the point here is to kind of get Hershey bigger in the store in a bunch of different areas, such that you are increasing overall distribution points on the go-forward for broader Hershey? Or do you feel like as you step back to the whole company, yes, obviously, you're looking for increased distribution, but maybe there's a little bit of infill on a SKU, maybe on sugar-free and maybe you take one out in kisses.

So I guess I would say, first and foremost, our #1 priority is always our core confection business because it is the Mothership, it's our profit engine. We have tremendous strengths.

And then with that is the foundation, we really look across all the capabilities that we have as a company relative to consumer insights, to taste science, to ubiquitous distribution. All of that and say, how could we leverage that to capture more and more incremental consumer occasions. And so I think that's where you see us with a targeted focus on okay, something like better-for-you should capture an incremental occasion and incremental consumer. So I don't think about that as kind of more incremental. And then if I look at labor variety on the core, to me, that's a little bit more where we rotate in, we rotate out. We have one slot for that, but it's not a permanent incremental. Some of our expansion into other categories, i.e., better-for-you and savory. Yes, I look at those as gaining incremental distribution points more broadly in the store by meeting incremental consumer occasions. So I think incremental occasion is important for us, leveraging the capabilities and then importantly, making sure that we do a very measured expansion. We want to focus on confection, add an area and then really play to win there. And make sure we don't spread ourselves too thin. Similarly to what I would say we're doing international, where we've focused the last set of markets that we've prioritized that we really want to play the wind as opposed to spreading ourselves to strength."

Our levels for the year were pretty consistent with prior year. So we were basically flat. The IRI data will support that. So I think there's a little bit of a disconnect in the Nielsen data. 
So we don't really expect any material changes as we go into next year as well. And then as you look at innovation, certainly, I think some of the bigger items we have, Kit Kat flavor, which has done exceptionally well for Kit Kat on a global basis. We have to stuff Reese's products and our Reese innovations tends to also always be quite strong for us. We have a permissible line of products to really address that benefit of better-for-you that we are underdeveloped in across our portfolio, and that will include Kit Kat THiNS, which is in addition to what has been an already launch of a successful platform with Reese THINS. We are also relaunching our sugar-free line to zero sugar, really focusing on Hershey and Reese and launching Hershey and Reese organic product. 
So those are the highlights for the year. And I would say, overall, if you look at our innovation, the level of innovation is about comparable to prior year."

So on the media side, I'll say media and SG&A, and in general, we're probably looking at something like mid-single digits across those pieces on the media side.

We made some reductions kind of midyear, we actually turned it up a little bit towards the end of the year. And we want to make sure as we go into this year that we've got enough to defend and extend share. 
On the SG&A side, we kind of think about it in 2 buckets. And I'll say things like normal corporate expense, travel, will be very tight year-over-year. And there, we use zero-based budgeting format. We watch headcount, all of that. And then we talk about the investment side. And the investment side, we do have some capabilities that we want to continue to fortify S-4 the ERP program, drive some OpEx through the SG&A areas. More expansion of our digital capabilities, which came into play quite a bit over the course of last year. And then the analytics and insights. But again, we talked a lot about that last year as well by but continuing to extend our capabilities in those spaces. 
And so could it flex up or down. I think as we get into the year and we've seen how the shape of the P&L, and we see how the top line delivers. We probably have some latitude and flexibility there, but I would say we have pretty firm investment plans, at least in those areas as we start the year."

Just to be fully clear, the Lindt is 100% in the cost base for 2021, but you have some of those hedges with the supply and demand imbalances as well as that Cocoa butter dynamic, which is really where the offset is. And so as you think about '22, those will be the 2 variables to kind of keep an eye on of what could cause those costs to change more so than the Lindt."

One was we did have retailers requesting early shipments so that they could make sure that they had adequate supply as they came into 2021. So those shipments were incremental. And then we also had exceptionally strong sell through, both for Halloween and for holiday, and that has kind of a knock-on effect where we then have left discounting required post the holiday and less cannibalization of the everyday business, so you kind of get back to the everyday business even more quickly. So those investments and the focus that we put both in terms of media and in-store merchandising to drive category growth during the season really paid off for us.

So I think our share gains really are, as you mentioned, the factor of many different components coming together. First of all, we do have incredibly strong brands and very strong operating capabilities and executional capabilities. I think as I look at year and look at the broad portfolio and we are able then to leverage that portfolio and pivot as needed to whatever occasions as resonating most with consumers and families right now. 
So certainly, this past year, there were a lot of those at-home occasions, things like [indiscernible], where people were staying home, being with their family at home in a smaller environment, doing movie nights, products like Twizzlers and seasons were turned out to be incredibly important for consumers during this very difficult time where they wanted to cling to as much normalcy as possible, and the Seasons are really about traditions and rituals and connections with family and close friends. 
As you mentioned, we also made strong investments over the past several years in a lot of capabilities that allowed us to understand consumers, improved our ability to forecast where consumers were going to go and then really execute well in our supply chain, apply data and analytics to our sales and retail coverage, data and analytics to our media in ways that we believe some others can't. 
Early on, we had discussed with all of you that we made that decision to lean in and capture opportunities as much as possible during COVID, take the opportunity to create new occasions for consumers and really partner with our retailers to make sure we were there for them when they needed us with our retail sales folks in-store stocking shelves, and meeting their product needs when some others couldn't. So clearly, all of those things together were really important for us. Now as we look at that, I would say we are, in the past, typically might gain 10, 20 basis points of share in a year.
Obviously, this year, 160 basis points of share and 130 on our chocolate business, where we already have a 45% market share. So as we look into 2021, we believe that the share growth will continue prior to the last, which is really basically up to Easter. And post Easter, we believe that the share will moderate as we lap those 20 gains, but it's going to be our goal to profitably sustain as much of the share as we can going forward."

I mean, it is difficult in a year like this past year to precisely pinpoint exact amount to any one factor just because there was so much going on.

Frankly, though, we also believe how we pivoted our portfolio and really shifted spending and shifted focus to -- on our portfolio to the exact right items that consumers were looking for the role that we were able to focus on with seasons and how much that resonated with consumers during that time. 
So it is -- it's difficult to pinpoint. There were opportunities for products on shelf. And so I guess I would say I think it's fair to say some of that was probably short-term benefit, and then there are other components that have somewhat of a longer-lasting effect. So for example, if you do well in a season in one year and your sell-through is quite strong. Typically, the buy that you get from retailers the next year tends to be pretty strong as well. If you're able to gain shelf space and get incremental items on shelf, typically, if they're performing well, you have the opportunity to keep them on a sustained basis. So while some of the benefits, I think, are short term, others will have that enduring effect."

I mean, our approach on media spend is, this is a category and we have brands that are incredibly responsive to media. And if you look at ROIs on media being driven by scale, profit margin and lift flash responsiveness. We win on all 3 of those. So we are one of the highest spenders on advertising as a percent of net sales within the industry, and we really believe in that. At the same time, we challenge ourselves constantly to get more from our money. And so over the years, we have transitioned from 100% television advertising probably 12-years ago to -- we are now down to probably 40%. I think about 60%, 65% of our spending is digital. Now the other factor that kind of plays in, in addition to being more efficient through digital, which has enabled us to do a lot of very targeted things, such as targeting media based on how sell-through is during the season or targeting ZIP codes, et cetera. You have the other factor going on, which is media, the cost of media in the marketplace and inflation and kind of playing through that. If you think about 2020, our spending was down a little bit because we pulled back on some parts of the portfolio that we thought just weren't relevant like refreshment this year. And so part of our increase is restoring some spend levels in some of those areas. And that's part of what's driving up some of our spending as well."

So I would say our goal, we expect we will continue to gain share through the lab. And then once the lap hits, we are going to be focused relentlessly on trying to profitably sustain as much of the share gain that we can. Obviously, it's hard to predict what will happen, what will be going on in the marketplace competitively, et cetera. Category mix alone could pressure our share a little bit as gum will likely rebound versus '20, and we are underdeveloped in gum. So that mix shift alone puts a little bit of pressure and I guess that's probably the only specific thing I'd call out. We will be executing. And it's one of the reasons that, as Steve mentioned earlier, that we are really making sure we have significant investments this year so that we invest into trying to maintain those share gains."

I think in response to Mr. Modi's question, you mentioned that you held your trade spend flat for the year. It's our understanding that some of your competitors did not do the same, but they actually pulled back on some trade and pulled back on some merchandising activity, suggesting that you likely gain share of trade spend, share of merchandising, share of activity in marketplace. A, is that understanding well placed or misplaced? And if it is sort of the reality of what happened last year, any indication that some of those folks who pulled back may be leaning back in?"

Again, one of the areas we were a little bit cautious on was projects last year and with COVID and pressure on resources. We had to reprioritize some things last year. And the net effect of that was a little bit less CapEx than and that CapEx pushing into '21. And for the main project, they're 2 of the biggest, ERP being one and work on supply chain. The total project cost didn't change. And so it shifted more into '21, and therefore, you can imagine some shifted into '22 as well. And so -- but this year is unusually high. I think we're going to see elevated CapEx sort of above our long-term algorithm, probably through '23, '24. And we're going to talk a little bit more about that in CAGNY in a few weeks, we'll give some more color on capital and where it's headed. But I would expect an elevated level for the next couple of years before we get back down to what's inside of our algorithm."

So when we think about packaging innovation, we think about pack types, which are designed to meet specific consumer occasions. So this is -- for me, I would encompass it as part of kind of price pack architecture, which is as we look to capture incremental consumer occasions, how do we have certain packs that enable that. So that there's a value to the consumer that our products now better meet an occasion or a need. If you go back and look at -- we went through a laydown to standup bags, not only was it easier to shop on-shelf but it was also, once it got into the home, in the pantry, much easier to use, much easier to see, less messy, those types of things. 
We will look at pack configurations in terms of size, like is there a smaller size that is used for certain occasions or certain demographics versus a larger pack. And we'll do that on a brand-by-brand basis. So I would say that our pipeline is largely kind of focused on what we would say price pack architecture.

But then also saying kind of given those discussions with retailers, the expectation is that kind of that bar business would come back. So just asking kind of broadly speaking, as you looked at that bar category relative to protein shake powders. Are those conversations with retailers like fairly pointed such that they are suggesting, oh, this is what we're doing for this period of time, but as we get through, let's say, Q2 or what have you, we would look to reallocate back to certain brands and certain bars. Or is this kind of more of a -- yes, it's going to probably come back, let's kind of wait and see how everything develops.

So I would say it's less -- we have a definitive time line. And we are focused on, one, on how we make sure that we've got the right support behind the brands and the right innovation relative to Minis, which we think is a big idea and also plant-based, which are on trend.

Where you're talking about more -- a little bit more sugar free, potentially, right? Obviously, there's ESG angle, you've got some plant-based innovation, maybe more on the bar side. You've mentioned before touching potentially increasingly into baked snacks. So I guess, Michele, the question is, as you step back, right? It seems like Hershey continues to evolve, right, and more of a broader snacking business, obviously, outside of the core chocolate confection. So as we get through '21 and we think about '22, like very simplistically, would you argue that the point here is to kind of get Hershey bigger in the store in a bunch of different areas, such that you are increasing overall distribution points on the go forward for broader Hershey? Or do you feel like as you step back to the whole company, yes, obviously, you're looking for increased distribution, but maybe there's a little bit of infill on a SKU, maybe on sugar free and maybe you take one out in Kisses.

All of that and say, how could we leverage that to capture more and more incremental consumer occasions. And so I think that's where you see us with a targeted focus on, okay, something like better-for-you should capture an incremental occasion and incremental consumer. So I don't think about that as kind of more incremental. And then if I look at labor variety on the core, to me, that's a little bit more where we rotate in, we rotate out. We have one slot for that, but it's not a permanent incremental. Some of our expansion into other categories, i.e., better-for-you and savory. Yes, I look at those as gaining incremental distribution points more broadly in the store by meeting incremental consumer occasions. So I think incremental occasion is important for us, leveraging the capabilities and then importantly, making sure that we do a very measured expansion. We want to focus on confection, add an area and then really play to win there. And make sure we don't spread ourselves too thin. Similarly, to what I would say we're doing international, where we've focused the last set of markets that we've prioritized that we really want to play the wind as opposed to spreading ourselves to strength."

We are proud to be an important part of comfort and connection in people's lives. Our portfolio of beloved brands remains extremely relevant with consumers, and our dedicated team, advantaged capabilities and operational excellence allowed us to create many moments of goodness for them during these unprecedented times. 
I want to thank all of our employees across the globe for making this possible by continuing to bring passion, focus and hard work each and every day. We had a strong finish to the year with fourth quarter reported net sales growth of plus 5.7% and adjusted EPS growth of plus 16.4%. and U.S. confectionery share gains of almost 160 basis points. 
Despite significant pressures in select parts of our business, we delivered an on algorithm year in 2020, with reported net sales growth of 2% and adjusted EPS growth of almost 9%. As we enter a new year, our priorities remain to help ensure the health and safety of our employees, deliver on the needs of our consumers, customers and communities and advance key initiatives to secure our future and deliver long-term sustainable shareholder value. We have good momentum heading into 2021. While we anticipate continued volatility in 2021, we have good visibility into a strong start to the year. And we believe we will deliver another year of balanced sales and earnings growth in 2021. 
In 2020, we adapted our operating models to prioritize the safety of our employees, execute with excellence and work with agility to respond to rapidly changing consumer needs. We elevated our social impact and company culture by enhancing community support in a time of need and accelerating our efforts to become an even more inclusive company.
In 2021, we will leverage many of these enhanced models to further optimize speed, agility and our employee experience. We will focus on maintaining our confectionary momentum by retaining new consumer rituals created during COVID-19, while also working to recapture occasions lost due to social distancing and limited mobility.
We will continue to focus on both portfolio and geographic diversification as we build out our better-for-you snacks business and implement new strategies in our international business for sustainable, profitable growth.
We will continue to invest in our capabilities to remain competitively advantaged to pivot as quickly as the environment and consumers' behaviors change, and build on our operational excellence. And finally, we will advance our ESG agenda and further embed and integrated across our organization to increase our impact and support the long-term sustainability of our business.
Let me discuss the core confectionery business in a little more detail. As we shared last year, COVID-19 has had a positive impact on certain confectionery products and channels while having a negative impact on others. Despite changes to what and where consumers are eating, we have seen our category and our trusted brands remain important, particularly when it comes to celebrating seasons and spending time at home with family.
We believe we have a strong and balanced plan to meet consumers' needs as they change throughout the year. It all starts with robust investment behind our brands. While 2020 advertising spend was relatively flat in North America due to marketplace media efficiencies and reduced support for brands negatively impacted by COVID-19, 2021 investment is planned to outpace sales growth as we look to maintain our strong 2020 share gains.
We plan to support a record number of brands, and we'll continue to leverage our advantaged capabilities to adjust messages, channels and impressions as needed. We also have a great lineup of innovation planned for 2021. Our recent stuff with pretzels and Kit Kat Moca items are already in market, and they provide new textures and flavors for some of our best-selling brands. This spring, we are excited to expand our better-for-you confectionery platform with the launch of Kit Kat thins and our Zero sugar and organic lines. Our sugar-free platform has been performing very well, and we believe this will enable us to reach more households and provide consumers with more great-tasting ways to enjoy their favorite Hershey brands. 
And while the organic chocolate market is small, it is growing rapidly, and we are excited to bring consumers great-tasting organic versions of Reese's and Hershey's through this targeted launch. Seasons will remain an important driver of our business in 2021. 2020 proved how important seasonal celebrations and rituals are to consumers. How creative they are at finding new ways to enjoy them in a safe way and how important our category and brands are to these celebrations.
We continue to leverage our strong consumer insights and deep category expertise to provide consumers with the right products and inspiration to celebrate the holidays in November and December. Our strong execution and tailored media helped drive sales increases across key occasions from decorating to baking, de-stocking stuffers and gifts. Hershey holiday retail sales grew 4.8% versus category growth of 0.7%, resulting in a seasonal market share gain of 117 basis points. 
We expect our strong portfolio of brands and advantaged supply chain execution will enable us to keep this momentum going for Valentine's Day and Easter. Easter is our second largest season, and we began shipping in late December. In 2021, Easter is one week earlier than last year, which has historically resulted in slightly lower category sales.
Easter is a family-centered holiday rooted and strong at-home traditions. With 5 of the 7 core occasions occurring at home from baking to filling baskets. These occasions performed well last year during the onset of the pandemic and we believe they will perform well again this year as consumers are even better equipped to celebrate and shop safely.
Given our strong portfolio and execution, we expect to outperform the category for the season. For both seasons and our everyday business, we will continue to execute an omnichannel strategy to optimize the consumer experience, inspire new ideas and maximize investment. Our e-commerce net sales now represent approximately 5% of our company sales after more than doubling in 2020. We expect another quarter of strong growth in Q1 before trends stabilize in Q2 as we begin lapping last year's significant increases. Finally, let me touch on pricing. We remain committed to our strategy of smaller, more frequent pricing actions to respond to changes we are seeing in the marketplace and enable strong business reinvestment. We recently communicated updated seasonal pricing to our retailers, impacting approximately 10% of company sales, beginning with our Holiday 2021 program.
As we've shared before, these items have not been priced since 2014 to 2015. We expect the changes to flow through in Q4 of this year and Q1 of 2022. Now let me provide an update on our snacking portfolio. Kidney pump had a strong year, with retail sales growth of 10.8% in measured channels, maintaining its #2 ready-to-eat popcorn share of 19.5%.
Pirate's Booty also grew in 2020, with retail sales growth of almost 4% in traditional channels. Both brands have new campaigns in 2021, and we'll continue to focus on core brand velocities and distribution growth. Our ONE nutrition bar business had a difficult year in 2020 as category trends were significantly impacted by COVID-19.
While overall retail sales declined approximately 5% for the year, the brand gained approximately 20 basis points of market share. As we progress through 2020, some retailers began to ship space from the on-the-go nutrition bars to in-home, ready-to-drink protein and powders to align with COVID-19 trends.
Based on discussions with retailers, we believe these trends are temporary, and we expect bars to recover as consumer mobility increases. The team is continuing to focus on supporting top SKUs and smart innovation in mini bars and plant-based bars so that we are well positioned to grow as trends reverse. 
In our international markets, performance remains challenged as COVID-19 restrictions and economic difficulties are negatively impacting the category. Hershey has outperformed the category, with chocolate share gains in all key markets for the year. As I mentioned earlier, we are implementing new strategies in our international markets that we believe are important for our long-term financial objectives.
Specifically, in Q4, we made the decision to evolve our go-to-market model in China. As many of you know, over the past several years, we have focused on optimizing our business model to prioritize our chocolate brands, moderning and e-commerce channels and to improve profitability.
As we have done this, we have continued to evaluate our operations and the best way we can provide consumers the products they love in the most efficient and effective way. As a result, we have decided to rely more heavily on utilizing best-in-class local distributors in China to make our products available to Chinese consumers. 
This transition will take place after Chinese New Year. While we will remain in many retail outlets in China going forward, we do anticipate sales declines in 2021 as we make the transition. While sales are expected to decline, we do expect stronger profitability from a more efficient operating model, and we believe we can return to sales growth in China in 2022.
Excluding China, we have seen stabilization across markets and expect to grow in 2021. India had a strong finish to the year with fourth quarter reported sales growth of 20%, and we plan to continue expanding distribution to drive additional growth in 2021. 
In Brazil, results were hampered by FX. However, organic constant currency growth was 4.8% in the fourth quarter. And in Mexico, despite a challenging retail environment due to COVID and new packaging requirements, organic constant currency sales declines improved versus Q3.
We will continue to adapt our business models and investments to respond to the changes we are seeing in consumer behavior and remain optimistic about the long-term opportunity in these markets. With that, let me now turn it over to Steve to provide more details of our 2020 financial results and expectations for 2021."

I want to build on Michelle's comments and also convey how proud I am of the way our teams work together safely and with integrity to deliver moments of goodness for our consumers, customers, suppliers, communities, shareholders and each other. Our fourth quarter results speak not only to the strength of our brands and our execution, but also the passion and dedication of our teams across the globe. In the fourth quarter, we delivered accelerated reported net sales growth of 5.7%, reflecting continued momentum in our North American confectionery business.
North America reported a net sales increase of 8.9% in Q4, driven primarily by volume. This strong performance was ahead of expectations due to our seasonal business as well as better-than-anticipated performance within our food service, vending, concession and specialty retail business. Within our seasonal business, strong sell-through resulted in fewer markdowns and less cannibalization on our everyday business. And we were able to capitalize on marketplace supply chain challenges to capture incremental orders for the holiday season. 
In addition, several key retailers requested earlier shipments of Valentine's and Easter products to ensure they had adequate supply. While these orders shifted from Q1 2021 into Q4 of 2020, we do not expect a material impact on Q1 sales as this shift was offset by additional order strength on Valentine's and Easter. Within our nonmeasured channels, we saw a noticeable improvement in trends versus Q3, while sales declined in the high single digits, inventory replenishment contributed to our better-than-anticipated performance.
Given that and the recent spike in COVID-19 cases and associated lockdown measures, Q1 performance in these channels may be lower than what we saw in Q4. Within our International and Other segment, reported net sales declined 17.3% in the fourth quarter. FX was a 420 basis point headwind. While sales grew in India and in our export business, we saw continued COVID-19-related pressures in Mexico, Brazil, world Travel Retail and our chocolate world locations. These results were relatively in line with expectations.
In China, while category sales remained soft, the majority of our net sales decline was driven by the change in the go-to-market model, Michele mentioned earlier. Given the seasonally heavy period for the Chinese New Year, the team took a prudent approach to managing orders, inventory and waste ahead of the transition to minimize risk in Q1.
Overall, we are pleased by the strength of our core business and our meaningful category share gains across segments of markets. This strong sales performance to close the year helped drive margin expansion and business reinvestment and resulted in another quarter of double-digit EPS growth. Q4 adjusted EPS was $1.49, a 16.4% increase versus prior year.
Adjusted gross margin expanded 50 basis points in the fourth quarter to 43.9%, led by our North America segment. In North America, gross margins expanded 120 basis points to 45.9%, as pricing, productivity and fixed cost absorption were able to more than offset inflation.
Gross margins in our International and Other segment remained pressured due to sales declines across most of our key markets. Recall, Q4 is normally our lowest margin quarter in the international and other segment due to seasonally-driven market and portfolio mix. As a result, sales declines had an even greater impact on gross margins than what we saw in the third quarter despite comparable net sales declines. This strong sales and margin performance enabled robust business reinvestment in the fourth quarter to ensure strong seasonal sell-through to sustain our everyday U.S. momentum into 2021. In North America, advertising and related consumer marketing spend increased 9.9%, driven by increased investment on our core brands, seasonal products and our e-commerce business.
This increase was consistent with our expectation to grow advertising roughly in line with sales. In our international and other segment, we continue to take a disciplined approach to cost management to minimize the profit loss from volume declines in the segment.
As a result, advertising and related consumer marketing spend in this segment declined 21.8% in the fourth quarter. Divisional and corporate expenses were relatively in line with prior year as reduced travel and meeting costs were offset by increased capability and community investments. Given higher-than-expected sales and profit in the fourth quarter, incentive compensation came in higher than our previous estimates, but was slightly favorable versus prior year.
Fourth quarter adjusted operating profit of $429 million resulted in an adjusted operating profit margin of 19.6%, an increase of 170 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2019. Sales growth and gross margin gains in North America more than offset increased marketing expenses and profit declines in our International and Other segment. 
The adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was negative 8.1%, a decline of almost 18 points versus the year ago period. Due to unique COVID-19 issues in 2020, many tax credit projects experienced delays over the course of the year, resulting in more projects being completed in the fourth quarter than normal. This, in turn, drove a substantial increase in our other expense line for the fourth quarter and a very low tax rate for the quarter. 
Overall, the net impact of these 2 line items was relatively in line with our previous estimate. Fourth quarter Other expense was $104 million, an increase of $69 million versus the prior year period. We remain committed to our capital allocation priorities, reinvestment for growth, dividends and share repurchases with appropriate leverage. In the fourth quarter, total capital additions, including software, were approximately $150 million, bringing the full year investment to $442 million.
This is below our original plan expectations, driven primarily by the delays in our supply chain and ERP projects that we spoke about earlier in the year. Overall cost estimates for these projects remain in line with original estimates. And therefore, we expect 2021 and 2022 CapEx to remain elevated as we complete these strategic programs. 
Now to dividends and share repurchases. In the fourth quarter, we paid $163 million in cash dividends. We did not complete any repurchases related to stock option replenishment nor did we repurchase any shares against the $500 million authorization. Approximately $260 million remain available under this repurchase program. While we took a conservative approach to share buybacks in 2020 due to COVID-19, our business and P&L resiliency give us confidence to return to a more traditional buyback strategy in 2021.
We are in a strong cash position exiting the year with balance sheet flexibility to continue investing in our business, pay our dividend and advance our M&A agenda. Now let me share some perspective around our expectations for 2021. As Michele mentioned, we expect volatility to continue in 2021. However, we have good visibility into the first quarter and are confident we can deliver another year of balanced sales and earnings growth in 2021. 
From a top line perspective, we believe many of the trends we saw in Q3 and Q4 will continue into the first quarter of 2021. In U.S., we have good visibility into seasonal orders and expect continued strong take-home chocolate sales and share gains. 
As we move through the year, our performance will be impacted by the progression of COVID-19 cases and the vaccine rollout as well as potential changes to competitive dynamics. For the full year, we do not expect material changes in innovation promotion or inventory levels. We do, however, expect inventory to be a tailwind in the first half of the year and a headwind in the second half. 
As we shared on our last call, we expect volume to be a larger contributor of overall growth in 2021 compared to the past 2 years as we lap pricing elasticity and continue to gain share. 
In January, we communicated price pack architecture changes on part of our seasonal portfolio that will result in approximately 50 basis points of price realization for the year, primarily to be realized in the fourth quarter.
Within our international and other segment, we expect trends in most markets to be similar to Q3 and Q4 2020 until we begin lapping COVID-19 declines in the second quarter. While we do not expect sales trends to worsen, the magnitude and pace of recovery as we move through the year remains uncertain.
In China, the changes to our go-to-market model to enhance profitability are expected to have a slight negative impact on overall company sales growth. From a gross margin perspective, we expect modest expansion this year, driven by productivity, fixed cost absorption, the lapping of incremental COVID-19 incentive costs for 2020 and our operating model change in China. While spot market prices for some inputs, including raw materials and freight have risen recently, our proactive approach and robust hedging program enable us to minimize the impact on our P&L this year.
Let me take a minute to discuss cocoa in a bit more detail, given some of the more significant changes the market is experiencing this year. First, as we have shared before, we are fully participating in the living income differential for our ongoing and substantial purchases from the 2020 and 2021 CÃ´te D'ivoire and Ghana crops. This is one of many factors impacting our overall costs. Another key component is supply and demand, not only of overall cocoa beans, but also of key cocoa derivatives, including liquor, butter and powder. 
Hershey's, like many manufacturers, relies primarily on cocoa liquor and butter to manufacture chocolate. As many of you know, COVID-19 has pressured global demand for chocolate, while supply has stayed the same in many markets and increased in others. This has created temporary market opportunities throughout the year and led to declining cocoa butter prices, which softened the impact of the increased investment associated with the living income differential this year. 
We expect advertising investment to grow ahead of sales as we lap marketplace efficiencies from 2020, invest to maintain new rentals consumers adopted during COVID-19 and support our strong share gains. 
Overall, divisional and corporate expenses are expected to grow in line with sales as incentive compensation favorability is offset by capability investments and a return of some travel and meeting expenses in the second half of the year.
We expect our full year 2021 adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 15% as we plan to continue investing in tax credits. Full year other expense, which includes our spend on those tax credits, is estimated to be approximately $125 million to $135 million. Finally, interest expense is expected to be roughly $130 million in 2021. This is approximately $20 million favorable versus 2020 and driven by planned bond repayments in both February and May.
Our capital allocation priorities remain the same, and we will continue to invest heavily behind key initiatives in 2021, including our ERP transformation and supply chain initiatives focused on increasing capacity and agility. We expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately $550 million. We look forward to sharing more details on our long-term financial objectives and capital allocation priorities at CAGNY in a few weeks. With that, I'll turn it back to Michelle for closing remarks."

We are proud to be an important part of comfort and connection in people's lives. Our portfolio of beloved brands remains extremely relevant with consumers, and our dedicated team, advantaged capabilities and operational excellence allowed us to create many moments of goodness for them during these unprecedented times. 
I want to thank all of our employees across the globe for making this possible by continuing to bring passion, focus and hard work each and every day. We had a strong finish to the year with fourth quarter reported net sales growth of plus 5.7% and adjusted EPS growth of plus 16.4%, and U.S. confectionery share gains of almost 160 basis points. 
Despite significant pressures in select parts of our business, we delivered an on-algorithm year in 2020, with reported net sales growth of 2% and adjusted EPS growth of almost 9%. As we enter a new year, our priorities remain to help ensure the health and safety of our employees, deliver on the needs of our consumers, customers and communities and advance key initiatives to secure our future and deliver long-term sustainable shareholder value. We have good momentum heading into 2021. While we anticipate continued volatility in 2021, we have good visibility into a strong start to the year. And we believe we will deliver another year of balanced sales and earnings growth in 2021. 
In 2020, we adapted our operating models to prioritize the safety of our employees, execute with excellence and work with agility to respond to rapidly changing consumer needs. We elevated our social impact and company culture by enhancing community support in a time of need and accelerating our efforts to become an even more inclusive company.
In 2021, we will leverage many of these enhanced models to further optimize speed, agility and our employee experience. We will focus on maintaining our confectionary momentum by retaining new consumer rituals created during COVID-19, while also working to recapture occasions lost due to social distancing and limited mobility.
We will continue to focus on both portfolio and geographic diversification as we build out our better-for-you snacks business and implement new strategies in our international business for sustainable, profitable growth.
We will continue to invest in our capabilities to remain competitively advantaged to pivot as quickly as the environment and consumers' behaviors change and build on our operational excellence. And finally, we will advance our ESG agenda and further embed and integrate it across our organization to increase our impact and support the long-term sustainability of our business.
Let me discuss the core confectionery business in a little more detail. As we shared last year, COVID-19 has had a positive impact on certain confectionery products and channels while having a negative impact on others. Despite changes to what and where consumers are eating, we have seen our category and our trusted brands remain important, particularly when it comes to celebrating seasons and spending time at home with family.
We believe we have a strong and balanced plan to meet consumers' needs as they change throughout the year. It all starts with robust investment behind our brands. While 2020 advertising spend was relatively flat in North America due to marketplace media efficiencies and reduced support for brands negatively impacted by COVID-19, 2021 investment is planned to outpace sales growth as we look to maintain our strong 2020 share gains.
We plan to support a record number of brands, and we'll continue to leverage our advantaged capabilities to adjust messages, channels and impressions as needed. We also have a great lineup of innovation planned for 2021. Our Reese's Stuffed with Pretzels and Kit Kat Mocha items are already in market, and they provide new textures and flavors for some of our best-selling brands. This spring, we are excited to expand our better-for-you confectionery platform with the launch of Kit Kat Thins and our Zero Sugar and organic lines. Our sugar-free platform has been performing very well, and we believe this will enable us to reach more households and provide consumers with more great-tasting ways to enjoy their favorite Hershey brands. And while the organic chocolate market is small, it is growing rapidly, and we are excited to bring consumers great-tasting organic versions of Reese's and Hershey's through this targeted launch. 
Seasons will remain an important driver of our business in 2021. 2020 proved how important seasonal celebrations and rituals are to consumers, how creative they are at finding new ways to enjoy them in a safe way and how important our category and brands are to these celebrations. We continue to leverage our strong consumer insights and deep category expertise to provide consumers with the right products and inspiration to celebrate the holidays in November and December. Our strong execution and tailored media helped drive sales increases across key occasions from decorating to baking, to stocking stuffers and gifts. Hershey holiday retail sales grew 4.8% versus category growth of 0.7%, resulting in a seasonal market share gain of 117 basis points. 
We expect our strong portfolio of brands and advantaged supply chain execution will enable us to keep this momentum going for Valentine's Day and Easter. Easter is our second largest season, and we began shipping in late December. In 2021, Easter is 1 week earlier than last year, which has historically resulted in slightly lower category sales.
Easter is a family-centered holiday rooted in strong at-home traditions with 5 of the 7 core occasions occurring at home from baking to filling baskets. These occasions performed well last year during the onset of the pandemic and we believe they will perform well again this year as consumers are even better equipped to celebrate and shop safely.
Given our strong portfolio and execution, we expect to outperform the category for the season. For both seasons and our everyday business, we will continue to execute an omnichannel strategy to optimize the consumer experience, inspire new ideas and maximize investment. Our e-commerce net sales now represent approximately 5% of our company sales after more than doubling in 2020. We expect another quarter of strong growth in Q1 before trends stabilize in Q2 as we begin lapping last year's significant increases. 
Finally, let me touch on pricing. We remain committed to our strategy of smaller, more frequent pricing actions to respond to changes we are seeing in the marketplace and enable strong business reinvestment. We recently communicated updated seasonal pricing to our retailers, impacting approximately 10% of company sales, beginning with our Holiday 2021 program. As we've shared before, these items have not been priced since 2014 to 2015. We expect the changes to flow through in Q4 of this year and Q1 of 2022. 
Now let me provide an update on our snacking portfolio. Skinny Pop had a strong year with retail sales growth of 10.8% in measured channels, maintaining its #2 ready-to-eat popcorn share of 19.5%. Pirate's Booty also grew in 2020 with retail sales growth of almost 4% in traditional channels. Both brands have new campaigns in 2021 and will continue to focus on core brand velocities and distribution growth. 
Our ONE nutrition bar business had a difficult year in 2020 as category trends were significantly impacted by COVID-19. While overall retail sales declined approximately 5% for the year, the brand gained approximately 20 basis points of market share. As we progress through 2020, some retailers began to ship space from the on-the-go nutrition bars to in-home, ready-to-drink protein and powders to align with COVID-19 trends.

While we took a conservative approach to share buybacks in 2020 due to COVID-19, our business and P&L resiliency give us confidence to return to a more traditional buyback strategy in 2021.
We are in a strong cash position exiting the year with balance sheet flexibility to continue investing in our business, pay our dividend and advance our M&A agenda. 
Now let me share some perspective around our expectations for 2021. As Michele mentioned, we expect volatility to continue in 2021. However, we have good visibility into the first quarter and are confident we can deliver another year of balanced sales and earnings growth in 2021. From a top line perspective, we believe many of the trends we saw in Q3 and Q4 will continue into the first quarter of 2021. 
In the U.S., we have good visibility into seasonal orders and expect continued strong take-home chocolate sales and share gains. 
As we move through the year, our performance will be impacted by the progression of COVID-19 cases and the vaccine rollout as well as potential changes to competitive dynamics. For the full year, we do not expect material changes in innovation, promotion or inventory levels. We do, however, expect inventory to be a tailwind in the first half of the year and a headwind in the second half. 
As we shared on our last call, we expect volume to be a larger contributor of overall growth in 2021 compared to the past 2 years as we lap pricing elasticity and continue to gain share. In January, we communicated price pack architecture changes on part of our seasonal portfolio that will result in approximately 50 basis points of price realization for the year primarily to be realized in the fourth quarter.
Within our International and Other segment, we expect trends in most markets to be similar to Q3 and Q4 2020 until we begin lapping COVID-19 declines in the second quarter. While we do not expect sales trends to worsen, the magnitude and pace of recovery as we move through the year remains uncertain.
In China, the changes to our go-to-market model to enhance profitability are expected to have a slight negative impact on overall company sales growth. 
From a gross margin perspective, we expect modest expansion this year driven by productivity, fixed cost absorption, the lapping of incremental COVID-19 incentive costs for 2020 and our operating model change in China. While spot market prices for some inputs, including raw materials and freight have risen recently, our proactive approach and robust hedging program enable us to minimize the impact on our P&L this year.
Let me take a minute to discuss cocoa in a bit more detail given some of the more significant changes the market is experiencing this year. First, as we have shared before, we are fully participating in the living income differential for our ongoing and substantial purchases from the 2020 and 2021 Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana crops. This is one of many factors impacting our overall costs. Another key component is supply and demand, not only of overall cocoa beans, but also of key cocoa derivatives, including liquor, butter and powder. 
Hershey, like many manufacturers, relies primarily on cocoa liquor and butter to manufacture chocolate. As many of you know, COVID-19 has pressured global demand for chocolate, while supply has stayed the same in many markets and increased in others. This has created temporary market opportunities throughout the year and led to declining cocoa butter prices, which softened the impact of the increased investment associated with the living income differential this year. 
We expect advertising investment to grow ahead of sales as we lap marketplace efficiencies from 2020, invest to maintain new rituals consumers adopted during COVID-19 and support our strong share gains. 
Overall, divisional and corporate expenses are expected to grow in line with sales as incentive compensation favorability is offset by capability investments and a return of some travel and meeting expenses in the second half of the year.
We expect our full year 2021 adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 15% as we plan to continue investing in tax credits. Full year other expense, which includes our spend on those tax credits, is estimated to be approximately $125 million to $135 million. Finally, interest expense is expected to be roughly $130 million in 2021. This is approximately $20 million favorable versus 2020 and driven by planned bond repayments in both February and May.
Our capital allocation priorities remain the same, and we will continue to invest heavily behind key initiatives in 2021, including our ERP transformation and supply chain initiatives focused on increasing capacity and agility. We expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately $550 million. We look forward to sharing more details on our long-term financial objectives and capital allocation priorities at CAGNY in a few weeks. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Michele for closing remarks."

First on just trade spend and just thinking about, obviously, things have been pulled back quite dramatically in 2020. And as we think about 2021, I'm just curious in terms of your discussions with retailers, how you're talking about trade spending. One of the things that we've been looking at is kind of this reset of price sensitivity, given that no promotions have effectively been in the market for the past 9 to 10 months. So just wanted to get your thoughts on that. And then the other question is just if you can give us a kind of a roundup of the innovation program that has already been announced just so we can get a sense for the program in 2021."

Our levels for the year were pretty consistent with prior year. So we were basically flat. The IRI data will support that. So I think there's a little bit of a disconnect in the Nielsen data. So we don't really expect any material changes as we go into next year as well. 
And then as you look at innovation, certainly, I think some of the bigger items we have, Kit Kat flavor, which has done exceptionally well for Kit Kat on a global basis. We have to stuffed Reese's products and our Reese innovation tends to also always be quite strong for us. We have a permissible line of products to really address that benefit of better-for-you that we are underdeveloped in across our portfolio, and that will include Kit Kat THiNS, which is an addition to what has been an already launch of a successful platform with Reese THiNS. We are also relaunching our sugar-free line to zero sugar, really focusing on Hershey and Reese and launching Hershey and Reese organic product. 
So those are the highlights for the year. And I would say, overall, if you look at our innovation, the level of innovation is about comparable to prior year."

And I think if I take freight as an example, we look at things like demand planning and how important that is. And to the extent our plans deviate from the way volume comes in and having to go to the spot market, for example, where we have less cover, there's some risk there. So net-net, more inflation. We've got a pretty good level of cover, and that's included inside of our guidance, but we're not fully covered either on the commodities side or outside the commodities."

So on the media side, I'll say media and SG&A, in general, we're probably looking at something like mid-single digits across those pieces. On the media side, clearly, we want to defend and extend our share gains. And so we were thoughtful in how we deployed media last year. We made some reductions kind of midyear, we actually turned it up a little bit towards the end of the year. And we want to make sure as we go into this year that we've got enough to defend and extend share. 
On the SG&A side, we kind of think about it in 2 buckets. And I'll say things like normal corporate expense, travel will be very tight year-over-year. And there, we use 0-based budgeting format, watch headcount, all of that. And then we talk about the investment side. And the investment side, we do have some capabilities that we want to continue to fortify, S-4, the ERP program, drive some OpEx through the SG&A areas, more expansion of our digital capabilities, which came into play quite a bit over the course of last year, and then the analytics and insights. But again, we talked a lot about that last year as well but continuing to extend our capabilities in those spaces. 
And so could it flex up or down?

So I think where share gains really are, as you mentioned, the factor of many different components coming together. First of all, we do have incredibly strong brands and very strong operating capabilities and executional capabilities. I think as I look at year, we've got a broad portfolio, and we are able then to leverage that portfolio and pivot as needed to whatever occasions as resonating most with consumers and families right now. 
So certainly, this past year, there were a lot of those at-home occasions, things like S'mores, where people were staying home, being with their family at home in a smaller environment, doing movie nights, products like Twizzlers. And seasons were -- turned out to be incredibly important for consumers during this very difficult time where they wanted to cling to as much normalcy as possible, and the seasons are really about traditions and rituals and connections with family and close friends. 
As you mentioned, we also made strong investments over the past several years in a lot of capabilities that allowed us to understand consumers, improved our ability to forecast where consumers were going to go and then really execute well in our supply chain, apply data and analytics to our sales and retail coverage, data and analytics to our media in ways that we believe some others can't. 
Early on, we had discussed with all of you that we made that decision to lean in and capture opportunities as much as possible during COVID, take the opportunity to create new occasions for consumers and really partner with our retailers to make sure we were there for them when they needed us with our retail sales folks in-store stocking shelves and meeting their product needs when some others couldn't. So clearly, all of those things together were really important for us.
Now as we look at that, I would say we are, in the past, typically might gain 10, 20 basis points of share in a year. Obviously, this year, 160 basis points of share and 130 on our chocolate business, where we already have a 45% market share, so as we look into 2021, we believe that the share growth will continue prior to the last, which is really basically up to Easter. And post Easter, we believe that the share will moderate as we lap those 20 gains, but it's going to be our goal to profitably sustain as much of the share as we can going forward."

I mean, it is difficult in a year like this past year to precisely pinpoint exact amount to any one factor just because there was so much going on.

Frankly, though, we also believe how we pivoted our portfolio and really shifted spending and shifted focus to -- on our portfolio to the exact right items that consumers were looking for, the role that we were able to focus on with seasons and how much that resonated with consumers during that time. 
So it is -- it's difficult to pinpoint. There were opportunities for products on shelf. And so I guess I would say I think it's fair to say some of that was probably short-term benefit, and then there are other components that have somewhat of a longer-lasting effect. So for example, if you do well in a season in 1 year and your sell-through is quite strong, typically, the buy that you get from retailers the next year tends to be pretty strong as well. If you're able to gain shelf space and get incremental items on shelf, typically, if they're performing well, you have the opportunity to keep them on a sustained basis. So while some of the benefits, I think, are short term, others will have that enduring effect."

I'm wondering at this point, after many years of declining, not just for Hershey, but for the industry, ad spend has come down as efficiency was more of the focus. Do you think that you can get to a point where you can get a flywheel going where you spend as much or maybe even lean in on advertising as a percentage of sales as you get a better sense of the returns on these types of spendings?"

I mean, our approach on media spend is, this is a category and we have brands that are incredibly responsive to media. And if you look at ROIs on media being driven by scale, profit margin and lift/responsiveness, we win on all 3 of those. So we are one of the highest spenders on advertising as a percent of net sales within the industry, and we really believe in that. At the same time, we challenge ourselves constantly to get more from our money. And so over the years, we have transitioned from 100% television advertising probably 12 years ago to we are now down to probably 40%. I think about 60%, 65% of our spending is digital.
Now the other factor that kind of plays in, in addition to being more efficient through digital, which has enabled us to do a lot of very targeted things, such as targeting media based on how sell-through is during the season or targeting ZIP codes, et cetera, you have the other factors going on, which is media, the cost of media in the marketplace and inflation and kind of playing through that.
If you think about 2020, our spending was down a little bit because we pulled back on some parts of the portfolio that we thought just weren't relevant like refreshment this year. And so part of our increase is restoring some spend levels in some of those areas. And that's part of what's driving up some of our spending as well."

In Brazil, constant currency sales were good. They were double digits, but FX has been a challenge. Mexico really is the market that's contended -- or has tended to have continued COVID pressure, where the category sales have remained soft, even though that they are improving.

As we look to '21 and plan this year, we're expecting share repurchase to revert to a more normal level. And again, our goal is not to warehouse cash at the end of the day. We want to deploy it for profitable growth. And share repurchase becomes one lever in creating some good constructive tension in that equation."

So you remember, last year, we started targeting $450 million to $500 million for CapEx. Again, one of the areas we were a little bit cautious on was projects last year; and with COVID and pressure on resources, we had to reprioritize some things last year. And the net effect of that was a little bit less CapEx in '20 and that CapEx pushing into '21. And for the main project, they're 2 of the biggest, ERP being one and work on supply chain. The total project cost didn't change. And so it shifted more into '21, and therefore, you can imagine some shifted into '22 as well. 
And so -- but this year is unusually high. I think we're going to see elevated CapEx sort of above our long-term algorithm, probably through '23, '24. And we're going to talk a little bit more about that in CAGNY in a few weeks. We'll give some more color on capital and where it's headed. But I would expect an elevated level for the next couple of years before we get back down to what's inside of our algorithm."

So when we think about packaging innovation, we think about pack types, which are designed to meet specific consumer occasions. So this is -- for me, I would encompass it as part of kind of price pack architecture, which is, as we look to capture incremental consumer occasions, how do we have certain packs that enable that so that there's a value to the consumer that our products now better meet an occasion or a need.
If you go back and look at -- we went from laydown to standup bags, not only was it easier to shop on-shelf, but it was also, once it got into the home, in the pantry, much easier to use, much easier to see, less messy, those types of things. 
We will look at pack configurations in terms of size. Like is there a smaller size that is used for certain occasions or certain demographics versus a larger pack? And we'll do that on a brand-by-brand basis. So I would say that our pipeline is largely kind of focused on what we would say price pack architecture. And so as such, what we try and do from a strategic perspective is make sure that we are at least margin neutral. I mean, that would be our goal. If we can get price realization, obviously, that's the focus. But short of that, we want to be margin neutral."

I guess in the prepared remarks, you had mentioned the bar business, I guess naming one is the brand. And you stated that it seems like some maybe retailers shifted space to protein drinks and powders, right, through just to meet the COVID demand shift. But then also saying kind of given the discussions with retailers, the expectation is that kind of that bar business would come back.
So just asking kind of broadly speaking, as you looked at that bar category relative to protein shake powders, are those conversations with retailers like fairly pointed such that they are suggesting, oh, this is what we're doing for this period of time, but as we get through, let's say, Q2 or what have you, we would look to reallocate back to certain brands and certain bars. Or is this kind of more of a, yes, it's going to probably come back, let's kind of wait and see how everything develops? And that's kind of a question, I guess, for bars, but then also more holistically for the entire store."

And obviously, it will shift at different times with different retailers, too, based on who their consumers are. 
So I would say it's less -- we have a definitive time line. And we are focused on, one, on how we make sure that we've got the right support behind the brands and the right innovation relative to minis, which we think is a big idea and also plant-based, which are on trend. So that as the category does come back, we are well positioned to capture that."

Obviously, there's ESG angle. You've got some plant-based innovation maybe more on the bar side. You've mentioned before touching potentially increasingly into baked snacks. So I guess, Michele, the question is, as you step back, right, it seems like Hershey continues to evolve, right, and more of a broader snacking business, obviously, outside of the core chocolate confection. So as we get through '21 and we think about '22, like very simplistically, would you argue that the point here is to kind of get Hershey bigger in the store in a bunch of different areas such that you are increasing overall distribution points on the go forward for broader Hershey? Or do you feel like as you step back for the whole company, yes, obviously, you're looking for increased distribution, but maybe there's a little bit of infill on a SKU, maybe on sugar free and maybe you take one out in Kisses. So I'm just trying to right size kind of that increased distribution opportunity given all the different spaces that you're focused on. That's it."

It's our profit engine. We have tremendous strengths. It's growing. It's in consumer demand. And so we always start there. And then with that as the foundation, we really look across all the capabilities that we have as a company relative to consumer insights, to taste science, to ubiquitous distribution. All of that and say how could we leverage that to capture more and more incremental consumer occasions. And so I think that's where you see us with a targeted focus on, okay, something like better-for-you should capture an incremental occasion and incremental consumer. So I don't think about that as kind of more incremental. 
And then if I look at labor variety on the core, to me, that's a little bit more where we rotate in, we rotate out. We have one slot for that, but it's not a permanent incremental. Some of our expansion into other categories, i.e., better-for-you and savory, yes, I look at those as gaining incremental distribution points more broadly in the store by meeting incremental consumer occasions. 
So I think incremental occasion is important for us, leveraging the capabilities and then importantly, making sure that we do a very measured expansion. We want to focus on confection, add an area and then really play to win there and make sure we don't spread ourselves too thin, similarly to what I would say we're doing international, where we've focused the last set of markets that we've prioritized that we really want to play to win wind as opposed to spreading ourselves too thin."

And to what extent do you need like the incremental pricing to get that gross margin to turn the other way?

So yes, we are still calling for modest gross margin expansion on a full year basis. As you noted and we had in the remarks, there were some transitory impacts in the first quarter, some lapping from last year, some also cost in response to the higher volume. As we look forward for the rest of the year, some of the things that are strengths for us, the productivity gains, the additional volume, the pricing that you referenced, all of that will be part of building that gross margin. So far, for the first quarter and even as we look out for the year, I would say our inflation assumptions are largely tracking to what we had in plan, and the one exception that we noted was packaging. And I think that is one we'll watch. Our expectation is that inflation will moderate some as the year plays out, impacted a bit by weather in Texas for the first quarter. So that's one we're watching. 
And then in any carryforward of incremental cost to support the higher volume. And with more runway here in the balance of the year, we'll have more opportunities to optimize between customer service and manufacturing capacity and the cost of support. So we're keeping a close watch on all those. But yes, at this point, we still see some gross margin expansion over the course of the year."

And then the second question is just on -- given the online momentum that you've been seeing and the clear stickiness that we've seen, how are you thinking about the supply chain and kind of reorienting the supply chain to make sure that you can continue to effectively execute as the online business continues to grow?"

So that'",361,"So let me first go to the space question. As we started out for the year, we always have a focused plan, focused on balanced growth across all levers, driving base velocity, using media to accelerate growth, growth in seasons, distribution gains. So that's always a focus for us. And we are fortunate that we have been able, given the strength of our performance of our supply chain, particularly overall, but also during COVID and some of the needs of our customers to be able to provide some incremental SKUs that were very viable, that our customers were looking for, and we gained about 5 incremental SKUs for the year. And so certainly, with that comes some shelf space gains. So that's something we've been focused on. As we get that distribution and we get shelf space now, that certainly has some staying power as long as those SKUs perform, which we anticipate that they will. 
So we are continuing to be focused on that. And as we look throughout the year, believe, we feel pretty good about our ability to continue to drive distribution as well as shelf space gains. And certainly, that kind of coincides with some of the share gains that we have seen on the business have been driven by that. 
As we look at online momentum as it relates to our supply chain, we've talked before about Supply Chain 2.0, a big initiative that we have to really prepare our business and enable our manufacturing and supply chain for the future. And certainly, as we build that program and that initiative, one of the key legs that we were focused on was the agility to enable us to adapt to the changing retail environment and specifically, e-commerce being one of those areas because a lot of the packs sold in e-commerce are slightly different than those sold across the business. 
So some of those investments that we're making there enable us to more efficiently at a better margin, develop the right packs that enable us to win in e-commerce. So big focus in Supply Chain 2.0 against that and in all of our new capacity builds."

We're in a bit of a unique circumstance right now where Mars is moving one direction with a higher magnitude, and you're moving in a different direction with a much lower magnitude. And it strikes me is quite a unique moment in time where you guys are diverging. I guess I love a little more clarity to try to understand the motivation for you to go in a different direction?

So I continue to feel really good about this being a very rational category from a pricing perspective and there being strong discipline from that perspective. Our recent announcements regarding increasing price on seasons and also non chocolate and grocery are very consistent with the strategy we've been executing over the past couple of years of realizing price through different levers and on different parts of the portfolio. And we think that, that's proven effective for us to drive profitable growth and also be able to reinvest in the business, both for us and also for our retailers. But we do know that across competitors in the category, we each do have unique portfolios with different SKUs to our business across pack types and across brands, we have some different capabilities in terms of what we are good at executing and perhaps even different business needs at different points in time. And so while all the pricing isn't exactly pack-to-pack, exactly the same, what we think is important is while those tactics and products might differ, overall, category price realization is pretty consistent. And so if you look at us and you look at the largest player in the -- the second largest player in the category, the magnitude and difference in terms of what we each are getting from price is probably a point or in that range. So it's a significant -- it's not a significant difference between."

So relative to the away-from-home strength, I would say it is across the board. So first of all, we did see stronger foot traffic and consumer mobility in North America, and that was really, I believe, from the accelerated vaccine distribution as well as from the stimulus funds that were allocated and that not only drove strength in what we would call our core channels, kind of the more traditional channel, food, drug mass and even some pickup in convenience in Q1. It also had -- there was also a very strong positive impact on our non-measured channels as well. So food service, our own retail stores, world travel retail, some of those businesses that were really big decliners for us last year came back faster than we had anticipated. So I would say it was pretty much across the board in terms of all of those venues improving a bit more than we had anticipated. 
So some of it was due to the consumer traffic. And then, of course, we were able to also capture incremental distribution and merchandising in our U.S. confection business. And given the strong sell-through that we saw, driven by mobility and foot traffic, strong sell-through Easter then led to accelerated shipments of some of our summer programs, which also helped us across the board. And then even beyond North America, we actually saw increased mobility in the international markets as well, a bit more than we had expected. 
So with that, I think those were unplanned for us in Q1. We certainly had planned to see those mobility improvement later in the year and have that in our plan, but not in Q1. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve to talk a little bit about the quarters."

From a quarterly standpoint, as we look at Q2, building on what Michele said, we've got a lot of momentum on the top line coming into Q2. We're able to merchandise early some of the summer season, that will get us off to a to a strong start. As we go forward from there on the top line, you're going to see sales growth moderate. The last get tougher. You'll see pricing start to make a contribution more in the back half. And as Michele said, our plan assumed mobility would begin to recover as we got to the back half. So that's less of a new piece of the story as we turn the corner on the midyear. And then we'll see some margin improvement as the year progresses. 
You mentioned ad spending for Q2, it's going to be up pretty big. Year-over-year, that was -- the quarter last year where we made some adjustments, some pricing advantage because it was cheaper to buy and some pricing or some adjustments in how much we spent just in response to COVID. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color on the balance of the quarter."

So I would say we came into the year feeling really good about our strategies. And many of those we have laid out pre-COVID relative to really focused on we got to win at the top line with balanced growth, which is driving against distribution, the core innovation, seasons, pricing and volume growth. And I think what we're seeing on the business is that we are delivering on each of those elements. And so certainly, that is a piece that I think has staying power that some of the strategies we put in place relative to pre-COVID optimizing our balanced focus on the core and on innovation, not over rotating on innovation too much. Not over rotating on any [indiscernible]. There is some underlying strength there as well as a lot of the investments that we've made in our core capabilities in our manufacturing and our supply chain over the year that have enabled us to deliver perhaps at stronger levels than perhaps some others in the marketplace. 
And so some of that strength that we're seeing in terms of impact of media, those types of things, they're there without the COVID impact. We tend to always, as you know, strong category managers. So we do tend to do well when it comes to winning at retail. We have our proprietary retail sales force that enable us to do that. 
At the same time, I say, I guess, if I was going to parse out some places where some of the current dynamics may be a little bit more transitory. Certainly, we have on more distribution than, I would say it's probably at the historic level in terms of number of new items because of our strength in being able to operate in this environment and our agility, we have won some incremental merch associated with the competitive situation as well. 
So for me, I guess I kind of -- I narrow into probably those 2 factors being probably the biggest ones that are the most unique. And of course, the other one is that right now in Q1, you asked more about a couple of quarters, in Q1, in particular, we've kind of got that unique duality where we're seeing that we're benefiting both from away-from-home and from at-home behaviors, both being strong. And certainly, I think that, that can't sustain at the level that it did in Q1. So we do think that, that's going to moderate a bit.

Because it would seem as if kind of relative to what we're thinking about for North America, is that international piece does continue to play out. And obviously, given those compares are so much easier, it would seem as if the volume-driven year could actually be even more volume-driven off of that international piece as we progress through the year.

So that's great to see. And certainly, we did have a strong first quarter in international that was significantly ahead of our expectation. I think what was interesting for us was that despite this fact that COVID cases were high in many of those markets, consumer mobility still increased, and that drove demand for our category that was stronger than we anticipated. 
I think the potential concern and certainly, as you look at the news, you see this everywhere is there certainly are some pretty dire situations, especially in some of the markets that we're in, but certainly, India being one of those, where case counts are rising. There are other markets where the vaccination dissemination is going quite slowly. And as new lockdowns are implemented, we expect that those could hamper mobility and that these trends could moderate. So we know international, things are always volatile, but they certainly are even more volatile during this time. And those markets are not going to have linear behavior. So we expect that we'll see continued volatility. 
What we're trying to do is to drive what's within our control, and our teams are responding with tremendous agility in adapting the plans based on the stages and the status in each market. So we feel good that all of our key initiatives, whether it's our China transition to the new business model, a restart or upping again our focus in India on our chocolate initiative, all of those things are going well.

And so I would start first within core confections and say, we have a -- our business splits 1/3, 1/3, 1/3. Instant consumables, which are all about people being out and about on the go; take home, which is all about people being at home and consuming the products there; and then seasons, which is all about celebrations. And so within confection, what we saw was, wow, normally, we might focus a bit more of our efforts on instant consumable. And when COVID hit, we were able to immediately shift media, in store merchandising, et cetera, more to our take-home portfolio. And we also saw that during a time like COVID, consumers were just hungry [Audio Gap] during season to create that connectivity and traditions and rituals with something consumers just were so hungry for. So really leveraging the full breadth of that within confection was important. 
You raised baking and certainly, consumers were baking more, and we were able to leverage that as part of our portfolio. So I think what it really taught us was this ability to pivot to follow the consumer and to focus on the parts of our portfolio that were most relevant to them at that time. And as I think -- if we think organic and inorganic likewise, we were able to take advantage of skinny path which has done incredibly well during COVID. And certainly, we know that category like nutrition bars haven't done quite as well.

Our first quarter results were outstanding with broad-based growth across the portfolio, leading to double-digit sales and earnings growth. We entered the year with strong plans to deliver accelerated top and bottom line growth with balanced activation of our brands through advertising, innovation, distribution and pricing. We are delivering against these plans, and at the same time, external conditions have been more favorable than we anticipated. Our strategies, capabilities and agility have enabled us to respond to these rapidly changing trends and capture incremental growth for the year. 
As COVID-19 vaccines roll out across the globe, consumers are more optimistic about the future and looking forward to spending more time with their family, friends and community. As we have seen over our 12-year history, our brands play an important role in these special moments of connection, comfort and happiness. 
Over the past few months, families continued to embrace the at-home lifestyle, and our brands were part of many game and movie nights, seasonal celebrations and baking creation. At the same time, consumer mobility is improving in the U.S., and our away-from-home businesses performed better than expected. Despite challenging COVID conditions across the globe, sales in our international markets exceeded expectations. 
Our teams have done a fantastic job responding to these trends in a volatile operating environment. Without their passion, agility and dedication to making more moments of goodness for our consumers, none of this would be possible. Thank you to our employees across the globe for their countless contributions to these results. 
In the first quarter, we delivered net sales growth of 12.7% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 17.8%. We expected a strong start to the year behind continued elevated take-home chocolate and seasonal sales, category share gains and inventory replenishment. We were able to exceed these high expectations by converting more shoppers as trips increased during the quarter and capitalizing on the competitive environment to capture incremental merchandising and distribution opportunities. This resulted in year-to-date total U.S. retail takeaway of plus 7.1% through April 18, and U.S. confectionery share gain of nearly 80 basis points. 
While some of these trends are planned to moderate as the year progresses, we expect to deliver sales and earnings growth above our long-term algorithm for the full year. Importantly, we are taking strategic actions and investing in the business to drive long-term value from the opportunities we are capturing today. 
We believe balanced growth and business reinvestment in our brands and capabilities are critical for delivering sustainable, advantaged financial results. Our strategies and investments over the past several years positioned us well to capitalize on COVID-19 tailwinds and execute with agility in a volatile operating environment. 
In the first quarter, all key pillars of our strategy contributed to our performance. We delivered growth in both our everyday and seasonal products in measured channels and nonmeasured channels, confection and snacking products and North America and international markets. We grew volume and price across both our core products and innovation and through base velocity and distribution gains. 
As we enter the recovery phase of COVID, we know the journey will not be linear. We are closely monitoring consumer trends and pivoting quickly to adjust as the environment changes. We expect certain pre-pandemic behaviors to rebound including in-person schooling, restaurant dining and in-store shopping. As those levels rebound, we will focus on our confection and better-for-you snack packs, foodservice business, single-serve products and nontraditional channel distribution opportunities. We saw a significant improvement in our sales in these channels in the first quarter. 
Our foodservice and specialty retail business grew high single digits in the first quarter of 2021 after declining high single digits in the fourth quarter of 2020. Sales in our retail store and world travel retail locations also improved notably with low single-digit growth in Q1 versus 50% declines in the fourth quarter of 2020. Importantly, while these businesses rebounded, we saw continued strength in our core portfolio in traditional channels. 
While we don't expect trends to permanently stay this elevated in both at-home and away-from-home channels, our teams are capitalizing on this unique window of dual strength as consumer behaviors change during the COVID recovery. 
Consumers tell us that they value some of the new traditions that they've created this past year, and they intend to continue them in the future even when the pandemic ends. This is particularly true for occasions spent connecting with loved ones, and this represents a wonderful opportunity for our brands. 
To share some examples, 43% of parents are having more movie nights this year compared to last, and 36% claim that they will increase movie nights in the coming months. While we had a record S'mores season last year, 14% of households who did not make S'mores last year plan to do so this year. And those who did make S'mores last year are excited to make more this year as they reconnect with close friends, families and neighbors. 
Another area where we've seen increased participation in new traditions is in seasons. Consumer participation in Valentine's and seasons was strong and ahead of expectations. Consumers have settled into their pandemic holiday routines, and they are finding ways to create special moments for their families at home. 
At Easter, this included candy dishes filled with chocolate eggs, Easter baskets filled with bunnies and treats to fill eggs for hunts. While backyard egg hunts became a COVID necessity as community hunts were canceled, many consumers indicate that they plan to continue backyard hunts in the years to come as their kids seem to enjoy them more. 
A significant amount of candy continues to be purchased in-store. However, a sizable number of consumers did purchase their seasonal and everyday candy online in the first quarter. e-commerce represented approximately 15% of confection trips in the first quarter, an increase of approximately 60% versus the same period last year. Our team was prepared with strong omnichannel activation and cross-category promotion to inspire consumers as they got ready for the season. 
While this year was a shorter season, the category grew 9.5% versus 2020. Hershey grew 9.7%, resulting in a share gain of 11 basis points. 
Given 2020 was impacted by the onset of COVID-19, the 2-year trend is perhaps more telling. Despite 2021 being a 2-week shorter season than 2019, category sales were down approximately 3.5% versus 2019. This is above historical decline of approximately 10% during a 2-week shorter season. And it's a testament to the importance of seasons and confection's role in consumers' traditions during these holidays. Hershey's results for that 2-year period were slightly up, resulting in a category share gain of almost 170 basis points. Our sell-through was stronger than anticipated this year, partially driven by elevated foot traffic and robust retail spending as vaccinations paced ahead of expectations and stimulus checks were issued. These great results will set us up for a fast start on our summer activations and position us well for a strong sell-in for 2022. 
As we head into summer, we are excited about the plans we have in place. We will continue to support our brands with strong media, and we have great merchandising lined up to support summer S'mores, Twizzlers and our Olympic sponsorship. Our innovation is on track and many of our take-home items, including Kit Kat Thins and our 0 sugar items are hitting shelves now. 
In addition, Our category management teams have been able to capitalize on our strong performance and the competitive environment to secure incremental distribution during planogram changes. In Q1 alone, our teams gained approximately 5 new everyday items through front-end strategies like queuing and take-home aisle space optimization. We expect this strength to continue as we progress through the year. 
Finally, let me share an update on our confection pricing strategy. Earlier this year, we announced changes to our seasonal pricing that go into effect with our holiday products this year. 2 weeks ago, we communicated additional pricing changes to our retailers. This most recent change primarily affects our non-chocolate and grocery products, which had not been priced since 2014. These actions are consistent with our previously stated pricing strategy, one that we believe plays an important role in enabling business investment and driving profitable category growth. Steve will share some additional details as it relates to the impact on our financial outlook. 
Now let me shift gears and provide an update on our snacking and grocery products. Our Amplify business is off to a great start with retail sales growth of 9% for the year-to-date period ending April 18. This strength was driven by SkinnyPop, which grew 14.6% and gained 180 basis points of share in the ready-to-eat popcorn category. While we expect growth to moderate as laps become more difficult, we do expect to grow and gain share in the coming quarters behind strong media support, distribution gains and incremental merchandising. 
Pirate's Booty declined in Q1 as multipack sales were pressured by virtual school and key promotional activity was shifted to Q2. We expect trends to improve as more students return to in-person schooling and promotional activity increases in the second quarter. 
The ONE business continued to be impacted by reduced consumer mobility in the first quarter, but trends subsequently improved and have turned positive over the past several weeks. We expect category and ONE trends to continue to improve as the year progresses. 
Finally, let me spend a few minutes on our International and Other segment before turning it over to Steve. Net sales grew 11.2%, with strong results across markets. 
In Mexico, chocolate category sales remained pressured, but we did see improvement in the traditional trade in Q1 as consumer mobility increased. We were able to take advantage of incremental capacity to capitalize on this improvement and deliver net sales relatively in line with the prior year despite continued COVID-19 challenges. A big thank you to the teams who were able to bring this capacity online ahead of plan to be able to capture this demand. 
Similarly, in India, we saw mobility improve ahead of expectations in the first quarter, driving better-than-anticipated results across our portfolio. Our chocolate distribution expansion initiatives resumed late last year, and they remain on track. 
In Brazil, our performance accelerated in the first quarter as the chocolate category gained incremental merchandising opportunities due to the cancellation of Carnival this year. 
And in China, our transition to the new distributor go-to-market model is going well and remains on track. 
As many of you know, the state of the COVID-19 across the globe is different from what we're seeing in the U.S., and the environment remains uncertain and volatile. Recently, we have seen new lockdowns implemented across the globe as variants spread and cases rise. 
During the past year, we have seen these strategies to limit mobility have a negative impact on confectionery category sales. However, despite these challenges, we believe we can grow both sales and profitability in our international markets this year. 
Now let me turn it over to Steve to provide more details on our Q1 financial results and our full year outlook."

As Michele shared, our first quarter results were exceptional, while exceeding our expectations by delivering double-digit sales and adjusted earnings growth. Strength in our core confection and seasonal pro",1453,"Thank you, Michele, and good morning, everyone. As Michele shared, our first quarter results were exceptional, while exceeding our expectations by delivering double-digit sales and adjusted earnings growth. Strength in our core confection and seasonal products complemented by the accelerated recovery of our COVID-19 impacted businesses drove significant net sales and operating income growth despite higher input costs and capability investments. These results showcase our focus on balanced and profitable growth, providing the financial flexibility to meet current business needs, invest for the future and return cash to our shareholders. 
While the environment remains highly volatile due to the pandemic, we see incremental opportunities based on our first quarter performance and growth momentum that is reflected in our increased outlook. The North America segment continued to show momentum with reported net sales growth of 12.8%. As expected, we saw strength in our take-home chocolate portfolio in addition to solid seasonal performance for Valentine's Day in Easter, which drove category share gains in the quarter. We also benefited from inventory replenishment, which was relatively in line with expectations, and 2 additional selling days in the quarter. 
Accelerated orders for some of our key summer programs drove incremental shipments for the quarter given our strong Easter sell-through. Additionally, the team's captured incremental distribution and merchandising opportunities that further contributed to our outperformance in Q1. We do see additional distribution and merchandising opportunity in the coming quarters, particularly the second quarter, which is reflected in our raised full year outlook. 
Despite elevated COVID case counts throughout much of the quarter, mobility increased ahead of our expectations as consumers anticipated the distribution of the vaccine and discretionary income increase with the receipt of 2 rounds of stimulus checks in January and March. 
As Michele shared, this created a unique window of dual strength as both our at-home and away-from-home businesses benefited in the quarter. Our away-from-home businesses, including foodservice and specialty, had a strong quarter, growing high single digits versus the prior year period. While away-from-home businesses improved, we also saw continued strength in chocolate take home and seasonal products, growing 9.9% year-to-date. 
As the year progresses, we expect our away-from-home business to continue to rebound and our at-home business to moderate as we start to lap higher growth and share gains in the second half of the year. This benefit was compounded as base volume gains and channel mix generated trade favorability and net price realization of approximately 130 basis points in the first quarter. Additionally, we generated approximately 40 basis points of price realization from list price increases, in line with expectations. On a full year basis, we now expect net price realization of 1 to 1.5 points, reflecting modest trade favorability largely realized in the first quarter, along with the pricing on our seasonal, non-chocolate and grocery products benefiting the back half of the year. 
Within our International and Other segment, reported net sales increased 11.2% in the first quarter. FX was a 370 basis point headwind. First quarter results were ahead of expectations due to stronger-than-expected consumer mobility that benefited confectionery category sales. 
Michele shared a detailed update on each of our key international markets, and we are pleased with the strength we saw in Q1 and the team's ability to react to the significant demand changes. Given that our original outlook anticipated improving mobility over the course of the year, we do not expect this plan of our delivery to sustain in future quarters. Furthermore, the international environment remains volatile and the rising case counts and new lockdowns implemented in April, bring additional uncertainty to the continued recovery of the confectionery category in these markets. 
Our strong top line delivery generated over $1 billion of gross profit for the quarter, reflecting a dollar increase of 10.8% versus the prior year period. While gross profit increased double digits, we did see a slight contraction in gross margin in the quarter, driven by the North America segment. 
In North America, adjusted gross margin decreased by 110 basis points to 46.4% in the first quarter, driven by raw material and packaging cost inflation as well as increased supply chain costs related to higher-than-anticipated demand, which were partially offset by higher volume and net price realization. 
As our net sales exceeded expectations in the quarter, we incurred higher co-manufacturing and co-packaging costs to service this demand, in addition to warehousing and transportation costs. We expect these cost pressures to subside as volume begins to moderate throughout the year and as new capacity comes online early next year. We also provided additional onetime incentives to our manufacturing employees in the first quarter to recognize and reward them for their tremendous efforts, keeping our plants running safely at high capacity to service this strong demand. 
Gross margin in our International and Other segment expanded by 180 basis points to 39.4% for the first quarter, driven primarily by strong volume growth and fixed cost absorption. Overall, we continue to expect modest gross margin expansion this year, driven by productivity, volume gains, the lapping of incremental COVID-19 incentive costs in 2020 and net price realization. This multi-lever approach to gross margin expansion has been successful for us in the past, and we are confident that we can deliver our profitability targets for the full year, barring any significant changes to our internal assumptions or new external pressures. 
In North America, advertising and related consumer marketing spend increased 3.4%, consistent with our expectations. This increase was driven by investments in our core brands and innovation, in addition to the sponsorship of NCAA March Madness that was canceled in the prior year due to COVID-19. 
For the full year, we expect advertising to grow roughly in line with sales. However, we do expect growth to vary by quarter. Specifically, we expect a significant increase in advertising in the second quarter as we lap a deflated base in the prior year due to COVID-19-driven market price efficiencies and brand support reductions. 
In our International and Other segment, advertising and related consumer marketing spend decreased by 2.9% in the first quarter. We continue to have an agile yet disciplined approach to deploying brand investment based on the sales trends and recovery of the confectionery category by market. Divisional and corporate expenses increased 4.4% for the first quarter, driven by salary and benefit inflation, incentive compensation and capability and technology investments. These investments were partially offset by reduced travel and meeting expenses. 
First quarter adjusted operating profit of $556 million resulted in an adjusted operating profit margin of 24.2%, an increase of 110 basis points versus the first quarter of 2020. Strong volume gains in both the North America and International and Other segments more than offset product cost pressures and increased SG&A costs. 
The adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was 22.5%, an increase of almost 340 basis points versus the year ago period, driven by the timing of lower tax credits and lower benefits related to employee share-based payments versus the year ago period. First quarter other expense was $2 million, a decrease of $9 million versus the prior year period. 
Our first quarter results are a testament to our balanced top and bottom line approach, which provided for a healthy cash flow and a strong balance sheet. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet and $610 million in operating cash flow in the quarter. This strong cash flow allowed us to simultaneously execute nearly every lever in our capital allocation framework during the quarter. We funded investments to fuel growth, returned a significant portion of cash to our shareholders through dividends and share buybacks and paid down debt. 
In the first quarter, total capital additions, including software, were approximately $114 million. As we shared in January and last year, we have several key capital projects over the next few years, including capacity expansion, ERP and supply chain modernization initiatives. We expect capital expenditures to be around $550 million for the full year, consistent with prior guidance. 
In the first quarter, we paid $163 million in cash dividends, and we resumed share buybacks by completing $240 million of repurchases related to stock option replenishment. Finally, we repaid $85 million of bonds in February with an additional payment scheduled for May. We had a strong start to the year, benefiting from some unique benefits in the first quarter and as a result, expect a stronger full year outlook. As the year progresses, we expect our performance to moderate as we lap higher prior year growth and share gains and take-home chocolate sales growth moderates as away-from-home sales rebound. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Michele for closing remarks."

I am so proud of how our teams continue to respond with agility and execute well against many factors out of our control during these extraordinary times. We are continuing to execute our strategies and make investment to not only deliver today but secure our future as well. 
Last month, we announced an ambitious commitment to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions based on the latest climate science by partnering with a science-based target initiative. This includes goals to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by more than 50% and our absolute Scope 3 emissions by 25% by 2030. As part of these commitments, we signed 2 power purchase agreements that will enable the construction of 2 new utility-scale solar farms. 
Additionally, we set a new goal to reduce packaging weight by 25 million pounds and target 100% of our plastic packaging to be recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2030. 
Finally, we announced a new company-wide deforestation policy to end deforestation across our supply chain by 2030. 
This work is important. It's ambitious, and it's what the world needs from leading companies like Hershey. It will take all of us working together to achieve our goals, and we are excited by the journey we are on and the impact that we can make.

Given 2020 was impacted by the onset of COVID-19, the 2-year trend is perhaps more telling. Despite 2021 being a 2-week shorter season than 2019, category sales were down approximately 3.5% versus 2019. This is above historical decline of approximately 10% during a 2-week shorter season. And it's a testament to the importance of seasons and confection's role in consumers' traditions during these holidays.
Hershey's results for that 2-year period were slightly up, resulting in a category share gain of almost 170 basis points. Our sell-through was stronger than anticipated this year, partially driven by elevated foot traffic and robust retail spending as vaccinations paced ahead of expectations and stimulus checks were issued. These great results will set us up for a fast start on our summer activations and position us well for a strong sell-in for 2022.
As we head into summer, we are excited about the plans we have in place. We will continue to support our brands with strong media, and we have great merchandising lined up to support summer S'mores, Twizzlers and our Olympic sponsorship. Our innovation is on track and many of our take-home items, including Kit Kat Thins and our  Zero Sugar items are hitting shelves now.
In addition, Our category management teams have been able to capitalize on our strong performance and the competitive environment to secure incremental distribution during planogram changes. In Q1 alone, our teams gained approximately 5 new everyday items through front-end strategies like queuing and take-home aisle space optimization. We expect this strength to continue as we progress through the year.
Finally, let me share an update on our confection pricing strategy. Earlier this year, we announced changes to our seasonal pricing that go into effect with our holiday products this year. 2 weeks ago, we communicated additional pricing changes to our retailers. This most recent change primarily affects our non-chocolate and grocery products, which had not been priced since 2014. These actions are consistent with our previously stated pricing strategy, one that we believe plays an important role in enabling business investment and driving profitable category growth. Steve will share some additional details as it relates to the impact on our financial outlook.
Now let me shift gears and provide an update on our snacking and grocery products. Our Amplify business is off to a great start with retail sales growth of 9% for the year-to-date period ending April 18. This strength was driven by SkinnyPop, which grew 14.6% and gained 180 basis points of share in the ready-to-eat popcorn category. While we expect growth to moderate as laps become more difficult, we do expect to grow and gain share in the coming quarters behind strong media support, distribution gains and incremental merchandising.
Pirate's Booty declined in Q1 as multipack sales were pressured by virtual school and key promotional activity was shifted to Q2. We expect trends to improve as more students return to in-person schooling and promotional activity increases in the second quarter.
The ONE business continued to be impacted by reduced consumer mobility in the first quarter, but trends subsequently improved and have turned positive over the past several weeks. We expect category and ONE trends to continue to improve as the year progresses.
Finally, let me spend a few minutes on our International and Other segment before turning it over to Steve. Net sales grew 11.2%, with strong results across markets.
In Mexico, chocolate category sales remained pressured, but we did see improvement in the traditional trade in Q1 as consumer mobility increased. We were able to take advantage of incremental capacity to capitalize on this improvement and deliver net sales relatively in line with the prior year despite continued COVID-19 challenges. A big thank you to the teams who were able to bring this capacity online ahead of plan to be able to capture this demand.
Similarly, in India, we saw mobility improve ahead of expectations in the first quarter, driving better-than-anticipated results across our portfolio. Our chocolate distribution expansion initiatives resumed late last year, and they remain on track.
In Brazil, our performance accelerated in the first quarter as the chocolate category gained incremental merchandising opportunities due to the cancellation of carnival this year.
And in China, our transition to the new distributor go-to-market model is going well and remains on track.
As many of you know, the state of the COVID-19 across the globe is different from what we're seeing in the U.S., and the environment remains uncertain and volatile. Recently, we have seen new lockdowns implemented across the globe as variants spread and cases rise.
During the past year, we have seen these strategies to limit mobility have a negative impact on confectionery category sales. However, despite these challenges, we believe we can grow both sales and profitability in our international markets this year. 
Now let me turn it over to Steve to provide more details on our Q1 financial results and our full year outlook."

As Michele shared, our first quarter results were exceptional, while exceeding our expectations by delivering double-digit sales and adjusted earnings growth. Strength in our core confection and seasonal pro",1451,"Thank you, Michele, and good morning, everyone. As Michele shared, our first quarter results were exceptional, while exceeding our expectations by delivering double-digit sales and adjusted earnings growth. Strength in our core confection and seasonal products complemented by the accelerated recovery of our COVID-19 impacted businesses drove significant net sales and operating income growth despite higher input costs and capability investments. These results showcase our focus on balanced and profitable growth, providing the financial flexibility to meet current business needs, invest for the future and return cash to our shareholders.
While the environment remains highly volatile due to the pandemic, we see incremental opportunities based on our first quarter performance and growth momentum that is reflected in our increased outlook. The North America segment continued to show momentum with reported net sales growth of 12.8%.
As expected, we saw strength in our take-home chocolate portfolio in addition to solid seasonal performance for Valentine's Day and Easter, which drove category share gains in the quarter. We also benefited from inventory replenishment, which was relatively in line with expectations, and 2 additional selling days in the quarter.
Accelerated orders for some of our key summer programs drove incremental shipments for the quarter given our strong Easter sell-through. Additionally, the teams captured incremental distribution and merchandising opportunities that further contributed to our outperformance in Q1. We do see additional distribution and merchandising opportunity in the coming quarters, particularly the second quarter, which is reflected in our raised full year outlook.
Despite elevated COVID case counts throughout much of the quarter, mobility increased ahead of our expectations as consumers anticipated the distribution of the vaccine and discretionary income increase with the receipt of 2 rounds of stimulus checks in January and March.
As Michele shared, this created a unique window of dual strength as both our at-home and away-from-home businesses benefited in the quarter. Our away-from-home businesses, including foodservice and specialty, had a strong quarter, growing high single digits versus the prior year period. While away-from-home businesses improved, we also saw continued strength in chocolate take home and seasonal products, growing 9.9% year-to-date.
As the year progresses, we expect our away-from-home business to continue to rebound and our at-home business to moderate as we start to lap higher growth and share gains in the second half of the year. This benefit was compounded as base volume gains and channel mix generated trade favorability and net price realization of approximately 130 basis points in the first quarter. Additionally, we generated approximately 40 basis points of price realization from list price increases, in line with expectations.
On a full year basis, we now expect net price realization of 1 to 1.5 points, reflecting modest trade favorability largely realized in the first quarter, along with the pricing on our seasonal, non-chocolate and grocery products benefiting the back half of the year.
Within our International and Other segment, reported net sales increased 11.2% in the first quarter. FX was a 370 basis point headwind. First quarter results were ahead of expectations due to stronger-than-expected consumer mobility that benefited confectionery category sales.
Michele shared a detailed update on each of our key international markets, and we are pleased with the strength we saw in Q1 and the team's ability to react to the significant demand changes. Given that our original outlook anticipated improving mobility over the course of the year, we do not expect this plan over-delivery to sustain in future quarters. Furthermore, the international environment remains volatile and the rising case counts and new lockdowns implemented in April bring additional uncertainty to the continued recovery of the confectionery category in these markets.
Our strong top line delivery generated over $1 billion of gross profit for the quarter, reflecting a dollar increase of 10.8% versus the prior year period. While gross profit increased double digits, we did see a slight contraction in gross margin in the quarter, driven by the North America segment.
In North America, adjusted gross margin decreased by 110 basis points to 46.4% in the first quarter, driven by raw material and packaging cost inflation as well as increased supply chain costs related to higher-than-anticipated demand, which were partially offset by higher volume and net price realization.
As our net sales exceeded expectations in the quarter, we incurred higher co-manufacturing and co-packaging costs to service this demand, in addition to warehousing and transportation costs. We expect these cost pressures to subside as volume begins to moderate throughout the year and as new capacity comes online early next year. We also provided additional onetime incentives to our manufacturing employees in the first quarter to recognize and reward them for their tremendous efforts, keeping our plants running safely at high capacity to service this strong demand.
Gross margin in our International and Other segment expanded by 180 basis points to 39.4% for the first quarter, driven primarily by strong volume growth and fixed cost absorption. Overall, we continue to expect modest gross margin expansion this year, driven by productivity, volume gains, the lapping of incremental COVID-19 incentive costs in 2020 and net price realization. This multi-lever approach to gross margin expansion has been successful for us in the past, and we are confident that we can deliver our profitability targets for the full year, barring any significant changes to our internal assumptions or new external pressures.
In North America, advertising and related consumer marketing spend increased 3.4%, consistent with our expectations. This increase was driven by investments in our core brands and innovation, in addition to the sponsorship of NCAA March Madness that was canceled in the prior year due to COVID-19.
For the full year, we expect advertising to grow roughly in line with sales. However, we do expect growth to vary by quarter. Specifically, we expect a significant increase in advertising in the second quarter as we lap a deflated base in the prior year due to COVID-19-driven market price efficiencies and brand support reductions.
In our International and Other segment, advertising and related consumer marketing spend decreased by 2.9% in the first quarter. We continue to have an agile yet disciplined approach to deploying brand investment based on the sales trends and recovery of the confectionery category by market. Divisional and corporate expenses increased 4.4% for the first quarter, driven by salary and benefit inflation, incentive compensation and capability and technology investments. These investments were partially offset by reduced travel and meeting expenses.
First quarter adjusted operating profit of $556 million resulted in an adjusted operating profit margin of 24.2%, an increase of 110 basis points versus the first quarter of 2020. Strong volume gains in both the North America and International and Other segments more than offset product cost pressures and increased SG&A costs.
The adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was 22.5%, an increase of almost 340 basis points versus the year ago period, driven by the timing of lower tax credits and lower benefits related to employee share-based payments versus the year ago period. First quarter other expense was $2 million, a decrease of $9 million versus the prior year period.
Our first quarter results are a testament to our balanced top and bottom line approach, which provided for a healthy cash flow and a strong balance sheet. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet and $610 million in operating cash flow in the quarter. This strong cash flow allowed us to simultaneously execute nearly every lever in our capital allocation framework during the quarter. We funded investments to fuel growth, returned a significant portion of cash to our shareholders through dividends and share buybacks and paid down debt.
In the first quarter, total capital additions, including software, were approximately $114 million. As we shared in January and last year, we have several key capital projects over the next few years, including capacity expansion, ERP and supply chain modernization initiatives. We expect capital expenditures to be around $550 million for the full year, consistent with prior guidance.
In the first quarter, we paid $163 million in cash dividends, and we resumed share buybacks by completing $240 million of repurchases related to stock option replenishment. Finally, we repaid $85 million of bonds in February with an additional payment scheduled for May. We had a strong start to the year, benefiting from some unique benefits in the first quarter and as a result, expect a stronger full year outlook. As the year progresses, we expect our performance to moderate as we lap higher prior year growth and share gains and take-home chocolate sales growth moderates as away-from-home sales rebound.
With that, I'll turn it back to Michele for closing remarks."

I am so proud of how our teams continue to respond with agility and execute well against many factors out of our control during these extraordinary times. We are continuing to execute our strategies and make investment to not only deliver today but secure our future as well.
Last month, we announced an ambitious commitment to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions based on the latest climate science by partnering with a science-based target initiative. This includes goals to reduce our scope 1 and 2 emissions by more than 50% and our absolute scope 3 emissions by 25% by 2030. As part of these commitments, we signed 2 power purchase agreements that will enable the construction of 2 new utility-scale solar farms.
Additionally, we set a new goal to reduce packaging weight by 25 million pounds and target 100% of our plastic packaging to be recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2030.
Finally, we announced a new company-wide deforestation policy to end deforestation across our supply chain by 2030. This work is important. It's ambitious, and it's what the world needs from leading companies like Hershey. It will take all of us working together to achieve our goals, and we are excited by the journey we are on and the impact that we can make.
We look forward to sharing more details with you in our 2020 Sustainability Report, which will be published on June 1.

So yes, we are still calling for modest gross margin expansion on a full year basis. As you noted and we had in the remarks, there were some transitory impacts in the first quarter, some lapping from last year, some also cost in response to the higher volume. As we look forward for the rest of the year, some of the things that are strengths for us, the productivity gains, the additional volume, the pricing that you referenced, all of that will be part of building that gross margin. So far, for the first quarter and even as we look out for the year, I would say our inflation assumptions are largely tracking to what we had in plan, and the one exception that we noted was packaging. And I think that is one we'll watch. Our expectation is that inflation will moderate some as the year plays out, impacted a bit by weather in Texas for the first quarter. So that's one we're watching. 
And then in any carryforward of incremental cost to support the higher volume. And with more runway here in the balance of the year, we'll have more opportunities to optimize between customer service and manufacturing capacity and the cost of support. So we're keeping a close watch on all those. But yes, at this point, we still see some gross margin expansion over the course of the year."

And we are fortunate that we have been able, given the strength of our performance of our supply chain, particularly overall, but also during COVID and some of the needs of our customers to be able to provide some incremental SKUs that were very viable, that our customers were looking for, and we gained about 5 incremental SKUs for the year. And so certainly, with that comes some shelf space gains. So that's something we've been focused on. As we get that distribution and we get shelf space now, that certainly has some staying power as long as those SKUs perform, which we anticipate that they will. 
So we are continuing to be focused on that. And as we look throughout the year, believe, we feel pretty good about our ability to continue to drive distribution as well as shelf space gains. And certainly, that kind of coincides with some of the share gains that we have seen on the business have been driven by that. 
As we look at online momentum as it relates to our supply chain, we've talked before about Supply Chain 2.0, a big initiative that we have to really prepare our business and enable our manufacturing and supply chain for the future. And certainly, as we build that program and that initiative, one of the key legs that we were focused on was the agility to enable us to adapt to the changing retail environment and specifically, e-commerce being one of those areas because a lot of the packs sold in e-commerce are slightly different than those sold across the business. 
So some of those investments that we're making there enable us to more efficiently at a better margin, develop the right packs that enable us to win in e-commerce. So big focus in Supply Chain 2.0 against that and in all of our new capacity builds."

We're in a bit of a unique circumstance right now where Mars is moving one direction with a higher magnitude, and you're moving in a different direction with a much lower magnitude. And it strikes me as quite a unique moment in time where you guys are diverging. I guess I'd love a little more clarity to try to understand the motivation for you to go in a different direction?

So I continue to feel really good about this being a very rational category from a pricing perspective and there being strong discipline from that perspective. Our recent announcements regarding increasing price on seasons and also non-chocolate and grocery are very consistent with the strategy we've been executing over the past couple of years of realizing price through different levers and on different parts of the portfolio. And we think that, that's proven effective for us to drive profitable growth and also be able to reinvest in the business, both for us and also for our retailers. But we do know that across competitors in the category, we each do have unique portfolios with different SKUs to our business across pack types and across brands, we have some different capabilities in terms of what we are good at executing and perhaps even different business needs at different points in time. And so while all the pricing isn't exactly pack-to-pack, exactly the same, what we think is important is while those tactics and products might differ, overall, category price realization is pretty consistent. And so if you look at us and you look at the largest player in the -- the second largest player in the category, the magnitude and difference in terms of what we each are getting from price is probably a point or in that range. So it's not a significant -- it's not a significant difference between."

And then my second follow-up question, I know you're not giving quarterly guidance, but obviously, 2020 was such an unusual year. And we're going to be lapping some interesting developments in the year ago period as we go into Q2. I think you mentioned the ad spend was going to be up materially in the second quarter. I'm just wondering whether you can give us any other pointers on how the top and the bottom line might be expected to develop? Or what the pluses and minuses are as we think about next quarter?"

So first of all, we did see stronger foot traffic and consumer mobility in North America, and that was really, I believe, from the accelerated vaccine distribution as we",297,"Sure. So relative to the away-from-home strength, I would say it is across the board. So first of all, we did see stronger foot traffic and consumer mobility in North America, and that was really, I believe, from the accelerated vaccine distribution as well as from the stimulus funds that were allocated and that not only drove strength in what we would call our core channels, kind of the more traditional channel, food, drug, mass and even some pickup in convenience in Q1. It also had -- there was also a very strong positive impact on our non-measured channels as well. So food service, our own retail stores, world travel retail, some of those businesses that were really big decliners for us last year came back faster than we had anticipated. So I would say it was pretty much across the board in terms of all of those venues improving a bit more than we had anticipated. 
So some of it was due to the consumer traffic. And then, of course, we were able to also capture incremental distribution and merchandising in our U.S. confection business. And given the strong sell-through that we saw, driven by mobility and foot traffic, strong sell-through Easter then led to accelerated shipments of some of our summer programs, which also helped us across the board. And then even beyond North America, we actually saw increased mobility in the international markets as well, a bit more than we had expected. 
So with that, I think those were unplanned for us in Q1. We certainly had planned to see those mobility improvement later in the year and have that in our plan, but not in Q1. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve to talk a little bit about the quarters."

From a quarterly standpoint, as we look at Q2, building on what Michele said, we've got a lot of momentum on the top line coming into Q2. We're able to merchandise early some of the summer season, that will get us off to a to a strong start. As we go",198,"Yes. From a quarterly standpoint, as we look at Q2, building on what Michele said, we've got a lot of momentum on the top line coming into Q2. We're able to merchandise early some of the summer season, that will get us off to a to a strong start. As we go forward from there on the top line, you're going to see sales growth moderate. The laps get tougher. You'll see pricing start to make a contribution more in the back half. And as Michele said, our plan assumed mobility would begin to recover as we got to the back half. So that's less of a new piece of the story as we turn the corner on the midyear. And then we'll see some margin improvement as the year progresses. 
You mentioned ad spending for Q2, it's going to be up pretty big. Year-over-year, that was -- the quarter last year where we made some adjustments, some pricing advantage because it was cheaper to buy and some pricing or some adjustments in how much we spent just in response to COVID. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color on the balance of the quarter."

So I would say we came into the year feeling really good about our strategies. And many of those we have laid out pre-COVID relative to really focused on we got to win at the top line with balanced growth, which is driving against distribution, the core innovation, seasons, pricing and volume growth. And I think what we're seeing on the business is that we are delivering on each of those elements. And so certainly, that is a piece that I think has staying power that some of the strategies we put in place relative to pre-COVID optimizing our balanced focus on the core and on innovation, not over rotating on innovation too much. Not over rotating on any one factor, balancing price and volume, all those things. So I think there is some underlying strength there as well as a lot of the investments that we've made in our core capabilities in our manufacturing and our supply chain over the year that have enabled us to deliver perhaps at stronger levels than perhaps some others in the marketplace. 
And so some of that strength that we're seeing in terms of impact of media, those types of things, they're there without the COVID impact. We tend to always, as you know, strong category managers. So we do tend to do well when it comes to winning at retail. We have our proprietary retail sales force that enable us to do that. 
At the same time, I say, I guess, if I was going to parse out some places where some of the current dynamics may be a little bit more transitory. Certainly, we have won more distribution than, I would say it's probably at the historic level in terms of number of new items because of our strength in being able to operate in this environment and our agility. We have won some incremental merch associated with the competitive situation as well. 
So for me, I guess I kind of -- I narrow into probably those 2 factors being probably the biggest ones that are the most unique. And of course, the other one is that right now in Q1, you asked more about a couple of quarters, in Q1, in particular, we've kind of got that unique duality where we're seeing that we're benefiting both from away-from-home and from at-home behaviors, both being strong. And certainly, I think that, that can't sustain at the level that it did in Q1. So we do think that, that's going to moderate a bit. 
Does that help?"

But I guess kind of overall, the question is, could it be actually a lot stronger, right, than we would expect as we go through the year? Because it would seem as if kind of relative to what we're thinking about for North America, if that international piece does continue to play out, and obviously, given those compares are so much easier, it would seem as if the volume-driven year could actually be even more volume-driven off of that international piece as we progress through the year. 
So kind of simplistically, I'm just asking, I realize you don't have the visibility, but if things were to kind of self-correct and momentum were to continue in international, I mean could you just not do much better on the top line than you're already currently guiding?"

So that's great to see. And certainly, we did have a strong first quarter in international that was significantly ahead of our expectation. I think what was interesting for us was that despite this fact that COVID cases were high in many of those markets, consumer mobility still increased, and that drove demand for our category that was stronger than we anticipated. 
I think the potential concern and certainly, as you look at the news, you see this everywhere is there certainly are some pretty dire situations, especially in some of the markets that we're in, but certainly, India being one of those, where case counts are rising. There are other markets where the vaccination dissemination is going quite slowly. And as new lockdowns are implemented, we expect that those could hamper mobility and that these trends could moderate. So we know international, things are always volatile, but they certainly are even more volatile during this time. And those markets are not going to have linear behavior. So we expect that we'll see continued volatility. 
What we're trying to do is to drive what's within our control, and our teams are responding with tremendous agility in adapting the plans based on the stages and the status in each market. So we feel good that all of our key initiatives, whether it's our China transition to the new business model, a restart or upping again our focus in India on our chocolate initiative, all of those things are going well. But there's just a lot outside of our control, and we'll have to see how the year plays out.

I mean, I think one of the things that we feel good about that COVID just reinforced was the strength of the breadth of our portfolio to be able to participate in different occasions. And so I would start first within core confections and say, we have a -- our business splits 1/3, 1/3, 1/3. Instant consumables, which are all about people being out and about on the go; take home, which is all about people being at home and consuming the products there; and then seasons, which is all about celebrations. And so within confection, what we saw was, wow, normally, we might focus a bit more of our efforts on instant consumable. And when COVID hit, we were able to immediately shift media, in store merchandising, et cetera, more to our take-home portfolio. And we also saw that during a time like COVID, consumers were just hungry for connection, and so the role that our brands play during seasons to create that connectivity and traditions and rituals was something consumers just were so hungry for. So really leveraging the full breadth of that within confection was important. 
You raised baking and certainly, consumers were baking more, and we were able to leverage that as part of our portfolio. So I think what it really taught us was this ability to pivot to follow the consumer and to focus on the parts of our portfolio that were most relevant to them at that time. And as I think -- if we think organic and inorganic, likewise, we were able to take advantage of SkinnyPop, which has done incredibly well during COVID. And certainly, we know that categories like nutrition bars haven't done quite as well. 
So it's really playing on the pieces of your portfolio at the right piece of time, but having the options and the breadth across the portfolio to be able to meet those needs."

So yes, we are still calling for modest gross margin expansion on a full year basis. As you noted and we had in the remarks, there were some transitory impacts in the first quarter, some lapping from last year, some also cost in response to the higher volume. As we look forward for the rest of the year, some of the things that are strengths for us, the productivity gains, the additional volume, the pricing that you referenced, all of that will be part of building that gross margin. So far, for the first quarter and even as we look out for the year, I would say our inflation assumptions are largely tracking to what we had in plan, and the one exception that we noted was packaging. And I think that is one we'll watch. Our expectation is that inflation will moderate some as the year plays out, impacted a bit by weather in Texas for the first quarter. So that's one we're watching. 
And then in any carryforward of incremental cost to support the higher volume. And with more runway here in the balance of the year, we'll have more opportunities to optimize between customer service and manufacturing capacity and the cost of support. So we're keeping a close watch on all those. But yes, at this point, we still see some gross margin expansion over the course of the year."

I'm just curious given how your momentum continues, if you would expect to see or have discussions with retailers, regarding more space later this year, but also in 2022? That's the first question. 
And then the second question is just on -- given the online momentum that you've been seeing and the clear stickiness that we've seen, how are you thinking about the supply chain and kind of reorienting the supply chain to make sure that you can continue to effectively execute as the online business continues to grow?"

As we started out for the year, we always have a focused plan, focused on balanced growth across all levers, driving base velocity, using media to accelerate growth, growth in seasons, distribution gains. So that'",361,"So let me first go to the space question. As we started out for the year, we always have a focused plan, focused on balanced growth across all levers, driving base velocity, using media to accelerate growth, growth in seasons, distribution gains. So that's always a focus for us. And we are fortunate that we have been able, given the strength of our performance of our supply chain, particularly overall, but also during COVID and some of the needs of our customers to be able to provide some incremental SKUs that were very viable, that our customers were looking for, and we gained about 5 incremental SKUs for the year. And so certainly, with that comes some shelf space gains. So that's something we've been focused on. As we get that distribution and we get shelf space now, that certainly has some staying power as long as those SKUs perform, which we anticipate that they will. 
So we are continuing to be focused on that. And as we look throughout the year, believe, we feel pretty good about our ability to continue to drive distribution as well as shelf space gains. And certainly, that kind of coincides with some of the share gains that we have seen on the business have been driven by that. 
As we look at online momentum as it relates to our supply chain, we've talked before about Supply Chain 2.0, a big initiative that we have to really prepare our business and enable our manufacturing and supply chain for the future. And certainly, as we build that program and that initiative, one of the key legs that we were focused on was the agility to enable us to adapt to the changing retail environment and specifically, e-commerce being one of those areas because a lot of the packs sold in e-commerce are slightly different than those sold across the business. 
So some of those investments that we're making there enable us to more efficiently at a better margin, develop the right packs that enable us to win in e-commerce. So big focus in Supply Chain 2.0 against that and in all of our new capacity builds."

Michele, if we look back in history, usually, you move Mars follows or Mars moves, you follow, and you follow on similar order of magnitude on similar products.

We're in a bit of a unique circumstance right now where Mars is moving one direction with a higher magnitude, and you're moving in a different direction with a much lower magnitude. And it strikes me as quite a unique moment in time where you guys are diverging. I guess I love a little more clarity to try to understand the motivation for you to go in a different direction?

So I continue to feel really good about this being a very rational category from a pricing perspective and there being strong discipline from that perspective. Our recent announcements regarding increasing price on seasons and also non-chocolate and grocery are very consistent with the strategy we've been executing over the past couple of years of realizing price through different levers and on different parts of the portfolio. And we think that, that's proven effective for us to drive profitable growth and also be able to reinvest in the business, both for us and also for our retailers. But we do know that across competitors in the category, we each do have unique portfolios with different SKUs to our business across pack types and across brands. 
We have some different capabilities in terms of what we are good at executing and perhaps even different business needs at different points in time. And so while all the pricing isn't exactly pack-to-pack, exactly the same, what we think is important is while those tactics and products might differ, overall, category price realization is pretty consistent. And so if you look at us and you look at the largest player in the -- the second largest player in the category, the magnitude and difference in terms of what we each are getting from price is probably a point or in that range. So it's a significant -- it's not a significant difference between."

So relative to the away-from-home strength, I would say it is across the board. So first of all, we did see stronger foot traffic and consumer mobility in North America, and that was really, I believe, from the accelerated vaccine distribution as well as from the stimulus funds that were allocated and that not only drove strength in what we would call our core channels, kind of the more traditional channel, food, drug, masks and even some pickup in convenience in Q1. It also had -- there was also a very strong positive impact on our non-measured channels as well. So food service, our own retail stores, world travel retail, some of those businesses that were really big decliners for us last year came back faster than we had anticipated. So I would say it was pretty much across the board in terms of all of those venues improving a bit more than we had anticipated. 
So some of it was due to the consumer traffic. And then, of course, we were able to also capture incremental distribution and merchandising in our U.S. confection business. And given the strong sell-through that we saw, driven by mobility and foot traffic, strong sell-through Easter then led to accelerated shipments of some of our summer programs, which also helped us across the board. And then even beyond North America, we actually saw increased mobility in the international markets as well, a bit more than we had expected. 
So with that, I think those were unplanned for us in Q1. We certainly had planned to see those mobility improvement later in the year and have that in our plan, but not in Q1. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve to talk a little bit about the quarters."

From a quarterly standpoint, as we look at Q2, building on what Michele said, we've got a lot of momentum on the top line coming into Q2. We're able to merchandise early some of the summer season, that will get us off to a to a strong start. As we go forward from there on the top line, you're going to see sales growth moderate. The laps get tougher. You'll see pricing start to make a contribution more in the back half. And as Michele said, our plan assumed mobility would begin to recover as we got to the back half. So that's less of a new piece in the story as we turn the corner on the midyear. And then we'll see some margin improvement as the year progresses. 
You mentioned ad spending for Q2, it's going to be up pretty big. Year-over-year, that was -- the quarter last year where we made some adjustments, some pricing advantage because it was cheaper to buy and some pricing or some adjustments in how much we spent just in response to COVID. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color on the balance of the quarter."

But as you think about how much of the gains that you've made the last couple of quarters, right, in distribution and shelf space, merchandising gains you've talked about, how do you think about like how much of those might be structural, right, based on a lot of the good stuff that you're doing around innovation and everything else versus a product of what's been clearly a more accommodative sort of competitive environment from a perspective of some others, whether it be supply chain missteps and things of that nature? 
So I'm just trying to get a sense, it's a hard one to answer, I know, but how sticky do you think some of those gains in market, right, that you've seen can be over time?"

So I would say we came into the year feeling really good about our strategies. And many of those we have laid out pre-COVID relative to really focused on we got to win at the top line with balanced growth, which is driving against distribution, the core, innovation, seasons, pricing and volume growth. And I think what we're seeing on the business is that we are delivering on each of those elements. And so certainly, that is a piece that I think has staying power that some of the strategies we put in place relative to pre-COVID optimizing our balanced focus on the core and on innovation, not over rotating on innovation too much. Not over rotating on any one factor. Balancing price is only one of those things. So I think that there is some underlying strength there as well as a lot of the investments that we've made in our core capabilities in our manufacturing and our supply chain over the year that have enabled us to deliver perhaps at stronger levels than perhaps some others in the marketplace. 
And so some of that strength that we're seeing in terms of impact of media, those types of things, they're there without the COVID impact. We tend to always, as you know, strong category managers. So we do tend to do well when it comes to winning at retail. We have our proprietary retail sales force that enable us to do that. 
At the same time, I say, I guess, if I was going to parse out some places where some of the current dynamics may be a little bit more transitory. Certainly, we have won more distribution than, I would say it's probably at the historic level in terms of number of new items because of our strength in being able to operate in this environment and our agility. We have won some incremental merch associated with the competitive situation as well. 
So for me, I guess I kind of -- I narrow into probably those 2 factors being probably the biggest ones that are the most unique. And of course, the other one is that right now in Q1, you asked more about a couple of quarters, in Q1, in particular, we've kind of got that unique duality where we're seeing that we're benefiting both from away-from-home and from at-home behaviors, both being strong. And certainly, I think that, that can't sustain at the level that it did in Q1. So we do think that, that's going to moderate a bit. 
Does that help?"

And then I know you had comments in your prepared remarks just around basically playing it safe, right? There's some incremental lockdowns occurring, the visibility is that strong. But I guess kind of overall, the question is, could it be actually a lot stronger, right, than we would expect as we go through the year? Because it would seem as if kind of relative to what we're thinking about for North America, if that international piece does continue to play out. And obviously, given those compares are so much easier, it would seem as if the volume-driven year could actually be even more volume-driven off of that international piece as we progress through the year. 
So kind of simplistically, I'm just asking, I realize you don't have the visibility, but if things were to kind of self-correct and momentum were to continue in international, I mean could you just not do much better on the top line than you're already currently guiding?"

So that's great to see. And certainly, we did have a strong first quarter in international that was significantly ahead of our expectation. I think what was interesting for us was that despite this fact that COVID cases were high in many of those markets, consumer mobility still increased, and that drove demand for our category that was stronger than we anticipated. 
I think the potential concern and certainly, as you look at the news, you see this everywhere is there certainly are some pretty dire situations, especially in some of the markets that we're in, but certainly, India being one of those, where case counts are rising. There are other markets where the vaccination dissemination is going quite slowly. And as new lockdowns are implemented, we expect that those could hamper mobility and that these trends could moderate. So we know international, things are always volatile, but they certainly are even more volatile during this time. And those markets are not going to have linear behavior. So we expect that we'll see continued volatility. 
What we're trying to do is to drive what's within our control, and our teams are responding with tremendous agility in adapting the plans based on the stages and the status in each market. So we feel good that all of our key initiatives, whether it's our China transition to the new business model, a restart or upping again our focus in India on our chocolate initiative, all of those things are going well. But there's just a lot outside of our control, and we'll have to see how the year plays out. 
If things are positive, certainly, there could be upside. And -- however, we also know that there could be downside as well."

I mean, I think one of the things that we feel good about that COVID just reinforced was the strength of the breadth of our portfolio to be able to participate in different occasions. And so I would start first within core confections and say, we have a -- our business splits 1/3, 1/3, 1/3. Instant consumables, which are all about people being out and about on the go; take home, which is all about people being at home and consuming the products there; and then seasons, which is all about celebrations. And so within confection, what we saw was, wow, normally, we might focus a bit more of our efforts on instant consumable. And when COVID hit, we were able to immediately shift media, in store merchandising, et cetera, more to our take-home portfolio. And we also saw that during a time like COVID, consumers were just hungry for connection. And so the roles that our brands played during season to create that connectivity and traditions and rituals with something consumers just were so hungry for. So really leveraging the full breadth of that within confection was important. 
You raised baking and certainly, consumers were baking more, and we were able to leverage that as part of our portfolio. So I think what it really taught us was this ability to pivot to follow the consumer and to focus on the parts of our portfolio that were most relevant to them at that time. And as I think -- if we think organic and inorganic likewise, we were able to take advantage of SkinnyPop which has done incredibly well during COVID. And certainly, we know that category like nutrition bars haven't done quite as well. 
So it's really playing on the pieces of your portfolio at the right piece of time, but having the options and the breadth across the portfolio to be able to meet those needs."

I guess it should not come as a surprise that 15% organic sales growth in a given quarter would kind of stress any supply chain, no matter how efficient. So my question is, I guess, are there any structural investments needed in the supply chain going forward? Or any capabilities that were exposed by the volume spike? Or is it simply you sort of suck up the higher cost as they're transitory, particularly the labor part and not need to necessarily make any changes as this sort of volume growth is really not likely sustainable at these extreme elevated levels?"

I would add to on the structural side, one of the benefits is we've been working on our Supply Chain 2.0 program and the inbuilt fulfillment center comes online later this year. That will provide some additional flexibility and agility. So that will certainly be helpful. And as Michele said, continuing to invest where we need to on capacity, especially on those fast-growing core brands, like Reese's. From a cost standpoint and getting into some of the pieces, clearly, like you said, Andrew, putting that much pressure on the supply chain at one time pushed us in a number of spots, it pushed us from an overtime standpoint, it pushed us from getting to contract manufacturers and expanding some of their work often outside the contract rate and the same on the freight and warehousing side.
So I look at those as pressure points in particular on top of that or as a result of the higher volume. And then in addition, I'd say labor rates in general and labor availability in general are a pressure points beyond just volume. The market for labor is challenging. And so just like everyone, we want to make sure we are staying ahead of the curve on hiring, making sure our value proposition in our plants is attractive and packaging inflation is similar. Packaging inflation, we touched on a little bit on the last call. It's still a pressure point. I think we're still optimistic we're going to see that moderate as we go forward, but we haven't seen it yet. And so it is a combination of those transitory costs on the back of the higher volume and a few things that are a little bit more sticky here as we look across the balance of the year."

And of course, implied inside our guidance for the balance of the year is a little softening of the gross margin outlook from being up slightly to being in line with last year. And I think that performance in face of the inflation that we've seen would be good. But our goal, again, looking to next year, building on the last question a little bit is we want to continue to grow gross margin over time. And we want to do that through a pricing strategy. We want to do that through productivity. We want to do that through all the levers to manage inflation and commodity costs. And so driving that forward remains an important goal. We'll give more color on next year's gross margin as we get closer to the end of the year, but that goal remains firmly in our mind."

The other thing I would say is Lily's is single-mindedly focused on better-for-you. So while it is premium, it has a very distinct understandable benefit that those consumers understand, which is about being the lack of sugar. So that also gives us a lot of confidence, but it fits very neatly into our operating model. As you know, we have already launched a broader portfolio of better-for-you on our core brands.

So I guess I had 2 questions related to that. One is if supply chains are kind of running all out, just how you think about stimulating demand when there's some challenges in terms of just getting product on the shelf?
And I guess the second is just as you step back and you look at all these different dynamics in the economy and the environment in general, it's definitely a situation that is in some ways unique. So just your perspective, have you seen some of this before? And maybe just how you're thinking about approaching planning for the business over the next, I don't know, 12 to 24 months, if we continue to be in this type of environment?"

It's certainly something that we spend a lot of time thinking about and working on. And I guess what I would say is, yes, we do realize that it is somewhat of a volatile time still, certainly with all the talk of the Delta variant and CDC guidance recently. So too much of a reminder that we clearly aren't fully out of the pandemic. And I personally believe, in September, we know that a lot of companies are implementing kind of a return to office. It seems like a lot of companies are doing that then, kids going back to school. And so there will be more for all of us to learn about consumer behaviors and what some of those changes mean for that.
The way that we think about the supply chain and managing where we are right now is, I guess, in a couple of ways. So how do we maximize -- how do we efficiently maximize and profitably maximize revenue. And so one of the key things we do focus on is really looking across the portfolio and focusing on really maxing out where we have available capacity and leaning into some of those brands and businesses with greater investment, reallocating investment to those businesses so that we can really take full advantage of that.
If there are areas in the portfolio where we -- like a Reese's, for example. I think we keep pointing it out as an example because it's such a big piece of our business and growing at such a hefty rate. We have total confidence making big capacity investments on that one just because of the track record and the dynamics around that. And then -- so we'll invest in capacity as a piece of that. And then there are parts of the portfolio where we're not going to lean in right away in investing capacity because we want things to play out a bit here more. So we really leverage the breadth, one of the strengths we have is the breadth of our portfolio. We've got our seasonal portfolio. It's the consumable take home. We have a range of different brands. And so we really try and leverage that as best possible to manage through.
So it's kind of a balance of investing to build supply chain even stronger, which we're always doing, but we're doing even more of that right now. Doing what we need now, kind of no regret move and then planning for the future from a contingency perspective, depending on what the potential outcomes are."

And they had, as we all know, tremendous issues with out of stocks. And so their goal is to make sure they remain in stock. In fact, right now, we've seen retailers really lean in a bit to inventory and carry a bit more inventory than they have in the past because I think there's a little bit of a scarcity mentality. They want to make sure they have product. They also know that manufacturers are taking price. And so in some cases, it may allow them to hedge a little bit there.
So I think it is definitely a focal area and, of course, something that we always focus on and are proud of how we've been able to deliver for retailers because they've continued to come to us, given how we were able to deliver during the worst of the pandemic last year and have continued to rely on us this year."

I guess it should not come as a surprise that 15% organic sales growth in a given quarter would kind of stress any supply chain, no matter how efficient.

Or is it simply you sort of suck up the higher cost as they're transitory, particularly the labor part and not need to necessarily make any changes as this sort of volume growth is really not likely sustainable at these extreme elevated levels?"

I would add to on the structural side, one of the benefits is we've been working on our Supply Chain 2.0 program and the inbuilt fulfillment center comes online later this year. That will provide some additional flexibility and agility. So that will certainly be helpful. And as Michele said, continuing to invest where we need to on capacity, especially on those fast-growing core brands, like Reese's. From a cost standpoint and getting into some of the pieces, clearly, like you said, Andrew, putting that much pressure on the supply chain at one time pushed us in a number of spots, it pushed us from an overtime standpoint, it pushed us from getting to contract manufacturers and expanding some of their work often outside the contract rate and the same on the freight and warehousing side.
So I look at those as pressure points in particular on top of that or as a result of the higher volume. And then in addition, I'd say labor rates in general and labor availability in general are a pressure points beyond just volume. The market for labor is challenging. And so just like everyone, we want to make sure we are staying ahead of the curve on hiring, making sure our value proposition in our plants is attractive and packaging inflation is similar. Packaging inflation, we touched on a little bit on the last call. It's still a pressure point. I think we're still optimistic we're going to see that moderate as we go forward, but we haven't seen it yet. And so it is a combination of those transitory costs on the back of the higher volume and a few things that are a little bit more sticky here as we look across the balance of the year."

We want to do that through productivity. We want to do that through all the levers to manage inflation and commodity costs. And so driving that forward remains an important goal.

The other thing I would say is Lily's is single-mindedly focused on better-for-you. So while it is premium, it has a very distinct understandable benefit that those consumers understand, which is about being the lack of sugar. So that also gives us a lot of confidence, but it fits very neatly into our operating model. As you know, we have already launched a broader portfolio of better-for-you on our core brands.

One is if supply chains are kind of running all out, just how you think about stimulating demand when there's some challenges in terms of just getting product on the shelf?
And I guess the second is just as you step back and you look at all these different dynamics in the economy and the environment in general, it's definitely a situation that is in some ways unique.

It's certainly something that we spend a lot of time thinking about and working on. And I guess what I would say is, yes, we do realize that it is somewhat of a volatile time still, certainly with all the talk of the Delta variant and CDC guidance recently. So too much of a reminder that we clearly aren't fully out of the pandemic. And I personally believe, in September, we know that a lot of companies are implementing kind of a return to office. It seems like a lot of companies are doing that then, kids going back to school. And so there will be more for all of us to learn about consumer behaviors and what some of those changes mean for that.
The way that we think about the supply chain and managing where we are right now is, I guess, in a couple of ways. So how do we maximize -- how do we efficiently maximize and profitably maximize revenue. And so one of the key things we do focus on is really looking across the portfolio and focusing on really maxing out where we have available capacity and leaning into some of those brands and businesses with greater investment, reallocating investment to those businesses so that we can really take full advantage of that.
If there are areas in the portfolio where we -- like a Reese's, for example. I think we keep pointing it out as an example because it's such a big piece of our business and growing at such a hefty rate. We have total confidence making big capacity investments on that one just because of the track record and the dynamics around that. And then -- so we'll invest in capacity as a piece of that. And then there are parts of the portfolio where we're not going to lean in right away in investing capacity because we want things to play out a bit here more. So we really leverage the breadth, one of the strengths we have is the breadth of our portfolio. We've got our seasonal portfolio. It's the consumable take home. We have a range of different brands. And so we really try and leverage that as best possible to manage through.
So it's kind of a balance of investing to build supply chain even stronger, which we're always doing, but we're doing even more of that right now. Doing what we need now, kind of no regret move and then planning for the future from a contingency perspective, depending on what the potential outcomes are."

And they had, as we all know, tremendous issues with out of stocks. And so their goal is to make sure they remain in stock. In fact, right now, we've seen retailers really lean in a bit to inventory and carry a bit more inventory than they have in the past because I think there's a little bit of a scarcity mentality. They want to make sure they have product. They also know that manufacturers are taking price. And so in some cases, it may allow them to hedge a little bit there.
So I think it is definitely a focal area and, of course, something that we always focus on and are proud of how we've been able to deliver for retailers because they've continued to come to us, given how we were able to deliver during the worst of the pandemic last year and have continued to rely on us this year."

Our business continued to excel in the second quarter with robust recovery in away-from-home consumption and international markets and sustained elevated at-home consumption. This strong consumer demand, coupled with our executional excellence, healthy balance sheet and relentless focus on delivering against our strategic initiatives enabled us to support and expand our portfolio, invest in our people and deliver strong shareholder returns during the second quarter. 
Net sales grew 16.5% in the second quarter and adjusted EPS grew over 12%. Our market share remains well above pre-COVID-19 levels, with our confectionery share 135 basis points higher and our snacking share 200 basis points higher than the same period in 2019. We also added another fast-growing on-trend brand to the portfolio with the acquisition of Lilly's. These great tasting, low-sugar and premium-priced products allow us to capture incremental consumers and occasions. Our excellent business performance and financial strength also enabled us to increase capital expenditures supporting core brands capacity and IT infrastructure, pay down debt, buy back shares and announced a 12% increase in our dividend. While the environment remains volatile and post COVID-19 trends are still evolving, we are confident in our ability to adapt with our consumers and retailers to meet their needs in the future and to continue to deliver advantaged financial results. 
In the second quarter, we saw healthy 1-year and 2-year trends in our confection brands driven primarily by increases in chocolate consumption whether it's at home or away from home, chocolate has provided consumers with comfort during stressful times and helped make time with family and friends even more special. NPD estimates chocolate per capita consumption increased 9% during the first year of the pandemic and retail sales have remained elevated since that time. As we enter the second half of the year and begin lapping our strongest performance from a year ago, we do expect sales growth to moderate. We will be closely monitoring consumer behavior to evaluate the sustainability of recent gains and implications to our performance in 2022 and beyond. 
So let me share an update on some of the consumer trends we saw in the second quarter and our current expectations for the second half. I'll start with areas of sustained strength.  Brands and occasions that are building on last year's gains. Hershey's retail sales grew over 10% during the latest 12 weeks, building upon last year's growth of 16% during the same period. This increase was across both core and innovation. Core velocities grew behind new packaging designs higher levels of advertising, more effective media and increased merchandising support, including the return of NCAA events, such as March Madness  Our recent innovation continues to be strong, leading with our instant consumable products, including the Reese's Pretzel and limited edition peanut butter lovers items. Over the past 3 years, our Reese's brand solidified its leadership position in confection, becoming a $2.5 billion brand growing at a CAGR of over 8% and and gaining 150 basis points of marketplace share. 
We have added 3 new manufacturing lines over the past 4 years and are adding another next year to further expand capacity and better service the strong growth. We expect continued strength in this franchise in the second half and beyond. Our Tinkles brand grew retail sales 2% in the second quarter on top of 6% growth during the year ago period. During COVID-19, consumers purchased more Twizzlers products to snack on during road trips, share with family members at home and during screen time, which is the #1 consumption occasion for this brand. 
Last year, we not only added households but also increased frequency and buy rate. To continue this momentum, the team took a holistic approach across all key levers, including media, innovation, pricing, distribution and merchandising. The team leveraged last year's strength to secure secondary placement this summer at key retailers to further bolster velocity. Our mystery flavor, limited edition drove 4.4 billion impressions and has had strong sell-through. We partnered with Fandango to provide Twizzlers buyers a promotional code to watch a movie while enjoying their Twizzlers products, which also enabled us to partner with Universal Studios and highlight movie on our merchandising units to bring even more consumer engagement in store. We expect growth to continue over the next several months despite difficult comparisons. Within seasons, we saw high levels of consumer participation in the first half and our second half seasonal sell-in has gone well. Consumers are excited to carry forward new traditions created last year and returned to some old favorites. While the way consumers celebrate these occasions may continue to evolve, we know these rituals and memories made with family and friends remain incredibly important and our brands play a key role. Halloween began shipping last month and our retail teams have already created some fantastic displays to capitalize on the increased foot traffic we've seen in stores. Sidney Pop has also continued to perform extremely well, with growth of over 25% over the last 12 weeks and share gains of 275 basis points within ready-to-eat popcorn. This is on top of growth of 5% during the same period last year and has been driven by distribution gains on our multipack offerings and elevated base velocities from our increased media investment. Household penetration has increased 420 basis points since we purchased the brand with gains coming in both at home and on-the-go occasions, and we are excited to build on this momentum in the second half. As I mentioned earlier, while at-home consumption remained higher than pre-COVID-19 levels in the second quarter. We Also saw a robust recovery in away-from-home consumption as we cycled the most severe declines in consumer mobility from last year. Net sales in our food service and specialty retail channels, grew 40%, recovering most of last year's losses. Our chocolate instant consumables business grew 6% in measured channels, driven by increased trips to convenience stores. Recall that trends in these channels improved over the course of last year as consumer mobility increased. 
Therefore, we do expect trends to moderate as we progress through the remainder of this year. We also saw improvements within our refreshment business with growth of over 25% in the last 12 weeks. While we are encouraged by the improvement in category sales and our strong share gains of over 200 basis points in this period. The category remains below pre-COVID-19 levels as some consumers continue to work from home, wear masks and practice social distancing. We expect trends to improve as we progress through the year but remain below pre-COVID-19 levels. Our Pirate's Booty and on nutrition bar brands showed significant growth against challenged performance in Q2 of 2020. 
Pirate's Booty sales were impacted by the shift to remote schooling and trends improved notably as we lapped last year's closures and more students returned to the classroom. Retail sales grew approximately 25% in the last 12 weeks, resulting in a 2-year share gain of over 20%. One nutrition bars have also rebounded with retail sales growth of 18% over the last 12 weeks, consistent with broader category trends. This more than offset last year's declines with sales approximately 3% higher than Q2 of 2019. Within our International and Other segment, we saw robust reported net sales growth of 70% in the second quarter against last year's second quarter declines of 38%, bringing 2-year growth to approximately 6%. This sales growth, along with the changes we've made to our operating model in China drove strong increases in segment profitability. While the teams have focused on managing COVID-19 volatility, they have also continued to drive progress against our strategies to increase brand awareness and distribution. Let me share 2 great examples of this from the past quarter. The first is our I Love Reis's Day campaign, which was our first multi-country campaign, and executed both in stores and online in Canada, the U.K. and Brazil. This activation provided messaging consistency and higher consumer reach within the same level of investment as a 1-country campaign. The results were fantastic driving double-digit sales growth and tripling brand engagement. Another great example was our Hershey campaign which originated in Brazil and gained participation in all major markets this year. For the campaign, we've changed the wrappers of our iconic Hershey's milk chocolate bars to feature important women who are making a difference and having a positive impact on our society. 
Hershey's bars became a canvas for the beautiful stories of union heroes, and gave more voice and visibility to these deserving women. The campaign increased brand awareness by 300 basis points, and the team's plan to build on this year's success in 2022. Finally, let me spend a few minutes on areas of the business that are below prior year levels but significantly ahead of pre-COVID-19 levels. Last summer, we had a stellar savor season as consumers invested in their homes and spent more time together with close family and friends outside during the pandemic. Our teams did a fantastic job monitoring and responding to significant changes in consumer demand last year, and we are leveraging many of the same capabilities this year. To date, Sales for the season are slightly below last year, but well ahead of 2019 levels. As expected, increased mobility is having a slight negative impact. Additionally, high temperatures, particularly in the West, are also having a negative impact on performance. 
The teams are continuing to monitor trends and pivot both messaging and supply accordingly, as these weather patterns evolve. Sales for our baking products were down 18% in the latest 12 weeks, lapping 30% growth in the year ago period. While we have seen some declines in at-home baking as consumer mobility has increased, sales for this part of our portfolio remain well ahead of pre-COVID-19 levels. 
Sales for our Coco, chip and syrup products in the second quarter were approximately 10% higher than the same period in 2019. We have also seen a shift back to in-store shopping over the past several months as consumer mobility improves. As a result, we did see a decline in our e-commerce sales during the quarter of approximately 30% and which was more than offset by growth in our brick-and-mortar channel as the teams did a fantastic job converting shoppers as they return to stores. Despite the declines versus last year, e-commerce sales were still up significantly versus pre-COVID levels with growth of over 100% versus the second quarter of 2019. The our year-to-date growth in the channel is over 7%, and we continue to believe e-commerce will remain an important channel for consumers and retailers in the future. While the U.S. has made tremendous progress recovering from COVID-19, the recent rise in cases in the U.S. and continued struggles in many international markets are a reminder that the world is not yet through the pandemic and business volatility and uncertainty is likely to persist. Change has become a constant and our teams have shown tremendous adaptability at dealing with change and turning it into opportunity. 
We will continue to invest in our people, our brands and our capabilities, and we believe we have the right strategies to continue meeting our consumers' needs and delivering strong financial performance for years to come. Now let me turn it over to Steve to provide more details on our financial results and outlook."

As Michelle shared, second quarter results exceeded expectations delivering a second consecutive quarter of double-digit net sales and adjusted earnings per share growth. Robust COVID-19 recovery, together wit",1464,"Thanks, Michelle, and good morning, everyone. As Michelle shared, second quarter results exceeded expectations delivering a second consecutive quarter of double-digit net sales and adjusted earnings per share growth. Robust COVID-19 recovery, together with the continued strength of our take-home portfolio, and retailer and distributor inventory replenishment drove balanced top and bottom line growth despite cost pressures and incremental tax reserves in the quarter. Strong delivery of our financial commitments was complemented by a balanced use of cash. In fact, in the quarter, we executed against every capital allocation lever investing in future growth while providing returns to shareholders with a consistent track record of delivering growth, profitability and cash generation, we are confident in our ability to drive shareholder value creation now and into the future. 
In the North America segment, reported net sales growth of 12.3% in the quarter was driven primarily by volume. Volume gains resulted from the dual strength of away-from-home and at-home consumption, exceeding expectations, while retailer inventory replenishment contributed 130 basis points to growth in line with expectations. North America net sales growth outpaced U.S. retail takeaway in the second quarter due to robust recovery of away-from-home consumption, U.S. retailer and distributor inventory replenishment and strong performance in Canada. As Michelle shared, our food service and specialty retail businesses grew 40% in the second quarter, though both remained slightly below 2019 levels. In the second half of the year, we expect the growth in away-from-home consumption to moderate as we lap improved mobility in the second half of 2020. As expected, retail and distributor inventory provided a tailwind in the first half of the year as retailers and distributors carried elevated inventory across the store, though we do expect this to moderate in the second half as inventories return to more historical levels. 
Canada also contributed nicely to net sales growth in the quarter, Canada's reported net sales were up double digits versus the year ago period and on a 2-year basis. Similar to the U.S., Canada has benefited from strong at-home chocolate consumption and baking as well as the recovery of away-from-home consumption. In the second half of the year, we expect net sales to continue to outpace U.S. retail takeaway though to a lesser extent than the first half driven by the continued recovery in nonmeasured channels. In the International and Other segment, Constant currency net sales grew at 64.5% in the second quarter and 14.9% on a 2-year basis. Our international markets recovered ahead of our expectations, driven by volume in the quarter, complemented by net price realization. Despite the rise in case counts and lockdowns we saw in early April, stores largely remained open in the second quarter. minimizing business disruption. While some uncertainty related to COVID-19 remains in these markets, we are pleased with the team's effort to manage both the recovery and our strategic growth imperatives. We could not be more pleased with the exceptional start to the year, with reported net sales growth of 14.4%, reported earnings per share growth of 29.8% and and adjusted earnings per share growth of 15.3% in the first half. In the second half of the year, we expect net sales growth to moderate in each segment and for the total company. In the North America segment, sales increases resulting from the continued away-from-home recovery, price realization and the acquisition of Lilly's are anticipated to be partially offset by declines in at-home chocolate consumption, retailer inventory depletion and fewer shipping days. 
In the International and Other segment, we expect COVID-19 recovery to continue though providing a smaller benefit as we lap improved mobility in the second half of last year. Our strong volume gains in the second quarter on top of our advantaged margin structure, allowed us to deliver a 16.4% increase in adjusted gross profit, while managing a challenging operating and inflationary environment. Second quarter adjusted gross margin was flat versus the prior year at 46.4% as higher fixed cost leverage in both segments, offset higher supply chain costs due to both incremental demand and inflation in the North America segment. 
In the North America segment, gross margin decreased 50 basis points to 47% in the second quarter. Higher volume in the second quarter drove an increase in supply chain costs, including overtime at our manufacturing sites higher volumes produced at contract manufacturing sites, freight and warehousing costs, higher labor costs and packaging inflation. These pressures were partially offset by higher sales productivity initiatives and lower COVID-19-related costs versus the prior year period. In the second half of the year, we expect increased packaging and freight costs to continue. We also expect labor costs to remain elevated as higher levels of marketplace attrition contribute to more overtime and accelerated hiring to keep pace with demand. While we expect more price realization in the second half versus the first half, we also expect less sales volume benefits. In the International and Other segment, gross margin was 41.4% in the second quarter, an increase of 850 basis points from the prior year, roughly in line with gross margin in 2019. Volume gains provided favorable fixed cost leverage in the second quarter, and we expect fixed cost leverage to continue to be a benefit in the second half of the year, though to a lesser extent as sales growth moderates. 
Overall, full year gross margin is expected to be slightly less than our previous estimates due to higher supply chain and labor costs to service demand in the North America segment. In North America, advertising and related consumer marketing spend increased 8.4% in the second quarter. This was driven by a slight increase in advertising spend across our portfolio including spend to support core chocolate innovation such as KitKat thins, Zero Sugar and organic and snack brands, SkinnyPop and Pirate's Booty along with reactivated sponsorship of NCAA March Madness and the Olympics. In the International and Other segment, advertising and related consumer spending increased nearly 30% to support the COVID-19 related sales recovery we saw during the quarter. Corporate expenses increased 38.2% in the second quarter, driven by higher incentive compensation accruals and planned elevated capability investments and medical claims against deflated 2020 levels due to COVID-19. 
The adjusted effective income tax rate was 27.4% in the second quarter, an increase of 8% or approximately $50 million versus the prior year period. This rate increase was driven by incremental tax reserves incurred in connection with an adverse ruling on a non-U.S. tax litigation matter as well as lower tax credits versus the year ago period. We now expect our full year reported and adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 17% to 18%. 
Despite this tax headwind, Q2 adjusted EPS was $1.47 or 12.2% versus the prior year. Strong sales performance and operating leverage drove strong cash flow in the quarter. enabling us to execute every lever of our capital allocation flywheel. Let's begin with the acquisition of Lilly's, as Michelle shared, we are excited to add this highly incremental on-trend brand to our confection portfolio. The brand has net sales of roughly $100 million, with margins comparable to our recent acquisitions, and is expected to be slightly accretive to earnings in year 1. 
Next, let's move to CapEx. Total capital additions, including software, were approximately $113 million in the second quarter, and our full year CapEx outlook remains consistent with prior guidance at $550 million. Our agile fulfillment center is on track to be operational in the fourth quarter, initially providing assortment bag capacity. We continue to invest in capacity across our portfolio to meet the demands of retailers and consumers with payday being brought online in Q4. Our ERP project is on track to be rolled out to our international markets next year in the U.S. in 2023. Now to dividends, share repurchases and repayment of debt. In the second quarter, we paid $161 million in cash dividends. And as Michelle shared, we announced a 12% increase in our dividends starting in September. This double-digit increase reinforces our commitment to return cash to our shareholders and to maintain a healthy payout ratio. In addition to stock option replenishment, we deployed $150 million to repurchase shares related to our strategic buyback program. 
Approximately $110 million remain available under this repurchase program, and we received board approval for an incremental $500 million repurchase program. Finally, we've repaid $350 million of bonds in May with no additional long-term debt due until 2023. I could not be more pleased with the position we are in as we approach the second half of the year. We have a strong outlook, balance sheet flexibility and a plan to deliver an above algorithm year. while investing in our future. With that, I'll turn it back to Michele for closing remarks."

So let me share an update on some of the consumer trends we saw in the second quarter and our current expectations for the second half. I'll start with areas of sustained strength, brands and occasions that are building on last year's gains. Reese's retail sales grew over 10% during the latest 12 weeks, building upon last year's growth of 16% during the same period. This increase was across both core and innovation. Core velocities grew behind new packaging designs, higher levels of advertising, more effective media and increased merchandising support, including the return of NCAA events, such as March Madness.

Our Pirate's Booty and ONE nutrition bar brands showed significant growth against challenged performance in Q2 of 2020. Pirate's Booty sales were impacted by the shift to remote schooling, and trends improved notably as we lapped last year's closures and more students returned to the classroom. Retail sales grew approximately 25% in the last 12 weeks, resulting in a 2-year share gain of over 20%. ONE nutrition bars have also rebounded, with retail sales growth of 18% over the last 12 weeks, consistent with broader category trends. This more than offset last year's declines with sales approximately 3% higher than Q2 of 2019.
Within our International and Other segment, we saw robust reported net sales growth of 70% in the second quarter against last year's second quarter declines of 38%, bringing 2-year growth to approximately 6%. This sales growth, along with the changes we've made to our operating model in China drove strong increases in segment profitability. While the teams have focused on managing COVID-19 volatility, they have also continued to drive progress against our strategies to increase brand awareness and distribution.
Let me share 2 great examples of this from the past quarter. The first is our I Love Reese's Day campaign, which was our first multi-country campaign, and executed both in stores and online in Canada, the U.K. and Brazil. This activation provided messaging consistency and higher consumer reach within the same level of investment as a one-country campaign. The results were fantastic, driving double-digit sales growth and tripling brand engagement.
Another great example was our HerShe campaign, which originated in Brazil and gained participation in all major markets this year. For the campaign, we changed the wrappers of our iconic Hershey's Milk Chocolate bars to feature important women who are making a difference and having a positive impact on our society. Hershey's bars became a canvas for the beautiful stories of unsung Sheroes and gave more voice and visibility to these deserving women. The campaign increased brand awareness by 300 basis points, and the team's plan to build on this year's success in 2022.
Finally, let me spend a few minutes on areas of the business that are below prior year levels but significantly ahead of pre-COVID-19 levels. Last summer, we had a stellar S'mores season as consumers invested in their homes and spent more time together with close family and friends outside during the pandemic. Our teams did a fantastic job monitoring and responding to significant changes in consumer demand last year, and we are leveraging many of the same capabilities this year.
To date, sales for the season are slightly below last year, but well ahead of 2019 levels. As expected, increased mobility is having a slight negative impact. Additionally, high temperatures, particularly in the west, are also having a negative impact on performance. The teams are continuing to monitor trends and pivot both messaging and supply accordingly, as these weather patterns evolve.
Sales for our baking products were down 18% in the latest 12 weeks, lapping 30% growth in the year ago period. While we have seen some declines in at-home baking as consumer mobility has increased, sales for this part of our portfolio remain well ahead of pre-COVID-19 levels. Sales for our cocoa, chip and syrup products in the second quarter were approximately 10% higher than the same period in 2019.
We have also seen a shift back to in-store shopping over the past several months as consumer mobility improves. As a result, we did see a decline in our e-commerce sales during the quarter of approximately 30%, which was more than offset by growth in our brick-and-mortar channel as the teams did a fantastic job converting shoppers as they return to stores. Despite the declines versus last year, e-commerce sales were still up significantly versus pre-COVID levels with growth of over 100% versus the second quarter of 2019. Our year-to-date growth in the channel is over 7%, and we continue to believe e-commerce will remain an important channel for consumers and retailers in the future.
While the U.S. has made tremendous progress recovering from COVID-19, the recent rise in cases in the U.S. and continued struggles in many international markets are a reminder that the world is not yet through the pandemic and business volatility and uncertainty is likely to persist. Change has become a constant, and our teams have shown tremendous adaptability at dealing with change and turning it into opportunity. We will continue to invest in our people, our brands and our capabilities, and we believe we have the right strategies to continue meeting our consumers' needs and delivering strong financial performance for years to come.
Now let me turn it over to Steve to provide more details on our financial results and outlook."

As Michele shared, second quarter results exceeded expectations, delivering a second consecutive quarter of double-digit net sales and adjusted earnings per share growth. Robust COVID-19 recovery, together with",1464,"Thanks, Michele, and good morning, everyone. As Michele shared, second quarter results exceeded expectations, delivering a second consecutive quarter of double-digit net sales and adjusted earnings per share growth. Robust COVID-19 recovery, together with the continued strength of our take-home portfolio, and retailer and distributor inventory replenishment drove balanced top and bottom line growth despite cost pressures and incremental tax reserves in the quarter.
Strong delivery of our financial commitments was complemented by a balanced use of cash. In fact, in the quarter, we executed against every capital allocation lever, investing in future growth while providing returns to shareholders. With a consistent track record of delivering growth, profitability and cash generation, we are confident in our ability to drive shareholder value creation now and into the future.
In the North America segment, reported net sales growth of 12.3% in the quarter was driven primarily by volume. Volume gains resulted from the dual strength of away-from-home and at-home consumption, exceeding expectations, while retailer inventory replenishment contributed 130 basis points to growth, in line with expectations. North America net sales growth outpaced U.S. retail takeaway in the second quarter due to robust recovery of away-from-home consumption, U.S. retailer and distributor inventory replenishment and strong performance in Canada.
As Michele shared, our food service and specialty retail businesses grew 40% in the second quarter, though both remained slightly below 2019 levels. In the second half of the year, we expect the growth in away-from-home consumption to moderate as we lap improved mobility in the second half of 2020. As expected, retail and distributor inventory provided a tailwind in the first half of the year as retailers and distributors carried elevated inventory across the store, though we do expect this to moderate in the second half as inventories return to more historical levels.
Canada also contributed nicely to net sales growth in the quarter. Canada's reported net sales were up double digits versus the year ago period and on a 2-year basis. Similar to the U.S., Canada has benefited from strong at-home chocolate consumption and baking as well as the recovery of away-from-home consumption. In the second half of the year, we expect net sales to continue to outpace U.S. retail takeaway, though to a lesser extent than the first half, driven by the continued recovery in non measured channels.
In the International and Other segment, constant currency net sales grew at 64.5% in the second quarter and 14.9% on a 2-year basis. Our international markets recovered ahead of our expectations, driven by volume in the quarter, complemented by net price realization.
Despite the rise in case counts and lockdowns we saw in early April, stores largely remained open in the second quarter, minimizing business disruption. While some uncertainty related to COVID-19 remains in these markets, we are pleased with the team's effort to manage both the recovery and our strategic growth imperatives.
We could not be more pleased with the exceptional start to the year, with reported net sales growth of 14.4%, reported earnings per share growth of 29.8% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 15.3% in the first half. In the second half of the year, we expect net sales growth to moderate in each segment and for the total company.
In the North America segment, sales increases resulting from the continued away-from-home recovery, price realization and the acquisition of Lily's are anticipated to be partially offset by declines in at-home chocolate consumption, retailer inventory depletion and fewer shipping days. In the International and Other segment, we expect COVID-19 recovery to continue, though providing a smaller benefit as we lap improved mobility in the second half of last year.
Our strong volume gains in the second quarter on top of our advantaged margin structure, allowed us to deliver a 16.4% increase in adjusted gross profit, while managing a challenging operating and inflationary environment. Second quarter adjusted gross margin was flat versus the prior year at 46.4% as higher fixed cost leverage in both segments offset higher supply chain costs due to both incremental demand and inflation in the North America segment.
In the North America segment, gross margin decreased 50 basis points to 47% in the second quarter. Higher volume in the second quarter drove an increase in supply chain costs, including overtime at our manufacturing sites, higher volumes produced at contract manufacturing sites, freight and warehousing costs, higher labor costs and packaging inflation. These pressures were partially offset by higher sales productivity initiatives and lower COVID-19-related costs versus the prior year period.
In the second half of the year, we expect increased packaging and freight costs to continue. We also expect labor costs to remain elevated as higher levels of marketplace attrition contribute to more overtime and accelerated hiring to keep pace with demand. While we expect more price realization in the second half versus the first half, we also expect less sales volume benefits.
In the International and Other segment, gross margin was 41.4% in the second quarter, an increase of 850 basis points from the prior year, roughly in line with gross margin in 2019. Volume gains provided favorable fixed cost leverage in the second quarter, and we expect fixed cost leverage to continue to be a benefit in the second half of the year, though to a lesser extent as sales growth moderates. Overall, full year gross margin is expected to be slightly less than our previous estimates due to higher supply chain and labor costs to service demand in the North America segment.
In North America, advertising and related consumer marketing spend increased 8.4% in the second quarter. This was driven by a slight increase in advertising spend across our portfolio, including spend to support core chocolate innovation such as Kit Kat thins, Zero Sugar and Organic and snack brands, SkinnyPop and Pirate's Booty, along with reactivated sponsorship of NCAA March Madness and the Olympics.
In the International and Other segment, advertising and related consumer spending increased nearly 30% to support the COVID-19-related sales recovery we saw during the quarter. Corporate expenses increased 38.2% in the second quarter, driven by higher incentive compensation accruals and planned elevated capability investments and medical claims against deflated 2020 levels due to COVID-19.
The adjusted effective income tax rate was 27.4% in the second quarter, an increase of 8% or approximately $50 million versus the prior year period. This rate increase was driven by incremental tax reserves incurred in connection with an adverse ruling on a non-U.S. tax litigation matter as well as lower tax credits versus the year ago period. We now expect our full year reported and adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 17% to 18%. Despite this tax headwind, Q2 adjusted EPS was $1.47 or 12.2% versus the prior year.
Strong sales performance and operating leverage drove strong cash flow in the quarter, enabling us to execute every lever of our capital allocation flywheel. Let's begin with the acquisition of Lily's. As Michele shared, we are excited to add this highly incremental, on-trend brand to our confection portfolio. The brand has net sales of roughly $100 million, with margins comparable to our recent acquisitions, and is expected to be slightly accretive to earnings in year 1.
Next, let's move to CapEx. Total capital additions, including software, were approximately $113 million in the second quarter, and our full year CapEx outlook remains consistent with prior guidance at $550 million.
Our agile fulfillment center is on track to be operational in the fourth quarter, initially providing assortment bag capacity. We continue to invest in capacity across our portfolio to meet the demands of retailers and consumers with PAYDAY being brought online in Q4. Our ERP project is on track to be rolled out to our international markets next year in the U.S. in 2023.
Now to dividends, share repurchases and repayment of debt. In the second quarter, we paid $161 million in cash dividends. And as Michele shared, we announced a 12% increase in our dividends starting in September. This double-digit increase reinforces our commitment to return cash to our shareholders and to maintain a healthy payout ratio.
In addition to stock option replenishment, we deployed $150 million to repurchase shares related to our strategic buyback program. Approximately $110 million remain available under this repurchase program, and we received Board approval for an incremental $500 million repurchase program. Finally, we've repaid $350 million of bonds in May with no additional long-term debt due until 2023.
I could not be more pleased with the position we are in as we approach the second half of the year. We have a strong outlook, balance sheet flexibility and a plan to deliver an above algorithm year, while investing in our future.
With that, I'll turn it back to Michele for closing remarks."

So as we look at the growth that we've seen, the category growth has really been pretty broad-based. It's really cut across regions, it's cut across cohorts. As we speak with consumers, we hear that some of that elevation of those take-home behaviors and new routines that occurred during COVID that some of those will stick and sustain, perhaps not all of them, not to the degree to which people were suggested that they shouldn't leave their homes. But we do believe that some of those will stick and stay around based on what we're hearing and seeing. And we do also see some of that continued strength as people are out and about in mobility increases and that we're seeing a pretty good balance there. 
The other thing we've heard from consumers repeatedly that we've seen over the years is kind of the emotional aspect of the category and how it fits with kind of good and happy moments. And as those happy moments have continued to increase as people, I think, are starting to believe they see somewhat of a light at the end of the tunnel in us working through the pandemic those moments of happiness that were really associated with we see continuing. So that's really our perspective is a lot of those routines, we think some of which will just continue into the future. 
That said, there are a lot of unknowns. We certainly -- none of us know -- knew any of this was going to happen, and so we can't perfectly predict the future. As it comes to capacity investments, what we've tried to do is be really prudent in our investment strategy. So we've leaned in, in places on brands where we have clearly seen sustained growth over time. And there's a lot of proof points that, that capacity will pay off. Reese's is a great example of that. 
Frankly, there are a couple of other places where we had elevated demand that we held for a bit before leaning into that capacity until we really thought we were at a point where we could guarantee the ROI. So it is a bit of a balancing act, but  at this point, we are bullish on the future."

So I would say over time, given that strong partnership we've had with retailers and particularly a lot of our category management expertise around analytics, we've always partnered with retailers in terms of how to think about the placement of confection in their store and ways to optimize category growth, whether that's looking at heat maps of how people travel through convenience stores or years back when we found underutilized space under the checkout counter and convenience stores, and we put the category there. 
Recently, a lot of the focus from our retailers -- or there's been a big focus around the labor shortage and thus, a push for even more presence of self-checkout. And so we've partnered really closely with those retailers to increase the presence of the category at self-checkout and to maximize the presence in those queuing lines leading up to checkout and particularly self-checkout. I mean, it's a perfect fit with some of the struggles they're having around labor and a great opportunity to get the category out there and make sure that people don't miss that chance to have that last impulse purchase. 
So I think our retailers are always focused on what's going on in the environment that they need to address in terms of their store layout. And fortunately, we've been able to help them with some of that."

I certainly understand all the moving parts on the supply chain right now, which which makes getting overly specific, right, on '22, certainly a bit of a challenge. But if we take it from the top line, consumption trends remain very elevated, Hershey has got more pricing coming through and has had inventories depleted for really what will be, I guess, 2 years in a row. So I would think all these things provide a reasonably good line of sight to at least kind of an on-algorithm sort of type of year, at least on sales in '22. Again, unless I'm sort of missing something and please point it out if I am. 
On the profitability side next year, obviously, you've already talked about, and I understand there will be supply chain pressures, at least through the first half of the year. I guess my question is, would you expect that year-over-year gross margin pressure to sort of sequentially improve as you move through the first half as sort of the pricing flows through and you make improvements to the supply chain? Or our gross margin pressures potentially expected to be as, let's say, severe in the first half is maybe what you're seeing in the back half of this year?"

Maybe I'll just start with the top line as you started. I think you're right. As we look at it today, it's hard to point to something that would say you don't have an on-algorithm top line.

As we look at it today, it's hard to point to something that would say you don't have an on-algorithm top line. We'll have momentum coming out of this year. We've got the long Easter. You mentioned pricing, which will be a bigger factor next year than it was this year. But we also would hope we see some capacity improvements would give us some upside. And then at some point, inventory replenishment, I think that's hard to call. but that -- we would expect to see some of that certainly over the course of next year. So still volatile, but I agree with the first premise. 
And then as you get into gross margin, I think there still are a lot of moving pieces. Some of the things I think we can directionally point to, obviously, the pricing will have a tailwind on gross margin. As we look at raw materials, raw material inflation wasn't a big factor for us, this year, we expect it will be a bigger factor as we look at next year. Logistics inflation that we're seeing now, I don't think we see a reason yet for that to break at least through the first half of next year. We'll have less spot market activity because some of the -- we'll be, say, better positioned for some of the stronger consumer demand than we were, particularly in the third quarter. 
We still expect to see some labor inflation. And as we said in the prepared remarks, we've increased headcount to respond to some of the additional demand. Packaging inflation and resins, I think we keep waiting for that to bring and it's probably moderated, but it hasn't reverted back to other levels or lower levels. So I think at least through the first half, we're going to see that still remain a pressure point. 
And then we'll see how capacity plays out in the broader supply chain network, the challenges we've had with logistics and trucks and warehousing and all of those labor implications. So when you step back from all of that, I'd say the gross margin piece still has a lot of moving pieces. And I think we'll give more clarity, obviously, when we get to February and provide full guidance. But right now, I'd say particularly through the first half of the year, we're going to see a lot of those cost pressures in place."

We remain committed to investing in brands at some of the highest levels in our industry across the peer group. So there's nothing that has changed about the strategy. So I want to be clear about that. Yes, as we looked at the decision, it really was driven by the fact that we have such elevated demand. And given that the supply chain challenges just wouldn't enable us to be able to to meet the further demand that we would create through our very impactful advertising that it just didn't make sense. It put more pressure on the supply chain. And also, we probably wouldn't get a good ROI because we wouldn't be able to fulfill that incremental demand. 
If we looked at our market share right now, we don't think that the advertising cuts that we have executed impacted our share in Q3. And we're not the only ones having supply chain challenges and issues. So overall, I think across the board, even in the industry, we're seeing a lot of people manage advertising to supply as a challenge. We'll continue to focus on optimizing it. We will invest as much as we can, as much as we think we can fill. Certainly, we're investing in capacity going forward, and we are very agile in how we're handling support behind our brands."

And seeing lots of very picked over sales out there as the mountain stores. It's going to be a good trick or treat based on everything we've heard from consumers as well as people really flock back to that behavior."

So we have very long focused and believed and operated in a way that we believe we are the best advocates for the needs of our people. We are in constant communication with our employees, and we're really focused on our total employee value proposition with those employees. We know that we have highly competitive wage rates, we have excellent benefits and we routinely benchmark all of that. But we're also very focused on the softer factors that are very important to our employees. And that includes, especially during these times of global supply chain challenge, work-life balance, stress management, flexibility in hours, being able to get time off. 
And so we have enacted a lot of strategies to really try and help with that. We have an always-on recruiting approach and we have really amplified our recruiting efforts this year to be able to successfully manage through the challenges and increase our net headcount. We've also leveraged analytics to, as I said, understand some of the things most important to our workforce. So we're very focused on that. We are very focused on prioritizing the needs of that group,; and continuing to look at ways that we can optimize the situation in terms of supply and demand. So we feel pretty good about that."

From a broad consumer perspective, overall trips to stores, both brick-and-mortar and e-commerce are up both versus 2020 and 2019. In-store trips have pretty much rebounded to the pre-pandemic levels. And in e-commerce, what we've seen is the trips have largely maintained versus last year, but we have seen the dollars per trip go down as many of those consumers who were more exclusively purchasing in e-commerce shifted more of their spend back into bricks and mortar. Most of the e-commerce shoppers are not exclusively e-commerce. They shop omnichannel. So we saw some of that shifting occur. 
Relative to our business, in particular, our e-commerce retail sales are up versus last year with our omnichannel partners despite the significant growth that we had a year ago and also despite the significant growth that we're seeing in bricks and mortar as well."

So as we look at the growth that we've seen, the category growth has really been pretty broad-based. It's really cut across regions, it's cut across cohorts. As we speak with consumers, we hear that some of that elevation of those take-home behaviors and new routines that occurred during COVID, that some of those will stick and sustain, perhaps not all of them, not to the degree to which people were suggested that they shouldn't leave their homes, but we do believe that some of those will stick and stay around based on what we're hearing and seeing. And we do also see some of that continued strength as people are out and about and mobility increases, and that we're seeing a pretty good balance there. 
The other thing we've heard from consumers repeatedly that we've seen over the years is kind of the emotional aspect of the category and how it fits with kind of good and happy moments. And as those happy moments have continued to increase, as people, I think, are starting to believe they see somewhat of a light at the end of the tunnel in us working through the pandemic, those moments of happiness that we're really associated with we see continuing. So that's really -- our perspective is a lot of those routines, we think some of which will just continue into the future. 
That said, there are a lot of unknowns. We certainly -- none of us know -- knew any of this was going to happen and so we can't perfectly predict the future. As it comes to capacity investments, what we've tried to do is be really prudent in our investment strategy. So we've leaned in, in places on brands where we have clearly seen sustained growth over time. And there's a lot of proof points that, that capacity will pay off. Reese's is a great example of that. Frankly, there are a couple of other places where we had elevated demand that we held for a bit before leaning into that capacity, until we really thought we were at a point where we could guarantee the ROI. So it is a bit of a balancing act. But at this point, we are bullish on the future."

So I would say over time, given that strong partnership we've had with retailers and particularly a lot of our category management expertise around analytics, we've always partnered with retailers in terms of how to think about the placement of confection in their store and ways to optimize category growth, whether that's looking at heat maps of how people travel through convenience stores, or years back when we found underutilized space under the checkout counter in convenience stores and we put the category there. 
Recently, a lot of the focus from our retailers, or there's been a big focus, around the labor shortage, and thus, a push for even more presence of self-checkout. And so we've partnered really closely with those retailers to increase the presence of the category at self-checkout and to maximize the presence in those queuing lines leading up to checkout and particularly self-checkout. I mean it's a perfect fit with some of the struggles they're having around labor and a great opportunity to get the category out there and make sure that people don't miss that chance to have that last impulse purchase. 
So I think our retailers are always focused on what's going on in the environment that they need to address in terms of their store layout. And fortunately, we've been able to help them with some of that."

I certainly understand all the moving parts on the supply chain right now, which makes getting overly specific, right, on '22 certainly a bit of a challenge. But if we take it from the top line, consumption trends remain very elevated. Hershey's got more pricing coming through and has had inventories depleted for really what will be, I guess, 2 years in a row. So I would think all these things provide a reasonably good line of sight to at least kind of an on-algorithm sort of type of year, at least on sales in '22. Again, unless I'm sort of missing something and please point it out if I am. 
On the profitability side next year, obviously, you've already talked about and I understand there will be supply chain pressures, or at least through the first half of the year. I guess my question is, would you expect the -- that year-over-year gross margin pressure to sort of sequentially improve as you move through the first half as sort of the pricing flows through and you make improvements to the supply chain? Or are gross margin pressures potentially expected to be as, let's say, severe in the first half is maybe what you're seeing in the back half of this year?"

Maybe I'll just start with the top line as you started. I think you're right. As we look at it today, it's hard to point to something that would say you don't have an on-algorithm top line or have momentum. Coming out of this year, we've got the lon",419,"Sure. Maybe I'll just start with the top line as you started. I think you're right. As we look at it today, it's hard to point to something that would say you don't have an on-algorithm top line or have momentum. Coming out of this year, we've got the long Easter. You mentioned pricing, which will be a bigger factor next year than it was this year. But we also would hope we see some capacity improvements, would give us some upside. And then at some point, inventory replenishment. I think that's hard to call. But that -- we would expect to see some of that certainly over the course of next year. So still volatile, but I agree with the first premise. 
And then as you get into gross margin, I think there still are a lot of moving pieces. Some of the things I think we can directionally point to, obviously, the pricing will have a tailwind on gross margin. As we look at raw materials, raw material inflation wasn't a big factor for us, this year, we expect it will be a bigger factor as we look at next year. Logistics inflation that we're seeing now, I don't think we see a reason yet for that to break, at least through the first half of next year. We'll have less spot market activity because some of the -- we'll be, say, better positioned for some of the stronger consumer demand than we were particularly in the third quarter. 
We still expect to see some labor inflation. And as we said in the prepared remarks, we've increased headcount to respond to some of the additional demand. Packaging inflation and resins, I think we keep waiting for that to break and it's probably moderated, but it hasn't reverted back to other levels or lower levels. So I think at least through the first half, we're going to see that still remain a pressure point. And then we'll see how capacity plays out in the broader supply chain network, the challenges we've had with logistics and trucks and warehousing and all of those labor implications. 
So when you step back from all of that, I'd say the gross margin piece still has a lot of moving pieces. And I think we'll get more clarity, obviously, when we get to February and provide full guidance. But right now, I'd say particularly through the first half of the year, we're going to see a lot of those cost pressures in place."

And if you can't get the inventory where you want, why advertise. But the stock has done well and your sales have done well because of the market share gains. And I just wanted to know if you think there's risk to market share erosion from this decision. Do you think your competitors are doing the same thing so it won't matter? How did you evaluate the risk and reward of that?"

So first of all, I would say there is not a strategic change to our business model. We remain committed to investing in brands at some of the highest levels in our industry across the peer group. So there's nothing that has changed about the strategy",240,"Yes. So first of all, I would say there is not a strategic change to our business model. We remain committed to investing in brands at some of the highest levels in our industry across the peer group. So there's nothing that has changed about the strategy. So I want to be clear about that. Yes, as we looked at the decision, it really was driven by the fact that we have such elevated demand. And given that the supply chain challenges just wouldn't enable us to be able to meet the further demand that we would create through our very impactful advertising that it just didn't make sense. It put more pressure on the supply chain. And also, we probably wouldn't get a good ROI because we wouldn't be able to fulfill that incremental demand. 
If we look at our market share right now, we don't think that the advertising cuts that we have executed impacted our share in Q3. And we're not the only ones having supply chain challenges and issues. So overall, I think across the board, even in the industry, we're seeing a lot of people manage advertising to supply as a challenge. We'll continue to focus on optimizing it. We will invest as much as we can, as much as we think we can fill. Certainly, we're investing in capacity going forward, and we are very agile in how we're handling support behind our brands."

So we have very long focused and believed and operated in a way that we believe we are the best advocates for the needs of our people. We are in constant communication with our employees, and we're really focused on our total employee value proposition with those employees. We know that we have highly competitive wage rates, we have excellent benefits and we routinely benchmark all of that. But we're also very focused on the softer factors that are very important to our employees. And that includes, especially during these times of global supply chain challenge, work-life balance, stress management, flexibility in hours, being able to get time off. 
And so we have enacted a lot of strategies to really try and help with that. We have an always-on recruiting approach and we have really amplified our recruiting efforts this year to be able to successfully manage through the challenges and increase our net headcount. We've also leveraged analytics to, as I said, understand some of the things most important to our workforce. So we're very focused on that. We are very focused on prioritizing the needs of that group, and continuing to look at ways that we can optimize the situation in terms of supply and demand. So we feel pretty good about that."

You can continue to see effects from the top line, the benefits of some of the go-to-market work, including the model in China, but also efficiencies in the other markets. So we're pleased with the way things are going. As we look to the fourth quarter, some of the same capacity challenges that we've seen in the U.S. and North America are going to have some impact on those markets as well. But really pleased with the distribution gains we've seen, the velocity and the share across those 3 markets."

In-store trips have pretty much rebounded to the pre-pandemic levels. And in e-commerce, what we've seen is the trips have largely maintained versus last year, but we have seen the dollars per trip go down as many of those consumers who were more exclusively purchasing in e-commerce shifted more of their spend back into bricks and mortar. Most of the e-commerce shoppers are not exclusively e-commerce, they shop omnichannel. So we saw some of that shifting occur. 
Relative to our business, in particular, our e-commerce retail sales are up versus last year with our omnichannel partners, despite the significant growth that we had a year ago and also despite the significant growth that we're seeing in bricks and mortar as well."

Consumer demand for our brand has remained robust on both a 1- and 2-year basis.

Consumer demand for our brand has remained robust on both a 1- and 2-year basis. Our continued focus on operating with speed and flexibility has enabled us to respond quickly to changes in the marketplace and develop plans we believe will enable us to maintain elevated consumer demand, increase our supply chain output and sustain our advantaged margin structure over the long term. 
We are raising both sales and earnings guidance for 2021 to reflect the strong consumer demand and improved tax outlook and optimized brand investment which collectively are expected to more than offset higher supply chain costs and inflation. Our teams have done an outstanding job navigating a volatile and unpredictable environment over the past 1.5 years. 
Our manufacturing team is on track to deliver a record year of production volume and complete key capital investment projects to deliver an additional $500 million of sales capacity this year and next. We have also increased our manufacturing headcount and invested in our workforce to ensure a stable talent supply in 2021 and 2022. 
And our commercial teams have adjusted campaigns and reallocated investments in real time, optimized product mixes to capitalize on consumer and competitor trends, executed several pricing actions and maintained a strong presence in store. Our purpose is to make more moments of goodness and I could not be prouder of our employees' agility, dedication and commitment to ensure that our beloved brands are here for consumers when they need them. 
Because of this focus, net sales grew 6.3% in the third quarter and adjusted EPS increased 12.9%. Our market share remains well above pre-COVID-19 levels with our confectionery share almost 100 basis points higher and our snacking share 220 basis points higher in Q3 of 2021 versus Q3 of 2019. 
Growth was broad-based with both volume and price gains in North America confection, North America snacking and our International and Other segment. New routines established during the pandemic have not only endured, but grown over the past 6 months despite improving mobility. Areas negatively impacted by COVID-19, including away-from-home consumption -- confection consumption and sales within our International and Other segment have continued to rebound. 
Within North America, net sales increased 5.5% during the third quarter. Consumer demand was even stronger in Q3 with measured channel retail takeaway growth of almost 9% and nonmeasured channel growth of over 10%. Changes in year-over-year inventory levels versus the prior year period resulted in an approximate 6-point headwind to sales growth this quarter. While we expected inventories to contract in the third quarter, the contraction was larger than we anticipated as capacity constraints, labor shortages and unprecedented levels of disruption in the broader supply chain network limited our ability to increase production commensurate with this significant increase in consumer demand. 
These same factors have also resulted in higher-than-anticipated supply chain costs. As we progressed through the third quarter and observed strong consumer demand sustaining against more difficult laps and worsening supply chain disruptions and inflation, we took additional action to improve both our service levels and margins. 
Within our manufacturing facilities, we have accelerated hiring and are adding head count to not only increase production but also provide employees with more scheduling flexibility and time off, which we believe will make our employee value proposition even stronger. 
Our Board of Directors approved an additional $200 million of capital in August to add more capacity on constrained brands, particularly Reese's. Our supply chain and commercial teams have partnered to further optimize and prioritize our SKUs to reduce complexity and maximize output while ensuring that we continue to support strategic initiatives for our long-term growth aspirations. 
We optimized our marketing investment to alleviate pressure on our capacity constrained brands. And last month, we executed a high single-digit price increase on approximately 60% of our U.S. confection products. While not all of these actions will have immediate benefits and we anticipate many supply chain pressures to persist well into next year. We expect to see gradual improvement in service levels in the coming quarters and we are committed to continuing to invest in our brands and protect our advantaged margin structure over the long term. 
While we are spending a significant amount of time on execution, we are also advancing strategic initiatives to enhance our capabilities and drive sustained advantaged sales growth over the long term. We continue to collaborate with our retailers on macro space planning, particularly self-checkout solutions and queuing lines. These initiatives have become even more critical as the industry struggles with labor shortages. 
In the past year, we have partnered on more of these solutions than in the prior 5 years combined. Results have been terrific with both accelerated category and Hershey sales growth, and we have many more opportunities in the pipeline for 2022 and beyond. 
We have also expanded our presence in better-for-you confection and gummy sweets, 2 areas where we are under shared and see meaningful incremental opportunity. Our zero sugar chocolate and Jolly Rancher gummies innovation are both performing well and bringing new consumers and occasions into our portfolio. 
We are leveraging an agile approach to media to reallocate and adjust investment and content in real time as consumer trends and supply chain pressures evolve. For Halloween this year, we are activating our first-ever multi-brand advertisement for Reese's and Kit Kat, our top 2 selling brands of the season. This ad was created by our in-house design team. A key driver of our agility over the past year and will enable us to more efficiently reach our consumers buying both brands, particularly in large assortments. 
As we head into the final days of Halloween, sales and sell-through are both looking strong. Category sales in early and mid-season are up 18% versus 2020 and up 12% versus 2019 levels. And trick or treat participation is expected to rebound to pre-pandemic levels. Hershey Halloween sales for the same period are up 14% versus last year, resulting in 2-year growth of 23%. Last year, we gained approximately 500 basis points of Halloween share. 
And heading into the final days, we have retained approximately 75% of those gains. We expect this strength to flow into the holiday season as more family gatherings occur this year. From a brand and occasion perspective, nearly all parts of our portfolio grew in the third quarter despite challenging laps from prior year. Reese's continued to shine with another quarter of double-digit growth. Q3 2021 retail sales grew 10%, building on last year's Q3 growth of 25%. 
Full year growth on this $2.5 billion brand of approximately 20% was driven by media support, new packaging, seasonal gains, pricing and innovation. Reese's Pretzel is the #1 confection innovation item in the category this year and Reese's snack cakes are the #2 innovation item in convenience stores, where we focused our targeted launch. 
As we shared on our last call, we have added 3 new manufacturing lines over the past 4 years as well as expanded peanut roasting capacity, but it has still not been enough to keep pace with this significant increase in demand. New Reese's capacity is on track to come online throughout 2022 and 2023 to help support this tremendous growth. 
Kisses has also seen incredibly strong growth as more consumer occasions occur at home, with gains of 13% in the third quarter of 2021 on top of 8% gains in Q3 of 2020. Jolly Ranchers grew 33% in the third quarter behind core item velocity growth as well as the expansion of last year's successful gummy launch to take home bags this past year. 
We have additional capacity coming online next year to drive even more growth in this on-trend business. Overall, we have seen at-home chocolate consumption remain elevated while away-from-home consumption has rebounded. Sales for our everyday take-home chocolate products grew 5% in the third quarter building upon last year's 16% gains. Despite the sustained at-home consumption, category sales for chocolate instant consumables also grew almost 10% during the third quarter, as consumer mobility improved. 
Sales for our refreshment business were up over 15% as social distancing and mask wearing were below 2020 levels. This strong growth in our U.S. confection business was complemented by accelerated growth in our snacking products and markets within our international and other segment. 
Retail sales for our SkinnyPop and Pirate's Booty brands grew over 20% in the third quarter. Over the past year, household penetration has increased from 18% to 20%, with over 80% of new buyers also repeating. Growth has been broad-based across channels and occasions with particular strength in our multipack offerings that have grown over 60% year-to-date. 
This multipack growth is driven by the resurgence of away-from-home consumption, including lunch boxes, as well as consumers' desire for self-sharing packs. Our family snack pack innovation featuring both SkinnyPop and Pirate's Booty is performing incredibly well and offers consumers a great variety for the entire family. 
This our acquisition in late 2017. Our teams have done a fantastic job fueling growth on the SkinnyPop brand with consistent double-digit growth. Over the past year, we have reached an important milestone, delivering $500 million in retail sales. SkinnyPop is now our fifth largest brand, and we couldn't be more excited to continue driving growth on SkinnyPop and our other great snack brands in the coming years. 
Strong recovery continued within our International and Other segment with reported sales growth of 13.9% in Q3. In India, Brazil and Mexico, reported net sales were above pre-pandemic levels with 2-year growth of approximately 15%. Distribution expansion across markets as well as new marketing activation such as our first ever launch of Halloween in Brazil this year are driving growth. 
In China, sales are in line with expectations, and profitability continues to improve from the new go-to-market model we began implementing last year. While sales at Chocolate World and travel retail locations remained below pre-pandemic levels. We saw strong growth in Q3 this year as mobility improved. 
Before I turn it over to Steve, I want to take a minute to recognize and thank our employees around the globe. Every day, they come to work with energy and passion to meet the new challenges awaiting us in this volatile environment. They have embraced the spirit of flexibility and they are constantly adapting to the changes around us to make more moments of goodness for our consumers. 
These qualities are critical for successfully adapting and driving sustainable and advantaged results for all of our stakeholders. 
Steve, let me turn it over to you to provide more details on our financial results and outlook."

As Michele shared, we delivered 6.3% net sales growth and 12.9% adjusted EPS growth in the third quarter amidst a dynamic and evolving operating environment. 
Continued strong consumer demand, price realization and favorable tax drove solid results despite higher supply chain costs and inflation. Additional pricing actions were announced in the quarter to address rising logistics, labor and packaging costs. 
Looking ahead, continued investment in enterprise projects is critical for our future success, including capacity, flexibility and digital infrastructure. Our strong financial foundation and adaptive operating model continue to enable us to deliver balanced top and bottom line growth in this environment. 
The North America segment continues to perform well, with reported net sales growth of 5.5% in the quarter, including a 1.5 point benefit from the acquisition of Lilly's. Price realization contributed 2.4 points of growth driven by list price increases and lower seasonal markdown reserves versus the prior year. This was in line with expectations. The benefit from list price increases on our seasonal non-chocolate and grocery products will continue to build in Q4, while our most recent pricing action is expected to have minimal impact in the fourth quarter, with the majority being realized in 2022. 
Favorability in seasonal reserves reflects an increase in Halloween visibility this year and will largely be offset in the fourth quarter. In total, we expect net price realization in the fourth quarter to be comparable to what we saw in the third quarter. 
Volume also contributed an incremental 1.3 points of growth in the third quarter, though not fully reflective of the strong consumer demand as volume was constrained by capacity and industry-wide supply chain disruptions. Changes in year-over-year retailer and distributor inventory levels helped meet that consumer demand in Q3. 
In the fourth quarter, we expect net sales growth to again lag U.S. retail takeaway driven by less shipment days which is expected to provide a 2-point headwind in the quarter and continued depletion of retail and distributor inventory. We now expect retailer and distributor inventory to be a 1-point headwind for full year net sales growth. 
As Michele mentioned, we have taken action to increase output and improve service levels as we move through the next several quarters and expect to begin replenishing inventory in 2022. In the International and Other segment, constant currency net sales grew 11.4% in the third quarter. This growth was in line with expectations, driven by both net price realization and volume in the third quarter. 
In the fourth quarter, we expect growth to moderate across international markets due to depletion of retailer and distributor inventory related to our U.S. capacity constraints. Adjusted gross margin declined by 110 basis points in the third quarter, driven by the North America segment. In North America, gross margins decreased 140 basis points to 44.9% as higher supply chain costs and inflation, along with unfavorable mix, were partially offset by net price realization and lower seasonal markdown reserves versus the prior year. 
In July, we plan for demand to moderate and the broader supply chain to improve in the second half of the year. However, consumer demand has sustained and industry-wide supply chain disruptions have impacted both our service levels and our costs. As we look to the fourth quarter, we anticipate these pressures to persist and therefore, expect a comparable amount of gross margin contraction in the fourth quarter as we saw in the third quarter. 
Given the disruption in the supply chain we've seen globally, I am proud of our team for rallying in the face of these challenges, and I'm confident in the plans we have put in place to improve and protect our advantaged margin structure in the long term. 
In the International and Other segment, gross margin was 38.9% in the third quarter, an increase of 230 basis points from the prior year. Net price realization and favorable fixed cost leverage drove margin expansion in the third quarter, partially offset by higher supply chain costs, mainly inflation and freight. 
We expect profitability to continue to improve in the fourth quarter as we complete the first full year following the change in operating model in China. I could not be more pleased with the tremendous work done by the international teams over the last several years to implement strategies across markets to structurally improve the profitability of this important segment. 
In North America, advertising and related consumer marketing spend decreased 5.2% in the third quarter. We acted with agility, taking a disciplined approach to evaluate our marketing investments and optimize spending to align with consumer demand and available capacity in the quarter. Despite this optimization, we continue to invest nearly $150 million in our brands in the third quarter with 20 brands and key occasions supported, including SMORS and Halloween. 
We also increased investment by double digits in faulting snack brands, SkinnyPop and Pirate's Booty. We anticipate a year-over-year decline in advertising spend in the fourth quarter as we saw in the third quarter. In the International and Other segment, advertising and related consumer spending increased 11.4% as we continue to support the COVID-19 recovery across key international markets. 
Corporate expenses increased 10.5% in the third quarter, driven by higher capability and technology investments, both project and people costs, against deflated 2020 levels due to COVID-19, along with elevated benefits costs and medical claims. The adjusted effective income tax rate was 14.7% in the third quarter, a decrease of 6.8% versus the prior year period. This rate decrease was driven by the utilization of certain capital losses, along with the timing of tax credits versus the prior year. 
We now expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 15% to 16% and other expense to be around $125 million. As we look to next year, we expect the overall tax expense to be comparable to 2021, absent any global or U.S. tax reform. 
As I turn to capital deployment, I want to reiterate our priorities, which have remained constant during the elevated volatility of the current environment. Our strong cash flow provides us with the financial flexibility to maintain a dual focus on current and future growth. In the third quarter, we invested another $120 million in capital bringing our year-to-date investment to $347 million. 
Of this investment, approximately 55% has been related to incremental capacity. We recently brought online an additional payday line in September and the agile fulfillment center came online just this week. Looking to 2022, we have additional Reese's and gummy capacity expected to come online along with the completion of the Canadian distribution center. 
Over the past few years, we've remained proactive in investing for growth, which has positioned us well during the pandemic. Our capital spending outlook for 2021 is slightly below our prior estimate, largely due to project timing. Looking ahead, we expect a slightly higher level of capital investment in 2022 as we continue to invest for future growth. 
Shifting to dividends and share repurchases. In the third quarter, we paid $181 million in cash dividends totaling over $505 million in cash returned to shareholders year-to-date. During the third quarter, we also completed $24 million of share repurchases related to stock option replenishment. 
Before we wrap up this morning, let me share some high-level perspectives and expectations for 2022. While we expect the environment to remain dynamic next year, we are committed to delivering another year of top and bottom line growth. From a top line perspective, we expect price to be a larger contributor to overall growth in 2022, backed by several pricing actions announced this year, which will also provide a tailwind to gross margin. 
Supply chain costs, specifically logistics, labor and packaging are expected to remain elevated at least through the first half of the year. while raw material inflation is expected to be higher relative to 2021 as we had minimal impact this year. As Michele shared, we are committed to maintaining our advantaged margin structure over the long term and have robust plans in place to address challenges in capacity and the broader supply chain. 
While this is more than we typically share at this time of year, we believe this additional perspective is helpful in the dynamic environment we're operating in. We look forward to sharing more details with you in February. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Michele for closing remarks."

98873,1686390448,2417205,"The Hershey Company, Q3 2021 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","The Hershey Company","Executives","Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. Consumer demand for our brand has remained robust on both a 1- and 2-year basis. Our continued focus on operating with speed and flexibility has enabled us to respond quickly to changes in the marketplace",1769,"Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. 
Consumer demand for our brand has remained robust on both a 1- and 2-year basis. Our continued focus on operating with speed and flexibility has enabled us to respond quickly to changes in the marketplace and develop plans we believe will enable us to maintain elevated consumer demand, increase our supply chain output and sustain our advantaged margin structure over the long term. 
We are raising both sales and earnings guidance for 2021 to reflect the strong consumer demand and improved tax outlook and optimized brand investment which collectively are expected to more than offset higher supply chain costs and inflation. Our teams have done an outstanding job navigating a volatile and unpredictable environment over the past 1.5 years. 
Our manufacturing team is on track to deliver a record year of production volume and complete key capital investment projects to deliver an additional $500 million of sales capacity this year and next. We have also increased our manufacturing headcount and invested in our workforce to ensure a stable talent supply in 2021 and 2022. 
And our commercial teams have adjusted campaigns and reallocated investments in real time, optimized product mixes to capitalize on consumer and competitor trends, executed several pricing actions and maintained a strong presence in store. Our purpose is to make more moments of goodness, and I could not be prouder of our employees' agility, dedication and commitment to ensure that our beloved brands are here for consumers when they need them. 
Because of this focus, net sales grew 6.3% in the third quarter and adjusted EPS increased 12.9%. Our market share remains well above pre-COVID-19 levels with our confectionery share almost 100 basis points higher and our snacking share 220 basis points higher in Q3 of 2021 versus Q3 of 2019. 
Growth was broad-based with both volume and price gains in North America confection, North America snacking and our International and Other segment. New routines established during the pandemic have not only endured, but grown over the past 6 months despite improving mobility. Areas negatively impacted by COVID-19, including away-from-home consumption -- confection consumption and sales within our International and Other segment have continued to rebound. 
Within North America, net sales increased 5.5% during the third quarter. Consumer demand was even stronger in Q3 with measured channel retail takeaway growth of almost 9% and nonmeasured channel growth of over 10%. Changes in year-over-year inventory levels versus the prior year period resulted in an approximate 6-point headwind to sales growth this quarter. While we expected inventories to contract in the third quarter, the contraction was larger than we anticipated as capacity constraints, labor shortages and unprecedented levels of disruption in the broader supply chain network limited our ability to increase production commensurate with this significant increase in consumer demand. These same factors have also resulted in higher-than-anticipated supply chain costs. 
As we progressed through the third quarter and observed strong consumer demand sustaining against more difficult laps and worsening supply chain disruptions and inflation, we took additional action to improve both our service levels and margins. Within our manufacturing facilities, we have accelerated hiring and are adding headcount to not only increase production but also provide employees with more scheduling flexibility and time off, which we believe will make our employee value proposition even stronger. 
Our Board of Directors approved an additional $200 million of capital in August to add more capacity on constrained brands, particularly Reese's. Our supply chain and commercial teams have partnered to further optimize and prioritize our SKUs to reduce complexity and maximize output while ensuring that we continue to support strategic initiatives for our long-term growth aspirations. We optimized our marketing investment to alleviate pressure on our capacity constrained brands. And last month, we executed a high single-digit price increase on approximately 60% of our U.S. confection products. 
While not all of these actions will have immediate benefits and we anticipate many supply chain pressures to persist well into next year, we expect to see gradual improvement in service levels in the coming quarters and we are committed to continuing to invest in our brands and protect our advantaged margin structure over the long term. 
While we are spending a significant amount of time on execution, we are also advancing strategic initiatives to enhance our capabilities and drive sustained advantaged sales growth over the long term. We continue to collaborate with our retailers on macro space planning, particularly self-checkout solutions and queuing lines. These initiatives have become even more critical as the industry struggles with labor shortages. In the past year, we have partnered on more of these solutions than in the prior 5 years combined. Results have been terrific with both accelerated category and Hershey sales growth, and we have many more opportunities in the pipeline for 2022 and beyond. 
We have also expanded our presence in better-for-you confection and gummy sweets, 2 areas where we are under shared and see meaningful incremental opportunity. Our zero sugar chocolate and Jolly Rancher gummies innovation are both performing well and bringing new consumers and occasions into our portfolio. 
We are leveraging an agile approach to media to reallocate and adjust investment and content in real time as consumer trends and supply chain pressures evolve. For Halloween this year, we are activating our first-ever multi-brand advertisement for Reese's and Kit Kat, our top 2 selling brands of the season. This ad was created by our in-house design team, a key driver of our agility over the past year and will enable us to more efficiently reach our consumers buying both brands, particularly in large assortments. 
As we head into the final days of Halloween, sales and sell-through are both looking strong. Category sales in early and mid-season are up 18% versus 2020 and up 12% versus 2019 levels. And trick or treat participation is expected to rebound to pre-pandemic levels. Hershey Halloween sales for the same period are up 14% versus last year, resulting in 2-year growth of 23%. Last year, we gained approximately 500 basis points of Halloween share, and heading into the final days, we have retained approximately 75% of those gains. We expect this strength to flow into the holiday season as more family gatherings occur this year. 
From a brand and occasion perspective, nearly all parts of our portfolio grew in the third quarter despite challenging laps from prior year. Reese's continued to shine with another quarter of double-digit growth. Q3 2021 retail sales grew 10%, building on last year's Q3 growth of 25%. Full year growth on this $2.5 billion brand of approximately 20% was driven by media support, new packaging, seasonal gains, pricing and innovation. Reese's Pretzel is the #1 confection innovation item in the category this year, and Reese's snack cakes are the #2 innovation item in convenience stores where we focused our targeted launch. 
As we shared on our last call, we have added 3 new manufacturing lines over the past 4 years as well as expanded peanut roasting capacity, but it has still not been enough to keep pace with this significant increase in demand. New Reese's capacity is on track to come online throughout 2022 and 2023 to help support this tremendous growth. 
Kisses has also seen incredibly strong growth as more consumer occasions occur at home, with gains of 13% in the third quarter of 2021 on top of 8% gains in Q3 of 2020. Jolly Ranchers grew 33% in the third quarter behind core item velocity growth as well as the expansion of last year's successful gummy launch to take home bags this past year. We have additional capacity coming online next year to drive even more growth in this on-trend business. 
Overall, we have seen at-home chocolate consumption remain elevated while away-from-home consumption has rebounded. Sales for our everyday take-home chocolate products grew 5% in the third quarter, building upon last year's 16% gains. Despite the sustained at-home consumption, category sales for chocolate instant consumables also grew almost 10% during the third quarter as consumer mobility improved. 
Sales for our refreshment business were up over 15% as social distancing and mask wearing were below 2020 levels. This strong growth in our U.S. confection business was complemented by accelerated growth in our snacking products and markets within our international and other segment. 
Retail sales for our SkinnyPop and Pirate's Booty brands grew over 20% in the third quarter. Over the past year, household penetration has increased from 18% to 20%, with over 80% of new buyers also repeating. Growth has been broad-based across channels and occasions with particular strength in our multipack offerings that have grown over 60% year-to-date. This multipack growth is driven by the resurgence of away-from-home consumption, including lunch boxes as well as consumers' desire for self-sharing packs. Our family snack pack innovation featuring both SkinnyPop and Pirate's Booty is performing incredibly well and offers consumers a great variety for the entire family. 
Since our acquisition in late 2017, our teams have done a fantastic job fueling growth on the SkinnyPop brand with consistent double-digit growth. Over the past year, we have reached an important milestone, delivering $500 million in retail sales. SkinnyPop is now our fifth-largest brand, and we couldn't be more excited to continue driving growth on SkinnyPop and our other great snack brands in the coming years. 
Strong recovery continued within our International and Other segment with reported sales growth of 13.9% in Q3. In India, Brazil and Mexico, reported net sales were above pre-pandemic levels with 2-year growth of approximately 15%. Distribution expansion across markets as well as new marketing activation such as our first ever launch of Halloween in Brazil this year are driving growth. In China, sales are in line with expectations, and profitability continues to improve from the new go-to-market model we began implementing last year. While sales at Chocolate World and travel retail locations remained below pre-pandemic levels, we saw strong growth in Q3 this year as mobility improved. 
Before I turn it over to Steve, I want to take a minute to recognize and thank our employees around the globe. Every day, they come to work with energy and passion to meet the new challenges awaiting us in this volatile environment. They have embraced the spirit of flexibility and they are constantly adapting to the changes around us to make more moments of goodness for our consumers. These qualities are critical for successfully adapting and driving sustainable and advantaged results for all of our stakeholders. 
Steve, let me turn it over to you to provide more details on our financial results and outlook."

As Michele shared, we delivered 6.3% net sales growth and 12.9% adjusted EPS growth in the third quarter amidst a dynamic and evolving operating environment. Continued strong consumer demand, price realization and favorable tax drove solid results despite higher supply chain costs and inflation. Additional pricing actions were announced in the quarter to address rising logistics, labor and packaging costs. Looking ahead, continued investment in enterprise projects is critical for our future success, including capacity, flexibility and digital infrastructure. Our strong financial foundation and adaptive operating model continue to enable us to deliver balanced top and bottom line growth in this environment. 
The North America segment continues to perform well, with reported net sales growth of 5.5% in the quarter, including a 1.5 point benefit from the acquisition of Lily's. Price realization contributed 2.4 points of growth driven by list price increases and lower seasonal markdown reserves versus the prior year. This was in line with expectations. The benefit from list price increases on our seasonal non-chocolate and grocery products will continue to build in Q4, while our most recent pricing action is expected to have minimal impact in the fourth quarter, with the majority being realized in 2022. 
Favorability in seasonal reserves reflects an increase in Halloween visibility this year and will largely be offset in the fourth quarter. In total, we expect net price realization in the fourth quarter to be comparable to what we saw in the third quarter. Volume also contributed an incremental 1.3 points of growth in the third quarter, though not fully reflective of the strong consumer demand as volume was constrained by capacity and industry-wide supply chain disruptions. Changes in year-over-year retailer and distributor inventory levels helped meet that consumer demand in Q3. 
In the fourth quarter, we expect net sales growth to again lag U.S. retail takeaway driven by less shipment days which is expected to provide a 2-point headwind in the quarter and continued depletion of retail and distributor inventory. We now expect retailer and distributor inventory to be a 1-point headwind for full year net sales growth. 
As Michele mentioned, we have taken action to increase output and improve service levels as we move through the next several quarters and expect to begin replenishing inventory in 2022. In the International and Other segment, constant currency net sales grew 11.4% in the third quarter. This growth was in line with expectations, driven by both net price realization and volume in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we expect growth to moderate across international markets due to depletion of retailer and distributor inventory related to our U.S. capacity constraints. 
Adjusted gross margin declined by 110 basis points in the third quarter, driven by the North America segment. In North America, gross margins decreased 140 basis points to 44.9% as higher supply chain costs and inflation, along with unfavorable mix, were partially offset by net price realization and lower seasonal markdown reserves versus the prior year. In July, we plan for demand to moderate and the broader supply chain to improve in the second half of the year. However, consumer demand has sustained and industry-wide supply chain disruptions have impacted both our service levels and our costs. 
As we look to the fourth quarter, we anticipate these pressures to persist, and therefore, expect a comparable amount of gross margin contraction in the fourth quarter as we saw in the third quarter.
