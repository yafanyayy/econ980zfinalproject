I want to open by saying I'm really proud of what we accomplished in 2020. Our teams executed well commercially, advanced our pipeline, kept our integration efforts ahead of schedule and executed important business development activities. We did this while managing through the complexities of the pandemic, keeping our teams safe and our patients at the center of everything we do. 
Turning to Slide 4. In Q4, we delivered another strong quarter. Commercial performance was strong, with sales increasing 10% compared to pro forma sales for the same period in the prior year, and we made significant progress to advance our pipeline. Of note, we continued to make progress with our launches, including good momentum for Opdivo + Yervoy in first-line lung, which supports our confidence in a return to growth of Opdivo this year; Reblozyl, which has seen a strong launch with rapid adoption in MDS; ZEPOSIA, which is well positioned as the S1P modulator of choice in multiple sclerosis; and Onureg, which is the only oral option with an overall survival benefit in first-line AML response maintenance. We closed the acquisition of MyoKardia, bringing us mavacamten and strengthening our existing presence in cardiovascular. 
During the quarter, we also continued to advance our pipeline, including regulatory filings and approvals in our I-O, immunology and hematology portfolio, most recently with positive top line results for the pralsetinib in psoriasis. We demonstrated strong financial results, enabling an increased non-GAAP earnings per share outlook for 2021. 
As you would have just seen, we have entered into a licensing arrangement with The Rockefeller University for the development of a dual antibody combination for the treatment of COVID-19. Though early, we believe this treatment could be differentiated with the potential for low-dose subcutaneous administration. We are pleased to partner with Rockefeller University and leverage our expertise in antibody technology and strength in development, manufacturing and distribution to bring this potential option to patients. 
Moving to Slide 5. Let me put the performance from the quarter and full year 2020 into context. Thanks to excellent execution throughout the year, we have continued to deliver on all value drivers of the Celgene acquisition and laid a strong foundation for future growth of our new company. We are well positioned to accelerate the renewal of our portfolio and support the long-term growth of our business. 
Last month at JPMorgan, I shared why I have confidence in the future of Bristol-Myers Squibb. The integration of Celgene has gone very well. Based on progress last year, we now expect total synergies to be close to $3 billion by the end of '22. We have proven commercial capabilities, which enable us to fully realize the opportunities to grow our inline portfolio and support strong execution of our launches. The breadth and depth of our late-stage pipeline is reflected in the significant number of milestones delivered last year. Finally, our financial strength makes it possible for us to continue to invest in future growth internally and externally through business development. 
Now turning to Slide 6. Overall, we are in a strong position to unlock the potential of the company we planned to build when we acquired Celgene. We're building a company with a younger, more diversified portfolio of medicines, better positioned in the second half of the decade. Let me remind you when we believe we are heading. We are confident we can more than offset the impact of near-term patent expiries, including Revlimid. We expect to grow our revenue and earnings through 2025, with low to mid-single-digit revenue CAGR for 2025 driven by the significant growth potential of our continuing business, which is comprised of our in-line drop drivers and our launch brands. We see strong momentum for this portfolio, which excludes Revlimid and Pomalyst, with low double-digit revenue CAGR during the same period. Looking out to 2025, we expect the continuing business will represent approximately 90% of the company, with 30% of that revenue from our newly launched products. 
Importantly, looking out to the second half of the decade on Slide 7. We have multiple sources of portfolio renewal. Our recently launched products will continue to grow. Most have significant expansion opportunities beyond the launch indication. We have a rich mid- to late-stage pipeline, with assets such as our Factor XIa inhibitor and our multiple myeloma CELMoDs, iberdomide and CC-92480. We will continue to advance our diverse early R&D portfolio and further invest in business development opportunities, just as we have done with MyoKardia. We believe we can achieve this while maintaining very strong profitability, with operating margins expected in the low to mid-40s. 
Turning to our execution scorecard on Slide 8. At JPMorgan, I outlined several important milestones that would support our success. And as mentioned, we've already delivered on a number of those. Opdivo + was recently approved by the FDA for patients with first-line RCC. This week, we delivered the second positive Phase III for deucravacritinib in plaque psoriasis, supporting the filing of this potential new therapy to help authorities in the near term. ZEPOSIA was filed for the treatment of ulcerative colitis in the U.S., and we look forward to launching that indication later this year. 
Moving to Slide 9. As we think about this year, based on the strength of our business and the exciting opportunities ahead, we are increasing our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance for '21. David will provide more details on the financials, but let me offer some perspective on key areas of focus in '21. Commercially, we expect revenue growth across key businesses, driven in large part by the continued execution of our recent launches, Opdivo's return to growth and Eliquis. 
We will continue to advance our pipeline and have important milestones ahead this year, such as filing mavacamten, Phase II data for Factor XIa, proof-of-concept data for deucravacritinib in ulcerative colitis and initial data for iberdomide in refractory multiple myeloma. We will maintain a balanced approach to capital allocation. Disciplined business development is a top priority and provides an opportunity to further invest in future growth. David will provide more color on our consistent approach to capital allocation in a few minutes. 
This year, we also anticipate the U.S. policy environment will continue to evolve, and I'm confident the diversification of our portfolio will help us navigate potential changes. We agree that patient affordability needs to be improved, and we are supportive of policies that can address this issue. We look forward to working with the new administration and congressional leaders to foster an environment that supports innovation and enhances patient access to medicines. 
To close, I am encouraged by the strength and momentum across the company. Across our 4 key therapeutic areas of hematology, oncology, cardiovascular and immunology, we have leading in-line medicines, significant short-term launch opportunities and a rich pipeline. Our diversified portfolio and leading position in each business allows us to be less dependent on any 1 product or business. 
I'm also immensely proud of our employees. Their talent is second to none and their commitment is inspiring. I feel very good about the future of Bristol-Myers Squibb and the potential that lies before us. I will now hand it over to David to walk you through the financials. David?"
25798,699084559,2191896,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Bristol-Myers Squibb Company","Executives","Thank you, Giovanni, and hello, everyone, and thanks again for joining our call today. If you turn to Slide 11, I'd like to discuss our robust top line performance for the quarter. Our teams continued to operate well in a virtual environment, delivering v",1705,"Thank you, Giovanni, and hello, everyone, and thanks again for joining our call today. If you turn to Slide 11, I'd like to discuss our robust top line performance for the quarter. Our teams continued to operate well in a virtual environment, delivering very strong quarterly and full year results. For the fourth quarter, revenues grew 10% on a pro forma basis versus prior year, reflecting strong execution across the world. During the quarter, we also saw approximately $250 million of favorable inventory build versus the third quarter, primarily driven by Eliquis and Revlimid as well as a 2% favorable impact from foreign exchange. Full year revenues were equally strong and reflect a pro forma growth of 7%. 
I'll now provide additional color on the performance of our key brands and new launches. Now starting with Eliquis on Slide 12. Global sales continued to perform very well, growing double digit for both the fourth quarter and the full year. In the U.S., fourth quarter sales increased 6% versus prior year, driven by robust 17% TRx growth and an inventory build partially offset by expected higher gross to net impact from the coverage gap. Inventory build versus prior quarter was approximately $100 million. Though we saw total new scripts for oral declining during last year due to COVID, we are starting to see naive volumes return to pre COVID levels. 
Internationally, sales remained strong with revenue of approximately $1 billion, growing 19% versus prior year. Eliquis continues to be the #1 NOAC in multiple key markets internationally, including Germany, France and the U.K. Both in the U.S. and internationally, we believe that the growth outlook for Eliquis remains strong as we continue to grow the oral anticoagulant class as well as increasing our share within the class. 
Turning to Slide 13. Global sales of Opdivo grew 2% in the fourth quarter versus prior year, primarily driven by strong growth in international markets. In the U.S., the teams continued to execute well, largely through remote engagement. During the fourth quarter, we saw an expected unwind of favorable inventory we discussed last quarter. Importantly, our first-line lung cancer continues to go very well with our share now in the low double-digit range. This is visible by the strong 20% sales growth of [indiscernible] quarter versus prior year. 
We continue to work through the pressure of our second-line indication, which is stabilizing and now starting to be balanced out by the momentum we are building in first-line lung. We remain very confident in the return to growth for Opdivo in the U.S. this year. We expect continued growth in first-line lung, combined with launches and additional indications, including first-line renal with the recent approval of Opdivo + CABO and the opportunity to be the first I-O agent in first-line gastric, as well as several new adjuvant launches. 
Internationally, we continue to see strong commercial execution, with growth primarily driven by first-line melanoma and RCC as we continue to secure reimbursement around the world. We are pleased with the recent Japanese approvals and the launch in first-line lung with a broad label in as well as the EU approval of 9LA, and will we be working on securing reimbursements in various countries throughout 2021. 
Now moving to our in-line multiple myeloma portfolio on Slide 14. Revlimid and Pomalyst continue to perform very well with strong double-digit quarterly growth on a pro forma basis. Globally, Revlimid grew 18%, primarily driven by continued increase in treatment duration. In the U.S., fourth quarter revenues increased 15%, primarily driven by solid demand and inventory build compared to prior year. The inventory build versus prior quarter was approximately $100 million, and we expect this inventory build to reverse in the first quarter. 
Outside the U.S., revenues were strong with growth of 24% in the fourth quarter versus prior year due to growth in ATRIPLA combination, which include new reimbursement for RVD in several countries. We should note that this strong revenue growth included an earlier-than-expected tender of approximately $80 million. global pro forma revenues continue to reflect significant growth, up 21%. In the U.S., pro forma revenues increased 18% and internationally up 27%, driven by increased usage in earlier lines and longer treatment durations. As we look to the first quarter of 2021, our portfolio in addition to the inventory build in the U.S., I would like to remind you of the typical seasonality of Revlimid and Pomalyst experienced due to patients entering the Medicare coverage gap earlier in the year. 
Now moving on to our recent launches on Slide 15. Our new launches contributed just over $300 million in 2020. Reblozyl is off to a great start with global revenues in the year of $274 million. In the U.S., we experienced significant pent-up demand from the MDS launch in Q2 and Q3. And during the fourth quarter, we began to see expected evolution from the original bolus to true underlying demand. We continue to expect growth through new patient starts early in their treatment journey. Internationally, initial launches in Germany and Austria are going very well. We continue our launches in various markets globally over the course of 2021 as we receive reimbursement. 
Now turning to ZEPOSIA. Strong commercial access has been secured with greater than 90% of U.S. commercial lives covered. We remain focused on driving demand and establishing ZEPOSIA as the leading S1P modulator in multiple sclerosis. Outside U.S., we have now launched in Germany, Switzerland, Canada, the Netherlands and Norway. And we'll continue to secure reimbursement in other markets throughout the year. In addition to our MS launch, we now have a PDUFA date for ZEPOSIA in May and look forward to building momentum of this differentiated medicine. An MAA has been validated in Europe and we will work with European health authorities to bring this medicine to patients as soon as possible. 
Moving on to Onureg. Initial feedback from physicians has been very positive in establishing Onureg as the first and only oral treatment to demonstrate an overall survival benefit for first-line AML maintenance patients. With the data now published in the New England Journal of Medicine, we are focusing on educating physicians on this new maintenance therapy for patient. The MAA remains under review in EU with approval expected this year. 
Now moving to our balance sheet and capital allocation on Slide 16. You'll see we continue to generate a significant amount of cash flow from operations of approximately $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter. We ended the quarter in a strong liquidity position with approximately $16 billion in cash and marketable securities. Our capital allocation priorities are unchanged. Business development remains a top priority. We're committed to reducing our debt and returning capital to shareholders. 
With respect to business development, we plan to focus on strengthening our pipeline on midsized bolt-on deals that further strengthen the company into the second half of the decade. We will remain disciplined with respective deals that we execute and consistent with our criteria of being strategically aligned, scientifically sound and financially attractive. 
As it relates to reducing debt, we will continue to be focused on this, further strengthening our ability to invest for growth. This morning, we announced a debt reduction transaction of up to $4 billion. Based upon the bonds we are targeting, we still expect to see our leverage ratio reduce by 1.5x debt-to-EBITDA in '24. Importantly, we are committed to a strong investment-grade credit rating, which is apparent through our willingness to use excess cash to proactively accelerate debt reduction. 
Lastly, we are committed to returning capital to shareholders through continued dividend growth and share repurchases. We have increased our dividend for the 12th consecutive year and recently increased our share repurchase authorization, with plans to execute a total of $3 billion to $4 billion in share repurchases by the end of this year. 
Now let's turn to our guidance for 2021 on Slide 17. Let me start by giving a quick update on our synergies. As Giovanni mentioned, the integration has gone very well, and we increased our total expected synergies to approximately $3 billion by the end of '22. We achieved about $1.4 billion in 2020 and expect the remaining synergy capture to be split evenly through this year and in '22. With that in mind and considering the momentum we saw in the business in 2020, we have increased our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance for 2021. 
Now touching on our non-GAAP expectation at constant exchange rates. We expect high single-digit revenue growth over 2020 based on the strength of our in-line products and the launches we are executing. We expect to sustain a high enterprise gross margin of approximately 80.5%. 
Now I want to take a moment to touch on MS&A. In 2020, we had the opportunity to make a number of incremental and accelerated investments to support our prioritized brands and product launches. Also, with COVID recovery and higher expenses due to MyoKardia are reflected. For 2021, we expect MS&A to increase in the low single digit as we invest in our launches and include the full year spend for MyoKardia. We expect mid-single-digit increase in R&D as we invest behind a robust pipeline, COVID recovery plans in preclinical and clinical studies and incorporate spend of MyoKardia. We expect our tax rate to remain about 16%. And finally, based on the strength and the momentum in the business, we are now increasing our non-GAAP 2021 diluted EPS to $7.35 to $7.55. 
I would also like to provide some color on OI&E and share count. It's likely we'll see realty income and net interest expense to roughly offset each other in 2021, resulting in net neutral OI&E. Regarding our share count, we ended 2020 with approximately 2.3 billion shares outstanding, which will decrease based upon the $3 billion to $4 billion repurchase activity we're planning in the year. 
Now before we move on to Q&A session, I want to thank our teams around the world for delivering such outstanding results in 2020. These results demonstrate the resiliency of our portfolio and position us well for strong growth in 2021 and into the future. I'll now turn the call back over to Tim and Giovanni for Q&A."

Let me start with the question on the tipping point and then also your question with respect to liso-cel. And maybe I'll start with the question on liso-cel and how we're thinking about the launch there. We're obviously very excited about the opportunity to launch liso-cel in DLBCL. We expect that imminently. We are obviously going to be very much focused on ensuring at launch that sites are activated very quickly, that we're able to get patients efficiently moved on to therapy. 
And then as we stated repeatedly, really, the tipping point with respect to is going to be our ability to continue to expand the CAR-T market by driving referrals and expanding the site footprint and then ultimately being able to leverage what we believe to be a differentiated product profile in order to drive brand share. And so that's going to be very important. 
And a similar story will be for ide-cel, where obviously, we have a very strong position in multiple myeloma to leverage. With respect to staying in hematology of the 3 products that were on the 
[Audio Gap]
where the launch is at this point. We think thus far, we've had very good demand. Some of that demand, frankly, has been pent-up. And as we get into the first quarter and certainly into this year, we think we'll be tapping into the true underlying demand. But we continue to see real opportunity to grow this brand both in its labeled indication as well as potentially to expand into the first-line ESA-naive with the COMMAND studies and ultimately potentially into a. 
And then for Onureg, Onureg is obviously off to a very good start. As David mentioned, there remains a very high unmet need for patients in first-line AML who've achieved a CR post-intensive chemo but aren't candidates for stem cell. We believe that really, the opportunity here is going to be to continue to drive the benefit that we see from an overall survival standpoint with Onureg. 
But importantly, this is a market where there is no established treatment approach in AML maintenance. So what we're going to have to do is continue to build that market and convince physicians that it's a new paradigm to treat these patients and that there's a real urgency to treat. 
And then finally, to pick up on the question on ZEPOSIA, we are very pleased with what we have seen with the opportunity for ZEPOSIA not only in MS but particularly in IBD. The MS launch, we think, is going well. In spite of the situation with COVID, we've seen good uptake from physicians in terms of willingness to prescribe. Importantly, the percentage of physicians who now believe that ZEPOSIA is the best S1P is very much on track with what we had hoped for. And given the data that we saw with True North, we think there's considerable opportunity for us to drive business there as well. So very excited about the opportunity with ZEPOSIA. Maybe I'll turn it over to Samit."

As was mentioned earlier in the call, we do see continued confidence that Opdivo is going to return to growth in 2021 and contribute meaningfully as part of the I-O franchise to company growth beyond that. 
What I would say to answer your question on 9ER is, first of all, 9ER needs to be put within the context of, first of all, a very stable business that we're starting to see in the U.S. a strong business as you saw in the numbers in Q4 ex U.S. And then as David mentioned, we've seen good uptake in the first-line lung launch in the U.S., and it's still very early days outside of the U.S. 
We do see that there is a nice opportunity with 9ER in first-line renal. Again, as we talked about, we've got an established footprint with Opdivo plus Yervoy there, and we think that by giving us the opportunity to combine with what we believe to be a best-in-class TKI with CABO, there's opportunity to grow that business, particularly as we think about getting into the favorable patient population. Still very early days since we were just approved on the 22nd. 
And then with respect to the additional opportunities, as you know, we have launch opportunities with gastric cancer in the first-line metastatic space as well as in the adjuvant space as well as with adjuvant bladder. We do think that those are going to be more indexed to the latter half of this year and then as we get into '22 in terms of their contribution to growth. Maybe with that, I'll turn it over to Samit."

So first of all, we watch the competitive dynamics of the PD-L1 marketplace extremely carefully, as you can imagine, and something that we've been looking at considerably has been the question of commoditization. That's been with us really since we were approved with Opdivo. 
From a U.S. standpoint, we actually don't see considerable risk from these new entrants, in part driven by a number of factors: first, oncology continues to be a very data-driven field in the U.S. And so we've got a wealth of data covering both Opdivo and Yervoy, which gives us confidence; second, we've established a very strong position across tumors and, of course, we built very significant capabilities to operate in the competitive context, and I think we're demonstrating that now in both renal cell and lung cancer, for example. 
Ex U.S., again, it's something that we're going to continue to stay very focused on. We see that in some markets, you may see some risk of commoditization but those tend to be relatively small markets for us.

And then certainly, Chris can in the commercial aspects of it. So as you know, beyond the MS, there are 4 classes of medicines that are being developed in multiple myeloma, primarily: cell therapies; certainly, the ADC that has recently been approved and more to follow; there are the CELMoDs, and then they are going to be the combinations as we have also talked about. 
Then right now, what we're trying to do is to get to a stage where this disease, which is incurable and in patients who are heavily pretreated in the [ first-line plus ] where progression for remains very low with response rates of 30% or so. We are trying to transform that disease. So from that perspective, cell therapies are going to play a major role, and that's where ide-cel is coming in to begin with, where we have shown the data. We have shown the overall response rate. We've shown they're very durable and deep responses and a very manageable safety profile. 
As we look towards the next generation of molecules where the T cell engagers or CELMoDs T cell are going to be also very important. And as we've spoken about earlier, there could be patients who may not be able to receive cell therapies and would be more appropriate in terms of being treated to the T cell engagers. Of course, there are challenges right now with the formulation that we have available. We've seen data from multiple companies coming up, showing that IV administration is associated, while with good efficacy, there are challenges in terms of finding the right dose of administration schedule from a safety perspective. So we have to be careful in terms of how we go forward with that. 
And so certainly, many others and we are now investigating subcutaneous formulation, where it seems early data from other presentations that we've seen that the efficacy can be maintained. Of course, safety we'll be continuing to reevaluate it. There are small numbers right now but seems to go in the right direction. 
Third parties of CELMoD. And that's where we will show the first of the expansion data later this year. And depending on what the durability and the magnitude of the response are, we might have an opportunity to convey that to [indiscernible] and have a discussion of how to go forward. But from a strategic point of view, higher level, how to move these forward, the next phase of development is definitely going to be combinations. We've shown some of the data already. 
If we talk about iberdomide, for example, data at ASH showed us high response rates when combined with the value-added as well as  with zone. So those are the strategies moving forward in the earlier line. We are, in a similar way, going to be investigating combinations with ide-cel. And as the data evolves, the T cell engager, we'll look for combinations. The ultimate goal is to move CELMoDs in much earlier line so that we can have the comparisons versus image to be able to ultimately replace them in the longer run, and then, of course, try to move the other modalities also further up in line. But ultimately, yes, there will be segmentation of patients. Some may receive cell therapy, some may receive T cell engagers and there could still be an opportunity for our sequencing of these modalities. Chris, do you want to add something?"

Ide-cel is going to be an important piece of that innovative pipeline that we bring forward, initially in later line therapy, and then as we've discussed, potentially moving that into earlier lines of therapy in a broader patient population. 
And then as Samit mentioned, the opportunity to launch the next-generation BCMA targets with T cell engagers and potentially the next-generation of small molecules, which we think have the potential to displace today's backbone. And then over time, you could envision these newer therapies being combined and targeting different patient populations across lines of therapy and then also thinking about targeting the specific type of drug to the age, performance status or preference of patients.

Now as it relates to how quickly we'll be able to do that, clearly, this is going to be a market where we've got very compelling data versus the only world that's in the space now. So we think that there, we're going to have an opportunity to educate physicians relatively quickly.

So on China, let me say, first of all, we have a relatively small business in China that we see an opportunity to continue to strengthen our presence in that market  [indiscernible] our pipeline continues to  progress and we have launch opportunities going forward in China. 
I would agree that from a NRDL perspective, it is appropriate to be cautious because of the number of PD-1 agents that have been launched at the same time, including a number of local players. And so I share the perspective that the opportunity in China, I would be cautious about. I do believe, though, in a couple of things. So first of all, there are examples of brands in oncology and other therapeutic areas that recently have had a more differentiated profile with fewer local competitors have been able to be included in NRDL reimbursement and built to be meaningful contributors to growth in the market. So I don't think every therapeutic area is the same and every class of drug is the same. 
And specifically, in our portfolio, we believe there are truly differentiated medicines that can have a very meaningful presence in China. When you look at the medium and the long term, I think actually, the development opportunities in China will continue to grow not only through the government channel, but also over time, the development of commercial insurance for what is a relatively large population of patients that would have access to that. 
So I do see that in the medium term, the composition, if you want, of the marketplace in China in terms of payer dynamics will be more diversified. And I think that will strengthen opportunities across the board. So we continue to be really committed to China. 
With respect to your question on limit, you -- as you can imagine, we have a number of discussions ongoing. We have litigations along with players that are continuing. We're not going to be in a position to provide multiple year guidance going into the future. But I think we've been pretty clear in articulating our position on the Revlimid erosion beginning in '22. And as we've mentioned, we see the LOE portfolio of Revlimid and Pomalyst representing no more, in fact, less than 10% of the company by 2025. So the evolution of that business, I think it's pretty clear. And from my perspective, what's more important is to really look at the potential for double-digit growth for our continuing business and the growth of the total company between now and 2025.

Let me start with your question on Part D redesign. So first of all, there is a real need to think about redesigning benefits in a way that is more aligned with the treatments of today and most importantly, that addresses significant affordability issues that are faced by patients because of inappropriate design of benefits and the high co-pay and the high out-of-pocket exposures that patients have. 
I think it's premature to say exactly where potential legislation in Congress would evolve. We've been very clear that we are supportive of thinking about the evolution of the design. And I think when you look at our portfolio, there is -- we have a very diversified portfolio. So depending on how the coverage gap contribution of the industry evolves, that's currently 70%, and that may actually have an impact on Eliquis, should that be reduced. On the catastrophic side, you are right, some of the specialty oral medicines would be impacted by changes in that area. So it really depends.

The th",229,"Sure. So Ronny, we're obviously very enthusiastic about the opportunity that we have to play with potentially multiple drugs in IBD initially with ZEPOSIA and then pending the data with TYK, potentially an opportunity with deucravacritinib as well. The thing to keep in mind is that while IBD is a competitive space, there continues to be a need for efficacious drugs that have a manageable safety profile. Ultimately, we believe that the competitive dynamics are going to play out along a few dimensions. 
Obviously, efficacy, safety route of administration is very important here. And because this is a chronic disease where patients are going to cycle through multiple products, we think having a novel mechanism of action is important. And so when you look at the 2 broad categories of treatments that are available today, notably biologics and JAK inhibitors, we think our initial foray into this space with ZEPOSIA is favorably positioned. 
For example, we think ZEPOSIA demonstrates efficacy that is competitive with biologics in an oral formulation with an improved safety profile certainly versus the TNF inhibitors. So we think we play very well there. And similarly, with respect to the JAKs, ZEPOSIA efficacy that's generally competitive with JAKs as well and again, an improved safety profile. And across both of those categories being a novel S1P in the space, we think is going to be important."

I want to open by saying I'm really proud of what we accomplished in 2020. Our teams executed well commercially, advanced our pipeline, kept our integration efforts ahead of schedule and executed important business development activities. We did this while managing through the complexities of the pandemic, keeping our teams safe and our patients at the center of everything we do. 
Turning to Slide 4. In Q4, we delivered another strong quarter. Commercial performance was strong, with sales increasing 10% compared to pro forma sales for the same period in the prior year, and we made significant progress to advance our pipeline. Of note, we continued to make progress with our launches, including good momentum for Opdivo + Yervoy in first-line lung, which supports our confidence in a return to growth of Opdivo this year; Reblozyl, which has seen a strong launch with rapid adoption in MDS; Zeposia, which is well positioned as the S1P modulator of choice in multiple sclerosis; and Onureg, which is the only oral option with an overall survival benefit in first-line AML response maintenance. We closed the acquisition of MyoKardia, bringing us mavacamten and strengthening our existing presence in cardiovascular. 
During the quarter, we also continued to advance our pipeline, including regulatory filings and approvals in our I-O, immunology and hematology portfolio, most recently with positive top line results for deucravacitinib in psoriasis. We demonstrated strong financial results, enabling an increased non-GAAP earnings per share outlook for 2021. 
As you would have just seen, we have entered into a licensing arrangement with The Rockefeller University for the development of a dual antibody combination for the treatment of COVID-19. Though early, we believe this treatment could be differentiated with the potential for low-dose subcutaneous administration. We are pleased to partner with Rockefeller University and leverage our expertise in antibody technology and strength in development, manufacturing and distribution to bring this potential option to patients. 
Moving to Slide 5. Let me put the performance from the quarter and full year 2020 into context. Thanks to excellent execution throughout the year, we have continued to deliver on all value drivers of the Celgene acquisition and laid a strong foundation for future growth of our new company. We are well positioned to accelerate the renewal of our portfolio and support the long-term growth of our business. 
Last month at JPMorgan, I shared why I have confidence in the future of Bristol-Myers Squibb. The integration of Celgene has gone very well. Based on progress last year, we now expect total synergies to be close to $3 billion by the end of '22. We have proven commercial capabilities, which enable us to fully realize the opportunities to grow our in-line portfolio and support strong execution of our launches. The breadth and depth of our late-stage pipeline is reflected in the significant number of milestones delivered last year. Finally, our financial strength makes it possible for us to continue to invest in future growth internally and externally through business development. 
Now turning to Slide 6. Overall, we are in a strong position to unlock the potential of the company we planned to build when we acquired Celgene. We're building a company with a younger, more diversified portfolio of medicines, better positioned in the second half of the decade. Let me remind you when we believe we are heading. We are confident we can more than offset the impact of near-term patent expiries, including Revlimid. We expect to grow our revenue and earnings through 2025, with low to mid-single-digit revenue CAGR for 2025 driven by the significant growth potential of our continuing business, which is comprised of our in-line growth drivers and our launch brands. We see strong momentum for this portfolio, which excludes Revlimid and Pomalyst, with low double-digit revenue CAGR during the same period. Looking out to 2025, we expect the continuing business will represent approximately 90% of the company, with 30% of that revenue from our newly launched products. 
Importantly, looking out to the second half of the decade on Slide 7. We have multiple sources of portfolio renewal. Our recently launched products will continue to grow. Most have significant expansion opportunities beyond the launch indication. We have a rich mid- to late-stage pipeline, with assets such as our Factor XIa inhibitor and our multiple myeloma CELMoDs, iberdomide and CC-92480. We will continue to advance our diverse early R&D portfolio and further invest in business development opportunities, just as we have done with MyoKardia. We believe we can achieve this while maintaining very strong profitability, with operating margins expected in the low to mid-40s. 
Turning to our execution scorecard on Slide 8. At JPMorgan, I outlined several important milestones that would support our success. And as mentioned, we've already delivered on a number of those. Opdivo + CABO was recently approved by the FDA for patients with first-line RCC. This week, we delivered the second positive Phase III for deucravacritinib in plaque psoriasis, supporting the filing of this potential new therapy to help authorities in the near term. Zeposia was filed for the treatment of ulcerative colitis in the U.S., and we look forward to launching that indication later this year. 
Moving to Slide 9. As we think about this year, based on the strength of our business and the exciting opportunities ahead, we are increasing our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance for '21. David will provide more details on the financials, but let me offer some perspective on key areas of focus in '21. Commercially, we expect revenue growth across key businesses, driven in large part by the continued execution of our recent launches, Opdivo's return to growth and Eliquis. 
We will continue to advance our pipeline and have important milestones ahead this year, such as filing mavacamten, Phase II data for Factor XIa, proof-of-concept data for deucravacritinib in ulcerative colitis and initial data for iberdomide in refractory multiple myeloma. We will maintain a balanced approach to capital allocation. Disciplined business development is a top priority and provides an opportunity to further invest in future growth. David will provide more color on our consistent approach to capital allocation in a few minutes. 
This year, we also anticipate the U.S. policy environment will continue to evolve, and I'm confident the diversification of our portfolio will help us navigate potential changes. We agree that patient affordability needs to be improved, and we are supportive of policies that can address this issue. We look forward to working with the new administration and congressional leaders to foster an environment that supports innovation and enhances patient access to medicines. 
To close, I am encouraged by the strength and momentum across the company. Across our 4 key therapeutic areas of hematology, oncology, cardiovascular and immunology, we have leading in-line medicines, significant short-term launch opportunities and a rich pipeline. Our diversified portfolio and leading position in each business allows us to be less dependent on any 1 product or business. 
I'm also immensely proud of our employees. Their talent is second to none and their commitment is inspiring. I feel very good about the future of Bristol-Myers Squibb and the potential that lies before us. I will now hand it over to David to walk you through the financials. David?"
25798,699084559,2192299,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Bristol-Myers Squibb Company","Executives","Thank you, Giovanni, and hello, everyone, and thanks again for joining our call today. If you turn to Slide 11, I'd like to discuss our robust top line performance for the quarter. Our teams continued to operate well in a virtual environment, delivering v",1713,"Thank you, Giovanni, and hello, everyone, and thanks again for joining our call today. If you turn to Slide 11, I'd like to discuss our robust top line performance for the quarter. Our teams continued to operate well in a virtual environment, delivering very strong quarterly and full year results. For the fourth quarter, revenues grew 10% on a pro forma basis versus prior year, reflecting strong execution across the world. During the quarter, we also saw approximately $250 million of favorable inventory build versus the third quarter, primarily driven by Eliquis and Revlimid as well as a 2% favorable impact from foreign exchange. Full year revenues were equally strong and reflect a pro forma growth of 7%. 
I'll now provide additional color on the performance of our key brands and new launches. Now starting with Eliquis on Slide 12. Global sales continued to perform very well, growing double digit for both the fourth quarter and the full year. In the U.S., fourth quarter sales increased 6% versus prior year, driven by robust 17% TRx growth and an inventory build partially offset by expected higher gross to net impact from the coverage gap. Inventory build versus prior quarter was approximately $100 million. Though we saw total new scripts for oral anticoagulants declining during last year due to COVID, we are starting to see naive volumes return to pre COVID levels. 
Internationally, sales remained strong with revenue of approximately $1 billion, growing 19% versus prior year. Eliquis continues to be the #1 NOAC in multiple key markets internationally, including Germany, France and the U.K. Both in the U.S. and internationally, we believe that the growth outlook for Eliquis remains strong as we continue to grow the oral anticoagulant class as well as increasing our share within the class. 
Turning to Slide 13. Global sales of Opdivo grew 2% in the fourth quarter versus prior year, primarily driven by strong growth in international markets. In the U.S., the teams continued to execute well, largely through remote engagement. During the fourth quarter, we saw an expected unwind of favorable inventory we discussed last quarter. Importantly, our first-line lung cancer continues to go very well with our share now in the low double-digit range. This is visible by the strong 20% sales growth of Yervoy in the quarter versus prior year. 
We continue to work through the pressure of our second-line indication, which is stabilizing and now starting being balanced out by the momentum we are building in first-line lung. We remain very confident in the return to growth for Opdivo in the U.S. this year. We expect continued growth in first-line lung, combined with launches and additional indications, including first-line renal with the recent approval of Opdivo + CABO and the opportunity to be the first I-O agent in first-line gastric as well as several new adjuvant launches. 
Internationally, we continue to see strong commercial execution, with growth primarily driven by first-line melanoma and RCC as we continue to secure reimbursement around the world. We are pleased with the recent Japanese approvals and the launch in first-line lung with a broad label in all comers as well as the EU approval of 9LA, and will we be working on securing reimbursements in various countries throughout 2021. 
Now moving to our in-line multiple myeloma portfolio on Slide 14. Revlimid and Pomalyst continue to perform very well with strong double-digit quarterly growth on a pro forma basis. Globally, Revlimid grew 18%, primarily driven by continued increase in treatment duration. In the U.S., fourth quarter revenues increased 15%, primarily driven by solid demand and inventory build compared to prior year. The inventory build versus prior quarter was approximately $100 million, and we expect this inventory build to reverse in the first quarter. 
Outside the U.S., revenues were strong with growth of 24% in the fourth quarter versus prior year due to growth in ATRIPLA combination, which include new reimbursement for RVD in several countries. We should note that this strong revenue growth included an earlier-than-expected tender of approximately $80 million. Pomalyst global pro forma revenues continue to reflect significant growth, up 21%. In the U.S., pro forma revenues increased 18% and internationally up 27%, driven by increased usage in earlier lines and longer treatment durations. As we look through the first quarter of 2021, our MM portfolio, in addition to the inventory build in the U.S., I would like to remind you of the typical seasonality of Revlimid and Pomalyst experienced due to patients entering the Medicare coverage gap earlier in the year. 
Now moving on to our recent launches on Slide 15. Our new launches contributed just over $300 million in 2020. Reblozyl is off to a great start with global revenues in the year of $274 million. In the U.S., we experienced significant pent-up demand from the MDS launch in Q2 and Q3. And during the fourth quarter, we began to see expected evolution from the original bolus to true underlying demand. We continue to expect growth through new patient starts early in their treatment journey. Internationally, initial launches in Germany and Austria are going very well. We continue our launches in various markets globally over the course of 2021 as we receive reimbursement. 
Now turning to Zeposia. Strong commercial access has been secured with greater than 90% of U.S. commercial lives covered. We remain focused on driving demand and establishing Zeposia as the leading S1P modulator in multiple sclerosis. Outside U.S., we have now launched in Germany, Switzerland, Canada, the Netherlands and Norway. And we'll continue to secure reimbursement in other markets throughout the year. In addition to our MS launch, we now have a PDUFA date for Zeposia in UC in May and look forward to building momentum of this differentiated medicine. An MAA has been validated in Europe and we will work with European health authorities to bring this medicine to patients as soon as possible. 
Moving on to Onureg. Initial feedback from physicians has been very positive in establishing Onureg as the first and only oral treatment to demonstrate an overall survival benefit for first-line AML maintenance patients. With the data now published in the New England Journal of Medicine, we are focusing on educating physicians on this new maintenance therapy for patients. The MAA remains under review in EU with approval expected this year. 
Now moving to our balance sheet and capital allocation on Slide 16. You'll see we continue to generate a significant amount of cash flow from operations of approximately $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter. We ended the quarter in a strong liquidity position with approximately $16 billion in cash and marketable securities. Our capital allocation priorities are unchanged. Business development remains a top priority. We're committed to reducing our debt and returning capital to shareholders. 
With respect to business development, we plan to focus on strengthening our pipeline on midsized bolt-on deals that further strengthen the company into the second half of the decade. We will remain disciplined with respective deals that we execute and consistent with our criteria of being strategically aligned, scientifically sound and financially attractive. 
As it relates to reducing debt, we will continue to be focused on this, further strengthening our ability to invest for growth. This morning, we announced a debt reduction transaction of up to $4 billion. Based upon the bonds we are targeting, we still expect to see our leverage ratio reduce by 1.5x debt-to-EBITDA in '24. Importantly, we are committed to a strong investment-grade credit rating, which is apparent through our willingness to use excess cash to proactively accelerate debt reduction. 
Lastly, we are committed to returning capital to shareholders through continued dividend growth and share repurchases. We have increased our dividend for the 12th consecutive year and recently increased our share repurchase authorization, with plans to execute a total of $3 billion to $4 billion in share repurchases by the end of this year. 
Now let's turn to our guidance for 2021 on Slide 17. Let me start by giving a quick update on our synergies. As Giovanni mentioned, the integration has gone very well, and we increased our total expected synergies to approximately $3 billion by the end of '22. We achieved about $1.4 billion in 2020 and expect the remaining synergy capture to be split evenly through this year and in '22. With that in mind and considering the momentum we saw in the business in 2020, we have increased our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance for 2021. 
Now touching on our non-GAAP expectation at constant exchange rates. We expect high single-digit revenue growth over 2020 based on the strength of our in-line products and the launches we are executing. We expect to sustain a high enterprise gross margin of approximately 80.5%. 
Now I want to take a moment to touch on MS&A. In 2020, we had the opportunity to make a number of incremental and accelerated investments to support our prioritized brands and product launches. Also, with COVID recovery and higher expenses due to MyoKardia are reflected. For 2021, we expect MS&A to increase in the low single digit as we invest in our launches and include the full year spend for MyoKardia. We expect mid-single-digit increase in R&D as we invest behind a robust pipeline, COVID recovery plans in preclinical and clinical studies and incorporate spend of MyoKardia. We expect our tax rate to remain about 16%. And finally, based on the strength and the momentum in the business, we are now increasing our non-GAAP 2021 diluted EPS to $7.35 to $7.55. 
I would also like to provide some color on OI&E and share count. It's likely we'll see [indiscernible] income and net interest expense to roughly offset each other in 2021, resulting in net neutral OI&E. Regarding our share count, we ended 2020 with approximately 2.3 billion shares outstanding, which will decrease based upon the $3 billion to $4 billion repurchase activity we're planning in the year. 
Now before we move on to Q&A session, I want to thank our teams around the world for delivering such outstanding results in 2020. These results demonstrate the resiliency of our portfolio and position us well for strong growth in 2021 and into the future.

Let me start with the question on the tipping point and then also your question with respect to liso-cel. And maybe I'll start with the question on liso-cel and how we're thinking about the launch there. We're obviously very excited about the opportunity to launch liso-cel in DLBCL. We expect that imminently. We are obviously going to be very much focused on ensuring at launch that sites are activated very quickly, that we're able to get patients efficiently moved on to therapy. 
And then as we stated repeatedly, really, the tipping point with [indiscernible] to is going to be our ability to continue to expand the CAR-T market by driving referrals and expanding the site footprint and then ultimately being able to leverage what we believe to be a differentiated product profile in order to drive brand share. And so that's going to be very important. 
And a similar story will be for ide-cel, where obviously, we have a very strong position in multiple myeloma to leverage. With respect to staying in hematology of the 3 products that were on the slide, Reblozyl. Obviously, Reblozyl is off to a very good start. We're very pleased with the launch so far. The execution for this probably has gone very well, and we continue to believe Reblozyl is going to play a very important role in both MDS and beta thalassemia. As we look at where the launch is at this point, we think thus far, we've had very good demand. Some of that demand, frankly, has been pent-up. And as we get into the first quarter and certainly into this year, we think we'll be tapping into the true underlying demand. 
But we continue to see real opportunity to grow this brand both in its labeled indication as well as potentially to expand into the first-line ESA-naive with the COMMANDS studies and ultimately potentially into [indiscernible]. 
And then for Onureg, Onureg is obviously off to a very good start. As David mentioned, there remains a very high unmet need for patients in first-line AML who've achieved a CR post-intensive chemo but aren't candidates for stem cell. We believe that really, the opportunity here is going to be to continue to drive the benefit that we see from an overall survival standpoint with Onureg. 
But importantly, this is a market where there is no established treatment approach in AML maintenance. So what we're going to have to do is continue to build that market and convince physicians that it's a new paradigm to treat these patients and that there's a real urgency to treat them. 
And then finally, to pick up on the question on Zeposia, we are very pleased with what we have seen with the opportunity for Zeposia, not only in MS, but particularly in IBD. The MS launch, we think, is going well. In spite of the situation with COVID, we've seen good uptake from physicians in terms of willingness to prescribe. Importantly, the percentage of physicians who now believe that Zeposia is the best S1P is very much on track with what we had hoped for. And given the data that we saw with True North, we think there's considerable opportunity for us to drive business there as well. So very excited about the opportunity with Zeposia. Maybe I'll turn it over to Samit."

As was mentioned earlier in the call, we do see continued confidence that Opdivo is going to return to growth in 2021 and contribute meaningfully as part of the I-O franchise to company growth beyond that. 
What I would say to answer your question on 9ER is, first of all, 9ER needs to be put within the context of, first of all, a very stable business that we're starting to see in the U.S., a strong business as you saw in the numbers in Q4 ex U.S. And then as David mentioned, we've seen good uptake in the first-line lung launch in the U.S., and it's still very early days outside of the U.S. 
We do see that there is a nice opportunity with 9ER in first-line renal. Again, as we talked about, we've got an established footprint with Opdivo + Yervoy there, and we think that by giving us the opportunity to combine with what we believe to be a best-in-class TKI with CABO, there's opportunity to grow that business, particularly as we think about getting into the favorable patient population. Still very early days since we were just approved on the 22nd. 
And then with respect to the additional opportunities, as you know, we have [ Opdivo's ] launch opportunities with gastric cancer in the first-line metastatic space as well as in the adjuvant space as well as with adjuvant bladder. We do think that those are going to be more indexed to the latter half of this year and then as we get into '22 in terms of their contribution to growth.

So what we are trying to see is the profile that emerges from a bleeding perspective, whether we can have a similar or better efficacy with less bleeding. More importantly then, there will be the second study next year looking at a combination to the background therapy of the anti-platelet agents where, again, it is very important to note that, that profile, what impact it will have on bleeding? And if we are able to combine, then it opens up additional indications that we can pursue going forward. So those are the 2 things that we'll be watching out for defining the dose, looking at the safety and, of course, efficacy will also be a point of review."

So first of all, we watch the competitive dynamics of the PD-L1 marketplace extremely carefully, as you can imagine, and something that we've been looking at considerably has been the question of commoditization. That's been with us really since we were approved with Opdivo. 
From a U.S. standpoint, we actually don't see considerable risk from these new entrants, in part driven by a number of factors: first, oncology continues to be a very data-driven field in the U.S. And so we've got a wealth of data covering both Opdivo and Yervoy, which gives us confidence; second, we've established a very strong position across tumors and, of course, we built very significant capabilities to operate in the competitive context, and I think we're demonstrating that now in both renal cell and lung cancer, for example. 
Ex U.S., again, it's something that we're going to continue to stay very focused on. One see that in some markets, you may see some risk of commoditization but those tend to be relatively small markets for us.

And then certainly, Chris can fill in the commercial aspects of it. So as you know, beyond the MS, there are 4 classes of medicines that are being developed in multiple myeloma, primarily: cell therapies; certainly, the ADC that has recently been approved and more to follow; there are the CELMoDs, and then they are going to be the combinations as we have also talked about. 
Then right now, what we're trying to do is to get to a stage where this disease, which is incurable and in patients who are heavily pretreated in the [ first-line plus ] where progression [indiscernible] remains very low with response rates of 30% or so. We are trying to transform that disease. So from that perspective, cell therapies are going to play a major role, and that's where ide-cel is coming in to begin with, where we have shown the data. We have shown the overall response rate. We've shown the very durable and deep responses and a very manageable safety profile. 
As we look towards the next generation of molecules where the T cell engagers or CELMoDs [indiscernible]. T cell engagers are going to be also very important. And as we've spoken about earlier, there could be patients who may not be able to receive cell therapies and would be more appropriate in terms of being treated through the T cell engagers. Of course, there are challenges right now with the formulations that we have available. We've seen data from multiple companies coming up, showing that IV administration is associated -- while with good efficacy, there are challenges in terms of finding the right dose of administration schedule from a safety perspective. So we have to be careful in terms of how we go forward with that. 
And so certainly, many others and we are now investigating subcutaneous formulation, where it seems early data from other presentations that we've seen that the efficacy can be maintained. Of course, safety we'll be continuing to reevaluate it. There are small numbers right now but seems to go in the right direction. 
Third parties of CELMoD. And that's where we will show the first of the expansion data later this year. And depending on what the durability and the magnitude of the response are, we might have an opportunity to convey that to health authorities and have a discussion of how to go forward. But from a strategic point of view, higher level, how to move these forward, the next phase of development is definitely going to be combinations. We've shown some of the data already. 
If we talk about iberdomide, for example, data at ASH showed us high response rates when combined with the value-added dexamethasone as well as VELCADE with dexamethasone. So those are the strategies moving forward in the earlier line. We are, in a similar way, going to be investigating combinations with ide-cel. And as the data evolves, the T cell engager, we'll look for combinations. The ultimate goal is to move CELMoDs in much earlier line so that we can have the comparisons versus image to be able to ultimately replace them in the longer run, and then, of course, try to move the other modalities also further up in line. But ultimately, yes, there will be segmentation of patients. Some may receive cell therapy, some may receive T cell engagers and there could still be an opportunity for sequencing of these modalities. Chris, do you want to add something?"

Ide-cel is going to be an important piece of that innovative pipeline that we bring forward, initially in later line therapy, and then as we've discussed, potentially moving that into earlier lines of therapy in a broader patient population. 
And then as Samit mentioned, the opportunity to launch the next-generation BCMA targets with T cell engagers and potentially the next-generation of small molecules, which we think have the potential to displace today's backbone. And then over time, you could envision these newer therapies being combined and targeting different patient populations across lines of therapy and then also thinking about targeting [indiscernible] specific type of drug to the age, performance status or preference of patients.

Is this ever going to be a market that's meaningful for Bristol or other multinationals? And just as importantly, if it's happening in China in the PD-1 category, why wouldn't it happen in other disease categories, oncology or otherwise? 
And then second question on Revlimid. Largest product now for the company, goes off-patent next year. Analysts are guessing how to erode it in the first year. We don't know if it's $1 billion or $3 billion down or what exactly. And it'd be great to have some clarity on how to think about first year erosion."

So on China, let me say, first of all, we have a relatively small business in China that we see an opportunity to continue to strengthen our presence in that market, particularly as our pipeline continues to  progress and we have launch opportunities going forward in China. 
I would agree that from a NRDL perspective, it is appropriate to be cautious because of the number of PD-1 agents that have been launched at the same time, including the number of local players. And so I share the perspective that the opportunity in China, I would be cautious about. I do believe, though, in a couple of things. So first of all, there are examples of brands in oncology and other therapeutic areas that recently have had a more differentiated profile with fewer local competitors have been able to be included in NRDL reimbursement and built to be meaningful contributors to growth in the market. So I don't think every therapeutic area is the same and every class of drug is the same. 
And specifically, in our portfolio, we believe there are truly differentiated medicines that can have a very meaningful presence in China. When you look at the medium and the long term, I think actually, the development opportunities in China will continue to grow not only through the government channel, but also over time, the development of commercial insurance for what is a relatively large population of patients that would have access to that. 
So I do see that in the medium term, the composition, if you want, of the marketplace in China in terms of payer dynamics will be more diversified. And I think that will strengthen opportunities across the board. So we continue to be really committed to China. 
With respect to your question on Revlimid, you -- as you can imagine, we have a number of discussions ongoing. We have litigations along with players that are continuing. We're not going to be in a position to provide multiple year guidance going into the future. But I think we've been pretty clear in articulating our position on the Revlimid erosion beginning in '22. And as we've mentioned, we see the LOE portfolio of Revlimid and Pomalyst representing no more, in fact, less than 10% of the company by 2025. So the evolution of that business, I think it's pretty clear. And from my perspective, what's more important is to really look at the potential for double-digit growth for our continuing business and the growth of the total company between now and 2025. Chris, do you have anything to add on China?"

So in the U.S., for example, the incidence of MDS is roughly 21,000. The on-label population is a relatively small percentage of that, and that's because the initial indication obviously focuses on those patients who are lower risk, ESA-eligible, RF positive and in the second line. 
So the way we think about it is, first and foremost, we've got to continue to drive utilization in the existing indication we have. We think there's continued opportunity there. Then obviously, there's an opportunity to expand within MDS, and we think that the COMMANDS study gives us a meaningful opportunity to both include those patients who are RF negative and move into earlier lines of therapy. And then obviously, beyond MDS, there are other opportunities, beta thal, which is on label today, but then also we have additional opportunities in areas like myofibrosis."

First, about the Part D restructuring, you mentioned your support for isolating patients from paying out of pocket.

I was wondering if you can just give us a quick update where you believe the base standing, your concern around that issue heard? And is this part of what we should expect? 
And second, as we think about the kind of IL-23 TYK2 mechanism coming to IBD, I was wondering if you were able to compare the kind of the efficacy level you're able to achieve with the oral versus the antibodies. And is the gap there small enough that you can compete head-to-head with the IL-23s, assuming that mechanism becomes as dominant as it could be in those indications?"

Let me start with your question on Part D redesign. So first of all, there is a real need to think about redesigning benefits in a way that is more aligned with the treatments of today and most importantly, that addresses significant affordability issues that are faced by patients because of inappropriate design of benefits and the high co-pay and the high out-of-pocket exposures that patients have. 
I think it's premature to say exactly where potential legislation in Congress would evolve. We've been very clear that we are supportive of thinking about the evolution of the design. And I think when you look at our portfolio, there is -- we have a very diversified portfolio. So depending on how the coverage gap contribution of the industry evolves, that's currently 70%, and that may actually have an impact on Eliquis, should that be reduced. On the catastrophic side, you are right, some of the specialty oral medicines would be impacted by changes in that area. So it really depends. 
And when you have a diversified portfolio that may be areas that are impacted negatively, there are areas potentially impacted positively in terms of patients but also in terms of the contribution we already make. So when we look at concrete proposals, we'll be able to assess the impact on our portfolio better. But I think it's important to remember that different medicines in our portfolio today are impacted differently in the various phases of coverage in Medicare. Chris?"

So Ronny, we're obviously very enthusiastic about the opportunity that we have to play with potentially multiple drugs in IBD, initially with Zeposia and then pending the data with TYK, potentially an opportunity with deucravacritinib as well. The thing to keep in mind is that while IBD is a competitive space, there continues to be a need for efficacious drugs that have a manageable safety profile. Ultimately, we believe that the competitive dynamics are going to play out along a few dimensions. 
Obviously, efficacy, safety, route of administration is very important here. And because this is a chronic disease where patients are going to cycle through multiple products, we think having a novel mechanism of action is important. And so when you look at the 2 broad categories of treatments that are available today, notably biologics and JAK inhibitors, we think our initial foray into this space with Zeposia is favorably positioned. 
For example, we think Zeposia demonstrates efficacy that is competitive with biologics in an oral formulation with an improved safety profile certainly versus the TNF inhibitors. So we think we play very well there. And similarly, with respect to the JAKs, Zeposia administrates efficacy that's generally competitive with JAKs as well and again, an improved safety profile. And across both of those categories being a novel S1P in the space, we think is going to be important."

Now turning to Slide 4. We at the start of the year, I laid out our strategy to grow our business and renew our portfolio through the end of the decade. During the first quarter, we delivered strong results consistent with this strategy. We successfully grew our revenues, launched new medicines and new indications for I-O and continued to advance our pipeline. 
Starting with our financial performance, Our revenue grew 3% despite the impact of COVID-19-related buying patterns in Q1 of last year. Our quarter was strong for sales and EPS in the context of COVID-related dynamics for some of our products. Based on continued strength in our business, we are affirming our full year non-GAAP guidance for 2021. The accelerated renewal of our portfolio advanced across all 4 key therapeutic areas. Through regulatory approvals and clinical readouts, we're building a more diversified, younger portfolio that will fuel our growth through the decade and beyond. 
Although there remains uncertainty with how the COVID recovery will evolve, we are actively planning to return colleagues to the workplace, and our prioritizing plans to fully bring our sales reps back in the field, where conditions allow, to further support our in-line products and launches. 
Let's turn to our execution scorecard on Slide 5. I am pleased that we've already made solid progress across the board during Q1. Specifically, in oncology, Opdivo is the first and only I-O agent with a first-line approval in gastric cancer. Combined with our opportunities in metastatic and adjuvant esophageal cancer, Opdivo can become the leading I-O medicine for patients with early and advanced GI cancers. We have strengthened the growth and long-term sustainability of our I-O franchise with a positive Phase III clinical trial for relatlimab. We're now the only company with 3 proven I-O mechanisms. 
Building on our leadership position in melanoma with the Opdivo plus Yervoy regimen, We've now demonstrated a clinically meaningful PFS benefit on top of PD-1 monotherapy for a second I-O agent, which is a great accomplishment knowing the high efficacy of PD-1 monotherapy in first-line melanoma. This is great news for patients with advanced melanoma, and we look forward to presenting the data at ASCO in June. 
Beyond I-O, 6 of our 8 near-term launches are now successfully underway. In hematology, we made great progress in our cell therapy franchise with U.S. approvals of Breyanzi and Abecma. Our other new product launches are also progressing well. 
A lot is happening in immunology. We presented Phase III data for deucrava, which we expect to file later this year. We see this as an important medicine for patients and the company with significant revenue potential. As you know, deucrava is a first-in-class selective TYK2 inhibitor with the potential to become the new oral standard of care in moderate to severe psoriasis. It also has broader potential to treat diseases such as psoriatic arthritis, IBD and lupus. 
In our mid-stage pipeline, we initiated the Phase III study for cendakimab in eosinophilic esophagitis. And in CV, we filed mavacamten with the FDA and have a PDUFA date of early next year. 
Given the potential for our early-stage pipeline with multiple assets across therapeutic areas and modalities, including protein homeostasis, cell therapy and next-generation biologics, we are planning a more in-depth session with you sometime in the fall to update you on the progress within our pipeline and how that further supports the long-term potential of the company. 
Now turning to Slide 6. Our team's execution as a new company so far has been remarkable and reinforces my confidence in our ability to capitalize on the potential for future growth. We remain focused on growing our business between 2020 and 2025. More importantly, we expect that in '25, our LOE products will constitute less than 10% of our business with roughly 1/3 of our continuing business coming from our launch portfolio. We believe our new launch portfolio has significant potential, with EUR 20 billion to EUR 25 billion of non-risk-adjusted sales potential in 2029. And this does not include the potential medicines that could come from our mid- or early-stage pipeline. 
To close, I'm confident we have established a strong foundation for our future growth. The strength of our execution, promising launch opportunities ahead, the breadth of our pipeline and strength of our balance sheet positions us very well. 
I will now turn it over to David to walk you through the financials. David?"

I'd like to start with our strong top line performance on Slide 8. Our continued sales growth of 3% was driven by strong operational performance. When excluding the approximately $500 mill",1566,"Thank you, Giovanni, and thank you all for joining our call today. I'd like to start with our strong top line performance on Slide 8. Our continued sales growth of 3% was driven by strong operational performance. When excluding the approximately $500 million of COVID-related buying patterns we experienced last year, underlying sales growth was strong, up 8%, or 6% excluding the benefits of foreign exchange, as our teams continue to execute very well while operating in a mostly virtual environment. 
I'll now provide additional color on the performance of our key brands and new launches, starting with Eliquis on Slide 9. This was another strong quarter for Eliquis as global sales were up 9% despite the unwinding of a fourth quarter inventory build and the approximately $350 million COVID-related build we experienced this time last year. In the U.S., first quarter sales increased 8% versus prior year, driven by strong demand with total prescriptions up 11% due to the strength of our position as the #1 NOAC. First quarter sales also included the impact of a onetime true-up of approximately $160 million related to the Medicare coverage gap. 
As we look towards the second half of the year, we expect similar dynamics from the coverage gap as we've seen in prior years. We remain optimistic about the continued growth opportunity for Eliquis since we've seen both new-to-brand OAC volumes return to prepandemic levels as well as accelerated switching from warfarin. 
Internationally, sales remained strong, growing 11% versus prior year. Eliquis continues to be the #1 NOAC in multiple key markets internationally with significant room to grow. We remain very pleased with the execution of Eliquis around the world and expect to continue to grow Eliquis share within a growing class. 
Now turning to Opdivo on Slide 10. As it relates to the first quarter performance in the U.S., first-line lung shares remained in the low double digits within the I-O eligible population. The launch of our Opdivo plus Cabo indication in first-line renal is going well and further builds on our strong position in that space with significant uptake in the unfavorable segment where Opdivo plus Yervoy is not indicated. But we did see some impact from COVID during the quarter as the resurgence of the virus earlier in the year impacted offices at an infusion, we remain very confident in Opdivo's return to growth this year. Further supporting this growth, we are also very pleased with the recent approval of CheckMate -649 as Opdivo plus chemo is now the first I-O regimen approved in first-line gastric cancer. We look forward to launching additional indications in early-stage diseases across esophageal and muscle-invasive bladder cancers, which are expected to further contribute to our growth later this year. 
Additionally, we have multiple opportunities for future growth, including CheckMate -648, for the treatment in first-line esophageal cancer, which we announced as primary endpoints, as well as from other trials that will read out over time. 
Outside the U.S., sales were up 2% due to favorable effects of foreign exchange. We are encouraged to see strong adoption of new approvals and increased reimbursement, including the 9LA regimen in Europe and both 9LA and 227 regimens in Japan. These dynamics offset the second-line indications and the impact of COVID. Looking forward, we expect to expand the use of Opdivo in several additional indications currently under review. 
All in all, we remain very excited about the growth outlook for Opdivo. 
Moving to Slide 11, I'd like to touch on our in-line multiple myeloma portfolio. In the U.S., Revlimid sales are flat. Its growth was offset by the expected work-down of last quarter's inventory build. We also saw the expected seasonality that Revlimid and Pomalyst experienced due to patients entering the coverage gap early in the year. 
Outside the U.S., we saw a 4% increase primarily from foreign exchange, as well as strong demand for triplet-based therapies, which offset the approximate $100 million combined impact of an inventory build in a tender last year. This resulted in a 1% increase for REVLIMID globally. Global Pomalyst revenues were up 8%. This was driven by overall strong demand from triplet-based regimens and use in earlier lines. 
Now we want to spend a few minutes sharing the progress we've made in the quarter on our recent launches on Slide 12. Our launches contributed $145 million in sales in the quarter. Let's start with Reblozyl, which generated $112 million in the first quarter. We continue to be pleased with the launch and uptake in new patient starts. We continue to see the transition from initial bolus to underlying demand. And while this market has seen some COVID impact, we remain focused on continuing to drive new starts for patients earlier in their treatment journey. Our initial launches in international markets are going well, and we will continue to add markets globally over the course of the year as we receive reimbursement. 
Moving to Zeposia, where we continue to see good traction in establishing the brand as the S1P modulator choice in multiple sclerosis. Positive initial prescribing experiences are translating into repeat scripts, and we are also encouraged to see patients convert to commercial supply at a quicker rate than before. Beyond multiple sclerosis, we look forward to launching Zeposia in ulcerative colitis with FDA approval expected at the end of May. Outside the U.S., we are pleased with Zeposia's MS launches in several markets, and we will continue to secure reimbursement in additional markets as the year progresses. The marketing authorization application for ulcerative colitis also remains under review in Europe with approval expected towards the end of this year. 
Turning to Onureg. We continue to be encouraged by the launch where our teams remain focused on establishing the profile as the first and only oral treatment to demonstrate an overall survival benefit in the first-line maintenance setting of AML. Physician feedback and awareness have been positive, and our focus remains on shaping and establishing Onureg in a new maintenance segment of the AML treatment paradigm, which we know will take some time. Outside the U.S., we recently received a positive opinion from the CHMP with approval expected this year. 
Turning to our new newly established cell therapy franchise on Slide 13. We are very excited to have launched 2 differentiated cell therapies for patients following the recent approval of Breyanzi in large B-cell lymphoma and Abecma in multiple myeloma. 
First, regarding Breyanzi, our best-in-class CD19. While we are early in the launch, messages around efficacy and outpatient utilization are resonating, with high aided awareness among CAR-T treaters. We have also been very pleased with the rapid activation of our treatment sites as we now have approximately 55 sites activated with patients already apheresed and recently infused. And as it relates to Abecma, we're excited to have the first-ever BCMA CAR-T approved for patients with highly refractory multiple myeloma, where we're just a few weeks into the launch, we're encouraged by the enthusiasm we are hearing from customers for the treatment. We also see a real opportunity for synergy from the combined execution of these 2 therapies as Abecma is able to leverage the existing and growing site footprint of Breyanzi. For both these important new medicines, our priorities are expanding the site footprint through rapid account activation and maximizing our differentiated profiles while ensuring a seamless customer experience. 
Now let me take you through a few items on the P&L on Slide 14. First, as we've said, our gross margin will continue to be largely a function of product mix, and in the first quarter, our gross margin rate was impacted by the strength of Eliquis, in addition to foreign exchange. Operating expenses reflect continued MS&A investment in our multiple launches across various therapeutic areas. And as that relates to our tax rate, our effective rate in the quarter was 16.8%, which reflects our earnings mix for the quarter. 
Now switching gears to the balance sheet and our capital allocation on Slide 15. Our liquidity position remains strong with approximately $13 billion in cash and marketable securities, including strong cash flow from operations of nearly $4 billion in the quarter. Regarding capital allocation, business development remains our top priority for the company, and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to complement our internal innovation. 
With regard to our debt reduction this quarter, we've demonstrated our commitment to strong investment-grade credit rating by accelerating our repayment of debt by a $4 billion tender and redemption. 
We are also committed to returning cash to shareholders through dividend and share repurchases. Recall that we increased our share repurchase authorization by $2 billion at the start of the year, and that we plan to buy back between $3 billion and $4 billion in shares this year. In the first quarter, we have already repurchased $1.8 billion toward that goal, and we will remain opportunistic as the year progresses. 
Now turning to our 2021 guidance on Slide 16. Following this quarter's performance, we are reaffirming our non-GAAP guidance for the year, which reflects significant growth over last year. Our businesses have remained resilient, and our launch opportunities have come into fruition. Again, I'm pleased not with just the performance, but also with the considerable progress we made in executing our launches and advancing our pipeline. 
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Tim and Giovanni for Q&A."

So first, let me say that we are very excited and pleased with the data readout that we've seen for the third I-O that we have from BMS. The results are very encouraging. And I think seeing an enhanced activity on top of Opdivo in melanoma, that's a pretty high bar. And so we're excited about the opportunity to bring this to patients. 
In terms of where it fits, you remember the current landscape of first-line melanoma, Opdivo-Yervoy represents about 35% to 40% of first-line melanoma. Approximately 30% of this market is still single-agent I-O, and you've got another 30% that is non-I-O. So we think there's a real clear opportunity here for us to drive the benefit of relatlimab plus OPDIVO into that population. There's clearly a continued unmet need with physicians looking for additional options that have a dual I-O-like effect, and we're looking forward to bringing that combination to patients as we work our way through the regulatory process. 
In terms of the adjuvant opportunities, again, this is going to be an important opportunity as we get into the latter half of this year. And certainly, as we look about -- look for the growth opportunities beyond 2021, you noted esophageal and the upcoming opportunity with bladder. We're very excited about those. With adjuvant esophageal, this is a substantial patient population with considerable unmet need. The treatment rates here are relatively low today, just given the lack of approved therapy. So we would anticipate that over time, we'll be able to drive utilization, both in terms of the patients who are being treated today, which is relatively small, and then improve treatment rates over time, much the way we did, you'll recall, in adjuvant melanoma. And we would expect a similar dynamic to play out as we launch in bladder cancer as well. And so very excited about those opportunities and look forward to seeing those launches play out in the coming months."

And certainly, very excited to see the data coming out, grateful to patients and certainly very happy with where we're going in the pipeline for LAG-3 in oncology for BMS as well. Overall, the natural progression after seeing the data in the first-line setting of addition of relatlimab on top of Opdivo would be to go into the adjuvant setting. And that's where you're beginning to hear a lot more that we'll be progressing into a Phase III program in the adjuvant setting for this co-formulation that we now have as a fixed-dose combination for Opdivo plus relatlimab. Certainly more to follow as we look deeper into the data for the metastatic trial, to gain more in-depth knowledge on the biomarkers as well as the long-term follow-up that will come from the current 047 trial that will continue to evolve in terms of our knowledge. 
Now the second part which you asked is about the non-small cell lung cancer opportunity. Certainly, excited to have started the early POC generation trial as well as looking at the combination of nivo plus relatlimab plus chemotherapy to see where we can take it. And that's the idea behind accelerating the enrollment in that trial so that by the end of the year, we can initiate a Phase III program in that setting if we have tolerability that is demonstrated in that early trial that we're looking at. 
In addition to that, we will continue to hear evolution of the data potentially into [indiscernible] cellular carcinoma that we are looking also to have some look into in the Phase II study. And that can open up additional indications as we look forward. 
Beyond that, in the SSP trial, yes, we are still looking forward to the readout in the early part of 2022. As I said earlier, there are 2 opportunities. Opportunity number one is to improve on the current anti-coagulation paradigm with a single agent. And then opportunity number two is to expand the use of anticoagulants with a background therapy of anti-platelet agents. And those are the 2 studies that together will form the basis of the clinical development plan that we are thinking through, whether it be the venous side or the arterial side of thrombosis."

As we think about the number of new PD-1 entrants in the market, we really look at it on 2 dimensions. First, there's the competitive impact of having additional players on the market. Frankly, that's an area that we pay attention to, but we're a little bit less concerned about. We have considerable resources focused on planning around competition. We have a good track record of competing in these markets. And while we're always a bit paranoid of potential new entrants, we feel very good about our ability to effectively manage competition. 
The second dimension that we look at is the one you're raising, which is the risk of commoditization of a market. And the way we look at that is commoditization, we think, requires 2 things. It requires a low-cost entrance and it requires perceived interchangeability on the part of payers, providers and patients. The risk of both of these things coming together likely varies, we believe, by geography, health care system. It may be even by therapeutic setting, but we pay very close attention to this. In terms of the risk, we absolutely believe it's something that we need to stay on top of. It's, as you note, very dynamic. Currently, the areas where we see the greatest risk don't overlap with our largest markets, at least today. But we certainly have plans to address the risk as they become more tangible. 
The 2 things that I think we can continue to do that position us well against this threat are, first, continue to leverage the extremely broad data set that we have generated in I-O to ensure that treatment decisions continue to be clinically driven. And then second, continue to rapidly bring new data and approvals to market, such that we're constantly pushing forward innovation and changing the standard of care. But this is an area that's very dynamic, and we're paying close attention to it."

So Reblozyl, we're very pleased actually with the continued strong execution of the teams, and what we're hearing on Reblozyl and our exp",662,"Sure. Thanks for the questions, Geoff. There's a lot there, so let me try to hit on each of these relatively quickly. So Reblozyl, we're very pleased actually with the continued strong execution of the teams, and what we're hearing on Reblozyl and our expectations for growth this year, and certainly in the long term, remain unchanged. As for the dynamics that we saw in the quarter, sales were relatively flat Q4 into Q1, and there were really 2 factors underlying this. First, as you will have heard from some of our peers, we have seen new patient volumes down in hematology generally. They were down about 10% to 20% versus pre-COVID levels in the MDS population. And so that was one of the factors at play, at least for the quarter. And we have seen specific to Reblozyl, a bit of a prolonged bolus washout period. And to give you some context around that, in Q4, we estimate that bolus patients for Reblozyl often were roughly around 40% of the overall business. In Q1, that has come down to about 20% to 25%, and we would expect those patients to continue to come off therapy over the coming months. Those 2 dynamics, notwithstanding, we are very encouraged by the continued uptake of new patient starts in this setting and continue to see new trials and an expansion of the prescriber base, which is critically important at this point in the launch. So continued excitement on our -- from our perspective with respect to Reblozyl. 
Onureg and Zeposia in terms of pivot points, I would say, as we have discussed in MS and as you've seen with some of our peers, it does take time to transition patients from written scripts to commercial dispensation in MS. That said, it was a big focus area as we discussed last year, and we are seeing very nice acceleration for Zeposia in MS. And of course, we have the opportunity in UC coming up with the PDUFA date in a month or so, and that's obviously another important opportunity for Zeposia and very much look forward to bringing this differentiated product and mechanism into IBD. 
Onureg, we're in the process of creating a market with Onureg, and that launch is going very well. In fact, we saw patient demand volume increase about 50% from Q4 coming into Q1. And I would say in that space, we're very excited with what we're seeing. Now again, it's a market where we're creating a new treatment paradigm, and that's going to take some time. But all indicators are that the efficacy profile of this data is landing well with customers. And again, the teams are executing well. 
And then pivoting to your question on cell therapy. We're very excited about the 2 cell therapy launches. Both products have been very well received. Given Breyanzi's got a little bit more data in terms of the launch timing, let me start there. The launch there is going very well. We've had over 50 accounts that have been activated already. Our highest priority accounts, in fact, were activated within 8 weeks of approval. The messaging around the best-in-class profile for Breyanzi is landing well. Physicians are clearly seeing a differentiated safety profile. And in fact, we've already apheresed and infused patients with Breyanzi and so I would say the execution there has been exceptionally well. 
And just quickly on Abecma. Obviously, a bit earlier in the process for Abecma, but we have the advantage of launching that product on top of the infrastructure that we've built with Breyanzi. So we've actually been able to more rapidly activate sites there. We've had 25 centers were activated within 10 days of approval. The physician feedback has been very positive, and there's a lot of enthusiasm for us bringing the first BCMA-targeted cell therapy into multiple myeloma. So, so far, early days, but the launches seem to be off to a very good start."

In relation to business development, Bristol, we anticipate it's going to be more active than many of your peers given the cadence of LOEs you have in your portfolio. The FTC has been making increasingly loud noises about consolidation being a driver of increased drug prices and diminish patient access of late. I'm interested on how you think this could impact our business development going forward, whether it's more noise than actions, and what we should be looking for in novel mechanisms to engage to determine whether M&A relates in anticompetitive activities. 
And then second question for Samit. Perhaps you care to comment on whether you anticipate a panel meeting to assess JAK safety broadly in a cross-divisional way. I'm obviously thinking about deucravacitinib in terms of its broader membership of that particular category."

Let me start with your question on business development, and then Samit will follow on your second question. So it's really difficult to speculate at this point in early days what the evolving position of the FTC will be. A couple of things that I would say is, number one, I do agree with you that business development is an important priority for us. It has been for a while. And it will remain one of the priorities for deploying capital in our capital allocation strategy. 
The second thing that I like to say is that I actually feel that we've demonstrated over and over that when we acquire assets into the company, it's actually a way of accelerating their development and generating even more value for patients. And that's an important element of what drives our business development strategy. I feel there are plenty of opportunities to continue to strengthen our portfolio across all of the areas where we have presence and expertise. And obviously, we'll always take competition issues into account when we look at opportunities, but I don't see that at this point as limiting our ability to continue to execute a very differentiated business development strategy. So with that, Samit?"

The way we think about it is as we have presented, if you look at the data, we do believe it is very differentiated. And there are absolutely good measures in terms of thinking around preclinical data, the clinical data, the mechanism of action and the way the data has evolved also on the efficacy side. So overall, I think we have very strong arguments. If there is an AdCom, certainly, we'll be prepared with that with all the data that we've shared already, and we'll continue to evolve in terms of a long-term follow-up as well. We do believe this is new breakthrough in science. It's a new first-in-class molecule for a TYK2 inhibitor, potentially first as it brings new efficacy data for patients with psoriasis, which is an unmet medical need. So certainly looking forward to sharing more as we go along. At the current time, we are in discussions in terms of preparing the file and getting it to the regulators and move it forward as soon as possible."

Let me start there, and then I'll ask Chris to address your question on Zeposia. So let me say, obviously, there is continued dialogue about the potential benefit design changes that may be discussed by the administration. And I think it's premature to go into any assessment of what the Part D redesign may -- what elements may be discussed going forward. I think what's important is a couple of things. So first of all, as you know, we have a very diversified portfolio across multiple payer segments and multiple therapeutic areas. And so there will always be different impacts on different parts of our portfolio from any benefit redesign and very different dynamics for a product like Revlimid versus a product like Eliquis. So that makes it difficult to give you any insights into the impact of reforms because it really is important to know the details. 
What I think it's more important is the fact that from our perspective, it is critical that we look at reforms. I have one objective in mind, which is to improve affordability for patients in Medicare Part D. That's sort of the core of the priority that the industry has. And the proposals that we'll continue to make as we interact with the administration, we'll be focused on elements of Part D redesign that include establishing out-of-pocket caps, reducing the overall impact to patients in the catastrophic phase, smoothing expenses throughout the year. And so as proposals progress, I think it will be easier for us to provide insights into how that impacts our portfolio. Chris?"

What we are now bringing is an additional, let's say, treatment potential for patients who can be treated, who have melanoma in the first-line setting with relatlimab on top of nivolumab as a single agent. And that's the reason why we're excited about this, to be able to add to the treatment paradigm for prescribers and for patients to potentially use in the future once approved in this particular setting. One has to remember that we are also talking about the safety profile and its differentiation over here.

So the way we think about Zeposia is, first of all, we're very excited about the opportunity initially that we have both in the U.S. and ex U.S. And we think that Zeposia brings a very differentiated profile into this market. It's now in the U.S., the #1 SP in terms of written prescriptions. We're gaining on oral agents. And as I mentioned earlier, we are making progress in terms of optimizing the patient pull-through in terms of commercial dispense. So we think we've got considerable opportunity to continue to grow in the short term in MS in the U.S. Ex U.S., it's still very early days for the launches of Zeposia, but I would say that in the early launch markets in Europe, Zeposia's uptake appears to be very good, particularly in markets like Germany. So I think in the near term, there's going to be clearly a focus on maximizing the opportunity that we have with Zeposia in that market globally. And then, of course, with the upcoming launch in UC, that becomes a much more important opportunity for us as we get into 2022 and beyond. Zeposia's profile looks very good. The feedback we've gotten from treaters in the IBD space is very positive. Obviously, the rate limiter in terms of the U.S. uptake is going to be accessed. We know that's a very important component, and we're going to approach that in a very stepwise fashion. It's going to be important that we drive volume initially in those patients -- with those patients who have insurance that is open or relatively unrestricted. And then we'll leverage the Zeposia profile to drive additional utilization and then, of course, work with payers to ensure that we continue to increase the access that patients have in that space. That will clearly take some time. But we think the opportunity in IBD for Zeposia is substantial, and that will be important both in the U.S. and ex U.S. as we get into that launch in -- later in 2021 and then certainly 2022 and beyond."

Based on everything that has been said, it sounds as though the relatlimab data is not competitive with Opdivo plus Yervoy on efficacy. It might be on safety or am I misinterpreting? For instance, you mentioned adding to the armament area but not advancing it. You referred to many patients on monotherapy or not receiving I-O, but you didn't really refer to those on I-O, I-O. So I'm just curious what we should interpret. And will full data be in the abstract on May 19?

But I think what's important there is actually the strength of the emerging business for the remainder of the decade. And obviously, the launch brands become particularly important given that we're discussing 2025. 
Let me just reiterate our enthusiasm for the relatlimab-Opdivo fixed-dose combination in melanoma. It is clear that we have a very well-established standard of care with O plus Y and long durability of response demonstrated over a long period of time. But I just want to, again, reiterate from an efficacy perspective, from a safety perspective, we're really excited to be able to show today at ASCO. Samit?"

For relatlimab, we do not have the overall survival data as well as the response rate data. But we are excited to see where we stand with our overall progression-free survival data as compared to single-agent nivolumab. And you'll see that data very soon. And certainly, we can have a dialogue after that. But as Giovanni said, very pleased where we are and certainly looking forward to the evolution of the data as we go forward."

So very happy with the performance of Zeposia in MS, particularly as you point out, in light of the COVID environment. This was, as we had talked about last year, a market that was hit by COVID in terms of new patient volume being down. And obviously, this is a market that we are entering into relatively new for BMS. And so at the end of last year, we spent a considerable amount of time making sure we were engaging with customers in many cases for the first time. And so our focus was continuing to do a few things. First, it was making sure that we were selling the profile for this, what we believe and clearly is being demonstrated in the data, #1 SP in this market. We've seen very good uptake in terms of written prescriptions here. Obviously, the dynamic pool of MS is relatively small, and we've seen most of the business at this point coming from switch patients, and we're continuing to get an increase in new patients who are coming on board as well. So we're very happy with that. And we would expect that to continue to evolve over time. 
And then obviously, as I mentioned in one of the previous questions, a big focus for us has been making sure that we continue to convert those written scripts into commercial dispense and ensuring a very smooth journey for patients in this market, and we've had a great acceleration there.

We are leaders in multiple myeloma, of course, continuing to build on the heritage of the image where we've pioneered in that space. We do have the broadest portfolio, and now we are beginning to see the results of that with the approval of Abecma. But the way we look at it is a 3-pronged approach. On one side, we have the CELMoDs, which have the potential to allow for us to replace the image over time with a near-term opportunity for iberdomide reading out this year in the fourth line plus setting. And then the second CELMoD 480 reading out in 2022. The second strategy is the BCMA targeting. Abecma already approved, and we have the investigation ongoing for T-cell engager as well as the ADC targeting. The third pillar is, of course, the combination. And you will see beginning this year already the studies of CELMoDs in the earlier line setting in the 1 to 2 prior lines of therapy. And then we will continue to build on the other combinations as well. So we feel overall really good about our position by having these multiple modalities, and we are confident that we can continue to build on our leadership position going forward in that space."

We obviously, over the last few years, built a very innovative model where through a network of partnerships primarily, a small team at BMS has been very successful in advancing an early portfolio that looks quite compelling at this point. So not a large area of focus from a sort of late-stage development for us yet, but an emerging franchise that could be important in the future. As I said earlier, we are going to be looking at continuing to strengthen our portfolio depending on, obviously, the assets that we look at and are available across all of the areas where we have expertise. We haven't really given a target in terms of spend per year, but we've made it very clear that this is the #1 priority in terms of capital allocation strategy. The acquisition of MyoKardia last year is a really good example of the type of focus we want to continue to have going forward as a company.

Now turning to Slide 4. We at the start of the year, I laid out our strategy to grow our business and renew our portfolio through the end of the decade. During the first quarter, we delivered strong results consistent with this strategy. We successfully grew our revenues, launched new medicines and new indications for I-O and continued to advance our pipeline. 
Starting with our financial performance, Our revenue grew 3% despite the impact of COVID-19-related buying patterns in Q1 of last year. Our quarter was strong for sales and EPS in the context of COVID-related dynamics for some of our products. Based on continued strength in our business, we are affirming our full year non-GAAP guidance for 2021. The accelerated renewal of our portfolio advanced across all 4 key therapeutic areas. Through regulatory approvals and clinical readouts, we're building a more diversified, younger portfolio that will fuel our growth through the decade and beyond. 
Although there remains uncertainty with how the COVID recovery will evolve, we are actively planning to return colleagues to the workplace, and are prioritizing plans to fully bring our sales reps back in the field, where conditions allow, to further support our in-line products and launches. 
Let's turn to our execution scorecard on Slide 5. I am pleased that we've already made solid progress across the board during Q1. Specifically, in oncology, Opdivo is the first and only I-O agent with a first-line approval in gastric cancer. Combined with our opportunities in metastatic and adjuvant esophageal cancer, Opdivo can become the leading I-O medicine for patients with early and advanced GI cancers. We have strengthened the growth and long-term sustainability of our I-O franchise with a positive Phase III clinical trial for relatlimab. We're now the only company with 3 proven I-O mechanisms. 
Building on our leadership position in melanoma with the Opdivo plus Yervoy regimen, we've now demonstrated a clinically meaningful PFS benefit on top of PD-1 monotherapy for a second I-O agent, which is a great accomplishment knowing the high efficacy of PD-1 monotherapy in first-line melanoma. This is great news for patients with advanced melanoma, and we look forward to presenting the data at ASCO in June. 
Beyond I-O, 6 of our 8 near-term launches are now successfully underway. In hematology, we made great progress in our cell therapy franchise with U.S. approvals of Breyanzi and Abecma. Our other new product launches are also progressing well. 
A lot is happening in immunology. We presented Phase III data for deucrava, which we expect to file later this year. We see this as an important medicine for patients and the company with significant revenue potential. As you know, deucrava is a first-in-class selective TYK2 inhibitor with the potential to become the new oral standard of care in moderate-to-severe psoriasis. It also has broader potential to treat diseases such as psoriatic arthritis, IBD and lupus. 
In our mid-stage pipeline, we initiated the Phase III study for cendakimab in eosinophilic esophagitis. And in CV, we filed mavacamten with the FDA and have a PDUFA date of early next year. 
Given the potential for our early-stage pipeline with multiple assets across therapeutic areas and modalities, including protein homeostasis, cell therapy and next-generation biologics, we are planning a more in-depth session with you sometime in the fall to update you on the progress within our pipeline and how that further supports the long-term potential of the company. 
Now turning to Slide 6. Our team's execution as a new company so far has been remarkable and reinforces my confidence in our ability to capitalize on the potential for future growth. We remain focused on growing our business between 2020 and 2025. More importantly, we expect that in '25, our LOE products will constitute less than 10% of our business with roughly 1/3 of our continuing business coming from our launch portfolio. We believe our new launch portfolio has significant potential, with $20 billion to $25 billion of non-risk-adjusted sales potential in 2029. And this does not include the potential medicines that could come from our mid- or early-stage pipeline. 
To close, I'm confident we have established a strong foundation for our future growth. The strength of our execution, promising launch opportunities ahead, the breadth of our pipeline and strength of our balance sheet positions us very well. 
I will now turn it over to David to walk you through the financials. David?"
25798,707216767,2263244,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Bristol-Myers Squibb Company","Executives","Thank you, Giovanni, and thank you all for joining our call today. I'd like to start with our strong top line performance on Slide 8. Our continued sales growth of 3% was driven by strong operational performance. When excluding the approximately $500 mill",1566,"Thank you, Giovanni, and thank you all for joining our call today. I'd like to start with our strong top line performance on Slide 8. Our continued sales growth of 3% was driven by strong operational performance. When excluding the approximately $500 million of COVID-related buying patterns we experienced last year, underlying sales growth was strong, up 8%, or 6% excluding the benefits of foreign exchange, as our teams continue to execute very well while operating in a mostly virtual environment. 
I'll now provide additional color on the performance of our key brands and new launches, starting with Eliquis on Slide 9. This was another strong quarter for Eliquis as global sales were up 9% despite the unwinding of a fourth quarter inventory build and the approximately $350 million COVID-related build we experienced this time last year. In the U.S., first quarter sales increased 8% versus prior year, driven by strong demand with total prescriptions up 11% due to the strength of our position as the #1 NOAC. First quarter sales also included the impact of a onetime true-up of approximately $160 million related to the Medicare coverage gap. 
As we look towards the second half of the year, we expect similar dynamics from the coverage gap as we've seen in prior years. We remain optimistic about the continued growth opportunity for Eliquis since we've seen both new-to-brand OAC volumes return to prepandemic levels as well as accelerated switching from warfarin. 
Internationally, sales remained strong, growing 11% versus prior year. Eliquis continues to be the #1 NOAC in multiple key markets internationally with significant room to grow. We remain very pleased with the execution of Eliquis around the world and expect to continue to grow Eliquis share within a growing class. 
Now turning to Opdivo on Slide 10. As it relates to the first quarter performance in the U.S., first-line lung shares remained in the low double digits within the I-O eligible population. The launch of our Opdivo plus Cabo indication in first-line renal is going well and further builds on our strong position in that space with significant uptake in the unfavorable segment where Opdivo plus Yervoy is not indicated. But we did see some impact from COVID during the quarter as the resurgence of the virus earlier in the year impacted offices at an infusion, we remain very confident in Opdivo's return to growth this year. Further supporting this growth, we are also very pleased with the recent approval of CheckMate -649 as Opdivo plus chemo is now the first I-O regimen approved in first-line gastric cancer. We look forward to launching additional indications in early-stage diseases across esophageal and muscle-invasive bladder cancers, which are expected to further contribute to our growth later this year. 
Additionally, we have multiple opportunities for future growth, including CheckMate -648, for the treatment in first-line esophageal cancer, which we announced as primary endpoints, as well as from other trials that will read out over time. 
Outside the U.S., sales were up 2% due to favorable effects of foreign exchange. We are encouraged to see strong adoption of new approvals and increased reimbursement, including the 9LA regimen in Europe and both 9LA and 227 regimens in Japan. These dynamics offset the second-line indications and the impact of COVID. Looking forward, we expect to expand the use of Opdivo in several additional indications currently under review. All in all, we remain very excited about the growth outlook for Opdivo. 
Moving to Slide 11, I'd like to touch on our in-line multiple myeloma portfolio. In the U.S., Revlimid sales are flat. Its growth was offset by the expected work-down of last quarter's inventory build. We also saw the expected seasonality that Revlimid and Pomalyst experienced due to patients entering the coverage gap early in the year. 
Outside the U.S., we saw a 4% increase primarily from foreign exchange, as well as strong demand for triplet-based therapies, which offset the approximate $100 million combined impact of an inventory build in a tender last year. This resulted in a 1% increase for Revlimid globally. Global Pomalyst revenues were up 8%. This was driven by overall strong demand from triplet-based regimens and use in earlier lines. 
Now we want to spend a few minutes sharing the progress we've made in the quarter on our recent launches on Slide 12. Our launches contributed $145 million in sales in the quarter. Let's start with Reblozyl, which generated $112 million in the first quarter. We continue to be pleased with the launch and uptake in new patient starts. We continue to see the transition from initial bolus to underlying demand. And while this market has seen some COVID impact, we remain focused on continuing to drive new starts for patients earlier in their treatment journey. Our initial launches in international markets are going well, and we will continue to add markets globally over the course of the year as we receive reimbursement. 
Moving to Zeposia, where we continue to see good traction in establishing the brand as the S1P modulator choice in multiple sclerosis. Positive initial prescribing experiences are translating into repeat scripts, and we are also encouraged to see patients convert to commercial supply at a quicker rate than before. Beyond multiple sclerosis, we look forward to launching Zeposia in ulcerative colitis with FDA approval expected at the end of May. Outside the U.S., we are pleased with Zeposia's MS launches in several markets, and we will continue to secure reimbursement in additional markets as the year progresses. The marketing authorization application for ulcerative colitis also remains under review in Europe with approval expected towards the end of this year. 
Turning to Onureg. We continue to be encouraged by the launch where our teams remain focused on establishing the profile as the first and only oral treatment to demonstrate an overall survival benefit in the first-line maintenance setting of AML. Physician feedback and awareness have been positive, and our focus remains on shaping and establishing Onureg in a new maintenance segment of the AML treatment paradigm, which we know will take some time. Outside the U.S., we recently received a positive opinion from the CHMP with approval expected this year. 
Turning to our new newly established cell therapy franchise on Slide 13. We are very excited to have launched 2 differentiated cell therapies for patients following the recent approval of Breyanzi in large B-cell lymphoma and Abecma in multiple myeloma. 
First, regarding Breyanzi, our best-in-class CD19. While we are early in the launch, messages around efficacy and outpatient utilization are resonating, with high aided awareness among CAR-T treaters. We have also been very pleased with the rapid activation of our treatment sites as we now have approximately 55 sites activated with patients already apheresed and recently infused. And as it relates to Abecma, we're excited to have the first-ever BCMA CAR-T approved for patients with highly refractory multiple myeloma, where we're just a few weeks into the launch, we're encouraged by the enthusiasm we are hearing from customers for the treatment. We also see a real opportunity for synergy from the combined execution of these 2 therapies as Abecma is able to leverage the existing and growing site footprint of Breyanzi. For both these important new medicines, our priorities are expanding the site footprint through rapid account activation and maximizing our differentiated profiles while ensuring a seamless customer experience. 
Now let me take you through a few items on the P&L on Slide 14. First, as we've said, our gross margin will continue to be largely a function of product mix, and in the first quarter, our gross margin rate was impacted by the strength of Eliquis, in addition to foreign exchange. Operating expenses reflect continued MS&A investment in our multiple launches across various therapeutic areas. And as that relates to our tax rate, our effective rate in the quarter was 16.8%, which reflects our earnings mix for the quarter. 
Now switching gears to the balance sheet and our capital allocation on Slide 15. Our liquidity position remains strong with approximately $13 billion in cash and marketable securities, including strong cash flow from operations of nearly $4 billion in the quarter. Regarding capital allocation, business development remains our top priority for the company, and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to complement our internal innovation.  With regard to our debt reduction this quarter, we've demonstrated our commitment to strong investment-grade credit rating by accelerating our repayment of debt by a $4 billion tender and redemption. 
We are also committed to returning cash to shareholders through dividend and share repurchases. Recall that we increased our share repurchase authorization by $2 billion at the start of the year, and that we plan to buy back between $3 billion and $4 billion in shares this year. In the first quarter, we have already repurchased $1.8 billion toward that goal, and we will remain opportunistic as the year progresses. 
Now turning to our 2021 guidance on Slide 16. Following this quarter's performance, we are reaffirming our non-GAAP guidance for the year, which reflects significant growth over last year. Our businesses have remained resilient, and our launch opportunities have come into fruition. Again, I'm pleased not with just the performance, but also with the considerable progress we made in executing our launches and advancing our pipeline. 
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Tim and Giovanni for Q&A."

So first, let me say that we are very excited and pleased with the data readout that we've seen for the third I-O that we have from BMS. The results are very encouraging. And I think seeing an enhanced activity on top of Opdivo in melanoma, that's a pretty high bar. And so we're excited about the opportunity to bring this to patients. 
In terms of where it fits, you remember the current landscape of first-line melanoma, Opdivo-Yervoy represents about 35% to 40% of first-line melanoma. Approximately 30% of this market is still single-agent I-O, and you've got another 30% that is non-I-O. So we think there's a real clear opportunity here for us to drive the benefit of relatlimab plus OPDIVO into that population. There's clearly a continued unmet need with physicians looking for additional options that have a dual I-O-like effect, and we're looking forward to bringing that combination to patients as we work our way through the regulatory process. 
In terms of the adjuvant opportunities, again, this is going to be an important opportunity as we get into the latter half of this year. And certainly, as we look about -- look for the growth opportunities beyond 2021, you noted esophageal and the upcoming opportunity with bladder. We're very excited about those. With adjuvant esophageal, this is a substantial patient population with considerable unmet need. The treatment rates here are relatively low today, just given the lack of approved therapy. So we would anticipate that over time, we'll be able to drive utilization, both in terms of the patients who are being treated today, which is relatively small, and then improve treatment rates over time, much the way we did, you'll recall, in adjuvant melanoma. And we would expect a similar dynamic to play out as we launch in bladder cancer as well. And so very excited about those opportunities and look forward to seeing those launches play out in the coming months."

And certainly, very excited to see the data coming out, great for the patients and certainly very happy with where we're going in the pipeline for LAG-3 in oncology for BMS as well. Overall, the natural progression after seeing the data in the first-line setting of addition of relatlimab on top of Opdivo would be to go into the adjuvant setting. And that's where you're beginning to hear a lot more that we'll be progressing into a Phase III program in the adjuvant setting for this co-formulation that we now have as a fixed-dose combination for Opdivo plus relatlimab. Certainly more to follow as we look deeper into the data for the metastatic trial, to gain more in-depth knowledge on the biomarkers as well as the long-term follow-up that will come from the current 047 trial that will continue to evolve in terms of our knowledge. 
Now the second part which you asked is about the non-small cell lung cancer opportunity. Certainly, excited to have started the early POC generation trial as well as looking at the combination of nivo plus relatlimab plus chemotherapy to see where we can take it. And that's the idea behind accelerating the enrollment in that trial so that by the end of the year, we can initiate a Phase III program in that setting if we have tolerability that is demonstrated in that early trial that we're looking at. 
In addition to that, we will continue to hear evolution of the data potentially into hepatocellular carcinoma that we are looking also to have some look into in the Phase II study. And that can open up additional indications as we look forward. 
Beyond that, in the SSP trial, yes, we are still looking forward to the readout in the early part of 2022. As I said earlier, there are 2 opportunities. Opportunity number one is to improve on the current anti-coagulation paradigm with a single agent. And then opportunity number two is to expand the use of anticoagulants with a background therapy of anti-platelet agents. And those are the 2 studies that together will form the basis of the clinical development plan that we are thinking through, whether it be the venous side or the arterial side of thrombosis."

As we think about the number of new PD-1 entrants in the market, we really look at it on 2 dimensions. First, there's the competitive impact of having additional players on the market. Frankly, that's an area that we pay attention to, but we're a little bit less concerned about. We have considerable resources focused on planning around competition. We have a good track record of competing in these markets. And while we're always a bit paranoid of potential new entrants, we feel very good about our ability to effectively manage competition. 
The second dimension that we look at is the one you're raising, which is the risk of commoditization of a market. And the way we look at that is commoditization, we think, requires 2 things. It requires a low-cost entrants and it requires perceived interchangeability on the part of payers, providers and patients. The risk of both of these things coming together likely varies, we believe, by geography, health care system. It may be even by therapeutic setting, but we pay very close attention to this. In terms of the risk, we absolutely believe it's something that we need to stay on top of. It's, as you note, very dynamic. Currently, the areas where we see the greatest risk don't overlap with our largest markets, at least today. But we certainly have plans to address the risk as they become more tangible. 
The 2 things that I think we can continue to do that position us well against this threat are, first, continue to leverage the extremely broad data set that we have generated in I-O to ensure that treatment decisions continue to be clinically driven. And then second, continue to rapidly bring new data and approvals to market, such that we're constantly pushing forward innovation and changing the standard of care. But this is an area that's very dynamic, and we're paying close attention to it."

There's a lot there, so let me try to hit on each of these relatively quickly. So Reblozyl, we're very pleased actually with the continued strong execution of the teams, and what we're hearing on Reblozyl and our expectations for growth this year, and certainly in the long term, remain unchanged. As for the dynamics that we saw in the quarter, sales were relatively flat Q4 into Q1, and there were really 2 factors underlying this. First, as you will have heard from some of our peers, we have seen new patient volumes down in hematology generally. They were down about 10% to 20% versus pre-COVID levels in the MDS population and so that was one of the factors at play, at least for the quarter. And we have seen specific to Reblozyl, a bit of a prolonged bolus washout period. 
And to give you some context around that, in Q4, we estimate that bolus patients for Reblozyl often were roughly around 40% of the overall business. In Q1, that has come down to about 20% to 25%, and we would expect those patients to continue to come off therapy over the coming months. Those 2 dynamics, notwithstanding, we are very encouraged by the continued uptake of new patient starts in this setting and continue to see new trials and an expansion of the prescriber base, which is critically important at this point in the launch. So continued excitement on our -- from our perspective with respect to Reblozyl. 
Onureg and Zeposia in terms of pivot points, I would say, as we have discussed in MS and as you've seen with some of our peers, it does take time to transition patients from written scripts to commercial dispensation in MS. That said, it was a big focus area as we discussed last year, and we are seeing very nice acceleration for Zeposia in MS. And of course, we have the opportunity in UC coming up with the PDUFA date in a month or so, and that's obviously another important opportunity for Zeposia and very much look forward to bringing this differentiated product and mechanism into IBD. 
Onureg, we're in the process of creating a market with Onureg, and that launch is going very well. In fact, we saw patient demand volume increase about 50% from Q4 coming into Q1. And I would say in that space, we're very excited with what we're seeing. Now again, it's a market where we're creating a new treatment paradigm, and that's going to take some time. But all indicators are that the efficacy profile of this data is landing well with customers. And again, the teams are executing well. 
And then pivoting to your question on cell therapy. We're very excited about the 2 cell therapy launches. Both products have been very well received. Given Breyanzi's got a little bit more data in terms of the launch timing, let me start there. The launch there is going very well. We've had over 50 accounts that have been activated already. Our highest priority accounts, in fact, were activated within 8 weeks of approval. The messaging around the best-in-class profile for Breyanzi is landing well. Physicians are clearly seeing a differentiated safety profile. And in fact, we've already infused -- apheresed and infused patients with Breyanzi and so I would say the execution there has been exceptionally well. 
And just quickly on Abecma. Obviously, a bit earlier in the process for Abecma, but we have the advantage of launching that product on top of the infrastructure that we've built with Breyanzi. So we've actually been able to more rapidly activate sites there. We've had 25 centers were activated within 10 days of approval. The physician feedback has been very positive, and there's a lot of enthusiasm for us bringing the first BCMA-targeted cell therapy into multiple myeloma. So, so far, early days, but the launches seem to be off to a very good start."

And it will remain one of the priorities for deploying capital in our capital allocation strategy. 
The second thing that I like to say is that I actually feel that we've demonstrated over and over that when we acquire assets into the company, it's actually a way of accelerating their development and generating even more value for patients. And that's an important element of what drives our business development strategy. I feel there are plenty of opportunities to continue to strengthen our portfolio across all of the areas where we have presence and expertise.

If there is an AdCom, certainly, we'll be prepared with that with all the data that we've shared already, and we'll continue to evolve in terms of a long-term follow-up as well. We do believe this is new breakthrough in science. 
It's a new first-in-class molecule for a -- as a TYK2 inhibitor, potentially first as it brings new efficacy data for patients with psoriasis, which is an unmet medical need. So certainly looking forward to sharing more as we go along. At the current time, we are in discussions in terms of preparing the file and getting it to the regulators and move it forward as soon as possible."

Let me start there, and then I'll ask Chris to address your question on Zeposia. So let me say, obviously, there is continued dialogue about the potential benefit design changes that may be discussed by the administration. And I think it's premature to go into any assessment of what the Part D redesign may -- what elements may be discussed going forward. I think what's important is a couple of things. So first of all, as you know, we have a very diversified portfolio across multiple payer segments and multiple therapeutic areas. And so there will always be different impacts on different parts of our portfolio from any benefit redesign and very different dynamics for a product like Revlimid versus a product like Eliquis. So that makes it difficult to give you any insights into the impact of reforms because it really is important to know the details. 
What I think it's more important is the fact that from our perspective, it is critical that we look at reforms and have one objective in mind, which is to improve affordability for patients in Medicare Part D. That's sort of the core of the priority that the industry has. And the proposals that we'll continue to make as we interact with the administration, we'll be focused on elements of Part D redesign that include establishing out-of-pocket caps, reducing the overall impact to patients in the catastrophic phase, smoothing expenses throughout the year. And so as proposals progress, I think it will be easier for us to provide insights into how that impacts our portfolio. Chris?"

What we are now bringing is an additional, let's say, treatment potential for patients who can be treated, who have melanoma in the first-line setting with relatlimab on top of nivolumab as a single agent. 
And that's the reason why we're excited about this, to be able to add to the treatment paradigm for prescribers and for patients to potentially use in the future once approved in this particular setting. One has to remember that we are also talking about the safety profile and its differentiation over here.

So the way we think about Zeposia is, first of all, we're very excited about the opportunity initially that we have both in the U.S. and ex U.S. in MS. We think that Zeposia brings a very differentiated profile into this market. It's now in the U.S., the #1 SP in terms of written prescriptions. We're gaining on oral agents. And as I mentioned earlier, we are making progress in terms of optimizing the patient pull-through in terms of commercial dispense. So we think we've got considerable opportunity to continue to grow in the short term in MS in the U.S. Ex U.S., it's still very early days for the launches of Zeposia, but I would say that in the early launch markets in Europe, Zeposia's uptake appears to be very good, particularly in markets like Germany. 
So I think in the near term, there's going to be clearly a focus on maximizing the opportunity that we have with Zeposia in that market globally. And then, of course, with the upcoming launch in UC, that becomes a much more important opportunity for us as we get into 2022 and beyond. Zeposia's profile looks very good. The feedback we've gotten from treaters in the IBD space is very positive. Obviously, the rate limiter in terms of the U.S. uptake is going to be accessed. We know that's a very important component, and we're going to approach that in a very stepwise fashion. It's going to be important that we drive volume initially in those patients -- with those patients who have insurance that is open or relatively unrestricted. And then we'll leverage the Zeposia profile to drive additional utilization and then, of course, work with payers to ensure that we continue to increase the access that patients have in that space. That will clearly take some time. But we think the opportunity in IBD for Zeposia is substantial, and that will be important both in the U.S. and ex U.S. as we get into that launch in -- later in 2021 and then certainly 2022 and beyond."

We are leaders in multiple myeloma, of course, continuing to build on the heritage of the image where we've pioneered in that space. We do have the broadest portfolio, and now we are beginning to see the results of that with the approval of Abecma. But the way we look at it is a 3-pronged approach. On one side, we have the CELMoDs, which have the potential to allow for us to replace the image over time with a near-term opportunity for iberdomide reading out this year in the fourth line plus setting. And then the second CELMoD 480 reading out in 2022. 
The second strategy is the BCMA targeting. Abecma already approved, and we have the investigation ongoing for T-cell engager as well as the ADC targeting. The third pillar is, of course, the combination. And you will see beginning this year already the studies of CELMoDs in the earlier line setting in the 1 to 2 prior lines of therapy. And then we will continue to build on the other combinations as well. So we feel overall really good about our position by having these multiple modalities, and we are confident that we can continue to build on our leadership position going forward in that space."

It is a tailwind, the $160 million, with respect to business development. Actually, what we are doing, what our teams are doing in neuroscience is really interesting. We obviously, over the last few years, built a very innovative model where through a network of partnerships primarily, a small team at BMS has been very successful in advancing an early portfolio that looks quite compelling at this point. So not a large area of focus from a sort of late-stage development for us yet, but an emerging franchise that could be important in the future. 
As I said earlier, we are going to be looking at continuing to strengthen our portfolio depending on, obviously, the assets that we look at and are available across all of the areas where we have expertise. We haven't really given a target in terms of spend per year, but we've made it very clear that this is the #1 priority in terms of capital allocation strategy. The acquisition of MyoKardia last year is a really good example of the type of focus we want to continue to have going forward as a company. And I'll remind you, we have tremendous financial flexibility to be able to invest in the right opportunities and in the right science. 
So with that, I would like to thank all of you for joining us today as we discuss this quarter. We delivered strong results consistent with our strategy.

Now turning to Slide 4. 
Let me start by saying I am very proud of our second quarter results and express my gratitude to our teams across the globe for their dedication and steadfast commitment to our patients. Through their work, we are continuing to make great progress to diversify and renew our portfolio and position Bristol-Myers Squibb for an even stronger future. 
During the second quarter, we delivered excellent results across the board, including strong sales growth due to solid commercial performance, positive clinical results in our mid- and late-stage pipeline, continued BD execution and strengthened our financial position. The strength of our commercial execution this quarter was underscored by the performance of our key medicines, including the return of Opdivo growth and the uptake of our new launch portfolio. Over the last 18 months, we launched 5 new medicines with significant potential, and we are very encouraged by their performance to date. 
Clinically, we continue to deliver on the potential of our pipeline with significant mid- and late side stage clinical readouts and important regulatory actions across our therapeutic areas. The recent additions to our portfolio added diversification to our business and an opportunity to generate sustained growth over time. 
From a financial perspective, we saw double-digit growth for both the top and bottom line. And we are reaffirming our full year revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and generate significant cash flow, allowing us to advance our disciplined capital allocation strategy. We remain focused on external business development opportunities to further strengthen our pipeline over the long term. 
This quarter, we executed 2 licensing deals, an anti-TIGIT bispecific antibody program with Agenus; and MORAb-202, a folate receptor alpha ADC with Eisai, both strategically aligned with our oncology franchise. 
Overall, I am extremely pleased with our progress in the quarter. 
Turning now to our execution scorecard on Slide 5. 
We have made tremendous progress year-to-date across our therapeutic areas. In oncology, we are strengthening our I-O franchise and have returned Opdivo to growth through multiple clinical successes and excellent commercial execution. Earlier this year, we launched Opdivo in 3 additional indications, including first-line gastric cancer, where we are the first and only I-O agent. We anticipate additional launch opportunities and growth drivers for Opdivo to further accelerate the growth of the brand. 
We also see opportunities to expand our I-O portfolio through the fixed-dose combination of our LAG-3 inhibitor, relatlimab, with Opdivo. At ASCO last month, we announced impressive results for relatlimab, potentially the third I-O therapy for BMS, building on our leadership in the field and expanding the durability of our franchise. We have a broad development program underway in I-O to benefit more patients over time. 
Moving to hematology. We received approval in the U.S. for 2 cell therapies, Brian and Abaca, and demand for these products has been strong. Physicians recognize the value of these treatments and there is significant patient need. Building on existing indications for Brian we announced the first ever positive Phase III plan data in second-line transplant eligible large B-cell lymphoma last month. This is an important result. For the first time, we have shown that our cell therapy treatment is superior to a well-established standard of care. The positive results demonstrate that we can benefit patients early in their treatment journey. We look forward to sharing more details on these results later this year. 
We also have Iberdomide Phase II data in-house, which we are very pleased with and look forward to discussing with health authorities. The data are potentially the first step towards the establishment of a new backbone of treatment in multiple myeloma, offering a better option to benefit patients. 
We have made tremendous progress expanding our immunology franchise. Ducravacitinib, a first-in-class selective TYK2 inhibitor, has the potential to be the oral agent of choice. We expect to launch this potential new medicine in psoriasis in the second half of 2022. 
We have initiated our Phase III program in psoriatic arthritis. And we also look forward to Phase II data in ulcerative colitis later this year and in Crohn's disease and lupus in 2022 to further expand the potential of this molecule. 
We initiated our Phase III program for cendakimab in eosinophilic esophagitis. And last month in the U.S., we launched Zeposia in ulcerative colitis. 
Finally, turning to. We are encouraged by the top line results we received this quarter for Mildexion, our Factor XIa inhibitor. We look forward to presenting the data at a medical meeting later in the year. Additionally, we are preparing to launch mavacamten for symptomatic obstructive HCM in the U.S. early next year. We are encouraged by the potential of these assets to strengthen the durability of our CV franchise. 
In closing, on Slide 6, our steadfast progress gives me great confidence that we are well positioned for growth. We are rapidly advancing a new launch portfolio of first-in-class or best-in-class medicines across therapeutic areas. We remain focused on driving in light product performance, executing on our launches, advancing early, mid- and late-stage pipeline opportunities and continuing to take a disciplined approach to capital allocation. 
Our strong clinical performance further derisks our launch portfolio. And as a result, our confidence in our ability to deliver the $20 billion to $25 billion in non-risk-adjusted revenue in 2029 continues to increase. Our continued strong financial performance and balance sheet enable us to diversify and strengthen our long-term prospects. 
As our sales force returns to the field and we welcome our remote teams back to the office, I'm excited by the opportunity to reconnect with our colleagues, stakeholders and patients. 
I believe we have the strongest pipeline and launch portfolio in BMS' history. And I'm very excited about our future. 
With that, I'll turn it over to David to walk you through the financials. David?"

Let me start with our top line performance on Slide 8. I'm very pleased to discuss our strong double-digit growth this quarter, driven by increased demand for our key medicines across th",1766,"Thank you, Giovanni, and thank you all for joining our call today. 
Let me start with our top line performance on Slide 8. I'm very pleased to discuss our strong double-digit growth this quarter, driven by increased demand for our key medicines across the globe. 
Looking at the first half of the year, which normalizes for most of the COVID-related buying patterns we experienced last year, commercial performance was strong, up 9% year-over-year or 7% excluding currency. This robust performance demonstrates both our strong execution of our commercial teams as well as increased demand for our products. 
I'll now provide additional color on the performance of our key brands and new launches, starting with Eliquis on Slide 9. 
This was another strong quarter for Eliquis, with global sales up 29% versus last year. Second quarter growth benefited from a favorable year-over-year comparison as prior year included the unwinding of COVID-related buying patterns. When looking at the first half, to normalize for this dynamic, sales remained strong, up 18%. In the U.S., we saw strong demand, with total prescription growth of 14% versus prior year, driven by market share gains, which continue to expect strong new-to-brand share growth for further translate to overall total prescription growth. As a reminder, when we look toward the third and fourth quarters, we expect similar dynamics from the Medicare coverage gap that's seen in previous years. Internationally, we had very strong demand across all key geographies, as we further gained share as the #1 OAC in multiple markets and we continue to see additional room to grow. Overall, we remain very pleased with the execution of Eliquis around the world and expect to continue to grow Eliquis share within a growing class. 
Now turning to Opdivo on Slide 10. 
Let me start by saying we're very pleased to deliver return to growth this quarter up 16% versus last year. While COVID recovery dynamics as well as approximately $40 million in U.S. inventory build contributed this quarter's growth, the brand's performance was largely driven by strong demand for both our core and our newly launched indications. 
In the U.S., sales were up 13% year-over-year as well as 14% sequentially, driven by launches in lung, RCC and our upper GI cancers, which are all going well, and lung shares in the low double digits with positive momentum, and we are seeing use across all histologies. In RCC, our Opdivo plus cabo launch continues to do well, with Opdivo now the leading PD-1 first-line renal across both available regimen. In upper GI, we saw a very strong start with Opdivo plus chemo in first-line gastric cancer with CheckMate 649, which reached 25% to 30% share in just a few months based upon the strength of our data. The adjuvant Supageo launch, while still in early days, is off to a great start. Overall, we see upper GI as an important opportunity for Opdivo based on the breadth of offered indications and the fact that Opdivo is the only PD therapy approved for HER2-negative gastric cancer. Outside the U.S., we had another strong quarter, with sales up 13%, excluding the impact of foreign currency versus last year. Growth was primarily driven by demand of our new launches in lung and renal cancer. Results also benefited from a favorable comparison due to COVID-related impact last year. All in all, we're very pleased with Opdivo's performance and future growth outlook based on the positive momentum for our current launches, our future potential launches, including muscle invasive bladder cancer and first-line esophageal, as well as potential expansion opportunities from clinical trials that we'll read out over time. 
Now turning to Slide 11 regarding our in-line multiple myeloma portfolio. 
Revlimid was up globally, primarily driven by demand for triplet-based therapies and increasing treatment duration. In the U.S., we are encouraged to see prescriptions nearing pre-COVID levels. PhRMA's global sales were up 15%, driven by continued strong demand for triple-based therapies and use in earlier lines. 
Now moving to our recent launches on Slide 12. 
We continue to be very pleased with our new launches. 
Beginning with Reblozyl, which generated $128 million in Q2 and increased 14% sequentially. As the bolus from the MBS launches continue to wind down, it's being replaced by underlying demand growth as expected. We continue to expect sustained growth in the second half of the year as we remain focused on treating new patients earlier in their treatment journey and ensuring they receive the most appropriate dose for sustained benefit. 
Moving to S, which generated $28 million in the quarter. The MS launch continues to progress well, where symposia is the S1P of choice in terms of written prescriptions and where we continue to see high intent to prescribe metrics. We have also seen an acceleration in the conversion time from written prescriptions to commercially supplied product. Looking forward, we see -- we continue to focus on establishing symposium not only as the S1P of choice, but also the oral treatment of choice for MS. Beyond MS, we launched symposia in ulcerative colitis in the U.S. in early June. While early in the launch, we are very encouraged by physician receptivity to the product so far. Our plan is to focus on step-wise process of building volume by establishing demand for this differentiated oral like biologic-like medicine while maximizing access over time. 
Turning to Onureg. The launch is also going well, with double-digit demand growth over prior quarter. We continue to expand the user base with physicians recognizing Onureg as the first and only FDA-approved treatment for AML patients in first remission with a demonstrated OS benefit. Second quarter sales were impacted by reduced inventory, driven by our transition from bottles to blister cards. However, based upon the strength of the underlying demand trends, we expect to see sales rebound in the second half of the year. Remember that this is a new treatment segment where it will take time to shape and establish Onureg as a maintenance treatment. 
Looking at each of these products internationally, we are encouraged to see how these launches are going, and we look forward to driving growth to gaining access and reimbursement in additional markets over time. 
Now I'd like to turn to Slide 13 and discuss cell therapy. Demand for our 2 new differentiated cell therapy products has been strong. 
Starting with Breyanzi. We were pleased with our launch progress with Q2 sales of $17 million driven by strong execution and rapid site activation with more than 65 sites activated to date. Messages around our differentiated profile and outpatient utilization are resonating well, with high awareness among CAR-T treaters. 
Next, as it relates to Abecma, our first-in-class BCMA CAR T had sales of $24 million in the quarter, led by very strong demand. We were able to leverage the site footprint of Breyanzi to -- based on the significant unmet demand and differentiated profile, we have seen robust demand for this product beyond our current capacity, and we are looking hard to increase capacity over time. Looking forward, we continue to see meaningful long-term potential with our cell therapy franchise across both Breyanzi and Abecma as evidenced by the recent demand we've seen. 
Now turning to the next slide, a few points as we think about our launch portfolio overall. 
First, we are very encouraged with how each of these products are progressing at this point in the launch cycle. Together, they have already contributed $225 million this quarter and are approaching $1 billion run rate. Importantly, we review these products as having significant future potential. This gives us great confidence in our ability to diversify and renew our portfolio as we look forward. 
Now let me take you through a few line items on our P&L on Slide 15. Since we've already covered strong sales for the quarter, I'll focus on a couple of other key line items. 
First, gross margin decreased versus prior year, which is primarily due to foreign exchange and product mix. Operating expenses were higher than last year, particularly in MS&A due to higher launch and prelaunch investments across therapeutic areas as well as foreign exchange, which were partially offset by our realized synergies. Remember that at the same time period last year, our spend levels were lower than normal due to the initial wave of COVID. Effective tax rate was 16.9%, primarily driven by our earnings mix. And overall non-GAAP EPS increased significantly year-over-year, primarily driven by our strong top line performance. 
Now switching gears to the balance sheet and our capital allocation on Slide 16. 
Our liquidity position remains strong, with over $13 billion in cash and marketable securities and strong cash flow from operations of $3.1 billion in the quarter. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. During the quarter, we continued to strengthen the balance sheet while renewing and diversifying our portfolio through business development. 
As Giovanni mentioned, we executed 2 deals during the quarter that both complement, diversify our oncology portfolio, with the Genus and Eisei. 
As it relates to continued debt reduction, a $4 billion tender offer and additional $1.5 billion in maturities in the first half of the year demonstrate our commitment to strong investment-grade rating. 
As it relates to our share repurchases of the planned buyback of $3 billion to $4 billion this year, we have already bought back $3 billion to date, and we'll remain opportunistic as the year progresses. 
Now turning to our 2021 guidance on Slide 17. 
Following this quarter's performance, we are reaffirming our top and bottom line non-GAAP guidance for the year, which reflects significant growth over last year. From a full year revenue perspective, we continue to expect growth in the high single digits. In terms of phasing for the remainder of the year due to Eliquis' coverage gap and on unwinding of Opdivo inventory that I noted earlier, we expect Q3 global revenues to be similar to Q2. However, we are encouraged by the strength in the business and expect full year sales at the higher end of our guidance. We have updated our gross margin assumption to 80% for the full year, primarily due to product mix and the impact of foreign exchange. 
Moving to operating expenses. We are maintaining our full year guidance on MS&A of low single-digit increase and on R&D of mid-single-digit increase. In terms of phasing for OpEx, we expect it to increase quarter-over-quarter at a similar pace to the first half of the year. Based on that and the strength of the business, we are reaffirming non-GAAP diluted EPS of $7.35 [Audio Gap]"

We have seen a recovery in the I-O market really coming out of Q1 and into Q2. And I would say that is a recovery on multiple parameters. First, we've seen new patient claims. While they still lag pre-COVID levels, they've certainly improved quarter-over-quarter. I-O demand continues to recover versus the pre-COVID levels, and in fact, grew about 5% quarter-over-quarter. And importantly, we've seen an increase in in-person engagement. Oncology still lacks other therapeutic areas. But increasingly, our field teams are able to engage live with our customers. And that's going to be really important given the competitive nature of a number of these markets, like first-line lung cancer. So I would say, in general, COVID continues to be dynamic really across markets. And certainly, that's true in oncology. But I would say there's been a general improvement as we exited Q1 and into Q2. 
As for how things are going in gastric cancer, I would say the gastric launch continues to go really very well. As you know, we have multiple indications now in gastric cancer. And I would say that, in general, the first-line metastatic launch is going quite well. Our share is roughly 35%. That's being led really by the gastric segment, that we see really good utilization of Opdivo plus chemo in both GEJ and EAC as well. And we're seeing use across all CPS levels. As you would expect, the majority is in the greater than 10%, but we are seeing strong uptake in less than 10% as well. And I would say execution has been very good. And in fact, we have the #1 share of voice and we continue to build new trials, which is important at this stage in the launch. So overall, very happy with the performance in gastric."

And I guess [Audio Gap]. And the reason for that is, if you look at it from an efficacy perspective, the measures were at a different time point, first of all, 10 weeks versus a 30-week trial for Explorer. Secondly, the differences or the primary endpoints that were measured were at rest and with Valsalva miner in the Redwood trial versus doing exercise. So if you were to compare those apples-to-apples, there is no differentiation that we see. 
From a safety perspective as well, when we talk about decreasing the ejection fraction, if you start with a higher ejection fraction, of course, you will not see as big of a decrease below 50% on which was the case in the REDWOOD trial, we had patients enrolled in our EXPLORER study with a lower ejection fraction of 55% or lower. And therefore, when we compare apples to apples again, in fact, if anything, we could turn out to be better. At the end of it all, I would say we need to wait to see the data in the Phase III trial for the competitor molecule. We already have our Phase III data. We've already submitted and look forward to bringing it to patients, with a PDUFA date in January."

The commercial and medical launches for both products continues to be very strong. We've seen good execution across the teams. Importantly, for both Abecma and Breyanzi, the profiles for these products are resonating well with customers in the case of Abecma as a first-in-class BCMA targeted cell therapy, and for Breyanzi as a best-in-class. One of the things we've seen across both products is there's significant unmet need. That's particularly true in the case of Abecma just given the fact that there are no other opportunities in many cases for these patients. And as a result, we've seen very strong demand for both products. What I would say is for Breyanzi, the focus continues to be on ensuring that sites know how to manage these patients well, continuing to sell the best-in-class profile that we have with Breyanzi. And we're increasingly seeing interest in patients being referred to clinical trial sites, so we're managing that well with Breyanzi. For Abecma, I would say the focus there continues to be engaging with customers around manufacturing capacity. As we had said previously, this is a space where, because of the significant unmet need and because we are the first BCMA target cell therapy in the space, the demand for this product has outstripped our current capacity to manufacture. What I would say is the sole focus that we have there is instead of increasing manufacturing capacity. We have a very strong team that's in place focused on this. We're engaging obviously, internally and externally with third parties, including regulators to increase the number of slots that we have available for patients, and that's going to be the main focus on that product for the coming months."

At the same time, we continue to see a shortage of vector. That, that is something that's been affecting multiple cell therapy products, and so we're keeping an eye on that. And what I would say, Terence, is that the situation on vector supply continues to be fairly dynamic. And so with respect to when supply will ramp significantly, I would say that rather than put out a date that would likely shift, I'll just say that this continues to be a top priority for us. Our sole focus continues to be on increasing the supply to meet the near-term anticipated commercial demand.

To your second question, on the recent approval on Alzheimer's disease and then how to see that data and what to do with that. We do believe, as Giovanni said, that our focus on neurology and neurodegenerative disease has continued to be there, and we'll continue actually to increase from there onwards. The way we look at that data is now that the threshold has been set from a regulatory perspective, it was hard to gauge before what endpoints to really shoot for and what was the threshold. Now that we know what the threshold is, it is now probably going to be better or easier to develop studies because there is a regulatory path forward.

And we have a very strong pipeline, as you very well mentioned. 
There are 3 pillars to the multiple myeloma strategy. #1, the cell mods and we intend to use these cell mods as the future backbones replacing the image that are currently out there. In that regard, the strategy is 2-pronged. One is a single agent entering in the late line of therapy. The first data that we've seen with Iberdomide already. And then next year, we'll see the data for CC-480, the second CELMoD, which is more potent. And then progressing them further up the line in terms of combinations, you might see on clintrials.gov, we've already announced and are initiating a trial in patients who have received 2 to 3 prior lines of therapy as a combination of iberdomide with daratumumab and dexamethasone compared to Velcade, daratumumab, dexametasone. And that strategy will continue as we go further up the line with the CELMoDs. 
The second pillar is the BCMA-targeted therapies. First of which is already approved, that is Abecma. And the idea for Abecma to again move further up the line for eligible patients who can receive cell therapies. Karma 3 is currently enrolling, looking at patients who have received 3 prior lines of therapy. And then intention would be to go further up the line again for the right patient population. 
Now not all patients can get cell therapy because of comorbidities or other reasons. And therefore, other BCMA-directed therapies are going to be important. And that's where the T cell engagers and the ADC come into play. But they are very early in development right now in Phase I studies, and so more to follow on that. Our prioritization, our belief remains very strong that patients with multiple myeloma still are not cured, and we will require combination therapies in the future with multiple targets and multiple modalities and will progress accordingly."

So with respect to COVID, I would say it's very similar to the answer I gave previously on COVID. I think the dynamics in that market are still evolving. We've not yet seen a full return to normal. But what I would say is in the quarter, we also there saw an improvement, both with respect to new patients entering the clinic and being given access to therapy as well as, importantly, again, our field team's ability to interact with customers. And that's going to be really important here because you've got to continue to push on an urgency to treat these patients. Many of whom have been treated for a considerable time on ESAs. So those dynamics, we think, are very favorable and bode well for continued growth opportunities for us as we go into the second half of the year. 
And with respect to the ex U.S. launches, say it's still very early days. But what we've seen is very good customer reception in early launch markets like Germany. The execution in those markets have been good. As COVID continues to improve there and we're able to engage with customers more, we see those dynamics continuing to improve over the course of the year. And then we have, of course, additional launches as access is secured, most notably with Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Italy in the coming months."

As you know, there's a Phase II study that is also ongoing, doing a head-to-head comparison of Revlimid versus iberdomide in Europe through E&M.

I hope you're all staying safe and healthy.  
Now turning to Slide 4. Let me start by saying I am very proud of our second quarter results and express my gratitude to our teams across the globe for their dedication and steadfast commitment to our patients. Through their work, we are continuing to make great progress to diversify and renew our portfolio and position Bristol-Myers Squibb for an even stronger future.  
During the second quarter, we delivered excellent results across the board, including strong sales growth due to solid commercial performance, positive clinical results in our mid- and late-stage pipeline, continued BD execution and strengthened our financial position. The strength of our commercial execution this quarter was underscored by the performance of our key medicines, including the return of Opdivo to growth and the uptake of our new launch portfolio. Over the last 18 months, we launched 5 new medicines with significant potential, and we are very encouraged by their performance to date. Clinically, we continue to deliver on the potential of our pipeline with significant mid- and late-stage clinical readouts and important regulatory actions across our therapeutic areas. The recent additions to our portfolio added diversification to our business and an opportunity to generate sustained growth over time.  
From a financial perspective, we saw double-digit growth for both the top and bottom line, and we are reaffirming our full year revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and generate significant cash flow, allowing us to advance our disciplined capital allocation strategy. We remain focused on external business development opportunities to further strengthen our pipeline over the long term.  
This quarter, we executed 2 licensing deals, an anti-TIGIT bispecific antibody program with Agenus; and MORAb-202, a folate receptor alpha ADC with Eisai, both strategically aligned with our oncology franchise. Overall, I am extremely pleased with our progress in the quarter.  
Turning now to our execution scorecard on Slide 5. We have made tremendous progress year-to-date across our therapeutic areas. In oncology, we are strengthening our IO franchise and have returned Opdivo to growth through multiple clinical successes and excellent commercial execution. Earlier this year, we launched Opdivo in 3 additional indications, including first-line gastric cancer, where we are the first and only I-O agent. We anticipate additional launch opportunities and growth drivers for Opdivo to further accelerate the growth of the brand.  
We also see opportunities to expand our I-O portfolio through the fixed-dose combination of our LAG-3 inhibitor relatlimab with Opdivo. At ASCO last month, we announced impressive results for relatlimab, potentially the third I-O therapy for BMS, building on our leadership in the field and expanding the durability of our franchise. We have a broad development program underway in I-O to benefit more patients over time.  
Moving to hematology. We received approval in the U.S. for 2 cell therapies, Breyanzi and Abecma, and demand for these products has been strong. Physicians recognize the value of these treatments, and there is significant patient need. 
Building on existing indications for Breyanzi, we announced the first ever positive Phase III top line data in second-line transplant-eligible large B-cell lymphoma last month. This is an important result. For the first time, we have shown that our cell therapy treatment is superior to a well-established standard of care. The positive results demonstrate that we can benefit patients early in their treatment journey. We look forward to sharing more details on these results later this year.  
We also have iberdomide Phase II data in-house, which we are very pleased with and look forward to discussing with health authorities. The data are potentially the first step toward the establishment of a new backbone of treatment in multiple myeloma, offering a better option to benefit patients. We have made tremendous progress expanding our immunology franchise. Deucravacitinib, a first-in-class selective TYK2 inhibitor, has the potential to be the oral agent of choice. We expect to launch this potential new medicine in psoriasis in the second half of 2022. 
We have initiated our Phase III program in psoriatic arthritis, and we also look forward to Phase II data in ulcerative colitis later this year and in Crohn's disease and lupus in 2022 to further expand the potential of this molecule. We initiated our Phase III program for cendakimab in eosinophilic esophagitis, and last month, in the U.S., we launched Zeposia in ulcerative colitis.  
Finally, turning to CV. We are encouraged by the top line results we received this quarter for Milvexian, our Factor XIa inhibitor. We look forward to presenting the data at a medical meeting later in the year. Additionally, we are preparing to launch mavacamten for symptomatic obstructive HCM in the U.S. early next year. We are encouraged by the potential of these assets to strengthen the durability of our CV franchise.  
In closing, on Slide 6. Our steadfast progress gives me great confidence that we are well positioned for growth. We are rapidly advancing a new launch portfolio of first-in-class or best-in-class medicines across therapeutic areas. We remain focused on driving inline product performance; executing on our launches; advancing early, mid- and late-stage pipeline opportunities; and continuing to take a disciplined approach to capital allocation.  
Our strong clinical performance further derisks our launch portfolio. And as a result, our confidence in our ability to deliver the $20 billion to $25 billion in non-risk-adjusted revenue in 2029 continues to increase. Our continued strong financial performance and balance sheet enable us to diversify and strengthen our long-term prospects.  
As our sales force returns to the field and we welcome our remote teams back to the office, I'm excited by the opportunity to reconnect with our colleagues, stakeholders and patients. I believe we have the strongest pipeline and launch portfolio in BMS' history, and I am very excited about our future.  
With that, I'll turn it over to David to walk you through the financials. David?"

Let me start with our top line performance on Slide 8. I'm very pleased to discuss our strong double-digit growth this quarter, driven by increased demand for our key medicines across the",1812,"Thank you, Giovanni, and thank you all for joining our call today. Let me start with our top line performance on Slide 8. I'm very pleased to discuss our strong double-digit growth this quarter, driven by increased demand for our key medicines across the globe.  
Looking at the first half of the year, which normalizes for most of the COVID-related buying patterns we experienced last year, commercial performance was strong, up 9% year-over-year or 7% excluding currency. This robust performance demonstrates both the strong execution of our commercial teams as well as increased demand for our products.  
I'll now provide additional color on the performance of our key brands and new launches, starting with Eliquis on Slide 9. This was another strong quarter for Eliquis, with global sales up 29% versus last year. Second quarter growth benefited from a favorable year-over-year comparison as prior year included the unwinding of COVID-related buying patterns. When looking at the first half to normalize for this dynamic, sales remained strong, up 18%. 
In the U.S., we saw strong demand with total prescription growth of 14% versus prior year, driven by market share gains. We continue to expect strong new-to-brand share growth to further translate to overall total prescription growth. As a reminder, when we look toward the third and fourth quarters, we expect similar dynamics from the Medicare coverage gap we've seen in previous years. Internationally, we had very strong demand across all key geographies as we further gained share as the #1 OAC in multiple markets and we continue to see additional room to grow. Overall, we remain very pleased with the execution of Eliquis around the world and expect to continue to grow Eliquis share within a growing class.  
Now turning to Opdivo on Slide 10. Let me start by saying we're very pleased to deliver return to growth this quarter, up 16% versus last year. While COVID recovery dynamics as well as approximately $40 million in U.S. inventory build contributed to this quarter's growth, the brand's performance was largely driven by strong demand for both our core and our newly launched indications. In the U.S., sales were up 13% year-over-year as well as 14% sequentially, driven by launches in lung, RCC and our upper GI cancers, which are all going well. 
In lung, share is in the low double digits with positive momentum, and we are seeing use across all histologies. In RCC, our Opdivo + cabo launch continues to do well, with Opdivo now the leading PD-1 first-line renal across both available regimens. In upper GI, we saw a very strong start with Opdivo plus chemo in first-line gastric cancer with CheckMate-649, which reached 25% to 30% share in just a few months, based upon the strength of our data. The adjuvant esophageal launch, while still in early days, is off to a great start. Overall, we see upper GI as an important opportunity for Opdivo, based on the breadth of offered indications and the fact that Opdivo is the only PD therapy approved for HER2-negative gastric cancer. 
Outside the U.S., we had another strong quarter with sales up 13% excluding the impact of foreign currency versus last year. Growth was primarily driven by demand of our new launches in lung and renal cancer. Results also benefited from a favorable comparison due to COVID-related impact last year. All in all, we're very pleased with Opdivo's performance and future growth outlook based on positive momentum for our current launches, our future potential launches, including muscle-invasive bladder cancer and first-line esophageal as well as potential expansion opportunities from clinical trials that will read out over time.  
Now turning to Slide 11, regarding our inline multiple myeloma portfolio. Revlimid was up globally primarily driven by demand for triplet-based therapies and increasing treatment duration. In the U.S., we are encouraged to see prescriptions nearing pre-COVID levels. Pomalyst global sales were up 15%, driven by continued strong demand for triplet-based therapies and use in earlier lines.  
Now moving to our recent launches on Slide 12. We continue to be very pleased with our new launches. Beginning with Reblozyl, which generated $128 million in Q2 and increased 14% sequentially. As the bolus from the MDS launches continue to wind down, it's being replaced by underlying demand growth as expected. We continue to expect sustained growth in the second half of the year as we remain focused on treating new patients earlier in their treatment journey and ensuring they receive the most appropriate dose for sustained benefit.  
Moving to Zeposia, which generated $28 million in the quarter. The MS launch continues to progress well, where Zeposia is the S1P of choice in terms of written prescriptions and where we continue to see high-intent-to-prescribe metrics. We have also seen an acceleration in the conversion time from written prescriptions to commercially supplied product. Looking forward, we see -- we continue to focus on establishing Zeposia not only as the S1P of choice, but also the oral treatment of choice for MS. 
Beyond MS, we launched Zeposia in ulcerative colitis in the U.S. in early June. While early in the launch, we are very encouraged by physician receptivity to the product so far. Our plan is to focus on step-wise process of building volume by establishing demand for this differentiated oral biologic-like medicine while maximizing access over time.  
Turning to Onureg. The launch is also going well with double-digit demand growth over prior quarter. We continue to expand the user base with physicians recognizing Onureg as the first and only FDA-approved treatment for AML patients in first remission with a demonstrated OS benefit. Second quarter sales were impacted by reduced inventory, driven by our transition from bottles to blister cards. However, based upon the strength of the underlying demand trends, we expect to see sales rebound in the second half of the year. Remember that this is a new treatment segment where it will take time to shape and establish Onureg as a maintenance treatment. Looking at each of these products internationally, we are encouraged to see how these launches are going, and we look forward to driving growth through gaining access and reimbursement in additional markets over time.  
Now I'd like to turn to Slide 13 and discuss cell therapy. Demand for our 2 new differentiated cell therapy products has been strong. Starting with Breyanzi. We were pleased with our launch progress with Q2 sales of $17 million driven by strong execution and rapid site activation, with more than 65 sites activated to date. Messages around our differentiated profile and outpatient utilization are resonating well with high awareness among CAR-T treaters.  
Next, as it relates to Abecma, our first-in-class BCMA CAR-T, it had sales of $24 million in the quarter, led by very strong demand. We were able to leverage the site footprint of Breyanzi to accelerate site onboarding, an advantage of launching 2 CAR-T medicines simultaneously. Based on the significant unmet demand and differentiated profile, we have seen robust demand for this product beyond our current capacity, and we are looking hard to increase capacity over time. Looking forward, we continue to see meaningful long-term potential with our cell therapy franchise across both Breyanzi and Abecma as evidenced by the recent demand we've seen.  
Now turning to the next slide. A few points as we think about our launch portfolio overall. First, we are very encouraged with how each of these products are progressing at this point in the launch cycle. Together, they have already contributed $225 million this quarter and are approaching $1 billion run rate. Importantly, we review these products as having significant future potential. This gives us great confidence in our ability to diversify and renew our portfolio as we look forward.  
Now let me take you through a few line items on our P&L on Slide 15. Since we've already covered strong sales for the quarter, I'll focus on a couple of other key line items. First, gross margin decreased versus prior year, which is primarily due to foreign exchange and product mix. 
Operating expenses were higher than last year particularly in MS&A due to higher launch and prelaunch investments across therapeutic areas as well as foreign exchange, which were partially offset by our realized synergies. Remember that at the same time period last year, our spend levels were lower than normal due to the initial wave of COVID. Effective tax rate was 16.9%, primarily driven by our earnings mix. And overall non-GAAP EPS increased significantly year-over-year, primarily driven by our strong top line performance.  
Now switching gears to the balance sheet and our capital allocation on Slide 16. Our liquidity position remains strong with over $13 billion in cash and marketable securities and strong cash flow from operations of $3.1 billion in the quarter. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. 
During the quarter, we continued to strengthen the balance sheet while renewing and diversifying our portfolio through business development. As Giovanni mentioned, we executed 2 deals during the quarter that both complement and diversify our oncology portfolio with Agenus and Eisei.  
As it relates to continued debt reduction, a $4 billion tender offer and additional $1.5 billion in maturities in the first half of the year demonstrate our commitment to strong investment-grade rating. As it relates to our share repurchases, of the planned buyback of $3 billion to $4 billion this year, we have already bought back $3 billion to date, and we'll remain opportunistic as the year progresses.  
Now turning to our 2021 guidance on Slide 17. Following this quarter's performance, we are reaffirming our top and bottom line non-GAAP guidance for the year, which reflects significant growth over last year. From a full year revenue perspective, we continue to expect growth in the high single digits. 
In terms of phasing for the remainder of the year, due to Eliquis' coverage gap and an unwinding of Opdivo inventory that I noted earlier, we expect Q3 global revenues to be similar to Q2. However, we are encouraged by the strength in the business and expect full year sales at the higher end of our guidance. We have updated our gross margin assumption to 80% for the full year primarily due to product mix and the impact of foreign exchange.  
Moving to operating expenses. We are maintaining our full year guidance on MS&A of low single-digit increase and on R&D of mid-single-digit increase. In terms of phasing for OpEx, we expect it to increase quarter-over-quarter at a similar pace to the first half of the year. 
Based on that and the strength of the business, we are reaffirming non-GAAP diluted EPS of $7.35 to $7.55 for 2021. This quarter, we remain pleased not just with our performance but also with the considerable progress we've made in executing our launches and advancing our pipeline. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Tim and Giovanni for Q&A."

And then the second one on Opdivo was just a little bit more color on the rollout in gastric in terms of where we stand today in terms of penetration rates.

We have seen a recovery in the I-O market really coming out of Q1 and into Q2. And I would say that is a recovery on multiple parameters. First, we've seen new patient claims, while they still lag pre-COVID levels, they've certainly improved quarter-over-quarter. I-O demand continues to recover versus the pre-COVID levels and in fact, grew about 5% quarter-over-quarter. 
And importantly, we've seen an increase in in-person engagement. Oncology still lags other therapeutic areas, but increasingly, our field teams are able to engage live with our customers. And that's going to be really important given the competitive nature of a number of these markets like first-line lung cancer. So I would say, in general, COVID continues to be dynamic really across markets, and certainly, that's true in oncology. But I would say there's been a general improvement as we exited Q1 and into Q2. 
As for how things are going in gastric cancer, I would say the gastric launch continues to go really very well. As you know, we have multiple indications now in gastric cancer. And I would say that in general, the first-line metastatic launch is going quite well. Our share is roughly 35%. That's being led really by the gastric segment that we see really good utilization of Opdivo plus chemo in both GEJ and EAC as well. 
And we're seeing use across all CPS levels. As you would expect, the majority is in the greater than 10%, but we are seeing strong uptake in less than 10% as well. And I would say execution has been very good, and in fact, we have the #1 share of voice. And we continue to build new trials, which is important at this stage in the launch. So overall, very happy with the performance in gastric."

And I guess the question is emerging from the REDWOOD data that we recently shared through a press release. And while it's truly an apples-to-oranges comparison, if we were to indulge in that, I would say that we don't see a differentiation as might have been perceived. 
And the reason for that is, if you look at it from an efficacy perspective, the measures were at a different time point, first of all, 10 weeks versus a 30-week trial for EXPLORER. Secondly, the differences -- or the primary endpoints that were measured were at rest and with Valsalva maneuver in the REDWOOD trial versus doing exercise. So if you were to compare those apples to apples, there is no differentiation that we see. 
From a safety perspective as well, when we talk about decreasing the ejection fraction, if you start with a higher ejection fraction, of course, you will not see as big of a decrease below 50%, which was the case in the REDWOOD trial. We had patients enrolled in our EXPLORER study with a lower ejection fraction of 55% or lower. And therefore, when we compare apples to apples again, in fact, if anything, we could turn out to be better. 
At the end of it all, I would say we need to wait to see the data in the Phase III trial for the competitor molecule. We already have our Phase III data. We've already submitted and look forward to bringing it to patients with a PDUFA date in January."

The commercial and medical launches for both products continues to be very strong. We've seen good execution across the teams. 
Importantly, for both Abecma and Breyanzi, the profiles for these products are resonating well with customers, in the case of Abecma as a first-in-class BCMA-targeted cell therapy and for Breyanzi as a best-in-class. One of the things we've seen across both products is there's significant unmet need. That's particularly true in the case of Abecma just given the fact that there are no other opportunities, in many cases, for these patients, and as a result, we've seen very strong demand for both products. 
What I would say for Breyanzi, the focus continues to be on ensuring that sites know how to manage these patients well, continuing to sell the best-in-class profile that we have with Breyanzi. And we're increasingly seeing interest in patients being referred to clinical trial sites. So we're managing that well with Breyanzi. 
For Abecma, I would say the focus there continues to be engaging with customers around manufacturing capacity. As we had said previously, this is a space where, because of the significant unmet need and because we are the first BCMA-targeted cell therapy in the space, the demand for this product has outstripped our current capacity to manufacture. What I would say is the sole focus that we have there is on steadily increasing manufacturing capacity. 
We have a very strong team that's in place focused on this. We're engaging obviously internally and externally with third parties, including regulators, to increase the number of slots that we have available for patients, and that's going to be the main focus on that product for the coming months."

At the same time, we continue to see a shortage of vector. That is something that's been affecting multiple cell therapy products, and so we're keeping an eye on that. And what I would say, Terence, is that the situation on vector supply continues to be fairly dynamic. 
And so with respect to when supply will ramp significantly, I would say that rather than put out a date that would likely shift, I'll just say that this continues to be a top priority for us. Our sole focus continues to be on increasing the supply to meet the near-term anticipated commercial demand. And then, obviously, we have a longer-term focus on ensuring more stable long-term supply for vector that would be available to support both of these products.

We are really excited to have a number of early programs that are continuing to advance that's primarily driven by a really interesting set of external partnerships. 
So let me ask Samit to give you more detail on both of those topics."

The trials are ongoing, as you've said, very well, and we are actually looking forward to see the data towards the end of the year as well as in early part of next year. That will certainly pave the way for new trials looking at combinations with our pipeline, with Opdivo as well as other molecules that you just heard from Giovanni. We have relatlimab and then new additions to our pipeline with TIGIT as well as with the ADC that we recently acquired. Those clinical development plans are being formulated, and appropriate indications are yet to be chosen based on the activity that we will see from these trials. 
To your second question on the recent approval on Alzheimer's disease and then how to see that data and what to do with that, we do believe, as Giovanni said, that our focus on neurology and neurodegenerative disease has continued to be there, and we'll continue actually to increase from there onwards. The way we look at that data is now that the threshold has been set from a regulatory perspective -- it was hard to gauge before what endpoints to really shoot for and what was the threshold. Now that we know what the threshold is, it is now probably going to be better or easier to develop studies because there is a regulatory path forward. As you recall, we recently had announced our collaboration with Prothena  and looking forward to make our way into the clinical studies with that TAU inhibitor with a differentiated mechanism that we'll be able to take forward. More to follow in the future."

Or is it a global market dynamic associated with the sort of use of nucleic acid targeted therapies? Just wanted to get a sense of what the impacts are there. 
And then what would the hope for expansion of capacity capabilities be in 2022 relative to 2021? And do you have any sense of timing improvement for the vectors as it relates to a Abecma? 
Second question, just wanted to get a little bit of a better sense of the ongoing strategy, the number of targets that you guys are pursuing. Specifically in multiple myeloma, you have a huge number of programs ongoing there. Just wanted to have you guys talk a little bit about prioritization in that regard and where you see the most opportunity for new products in that space, whether it be the CELMoDs or bispecific, the T cell engager.

One is the significant demand that we're seeing in the marketplace, which is, I would say, a function of the fact that there's significant unmet need, the profile of Abecma is very strong and the fact that you've seen a bolus of patients who have been really reserved for these therapies and this therapy in particular when it launched. So there's very strong demand, and so obviously, there's an internal focus on increasing our ability to supply that demand, which has exceeded the supply that we anticipated having to deliver into the marketplace. 
The second thing I would say is this broader global issue around vector supply. That's something we've been hearing from customers. That's impacting multiple cell therapy products. And obviously, as we think about our strategy, not only through the end of this year but really as we get into next year, our focus is going to be ensuring a more stable long-term supply of vector. And that's something we'll be happy to update on as we have more details to provide you. Samit?"

And we have a very strong pipeline, as you very well mentioned. There are 3 pillars to the multiple myeloma strategy: number one, the CELMoDs. And we intend to use these CELMoDs as the future backbones, replacing the IMiDs that are currently out there. 
In that regard, the strategy is 2-pronged. One is a single agent entering in the late line of therapy. The first data, we've seen with iberdomide already. And then next year, we'll see the data for CC-480, the second CELMoD which is more potent. 
And then progressing them further up the line in terms of combinations. You might see on clinicaltrials.gov we've already announced and are initiating a trial in patients who have received 2 to 3 prior lines of therapy as a combination of iberdomide with daratumumab and dexamethasone compared to VELCADE, daratumumab  and dexamethasone. And that strategy will continue as we go further up the line with the CELMoDs. 
The second pillar is the BCMA-targeted therapies, first of which is already approved, that is Abecma. And the idea for Abecma will be to, again, move further up the line for eligible patients who can receive cell therapies. KarMMA-3 is currently enrolling, looking at patients who have received 3 prior lines of therapy. And then intention would be to go further up the line, again, for the right patient population. 
Now not all patients can get cell therapy because of comorbidities or other reasons, and therefore, other BCMA-directed therapies are going to be important. And that's where the T cell engagers and the ADC come into play. But they are very early in development right now, in Phase I studies. And so more to follow on that. Our prioritization -- our belief remains very strong that patients with multiple myeloma still are not cured, and we will require combination therapies in the future with multiple targets and multiple modalities and we'll progress accordingly."

And that's going to be really important here because you've got to continue to push on an urgency to treat these patients, many of whom have been treated for a considerable time on ESAs. So those dynamics, we think, are very favorable and bode well for continued growth opportunities for us as we go into the second half of the year. 
And with respect to the ex-U.S. launches, I'd say it's still very early days, but what we've seen is very good customer reception in early launch markets like Germany. The execution in those markets have been good. As COVID continues to improve there and we're able to engage with customers more, we see those dynamics continuing to improve over the course of the year.

I'm pleased to report a very good third quarter with solid secular growth driven by strong commercial execution and good progress in our pipeline. I'm proud of the performance of our commercial teams who drove demand growth for our launch products and delivered solid performance of our in-line products, including Revlimid, OPDIVO and ELIQUIS. 
In R&D, we are progressing the most promising assets in our pipeline for sustained growth. In the quarter, we advanced our third I/O mechanism with a fixed dose of relatlimab plus nivo accepted for priority review in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. This is an important development for the IO franchise, and we have additional data readouts for Opdivo on the horizon. 
From a financial perspective, we reported sales of $11.6 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2 with growth of 10% and 23%, respectively. I'm encouraged by our results and how they position us for the rest of '21 and for the future. As a result, we are reaffirming our revenue guidance and raising the lower end of our non-GAAP EPS guidance. 
Our balance sheet is strong, and we continue to pursue a disciplined capital allocation strategy focused on investing in internal and external innovation opportunities. On the IP front, we are pleased with the decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, upholding the ELIQUIS IP and providing exclusivity until 2028 under existing settlements. This decision confirms our belief in the value of the science behind Eliquis and the underlying IP protecting its innovation. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with our progress in the quarter. 
Turning to our execution scorecard on Slide 5. At the start of the year, I laid out this scorecard with the milestones we thought would be important for us to deliver in order to successfully renew our portfolio. The team has worked hard, and I'm proud that we're making progress across the board. A number of accomplishments were included on the prior slide, so I won't go through all the details, but I want to call out a few highlights here. David will provide more details in his remarks. 
I'll start with deucravacitinib. Deucrava Has demonstrated a compelling and differentiated profile in 2 Phase III studies as the oral treatment of choice in psoriasis and is an important asset with significant potential across a number of indications, including psoriatic arthritis, where we have already initiated a Phase III program. Although we did not achieve proof-of-concept in a Phase II study for ulcerative colitis, we are committed to advancing our promising deucravacitinib clinical program in inflammatory bowel disease, including another study for ulcerative colitis as well as Crohn's disease in lupus and other immune-mediated diseases. 
We continue to make great progress in our cell therapy franchise, and we look forward to presenting the transform data for Breyanzi in second-line DLBCL at ASH. We're excited with the strength of this data, which have the potential to enable our cell therapy franchise to reach a broader set of patients. 
And we are also looking forward to presenting data from the first Phase II study for milvexian for VTE prevention in patients undergoing total knee replacement at the American Heart Association conference in a few weeks. 
Looking at the overall strength of execution so far, I am confident that we are back for what is required for us to renew our portfolio. 
Moving to Slide 6. It has been 2 years since we formed the new Bristol-Myers Squibb. As I reflect on this time, we have already made great progress. We are doing what we set out to do, delivering on the value drivers of the integration, and most importantly, establishing a strong foundation for our company's growth well into the future. 
Knowing that we face losses of exclusivity in the coming years, I recognize executing well on our multiple launches and continuing to advance our pipeline is particularly important for us. When I reflect on the last 2 years, I'm pleased on both fronts. We see strong demand for our newly launched products, and we are delivering on the promise of our pipeline, including a broadening data set for our launch products and continuing progress with our next generation of assets, such as milvexian and aberdomide. 
Our company today is more diversified than ever before with 4 durable franchises and the financial flexibility to continue to invest in innovation. As we recently announced, we will be hosting an investor event on November 16 in New York City to review our progress over the last 2 years and further discuss the company's strategy, pipeline and business opportunities. I look forward to the meeting, and I hope you will join us. 
In closing, we have made significant progress through this period, and I would like to thank our global teams who have maintained the focus on delivering for patients. 
With that, I'll turn it over to David to walk you through the financials. David?"

Starting with our top line performance on Slide 8.

Starting with our top line performance on Slide 8. We had yet another strong quarter with third quarter revenues growing double digits versus prior year, primarily due to demand -- increased demand for our in-line brands, but as well as our new product portfolio. So let me shed some light on some of our product performance, starting with Eliquis on Slide 9. 
Eliquis continues to perform very strong with global sales up 15% versus prior year. In the U.S., sales grew 18% versus prior year. Demand growth continues to be strong with total prescription growth of 14% versus last year, driven by OAC class market share gains and growth in new-to-brand volumes. Sequentially, as usual, sales were impacted by the expected coverage gap liability that occurs in the third and fourth quarters each year. We expect strong new-to-brand share growth to further translate to overall total prescription growth. Internationally, sales grew 12% versus prior year, primarily due to demand. Shares continue to increase across all key geographies and continues to rank as the #1 OAC in multiple markets with additional room to grow. We remain really pleased with Eliquis' execution around the world and expect to continue to grow Eliquis share within a growing class. 
Now moving to Opdivo's performance on Slide 10. We are pleased with the continued momentum for the brand, with sales growth of 7% versus prior year. In the U.S., sales grew 4% versus last year, primarily driven by uptake in first-line lung cancer and our multiple other new launches this year. And sequentially, we had demand growth of 5%, which was offset by a work down of $40 million in inventory build we noted in the second quarter. 
Our commercial teams continue to execute well. We've retained strong positions in core indications such as melanoma and renal and are very pleased with the performance of our newer indications. Outside the U.S., we had another strong quarter with sales up 11% versus last year. Growth was primarily driven by demand for indications and expanded access in Latin America, Turkey and Russia. We continue to see strong uptake from our new launches in lung and renal cancer in Germany and Japan with pricing and reimbursement discussions ongoing in other key markets. These launches, together with recent approvals of first-line gastric native esophageal cancer are expected to contribute to further growth internationally. 
Based on positive momentum from our current launches and future potential launches, including first-line esophageal in May of next year as well as expansion opportunities from clinical trials that will read out over the next few years, the promise for OPDIVO's continued growth is high. 
Turning to our in-line multiple myeloma portfolio on Slide 11. Revlimid was up 11% globally, primarily driven by demand for triple-based therapies and increasing treatment duration. POMALYST global sales were up 10%, driven by continued demand for triple-based therapies and use in earlier lines. 
Now moving to our new products on Slide 12. We continue to be very pleased with our new products, which generate sales of $344 million in the third quarter. This new diversified portfolio is already annualizing close to $1.5 billion run rate, giving us a identities that we are on our way to renewing our business with products that are much earlier in our life cycle. So let's start with Reblozyl, which generated strong sales of $160 million in the third quarter, up 67% versus prior year. Sales growth in the U.S. was primarily driven by continued demand in the ESA refractory MDS patients as well as a $20 million to $25 million inventory build. We are very encouraged by the recent NCCN guideline update that now recommends evaluating ESA response sooner at 6 to 8 weeks instead of the previously recommended 12 to 16 weeks. This supports the need to monitor and potentially treat new patients earlier in their treatment journey. 
Additionally, we remain focused on ensuring we receive the most appropriate dose for sustained benefit. Outside the U.S., uptake continues to be strong in countries where Reblozyl was launched. Sales were impacted by the usual price review 1 year after launch in Germany. We expect to launch in Italy and the Netherlands and Q4 pending reimbursement discussions and in more countries in 2022 to drive additional growth for the brand. 
Moving to our cell therapies of Abecma and Breyanzi. Demand for Abecma, our first-in-class BCMA CAR T remains robust. We generated $71 million in the third quarter versus $24 million in the second quarter. Remember that 2Q revenues consisted of only 1.5 months of sales having launched in mid-May, so performance this quarter reflects a full quarter of sales. Demand continues to exceed supply, and we expect Q4 revenues to be largely similar to Q3. 
Now moving to our CD19 CAR T Breyanzi. Sales in the quarter were $30 million versus $17 million in the prior quarter. Since due to patient demand with physicians recognize in Breyanzi best-in-class profile. We're extremely pleased to have clinically meaningful EFS data in second-line large B-cell lymphoma and look forward to presenting the data at ASH and bringing this treatment to earlier line patients in 2022. 
Turning to Zeposia. Global revenues were $40 million in the quarter, driven by multiple sclerosis launch and onetime inventory build in the U.S. The MS launch continues to progress well, where suppose remains the S1P of choice in terms of written prescriptions. We continue to focus on establishing symposia as not only the S1P of choice, but also the oral treatment of choice in MS. Our launch in UC is also progressing well in the U.S. We are encouraged by the initial uptake and growth in the number of new trialists since launch in June. Our focus is building on volume, establishing demand for this oral biologic like medicine, while broadening access over time. 
We are also very pleased to have just received CHMP positive opinion in Europe and look forward to making ZEPOSIA available to patients living with UC as soon as possible. 
Lastly, we're making progress on establishing Onureg in first-line maintenance in AML patients. Onureg generated sales of $21 million in the quarter, primarily driven by increased demand as well as inventory build versus third quarter. We continue to focus on shaping the new maintenance segment and increasing adoption and patient adherence. 
Now let's turn our attention over to P&L on Slide 13. We've already covered our strong sales for the quarter, so let me walk you through a few other non-GAAP key line items. Gross margin increased versus prior year, primarily due to lower royalty payments. Operating expenses were higher than last year, particularly in R&D due to COVID recovery, but also slightly in MS&A due to investments supporting our launch and prelaunch activities. MS&A versus prior quarter did experience some softness due to timing of investments that have shifted to the fourth quarter. Our effective tax rate of 14.9% was primarily driven by earnings mix. Overall, non-GAAP EPS increased 23% year-over-year. 
Now moving to our balance sheet and capital allocation on Slide 14. Our liquidity position remains strong with almost $16 billion in cash and marketable securities and a cash flow from operations of $5.3 billion in the quarter. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We have significant financial flexibility to support a balanced approach to capital allocation. Our priorities are to continue to renew and diversify our portfolio through business development, paying down our debt and returning capital to shareholders. We have executed several business development deals this year, bringing in differentiated early-stage assets. Business development remains a top priority as a leading innovation-based company. 
We have paid down $6 billion in debt year-to-date and are committed to maintaining our strong investment-grade rating. As it relates to returning capital to shareholders, we're committed to growing our dividend subject to Board approval, and remain opportunistic about share repurchases. We have already purchased $3.5 billion of shares to date, and we currently have approximately $3 billion remaining in our authorization program. 
Now turning to our guidance on Slide 15. Based on the strong performance in the quarter, we are reaffirming full year sales and raising the lower end of our non-GAAP EPS guidance. We continue to expect revenues to increase at the higher end of our guidance and gross margin to be approximately 80%. Moving to operating expenses. We are maintaining our MS&A and R&D guidance for the year. As I mentioned earlier, MS&A, we are expecting higher expenses in the fourth quarter due to timing of investments that shifted by a quarter. Additionally, we're updating our tax rate guidance to approximately 16.5%, primarily due to earnings mix. 
All in all, I'm pleased with our performance. We had another remarkable quarter for the company and continue to execute well against our plans and to diversify and renew our portfolio. This performance can not been achieved without the passion and dedication of our employees around the world, and I look forward to providing you future updates on our progress. 
With that, I'll now turn it back over to Tim and Giovanni for Q&A."

And you'll remember in the past, we've had a number of discussions about whether cell therapy treatments would have a fast uptake in the marketplace where this market would grow over time. There were concerns with payers' willingness to provide coverage for those therapies. 
And I must say, when I look at the experience that we've had with both Abecma and Breyanzi, it really confirms our belief that given the right treatments with the right efficacy and safety profile, there is tremendous willingness of physicians to prescribe and drive increased adoption in the marketplace. 
Many of the payer dynamics have been resolved. So beyond, obviously, the question that Chris will answer.

So are very pleased with the performance really of both Abecma and Breyanzi in the quarter. We saw a very nice increase in demand for both products. There was some bolus for Abecma still reflected in these numbers. But the underlying demand for that product looks very strong. The same is true with Breyanzi. We're very happy with the commercial execution for both of these products. We now have over 70 accounts that have been activated across both products. And the majority of those accounts have been or planned to imminently use 1 or both of the cell therapy products. So overall, I would say the commercial performance continues to be very good. 
As has been mentioned already, we're actively managing the supply constraints. Those mainly are impacting Abecma. And as David mentioned in his remarks, we do anticipate that Abecma the sales in the fourth quarter are going to be roughly similar to what we saw in the third quarter. And we're, of course, continuing to stay very focused on managing through the Abecma supply constraints and anticipated being in a much better position on that front as we get into the second half of next year. 
But again, stepping back, as Giovanni just mentioned, we are very happy with what we're seeing in the marketplace on cell therapy and it confirms the opportunity we have to build a strong position here. 
With respect to Opdivo, the performance for the quarter for IO was really in line with expectations. We saw very strong double-digit growth relative to the same time last year. And while sales were flat, as you know, from Q2 into Q3, that was, as David mentioned, a function of inventory dynamics coming out of the second quarter. What is important here is that we had very solid growth in the quarter. We had solid growth relative to same time last year and quarter-over-quarter. And that growth was in the key tumors that are going to drive near and medium-term growth for the IO franchise, notably in gastric cancer where we've seen a nice uptick since the approval in April. 
In renal cell cancer, we continue to see very strong demand. And we've seen coming at the end of the quarter some nice growth in first-line lung cancer. So overall, if you step back, we were very confident not only in the continued growth for Opdivo this year, but importantly, the momentum going into '22."

The second question really is as we think about the opportunity for ducravacitinib, I wanted to just get a better understanding of what Bristol believes is necessary to succeed in ulcerative colitis? It's our understanding that the IC90 may, in fact, be the most critical part of the development plan. And that perhaps ducravacitinib may not achieve that unless the dose is really pushed. And so just wondering if a long-acting formulation may be something that Bristol is pursuing? And then just a final question very quickly. Between your the MK2 inhibitor, the BTK inhibitor, the S1P1 that you have in Phase II. Would you call out any of these as having data in 2022 that we should be watching for?"

On the first 1 on ducrava, let me just first start by reiterating our confidence in the data which differentiates it and establishes it as a potential best oral therapy of choice in the future for patients with psoriasis. In terms of the files you very well know, we don't comment on when we file but we certainly do make it public when the file has been accepted, validated after we have filed for the indication. So we will certainly make you aware and everyone aware when we hear as time goes. 
But having said that, we do anticipate bringing the medicine to patients in the second half of 2022, as we have said before. On the question on ulcerative colitis. You are right in the sense that the dose required in ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease or IBD in general is going to be 2x to 3x higher than what we see for psoriasis, and we've seen that for other molecules as well. And that is the intent of the ongoing trials to test out these doses. We obviously have not shared exactly what doses are being pursued for confident reasons and competitive reasons. But we are looking at all avenues in terms of looking at the impact from not only PK but the PD outcomes as well. And we'll continue to follow those. And those will be the ways to define a proof of concept in this disease for pursuing further in ulcerative colitis. 
In terms of the MK2 S1P1 BTK additional data, those trials are ongoing. As you know, these are in the Phase IIa, Phase IIb settings where we have multiple indications being pursued in BTK in the same trial in the autoimmune space. S1P1 also additional work being done in Crohn's disease, for example, for Zeposia and for MK2 as well, data is evolving. I can't say that you'll see the data in '22 or not, but certainly, we'll make it available as soon as we have evolution of the clinical outcomes for these data."

Maybe first, there seems to be a lot of debate on the rate of Revlimid erosion in '22. And I know you're not giving guidance for next year, but just any color you can provide there, both international dynamics, and maybe specifically on the international side of the business? Is it reasonable to think about a business that's down like 50% for next year given the LOEs you're facing? Or are you thinking of something much better or worse than that just again 1 of these things that think we all have eroding over time, but just any color on the rate of erosion would be much appreciated? And then the second question is a bigger picture one. You've been steadily rebuilding the portfolio here, but you've had a stock that's underperformed this year. And I think The Street remains concerned on some of these longer-term LOEs. Does that at some point lead to, I guess, a more aggressive deployment of your capital, whether that's a step-up in BD, you look at larger -- maybe later-stage deals or even going to the direction with more aggressive share repo? I'm just trying to get a sense of when you look at what -- I think you would think of as a disconnect between what's fundamentally happened with your business and the stock price, like how do you kind of think about it starting to address that?"

So first of all, on Revlimid generic entries. Nothing has changed there. And let me just reiterate what we've said before. and what we see happening next year. So next year, we will begin to see a volume limited generic competition in the U.S. And at the same time, we expect to see generic entries for Revlimid ex-U.S. That's consistent with what has always been our understanding. It has not changed. It's been fairly clear in our filings, and we're preparing for that. 
The second thing that I would like to say is that if you remember, beginning at JPMorgan, we clearly articulated how we think about the company during the period of loss of exclusivity for Revlimid and POMALYST. And we expect to be able to grow the company. 
In fact, we've articulated low to mid-single digit for the total company and low double digits for our continuing business through 2025. And when we provided that perspective, we obviously were reflecting our understanding of the revlimid erosion. And I think the conviction that we have that we can continue to grow the company is really driven by the belief which is proving right that the combination of strong growth from our in-line products, and namely Opdivo and Eliquis, combined with the strong uptake of our launch brands, which is happening, would more than offset the loss of exclusivity of revlimid in international in next year and then over time in the U.S. So what I'm not going to give you exactly a percentage of erosion for next year. And we definitely will have an opportunity to talk more about this when we eventually provide guidance for the year. 
What I can tell you is that our belief remains strong. And I think that our perspective that we are able to grow sales and earnings per share applies to next year as well. And so nothing has really changed there. 
Now with respect to your second question that speaks to what are our priorities as we renew the portfolio in the face of LOEs. First of all, I think we have a rapidly evolving portfolio of new medicines that has tremendous potential, where we are executing multiple launches well. And I think our priority is always going to be first to maximize the opportunities that we have in a very, very rich late-stage pipeline. At the same time, we have tremendous financial flexibility, as David said. And obviously, we've seen -- we've said for some time now that this development is a priority for us as we think about allocating capital, and that continues to be the case. 
At the same time, as I've said before, we will be disciplined as we think about BD because we do have many opportunities to deploy our capital to accelerate growth. And I also believe that our capital allocation strategy will continue to be balanced where, as David mentioned, we have a history to look at our dividend, and we have increased our dividend consistently over the last several years. We've done that double digit in the last couple of years. And looking at share repurchases, year-to-date, we've repurchased $3.5 billion we have an existing authorization for another $3 billion this year. And obviously, we'll continue to look at that as well. But I can tell you that, of course, I understand the focus on LOEs. At the same time, as we believe that we are executing really well on a plan to renew our portfolio, and we have tremendous financial flexibility to continue to make the right moves to do that."

LAG-3, when can we expect that you'll have overall survival data in hand and melanoma for the package you've already submitted? And can you update us on what the development program looks like from here in terms of new trials and new tumor types? If I look at Roche with TIGIT, they pushed into lots of registrational trials, a lots of different tumors, kind of all at once. And I'm wondering why we're not seeing Bristol do the same here, is a signal that your confidence just isn't there yet in this molecule and that the survival data in melanoma is a gating factor? And then second question on mavacamten. Last quarter, I asked a question why you got only a standard review when it was awarded breakthrough therapy designation previously. I didn't quite understand your answer. But in 2019, it was pretty clear you expected the 2020 are -- 2021 approval and launch. So I'm going to reask it here, are you confident you have an approvable drug at the PDUFA date? Or is there a potential that they'll want additional data and you'll get a CRL?"

We have to remember, though, that in IO therapies, more important than those hazard ratios are going to be the shape of the curve, and we're going to continue to watch out for that. and we'll share that when that becomes available. I cannot tell you exactly what the timing would be at this time. 
From a development program perspective, yes, the first aligned melanoma study read out, we submitted it. We have a PDUFA date for March of 2022. We have initiated the adjuvant trial in melanoma at this time. We have a randomized Phase II study ongoing in non-small cell lung cancer and plans to initiate Phase III trials late this year or meaning at the end of this year or early next year. And we have a randomized trial ongoing in hepatocellular carcinoma as a proof-of-concept generation. 
LAG-3, as you know, has had a history for a long time where we didn't have any data. So 1 has to ensure that the proof-of-concepts that we are following are going to be strong. And we believe that the trials that we have ongoing will give us that data to go forward. For TIGIT, if you recall, there is a proof-of-concept in non-small cell lung cancer, and that is a different tumor type and different tau in terms of the human microenvironment. So we have to sort of judge the scientific data and put that in that perspective as we look for new tumor types to explore new tumor types are added in the LAG-3 program as well. 
For mavacamten, we are certainly comfortable with the data that we have from the EXPLORER trial from the efficacy perspective as well as safety perspective. We have a PDUFA date for January of next year. We have not heard from the FDA in terms of what additional data would be required. We certainly don't comment as to what the outcomes will be and how the ultimate decisions will be made by the agency, but we continue to engage with them. And as is usual for any filing, the back and forth in answering questions continues, but that is not unusual as we look at mavacamten or any of the drug."

Let me just start there, and then I'll ask Samit to comment on your question about PD-1 development. So let me just start by saying that it's really difficult to forecast at this point what price reform may look like in the future. From my perspective, what's important is that any change that is made actually improves affordability of medicines for patients. And that's the lens that we are applying. And from that perspective, there are a number of elements of potential reform like establishing out-of-pocket caps in Part D, redesign of the Part D benefit to reduce the exposure of patients that we support, and we also support some changes like introducing market forces in Part B. Very difficult to answer your question with respect to whether a disproportionate impact may happen in oncology or not. I think what's important is that we don't go to reforms that actually impact the ability of the industry overall to continue to invest in innovation. And that's the primary lens here. I think from the perspective of the BMS portfolio, when you look at our portfolio, it's actually very diversified across therapeutic areas, across actually Part B versus Part D. And so I can't speculate what the impact of any reform would be on us. 
I think what's really important is to continue to advocate for reforms that yes, improve affordability of medicines for patients, but at the same time, enable us to continue to invest in innovation. And some of the hyperpartisan scenarios being discussed in Washington would actually impact both negatively."

And just starting from where you left off in terms of the portfolio, we have a very broad portfolio, which means that when we conduct our clinical trials, we do them globally, including those in the Asian countries. And when we file the data, we have to provide subset analysis by region or sometimes even by country, and that's how we seek approval in some of the regions and countries of the world, including in Asia. As it comes to the PD-1 inhibitors, where we have conducted clinical trials globally and across the 20-odd indications or 12-plus tumor types that have now sought approvals, we don't see a major difference occurring because of regional differences or population differences. That doesn't mean that representation of larger populations may not be required in clinical trials. So 1 has to just keep that in mind rather than thinking about a singular country trial will lead to approvals or not."

Our focus on symposia in the EMS side continues to be not only establishing ourselves as the #1 SP, which we are right now in terms of written scripts but also becoming the #1 oral. And so our focus will continue to be in a very disciplined way, focused on that. 
And then let me just give the commercial perspective on the second-line CAR-T study, and then I'll turn it over to Samit. When you look at that second line setting generally, you generally see that population divert into those physicians who tend to be very focused on transplant. There's a sort of defined segment of those physicians. There are a number of physicians who are very open and look for opportunities to avoid transplant where possible. And then there are a number of physicians who really take it on a case-by-case basis. And so we're excited about the data that we've seen so far, and look forward to seeing that data continue to play out and be presented at ASH, and we'll adjust obviously accordingly from a commercial standpoint."

We have a couple of other assets in early developments, which are on [indiscernible], which we have ongoing studies looking at lupus as well. So we do believe that we've covered a broad range of targets and broad range of medicines being explored in lupus and 1 of those -- or several of those could be pursued for the future. 
From an 11a perspective, for milvexian, as we've said at AHA, you'll see the data. And there are 2 things to really take away. One, the intent of the study was to define a range of those that will be pursued for future evaluation in Phase III once the data from SSP study is also available. So that collective data set then leads to the decision-making for future exploration indications as we go forward. 
Second, we wanted to see a differentiation in terms of not only efficacy, but very importantly, from a safety and bleeding this perspective. And when we think about that, it is going to be important to pay attention to major bleeds and minor bleed and overall bleeds. So those are the kinds of things that you probably will see at AHA and then we can certainly have a discussion in the middle of next month when we have the presentations for the investors meeting."

Firstly, just going back to the generic erosion debate heading into 2022. Taking a different angle, obviously, post the acquisition of Celgene that was accretive to your overall operating margin. The question from a lot of us have followed. Celgene historically, along with Bristol has been the belief was Revlimid drove a lot of that margin for Celgene. And with that going away, even with new brands ramping up, is there enough from the portfolio and steady state growth of maybe Eliquis and Opdivo to offset an impact operationally from EBITDA? Or will there need to be bridging like you said, of additional cost efficiencies from the organization? So that's one, essentially getting to whether there could be a lost year or 2 of EBITDA growth from the existing portfolio? Secondly, a quick 1 for me. It's been brought up a lot why the team has not aggressively moved to start studies in more of a mild to moderate population for zeposia in ulcerative colitis?

And the other thing I would say is that we've been very disciplined from the standpoint of reallocating resources from those LOE brands to our launch brands which gives us further confidence in that. And the last thing is if you think about the portfolio and the launches, many of those products have strong margins, as you talked about on the in line with Opdivo being a high-margin product, but also some of the other ones that are in the launch portfolio like Zeposia as well as revlimid.

I'm pleased to report a very good third quarter with solid secular growth driven by strong commercial execution and good progress in our pipeline. I'm proud of the performance of our commercial teams who drove demand growth for our launch products and delivered solid performance of our inline products, including Revlimid, Opdivo and Eliquis.  
In R&D, we are progressing the most promising assets in our pipeline for sustained growth. In the quarter, we advanced our third I-O mechanism with a fixed dose of relatlimab plus nivo accepted for priority review in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. This is an important development for the I-O franchise, and we have additional data readouts for Opdivo on the horizon.  
From a financial perspective, we reported sales of $11.6 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2 with growth of 10% and 23%, respectively. I'm encouraged by our results and how they position us for the rest of '21 and for the future. As a result, we are reaffirming our revenue guidance and raising the lower end of our non-GAAP EPS guidance range.
Our balance sheet is strong, and we continue to pursue a disciplined capital allocation strategy focused on investing in internal and external innovation opportunities. 
On the IP front, we are pleased with the decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, upholding the Eliquis IP and providing exclusivity until 2028 under existing settlements. This decision confirms our belief in the value of the science behind Eliquis and the underlying IP protecting its innovation. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with our progress in the quarter.  
Turning to our execution scorecard on Slide 5. At the start of the year, I laid out this scorecard with the milestones we thought would be important for us to deliver in order to successfully renew our portfolio. The team has worked hard, and I'm proud that we're making progress across the board. A number of accomplishments were included on the prior slide, so I won't go through all the details, but I want to call out a few highlights here. David will provide more details in his remarks.
I'll start with deucravacitinib. Deucrava has demonstrated a compelling and differentiated profile in 2 Phase III studies as the oral treatment of choice in psoriasis and is an important asset with significant potential across a number of indications, including psoriatic arthritis, where we have already initiated a Phase III program. Although we did not achieve proof-of-concept in a Phase II study for ulcerative colitis, we are committed to advancing our promising deucravacitinib clinical program in inflammatory bowel disease, including another study for ulcerative colitis as well as Crohn's disease in lupus and other immune-mediated diseases, in lupus and other immune-mediated diseases.
We continue to make great progress in our cell therapy franchise, and we look forward to presenting the transform data for Breyanzi in second-line DLBCL at ASH. We're excited with the strength of this data, which have the potential to enable our cell therapy franchise to reach a broader set of patients. 
And we are also looking forward to presenting data from the first Phase II study for Milvexian for VTE prevention in patients undergoing total knee replacement at the American Heart Association conference in a few weeks.  
Looking at the overall strength of execution so far, I am confident that we are on track to deliver what is required for us to renew our portfolio.
Moving to Slide 6. It has been 2 years since we formed the new Bristol-Myers Squibb. As I reflect on this time, we have already made great progress. We are doing what we set out to do: Delivering on the value drivers of the integration, and most importantly, establishing a strong foundation for our company's growth well into the future.  
Knowing that we face losses of exclusivity in the coming years, I recognize executing well on our multiple launches and continuing to advance our pipeline is particularly important for us. When I reflect on the last 2 years, I'm pleased on both fronts. We see strong demand for our newly launched products, and we are delivering on the promise of our pipeline, including a broadening data set for our launch products and continuing progress with our next generation of assets, such as Milvexian and iberdomide. 
Our company today is more diversified than ever before with 4 durable franchises and the financial flexibility to continue to invest in innovation. As we recently announced, we will be hosting an investor event on November 16 in New York City to review our progress over the last 2 years and further discuss the company's strategy, pipeline and business opportunities. I look forward to the meeting, and I hope you will join us.
In closing, we have made significant progress through this period, and I would like to thank our global teams who have maintained the focus on delivering for patients.
With that, I'll turn it over to David to walk you through the financials. David?"

Demand growth continues to be strong with total prescription growth of 14% versus last year, driven by OAC products' market share gains and growth in new-to-brand volumes. Sequentially, as usual, sales were impacted by the expected coverage gap liability that occurs in the third and fourth quarters each year. We expect strong new-to-brand share growth to further translate to overall total prescription growth. Internationally, sales grew 12% versus prior year, primarily due to demand. Shares continue to increase across all key geographies and continues to rank as the #1 OAC in multiple markets with additional room to grow. We remain really pleased with Eliquis' execution around the world and expect to continue to grow Eliquis share within a growing class.  
Now moving to Opdivo's performance on Slide 10. We are pleased with the continued momentum for the brand, with sales growth of 7% versus prior year. In the U.S., sales grew 4% versus last year, primarily driven by uptake in first-line lung cancer and our multiple other new launches this year. And sequentially, we had demand growth of 5%, which was offset by a work down of $40 million in inventory build we noted in the second quarter.  
Our commercial teams continue to execute well. We've retained strong positions in core indications such as melanoma and renal and are very pleased with the performance of our newer indications. 
Outside the U.S., we had another strong quarter with sales up 11% versus last year. Growth was primarily driven by demand for new indications that expanded access in Latin America, Turkey and Russia. We continue to see strong uptake from our new launches in lung and renal cancer in Germany and Japan with pricing and reimbursement discussions ongoing in other key markets. These launches, together with recent approvals of first-line gastric and adjuvant esophageal cancer are expected to contribute to further growth internationally.
Based on positive momentum from our current launches and future potential launches, including first-line esophageal in May of next year as well as expansion opportunities from clinical trials that will read out over the next few years, the promise for Opdivo's continued growth is high.
Turning to our inline multiple myeloma portfolio on Slide 11. Revlimid was up 11% globally, primarily driven by demand for triple-based therapies and increasing treatment duration. Pomalyst global sales were up 10%, driven by continued demand for triple-based therapies and use in earlier lines.
Now moving to our new products on Slide 12. We continue to be very pleased with our new products, which generated sales of $344 million in the third quarter. This new diversified portfolio is already annualizing close to $1.5 billion run rate, giving us great confidence that we are on our way to renewing our business with products that are much earlier in their life cycle. 
So let's start with Reblozyl, which generated strong sales of $160 million in the third quarter, up 67% versus prior year. Sales growth in the U.S. was primarily driven by continued demand in the ESA refractory MDS patients as well as a $20 million to $25 million inventory build. We are very encouraged by the recent NCCN Guideline update that now recommends evaluating ESA response sooner at 6 to 8 weeks instead of the previously recommended 12 to 16 weeks. This supports need to monitor and potentially treat new patients earlier in their treatment journey. Additionally, we remain focused on ensuring we receive the most appropriate dose for sustained benefit. 
Outside the U.S., uptake continues to be strong in countries where Reblozyl was launched. Sales were impacted by the usual price review 1 year after launch in Germany. We expect to launch in Italy and the Netherlands and Q4 pending reimbursement discussions and in more countries in 2022 to drive additional growth for the brand.  
Moving to our cell therapies Abecma and Breyanzi. Demand for Abecma, our first-in-class BCMA CAR T remains robust. We generated $71 million in the third quarter versus $24 million in the second quarter. Remember that 2Q revenues consisted of only 1.5 months of sales having launched in mid-May, so performance this quarter reflects a full quarter of sales. Demand continues to exceed supply, and we expect Q4 revenues to be largely similar to Q3.
Now moving to our CD19 CAR T Breyanzi. Sales in the quarter were $30 million versus $17 million in the prior quarter. Sales increased due to patient demand with physicians recognizing Breyanzi's best-in-class profile. We're extremely pleased to have clinically meaningful EFS data in second-line large B-cell lymphoma and look forward to presenting the data at ASH and bringing this treatment to earlier line patients in 2022.
Turning to Zeposia. Global revenues were $40 million in the quarter, driven by multiple sclerosis launch and onetime inventory build in the U.S. The MS launch continues to progress well, where Zeposia remains the S1P of choice in terms of written prescriptions. We continue to focus on establishing Zeposia as not only the S1P of choice, but also the oral treatment of choice in MS. Our launch in UC is also progressing well in the U.S. We are encouraged by the initial uptake and growth in the number of new trialists since launch in June. Our focus is building on volume, establishing demand for this oral biologic like medicine, while broadening access over time.
We are also very pleased to have just received CHMP positive opinion in Europe and look forward to making Zeposia available to patients living with UC as soon as possible.
Lastly, we're making progress on establishing Onureg in first-line maintenance in AML patients. Onureg generated sales of $21 million in the quarter, primarily driven by increased demand as well as inventory build versus prior quarter. We continue to focus on shaping the new maintenance segment and increasing adoption and patient adherence.
Now let's turn our attention over to P&L on Slide 13. We've already covered our strong sales for the quarter, so let me walk you through a few other non-GAAP key line items. Gross margin increased versus prior year, primarily due to lower royalty payments. Operating expenses were higher than last year, particularly in R&D due to COVID recovery, but also slightly in MS&A due to investments supporting our launch and prelaunch activities. MS&A versus prior quarter did experience some softness due to timing of investments that have shifted to the fourth quarter. Our effective tax rate of 14.9% was primarily driven by earnings mix. Overall, non-GAAP EPS increased 23% year-over-year.  
Now moving to our balance sheet and capital allocation on Slide 14. Our liquidity position remains strong with almost $16 billion in cash and marketable securities and a strong cash flow from operations of $5.3 billion in the quarter. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We have significant financial flexibility to support a balanced approach to capital allocation. Our priorities are to continue to renew and diversify our portfolio through business development, paying down our debt and returning capital to shareholders. We have executed several business development deals this year, bringing in differentiated early-stage assets. Business development remains a top priority as a leading innovation-based company.
We have paid down $6 billion in debt year-to-date and are committed to maintaining our strong investment-grade rating. As it relates to returning capital to shareholders, we're committed to growing our dividend subject to Board approval, and remain opportunistic about share repurchases. We have already purchased $3.5 billion of shares to date, and we currently have approximately $3 billion remaining in our authorization program.  
Now turning to our guidance on Slide 15. Based on the strong performance in the quarter, we are reaffirming full year sales and raising the lower end of our non-GAAP EPS guidance. We continue to expect revenues to increase at the higher end of our guidance and gross margin to be approximately 80%. 
Moving to operating expenses. We are maintaining our MS&A and R&D guidance for the year. As I mentioned earlier, MS&A, we are expecting higher expenses in the fourth quarter due to timing of investments that shifted by a quarter. Additionally, we're updating our tax rate guidance to approximately 16.5%, primarily due to earnings mix. 
All in all, I'm pleased with our performance. We had another remarkable quarter for the company and continue to execute well against our plans and to diversify and renew our portfolio. This performance couldn't have been achieved without the passion and dedication of our employees around the world, and I look forward to providing you future updates on our progress.  
With that, I'll now turn it back over to Tim and Giovanni for Q&A."

Let me just start with a couple of comments, and then I'll ask Chris to answer both of your questions. I just wanted to step back and really think about cell therapy. And you'll remember, in the past, we've had a number of discussions about whether cell therapy treatments would have a fast uptake in the marketplace where this market would grow over time. There were concerns with payers' willingness to provide coverage for those therapies.
And I must say, when I look at the experience that we've had with both Abecma and Breyanzi, it really confirms our belief that given the right treatments with the right efficacy and safety profile, there is tremendous willingness of physicians to prescribe and drive increased adoption in the marketplace. Many of the payer dynamics have been resolved. So beyond, obviously, the question that Chris will answer, as we look at the medium and the long term and the commitment we've made to a broad cell therapy portfolio, I'm very reassured that the commercial potential of this modality is being recognized, I would say significantly more than in the past.

So are very pleased with the performance really of both Abecma and Breyanzi in the quarter. We saw a very nice increase in demand for both products. There was some bolus for Abecma still reflected in these numbers. But the underlying demand for that product looks very strong. The same is true with Breyanzi. We're very happy with the commercial execution for both of these products. We now have over 70 accounts that have been activated across both products. And the majority of those accounts have been or planned to imminently use 1 or both of the cell therapy products. So overall, I would say the commercial performance continues to be very good.  
As has been mentioned already, we're actively managing the supply constraints. Those mainly are impacting Abecma. And as David mentioned in his remarks, we do anticipate that Abecma sales in the fourth quarter are going to be roughly similar to what we saw in the third quarter. And we're, of course, continuing to stay very focused on managing through the vector supply constraints. And anticipated being in a much better position on that front as we get into the second half of next year. But again, stepping back, as Giovanni just mentioned, we are very happy with what we're seeing in the marketplace on cell therapy and it confirms the opportunity we have to build a strong position here.  
With respect to Opdivo, the performance for the quarter for I-O was really in line with expectations. We saw very strong double-digit growth relative to the same time last year. And while sales were flat, as you know, from Q2 into Q3, that was, as David mentioned, a function of inventory dynamics coming out of the second quarter. What is important here is that we had very solid growth in the quarter. We had solid growth relative to same time last year and quarter-over-quarter. And that growth was in the key tumors that are going to drive near and medium-term growth for the I-O franchise, notably in gastric cancer where we've seen a nice uptick since the approval in April. 
In renal cell cancer, we continue to see very strong demand. And we've seen coming at the end of the quarter some nice growth in first-line lung cancer. So overall, if you step back, we were very confident not only in the continued growth for Opdivo this year, but importantly, the momentum going into '22."

The second question really is as we think about the opportunity for deucravacitinib, I wanted to just get a better understanding of what Bristol believes is necessary to succeed in ulcerative colitis? It's our understanding that the IC90 may, in fact, be the most critical part of the development plan. And that perhaps deucravacitinib may not achieve that unless the dose is really pushed. And so just wondering if a long-acting formulation may be something that Bristol is pursuing? And then just a final question very quickly.

On the first one on deucrava, let me just first start by reiterating our confidence in the data which differentiates it and establishes it as a potential best oral therapy of choice in the future for patients with psoriasis. In terms of the filing, as you very well know, we don't comment on when we file but we certainly do make it public when the file has been accepted, validated after we have filed for the indication. So we will certainly make you aware and everyone aware when we hear as time goes. But having said that, we do anticipate bringing the medicine to patients in the second half of 2022, as we have said before. 
On the question on ulcerative colitis. You are right in the sense that the dose required in ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease or IBD in general, is going to be 2x to 3x higher than what we see for psoriasis, and we've seen that for other molecules as well. And that is the intent of the ongoing trials to test out these doses. We obviously have not shared exactly what doses are being pursued for confidential reasons and competitive reasons. But we are looking at all avenues in terms of looking at the impact from not only PK but the PD outcomes as well. And we'll continue to follow those. And those will be the ways to define a proof of concept in this disease for pursuing further in ulcerative colitis.  
In terms of the MK2, S1P1, BTK additional data, those trials are ongoing. As you know, these are in the Phase IIa, Phase IIb settings where we have multiple indications being pursued in BTK in the same trial in the autoimmune space. S1P1, also additional work being done in Crohn's disease, for example, for Zeposia. And for MK2 as well, data is evolving. I can't say that you'll see the data in '22 or not, but certainly, we'll make it available as soon as we have evolution of the clinical outcomes for these data."

Maybe first, there seems to be a lot of debate on the rate of Revlimid erosion in '22. And I know you're not giving guidance for next year, but just any color you can provide there, both U.S. and international dynamics? And maybe specifically on the international side of the business. Is it reasonable to think about a business that's down like 50% for next year given the LOEs you're facing? Or are you thinking of something much better or worse than that? Just to get what you think that -- I think all have eroding over time, but just any color on the rate of erosion would be much appreciated? 
And then the second question is a bigger picture one. You've been steadily rebuilding the portfolio here, but you've had a stock that's underperformed this year. And I think the street remains concerned on some of these longer-term LOEs. Does that at some point lead to, I guess, a more aggressive deployment of your capital, whether that's a step-up in BD, you look at larger -- maybe later-stage deals or even going to the direction with more aggressive share repo? I'm just trying to get a sense of when you look at what -- I think you would think of as a disconnect between what's fundamentally happened with your business and the stock price, like how do you kind of think about it starting to address that?"

So first of all, on Revlimid generic entries. Nothing has changed there. And let me just reiterate what we've said before and what we see happening next year. So next year, we will begin to see a volume limited generic competition in the U.S. And at the same time, we expect to see generic entries for Revlimid ex-U.S. That's consistent with what has always been our understanding. It has not changed. It's been fairly clear in our filings, and we're preparing for that.
The second thing that I would like to say is that if you remember, beginning at JPMorgan, we clearly articulated how we think about the company during the period of loss of exclusivity for Revlimid and Pomalyst. And we expect to be able to grow the company. In fact, we've articulated low to mid-single digit for the total company and low double digits for our continuing business through 2025. And when we provided that perspective, we obviously were reflecting our understanding of the Revlimid erosion. 
And I think the conviction that we have that we can continue to grow the company is really driven by the belief which is proving right that the combination of strong growth from our inline products, and namely Opdivo and Eliquis, combined with the strong uptake of our launch brands, which is happening, would more than offset the loss of exclusivity of revlimid in international in next year and then over time in the U.S. So what I'm not going to give you exactly a percentage of erosion for next year. And we definitely will have an opportunity to talk more about this when we eventually provide guidance for the year. What I can tell you is that our belief remains strong. And I think that our perspective that we are able to grow sales and earnings per share applies to next year as well. And so nothing has really changed there. 
Now with respect to your second question that speaks to what are our priorities as we renew the portfolio in the face of LOEs. First of all, I think we have a rapidly evolving portfolio of new medicines that has tremendous potential, where we are executing multiple launches well. And I think our priority is always going to be first to maximize the opportunities that we have in a very, very rich late-stage pipeline. At the same time, we have tremendous financial flexibility, as David said. And obviously, we've seen -- we've said for some time now that this development is a priority for us as we think about allocating capital, and that continues to be the case.  
At the same time, as I've said before, we will be disciplined as we think about BD because we do have many opportunities to deploy our capital to accelerate growth. And I also believe that our capital allocation strategy will continue to be balanced where, as David mentioned, we have a history to look at our dividend, and we have increased our dividend consistently over the last several years. We've done that double digit in the last couple of years. And looking at share repurchases, year-to-date, we've repurchased $3.5 billion. We have an existing authorization for another $3 billion this year. And obviously, we'll continue to look at that as well. 
But I can tell you that, of course, I understand the focus on LOEs at the same time, as we believe that we are executing really well on a plan to renew our portfolio, and we have tremendous financial flexibility to continue to make the right moves to do that."

I cannot tell you exactly what the timing would be at this time.
From a development program perspective, yes, the first aligned melanoma study read out, we submitted it. We have a PDUFA date for March of 2022. We have initiated the adjuvant trial in melanoma at this time. We have a randomized Phase II study ongoing in non-small cell lung cancer and plans to initiate Phase III trials late this year or meaning at the end of this year or early next year. And we have a randomized trial ongoing in hepatocellular carcinoma as a proof-of-concept generation. 
LAG-3, as you know, has had a history for a long time where we didn't have any data. So 1 has to ensure that the proof-of-concepts that we are following are going to be strong. And we believe that the trials that we have ongoing will give us that data to go forward. For TIGIT, if you recall, there is a proof-of-concept in non-small cell lung cancer, and that is a different tumor type and different milieu in terms of the tumor microenvironment. So we have to sort of judge the scientific data and put that in that perspective as we look for new tumor types to explore new tumor types are added in the LAG-3 program as well. 
For mavacamten, we are certainly comfortable with the data that we have from the EXPLORER trial from the efficacy perspective as well as safety perspective. We have a PDUFA date for January of next year. We have not heard from the FDA in terms of what additional data would be required. We certainly don't comment as to what the outcomes will be and how the ultimate decisions will be made by the agency, but we continue to engage with them. And as is usual for any filing, the back and forth in answering questions continues, but that is not unusual as we look at mavacamten or any of the drug."

And so we'll talk about the progress with the pipeline, some of them is stage programs, the commercial opportunities we see from the asset, and we'll talk about the outlook for the company.
Specifically, there will be an opportunity to focus on a few of those. So for example, as you know, the Milvexian data will be presented at AHA just before our meeting, and we look forward to discussing that update with you. 
We're also making progress in another area, which is hematology, and that includes the CELMoDs and the Breyanzi second-line data that were mentioned earlier.

And frankly, in spite of still relatively restricted access environment, the sales teams are having very good success in engaging with customers, both in person and remotely. So from an execution standpoint, it's early days but we feel very good about where we are. 
As you note, access is going to be -- continue to be something we pay a lot of attention to. We feel good about our ability to start generating volume this year and into the first part of next year, and we think that volume will build momentum as we get into the second half of 2022 when we begin to get additional more favorable access with key payers.

Let me just start there, and then I'll ask Samit to comment on your question about PD-1 development. So let me just start by saying that it's really difficult to forecast at this point what price reform may look like in the future. From my perspective, what's important is that any change that is made actually improves affordability of medicines for patients. And that's the lens that we are applying. And from that perspective, there are a number of elements of potential reform like establishing out-of-pocket caps in Part D, redesign of the Part D benefit to reduce the exposure of patients that we support, and we also support some changes like introducing market forces in Part B. 
Very difficult to answer your question with respect to whether a disproportionate impact may happen in oncology or not. I think what's important is that we don't go to reforms that actually impact the ability of the industry overall to continue to invest in innovation. And that's the primary lens here. I think from the perspective of the BMS portfolio, when you look at our portfolio, it's actually very diversified across therapeutic areas, across actually Part B versus Part D. And so I can't speculate what the impact of any reform would be on us. I think what's really important is to continue to advocate for reforms that yes, improve affordability of medicines for patients, but at the same time, enable us to continue to invest in innovation. And some of the hyperpartisan scenarios being discussed in Washington would actually impact both negatively."

And just starting from where you left off in terms of the portfolio, we have a very broad portfolio, which means that when we conduct our clinical trials, we do them globally, including those in the Asian countries. And when we file the data, we have to provide subset analysis by region or sometimes even by country, and that's how we seek approval in some of the regions and countries of the world, including in Asia. As it comes to the PD-1 inhibitors, where we have conducted clinical trials globally and across the 20-odd indications or 12-plus tumor types that have now sought approvals, we don't see a major difference occurring because of regional differences or population differences. That doesn't mean that representation of larger populations may not be required in clinical trials.

And then let me just give the commercial perspective on the second-line CAR T study, and then I'll turn it over to Samit. When you look at that second line setting generally, you generally see that population diverting to those physicians who tend to be very focused on transplant. There's a sort of defined segment of those physicians. There are a number of physicians who are very open and look for opportunities to avoid transplant where possible. And then there are a number of physicians who really take it on a case-by-case basis.

From an XIa perspective, for Milvexian, as we've said, at AHA, you'll see the data. And there are 2 things to really take away. One, the intent of the study was to define a range of dose that will be pursued for future evaluation in Phase III once the data from SSP study is also available. So that collective data set then leads to the decision-making for future exploration and indications as we go forward. 
Second, we wanted to see a differentiation in terms of not only efficacy, but very importantly, from a safety and bleeding risk perspective. And when we think about that, it is going to be important to pay attention to major bleeds and minor bleeds and overall bleeds.

Taking a different angle, obviously, post the acquisition of Celgene that was accretive to your overall operating margin, the question from a lot of us have followed. Celgene, historically, along with Bristol has been -- the belief was Revlimid drove a lot of that margin for Celgene. And with that going away, even with new brands ramping up, is there enough from the portfolio and steady state growth of maybe Eliquis and Opdivo to offset an impact operationally from EBITDA? Or will there need to be bridging like you said, of additional cost efficiencies from the organization?

And we feel very confident in our ability to maintain our operating margins in the low to mid-40% through 2025. And there's a couple of things driving that. One, as I discussed earlier, we're doing better on our synergies and strong execution against that as we head into next year and the run rate after that. I'd say the other is we've been very disciplined on the P&L side of things. And as you may note, from an MS&A perspective, we're very efficient and top tier in our industry. And the other thing I would say is that we've been very disciplined from the standpoint of reallocating resources from those LOE brands to our launch brands which gives us further confidence in that. 
And the last thing is if you think about the portfolio and the launches, many of those products have strong margins, as you talked about on the inline with Opdivo being a high-margin product, but also some of the other ones that are in the launch portfolio like Zeposia as well as Reblozyl. Those products have nice margins as well. So that's what gives us confidence in our ability to keep those operating margins in that low to mid-40s as we progress."

I'm pleased to report a very good third quarter with solid secular growth driven by strong commercial execution and good progress in our pipeline. I'm proud of the performance of our commercial teams who drove demand growth for our launch products and delivered solid performance of our inline products, including Revlimid, Opdivo and Eliquis.  
In R&D, we are progressing the most promising assets in our pipeline for sustained growth. In the quarter, we advanced our third I-O mechanism with a fixed dose of relatlimab plus nivo accepted for priority review in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. This is an important development for the I-O franchise, and we have additional data readouts for Opdivo on the horizon.  
From a financial perspective, we reported sales of $11.6 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2 with growth of 10% and 23%, respectively. I'm encouraged by our results and how they position us for the rest of '21 and for the future. As a result, we are reaffirming our revenue guidance and raising the lower end of our non-GAAP EPS guidance range.
Our balance sheet is strong, and we continue to pursue a disciplined capital allocation strategy focused on investing in internal and external innovation opportunities. 
On the IP front, we are pleased with the decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upholding the Eliquis IP and providing exclusivity until 2028 under existing settlements. This decision confirms our belief in the value of the science behind Eliquis and the underlying IP protecting its innovation. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with our progress in the quarter.  
Turning to our execution scorecard on Slide 5. At the start of the year, I laid out this scorecard with the milestones we thought would be important for us to deliver in order to successfully renew our portfolio. The team has worked hard, and I'm proud that we're making progress across the board. A number of accomplishments were included on the prior slide, so I won't go through all the details, but I want to call out a few highlights here. David will provide more details in his remarks.
I'll start with deucravacitinib. Deucrava has demonstrated a compelling and differentiated profile in 2 Phase III studies as the oral treatment of choice in psoriasis and is an important asset with significant potential across a number of indications, including psoriatic arthritis, where we have already initiated a Phase III program. Although we did not achieve proof-of-concept in a Phase II study for ulcerative colitis, we are committed to advancing our promising deucravacitinib clinical program in inflammatory bowel disease, including another study for ulcerative colitis as well as Crohn's disease in lupus and other immune-mediated diseases.
We continue to make great progress in our cell therapy franchise, and we look forward to presenting the transform data for Breyanzi in second-line DLBCL at ASH. We're excited with the strength of this data, which have the potential to enable our cell therapy franchise to reach a broader set of patients. 
And we are also looking forward to presenting data from the first Phase II study for Milvexian for VTE prevention in patients undergoing total knee replacement at the American Heart Association conference in a few weeks. Looking at the overall strength of execution so far, I am confident that we are on track to deliver what is required for us to renew our portfolio.
Moving to Slide 6. It has been 2 years since we formed the new Bristol-Myers Squibb. As I reflect on this time, we have already made great progress. We are doing what we set out to do: delivering on the value drivers of the integration, and most importantly, establishing a strong foundation for our company's growth well into the future.  
Knowing that we face losses of exclusivity in the coming years, I recognize executing well on our multiple launches and continuing to advance our pipeline is particularly important for us. When I reflect on the last 2 years, I'm pleased on both fronts. We see strong demand for our newly launched products, and we are delivering on the promise of our pipeline, including a broadening data set for our launch products and continuing progress with our next generation of assets, such as Milvexian and iberdomide. 
Our company today is more diversified than ever before with 4 durable franchises and the financial flexibility to continue to invest in innovation. As we recently announced, we will be hosting an investor event on November 16 in New York City to review our progress over the last 2 years and further discuss the company's strategy, pipeline and business opportunities. I look forward to the meeting, and I hope you will join us.
In closing, we have made significant progress through this period, and I would like to thank our global teams who have maintained the focus on delivering for patients.
With that, I'll turn it over to David to walk you through the financials. David?"

Starting with our top line performance on Slide 8.

Starting with our top line performance on Slide 8. We had yet another strong quarter with third quarter revenues growing double digits versus prior year, primarily due to demand -- increased demand for our inline brands, but as well as our new product portfolio. So let me shed some light on some of our product performance, starting with Eliquis on Slide 9.  
Eliquis continues to perform very strongly with global sales up 15% versus prior year. In the U.S., sales grew 18% versus prior year. Demand growth continues to be strong with total prescription growth of 14% versus last year, driven by OAC products' market share gains and growth in new-to-brand volumes. Sequentially, as usual, sales were impacted by the expected coverage gap liability that occurs in the third and fourth quarters each year. We expect strong new-to-brand share growth to further translate to overall total prescription growth. Internationally, sales grew 12% versus prior year, primarily due to demand. Shares continue to increase across all key geographies and continues to rank as the #1 OAC in multiple markets with additional room to grow. We remain really pleased with Eliquis' execution around the world and expect to continue to grow Eliquis' share within a growing class.  
Now moving to Opdivo's performance on Slide 10. We are pleased with the continued momentum for the brand, with sales growth of 7% versus prior year. In the U.S., sales grew 4% versus last year, primarily driven by uptake in first-line lung cancer and our multiple other new launches this year. And sequentially, we had demand growth of 5%, which was offset by a work down of $40 million in inventory build we noted in the second quarter.  
Our commercial teams continue to execute well. We've retained strong positions in core indications such as melanoma and renal and are very pleased with the performance of our newer indications. 
Outside the U.S., we had another strong quarter with sales up 11% versus last year. Growth was primarily driven by demand for new indications that expanded access in Latin America, Turkey and Russia. We continue to see strong uptake from our new launches in lung and renal cancer in Germany and Japan with pricing and reimbursement discussions ongoing in other key markets. These launches, together with recent approvals of first-line gastric and adjuvant esophageal cancer, are expected to contribute to further growth internationally.
Based on positive momentum from our current launches and future potential launches, including first-line esophageal in May of next year as well as expansion opportunities from clinical trials that will read out over the next few years, the promise for Opdivo's continued growth is high.
Turning to our inline multiple myeloma portfolio on Slide 11. Revlimid was up 11% globally, primarily driven by demand for triple-based therapies and increasing treatment duration. Pomalyst global sales were up 10%, driven by continued demand for triple-based therapies and use in earlier lines.
Now moving to our new products on Slide 12. We continue to be very pleased with our new products, which generated sales of $344 million in the third quarter. This new diversified portfolio is already annualizing close to $1.5 billion run rate, giving us great confidence that we are on our way to renewing our business with products that are much earlier in their life cycle. 
So let's start with Reblozyl, which generated strong sales of $160 million in the third quarter, up 67% versus prior year. Sales growth in the U.S. was primarily driven by continued demand in the ESA refractory MDS patients as well as a $20 million to $25 million inventory build. We are very encouraged by the recent NCCN Guideline update that now recommends evaluating ESA response sooner at 6 to 8 weeks instead of the previously recommended 12 to 16 weeks. This supports the need to monitor and potentially treat new patients earlier in their treatment journey. Additionally, we remain focused on ensuring we receive the most appropriate dose for sustained benefit. 
Outside the U.S., uptake continues to be strong in countries where Reblozyl was launched. Sales were impacted by the usual price review 1 year after launch in Germany. We expect to launch in Italy and the Netherlands in Q4 pending reimbursement discussions and in more countries in 2022 to drive additional growth for the brand.  
Moving to our cell therapies Abecma and Breyanzi. Demand for Abecma, our first-in-class BCMA CAR T remains robust. We generated $71 million in the third quarter versus $24 million in the second quarter. Remember that 2Q revenues consisted of only 1.5 months of sales having launched in mid-May, so performance this quarter reflects a full quarter of sales. Demand continues to exceed supply, and we expect Q4 revenues to be largely similar to Q3.
Now moving to our CD19 CAR T, Breyanzi. Sales in the quarter were $30 million versus $17 million in the prior quarter. Sales increased due to patient demand with physicians recognizing Breyanzi's best-in-class profile. We're extremely pleased to have clinically meaningful EFS data in second-line large B-cell lymphoma and look forward to presenting the data at ASH and bringing this treatment to earlier line patients in 2022.
Turning to Zeposia. Global revenues were $40 million in the quarter, driven by multiple sclerosis launch and onetime inventory build in the U.S. The MS launch continues to progress well, where Zeposia remains the S1P of choice in terms of written prescriptions. We continue to focus on establishing Zeposia as not only the S1P of choice, but also the oral treatment of choice in MS. Our launch in UC is also progressing well in the U.S. We are encouraged by the initial uptake and growth in the number of new trialists since launch in June. Our focus is building on volume, establishing demand for this oral biologic-like medicine, while broadening access over time.
We are also very pleased to have just received CHMP positive opinion in Europe and look forward to making Zeposia available to patients living with UC as soon as possible.
Lastly, we're making progress on establishing Onureg in first-line maintenance in AML patients. Onureg generated sales of $21 million in the quarter, primarily driven by increased demand as well as inventory build versus prior quarter. We continue to focus on shaping the new maintenance segment and increasing adoption and patient adherence.
Now let's turn our attention over to P&L on Slide 13. We've already covered our strong sales for the quarter, so let me walk you through a few other non-GAAP key line items. Gross margin increased versus prior year, primarily due to lower royalty payments. Operating expenses were higher than last year, particularly in R&D due to COVID recovery, but also slightly in MS&A due to investments supporting our launch and prelaunch activities. MS&A versus prior quarter did experience some softness due to timing of investments that have shifted to the fourth quarter. Our effective tax rate of 14.9% was primarily driven by earnings mix. Overall, non-GAAP EPS increased 23% year-over-year.  
Now moving to our balance sheet and capital allocation on Slide 14. Our liquidity position remains strong with almost $16 billion in cash and marketable securities and a strong cash flow from operations of $5.3 billion in the quarter. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We have significant financial flexibility to support a balanced approach to capital allocation. Our priorities are to continue to renew and diversify our portfolio through business development, paying down our debt and returning capital to shareholders. We have executed several business development deals this year, bringing in differentiated early-stage assets. Business development remains a top priority as a leading innovation-based company.
We have paid down $6 billion in debt year-to-date and are committed to maintaining our strong investment-grade rating. As it relates to returning capital to shareholders, we're committed to growing our dividend subject to Board approval, and remain opportunistic about share repurchases. We have already purchased $3.5 billion of shares to date, and we currently have approximately $3 billion remaining in our authorization program.  
Now turning to our guidance on Slide 15. Based on the strong performance in the quarter, we are reaffirming full year sales and raising the lower end of our non-GAAP EPS guidance. We continue to expect revenues to increase at the higher end of our guidance and gross margin to be approximately 80%. 
Moving to operating expenses. We are maintaining our MS&A and R&D guidance for the year. As I mentioned earlier, MS&A, we are expecting higher expenses in the fourth quarter due to timing of investments that shifted by a quarter. Additionally, we're updating our tax rate guidance to approximately 16.5%, primarily due to earnings mix. 
All in all, I'm pleased with our performance. We had another remarkable quarter for the company and continue to execute well against our plans and to diversify and renew our portfolio. This performance couldn't have been achieved without the passion and dedication of our employees around the world, and I look forward to providing you future updates on our progress.  
With that, I'll now turn it back over to Tim and Giovanni for Q&A."

Let me just start with a couple of comments, and then I'll ask Chris to answer both of your questions. I just wanted to step back and really think about cell therapy. And you'll remember, in the past, we've had a number of discussions about whether cell therapy treatments would have a fast uptake in the marketplace where this market would grow over time. There were concerns with payers' willingness to provide coverage for those therapies.
And I must say, when I look at the experience that we've had with both Abecma and Breyanzi, it really confirms our belief that given the right treatments with the right efficacy and safety profile, there is tremendous willingness of physicians to prescribe and drive increased adoption in the marketplace. Many of the payer dynamics have been resolved. So beyond, obviously, the question that Chris will answer, as we look at the medium and the long term and the commitment we've made to our broad cell therapy portfolio, I'm very reassured that the commercial potential of this modality is being recognized, I would say, significantly more than in the past.

So we are very pleased with the performance really of both Abecma and Breyanzi in the quarter. We saw a very nice increase in demand for both products. There was some bolus for Abecma still reflected in these numbers. But the underlying demand for that product looks very strong. The same is true with Breyanzi. We're very happy with the commercial execution for both of these products. We now have over 70 accounts that have been activated across both products. And the majority of those accounts have been or planned to imminently use one or both of the cell therapy products. So overall, I would say the commercial performance continues to be very good.  
As has been mentioned already, we're actively managing the supply constraints. Those mainly are impacting Abecma. And as David mentioned in his remarks, we do anticipate that Abecma sales in the fourth quarter are going to be roughly similar to what we saw in the third quarter. And we're, of course, continuing to stay very focused on managing through the vector supply constraints. And anticipate it being in a much better position on that front as we get into the second half of next year. But again, stepping back, as Giovanni just mentioned, we are very happy with what we're seeing in the marketplace on cell therapy and it confirms the opportunity we have to build a strong position here.  
With respect to Opdivo, the performance for the quarter for I-O was really in line with expectations. We saw very strong double-digit growth relative to the same time last year. And while sales were flat, as you know, from Q2 into Q3, that was, as David mentioned, a function of inventory dynamics coming out of the second quarter. What is important here is that we had very solid growth in the quarter. We had solid growth relative to same time last year and quarter-over-quarter. And that growth was in the key tumors that are going to drive near and medium-term growth for the I-O franchise, notably in gastric cancer where we've seen a nice uptick since the approval in April. 
In renal cell cancer, we continue to see very strong demand. And we've seen coming at the end of the quarter some nice growth in first-line lung cancer. So overall, if you step back, we were very confident not only in the continued growth for Opdivo this year, but importantly, the momentum going into '22."

And so just wondering if a long-acting formulation may be something that Bristol is pursuing. And then just a final question very quickly. Between your -- the MK2 inhibitor, the BTK inhibitor, the S1P1 that you have in Phase II. Would you call out any of these as having data in 2022 that we's should be watching for?"

On the first one on deucrava, let me just first start by reiterating our confidence in the data which differentiates it and establishes it as a potential best oral therapy of choice in the future for patients with psoriasis. In terms of the filing, as you very well know, we don't comment on when we file but we certainly do make it public when the file has been accepted, validated after we have filed for the indication. So we will certainly make you aware and everyone aware when we hear as time goes. But having said that, we do anticipate bringing the medicine to patients in the second half of 2022, as we have said before. 
On the question on ulcerative colitis. You are right in the sense that the dose required in ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease or IBD in general, is going to be 2x to 3x higher than what we see for psoriasis, and we've seen that for other molecules as well. And that is the intent of the ongoing trials to test out these doses. We obviously have not shared exactly what doses are being pursued for confidential reasons and competitive reasons. But we are looking at all avenues in terms of looking at the impact from not only PK but the PD outcomes as well. And we'll continue to follow those. And those will be the ways to define a proof of concept in this disease for pursuing further in ulcerative colitis.  
In terms of the MK2, S1P1, BTK additional data, those trials are ongoing. As you know, these are in the Phase IIa, Phase IIb settings where we have multiple indications being pursued in BTK in the same trial in the autoimmune space. S1P1 also, additional work being done in Crohn's disease, for example, for Zeposia. And for MK2 as well, data is evolving. I can't say that you'll see the data in '22 or not, but certainly, we'll make it available as soon as we have evolution of the clinical outcomes for these data."

Maybe first, there seems to be a lot of debate on the rate of Revlimid erosion in '22. And I know you're not giving guidance for next year, but just any color you can provide there, both U.S. and international dynamics? And maybe specifically on the international side of the business, is it reasonable to think about the business as down like 50% for next year given the LOEs you're facing? Or are you thinking of something much better or worse than that? Just to get what you think that -- I think all have eroding over time, but just any color on the rate of erosion would be much appreciated.
And then the second question is a bigger picture one. You've been steadily rebuilding the portfolio here, but you've had a stock that's underperformed this year. And I think the Street remains concerned on some of these longer-term LOEs. Does that at some point lead to, I guess, a more aggressive deployment of your capital, whether that's a step-up in BD, you look at larger -- maybe later-stage deals or even going the other direction with more aggressive share repo? I'm just trying to get a sense of when you look at what, I think, you would think of as a disconnect between what's fundamentally happened with your business and the stock price, like how do you kind of think about starting to address that?"

Let me take your questions here. Giovanni. So first of all, on Revlimid generic entries, nothing has changed there. And let me just reiterate what we've said before and what we see happening next year. So next year, we will begin to see",607,"Thank you, Chris. Let me take your questions here. Giovanni. So first of all, on Revlimid generic entries, nothing has changed there. And let me just reiterate what we've said before and what we see happening next year. So next year, we will begin to see a volume limited generic competition in the U.S. And at the same time, we expect to see generic entries for Revlimid ex-U.S. That's consistent with what has always been our understanding. It has not changed. It's been fairly clear in our filings, and we're preparing for that.
The second thing that I would like to say is that if you remember, beginning at JPMorgan, we clearly articulated how we think about the company during the period of loss of exclusivity for Revlimid and Pomalyst. And we expect to be able to grow the company. In fact, we've articulated low to mid-single digit for the total company and low double digits for our continuing business through 2025. And when we provided that perspective, we obviously were reflecting our understanding of the Revlimid erosion. 
And I think the conviction that we have that we can continue to grow the company is really driven by the belief which is proving right, that the combination of strong growth from our inline products, and namely Opdivo and Eliquis, combined with the strong uptake of our launch brands, which is happening, would more than offset the loss of exclusivity of Revlimid internationally next year and then over time in the U.S. So while I'm not going to give you exactly a percentage of erosion for next year. And we definitely will have an opportunity to talk more about this when we eventually provide guidance for the year. What I can tell you is that our belief remains strong. And I think that our perspective that we are able to grow sales and earnings per share applies to next year as well. And so nothing has really changed there. 
Now with respect to your second question that speaks to what are our priorities as we renew the portfolio in the face of LOEs. First of all, I think we have a rapidly evolving portfolio of new medicines that has tremendous potential, where we are executing multiple launches well. And I think our priority is always going to be, first, to maximize the opportunities that we have in a very, very rich late-stage pipeline. At the same time, we have tremendous financial flexibility, as David said. And obviously, we've seen -- we've said for some time now that business development is a priority for us as we think about allocating capital, and that continues to be the case.  
At the same time, as I've said before, we will be disciplined as we think about BD because we do have many opportunities to deploy our capital to accelerate growth. And I also believe that our capital allocation strategy will continue to be balanced where, as David mentioned, we have a history to look at our dividend, and we have increased our dividend consistently over the last several years. We've done that double digit in the last couple of years. And looking at share repurchases, year-to-date, we've repurchased $3.5 billion. We have an existing authorization for another $3 billion this year. And obviously, we'll continue to look at that as well. 
But I can tell you that, of course, I understand the focus on LOEs at the same time, as we believe that we are executing really well on a plan to renew our portfolio, and we have tremendous financial flexibility to continue to make the right moves to do that."

LAG-3, when can we expect that you'll have overall survival data on hand in melanoma for the package you've already submitted? And can you update us on what the development program looks like from here in terms of new trials and new tumor types? If I look at Roche with TIGIT, they pushed into lots of registrational trials, into lots of different tumors, kind of all at once. And I'm wondering why we're not seeing Bristol do the same here? Is it a signal that your confidence just isn't there yet in this molecule and that the survival data in melanoma is a gating factor? 
And then second question on mavacamten. Last quarter, I asked a question why you got only a standard review when it was awarded breakthrough therapy designation previously, I didn't quite understand your answer. But in 2019, it was pretty clear you expected a 2021 approval and launch. So I'm going to reask it here, are you confident you have an approvable drug at the PDUFA date? Or is there a potential that they'll want additional data and you'll get a CRL?"

We have to remember, though, that in I-O therapies, more important than those hazard ratios are going to be the shape of the curve, and we're going to continue to watch out for that. and we'll share that when that becomes available. I cannot tell you exactly what the timing would be at this time.
From a development program perspective, yes, the first aligned melanoma study read out, we submitted it. We have a PDUFA date for March of 2022. We have initiated the adjuvant trial in melanoma at this time. We have a randomized Phase II study ongoing in non-small cell lung cancer and plans to initiate Phase III trials late this year or meaning at the end of this year or early next year. And we have a randomized trial ongoing in hepatocellular carcinoma as a proof-of-concept generation. 
LAG-3, as you know, has had a history for a long time where we didn't have any data. So one has to ensure that the proof-of-concepts that we are following are going to be strong. And we believe that the trials that we have ongoing will give us that data to go forward. For TIGIT, if you recall, there is a proof-of-concept in non-small cell lung cancer, and that is a different tumor type and different milieu in terms of the tumor microenvironment. So we have to sort of judge the scientific data and put that in that perspective as we look for new tumor types to explore. And we'll certainly keep you posted as new tumor types are added in the LAG-3 program as well. 
For mavacamten, we are certainly comfortable with the data that we have from the EXPLORER trial from the efficacy perspective as well as safety perspective. We have a PDUFA date for January of next year. We have not heard from the FDA in terms of what additional data would be required. We certainly don't comment as to what the outcomes will be and how the ultimate decisions will be made by the agency, but we continue to engage with them. And as is usual for any filing, the back and forth in answering questions continues, but that is not unusual as we look at mavacamten or any of the drug."

Let me just start there, and then I'll ask Samit to comment on your question about PD-1 development. So let me just start by saying that it's really difficult to forecast at this point what price reform may look like in the future. From my perspective, what's important is that any change that is made actually improves affordability of medicines for patients. And that's the lens that we are applying. And from that perspective, there are a number of elements of potential reform like establishing out-of-pocket caps in Part D, redesign of the Part D's benefit to reduce the exposure of patients that we support, and we also support some changes like introducing market forces in Part B. 
Very difficult to answer your question with respect to whether a disproportionate impact may happen in oncology or not. I think what's important is that we don't go to reforms that actually impact the ability of the industry overall to continue to invest in innovation. And that's the primary lens here. 
I think from the perspective of the BMS portfolio, when you look at our portfolio, it's actually very diversified across therapeutic areas, across actually Part B versus Part D. And so I can't speculate what the impact of any reform would be on us. I think what's really important is to continue to advocate for reforms that yes, improve affordability of medicines for patients, but at the same time, enable us to continue to invest in innovation. And some of the hyperpartisan scenarios being discussed in Washington would actually impact both negatively."

And just starting from where you left off in terms of the portfolio, we have a very broad portfolio, which means that when we conduct our clinical trials, we do them globally, including those in the Asian countries. And when we file the data, we have to provide subset analysis by region or sometimes even by country, and that's how we seek approval in some of the regions and countries of the world, including in Asia. As it comes to the PD-1 inhibitors, where we have conducted clinical trials globally and across the 20-odd indications or 12-plus tumor types that have now sought approvals, we don't see a major difference occurring because of regional differences or population differences. That doesn't mean that representation of larger populations may not be required in clinical trials. So one has to just keep that in mind rather than thinking about a singular country trial will lead to approvals or not."

So just on Zeposia very quickly, we have -- we don't anticipate that any potential change on the Tecfidera side would have an impact on us. We've seen very limited competitive impact of generic Tecfidera that's prominently been cannibalization of branded Tec and then obviously a shift in the utilization within that portfolio. Our focus on Zeposia in the MS side continues to be not only establishing ourselves as the #1 SP, which we are right now in terms of written scripts, but also becoming the #1 oral. And so our focus will continue to be, in a very disciplined way, focused on that. 
And then let me just give the commercial perspective on the second-line CAR T study, and then I'll turn it over to Samit. When you look at that second line setting generally, you generally see that population diverting to those physicians who tend to be very focused on transplant. There's a sort of defined segment of those physicians. There are a number of physicians who are very open and look for opportunities to avoid transplant where possible. And then there are a number of physicians who really take it on a case-by-case basis. And so we're excited about the data that we've seen so far, and look forward to seeing that data continue to play out and be presented at ASH, and we'll adjust obviously accordingly from a commercial standpoint."

We'll obviously continue to follow patients for overall survival. And as is required for CAR T cell therapies, long-term safety follow-up as well. So those data will evolve and will be shared in the future. At the current time, the primary endpoint of the study was EFS, and we have that in hand, and that will be presented."

And starting with lupus, as you know, that we will, first of all, get the data for deucravacitinib in SLE at the beginning of next year. We have a discoid lupus study that is also ongoing, which will read out in '23 or later part of that. We have a couple of other assets in early developments, which are on ClinicalTrials.gov, which we have ongoing studies looking at lupus as well. So we do believe that we've covered a broad range of targets and broad range of medicines being explored in lupus and one of those -- or several of those could be pursued for the future. 
From an XIa perspective, for Milvexian, as we've said, at AHA, you'll see the data. And there are 2 things to really take away. One, the intent of the study was to define a range of dose that will be pursued for future evaluation in Phase III once the data from SSP study is also available. So that collective data set then leads to the decision-making for future exploration and indications as we go forward. 
Second, we wanted to see a differentiation in terms of not only efficacy, but very importantly, from a safety and bleeding risk perspective. And when we think about that, it is going to be important to pay attention to major bleeds and minor bleeds and overall bleeds. So those are the kinds of things that you probably will see at AHA and then we can certainly have a discussion in the middle of next month when we have the presentations for the investors meeting."

Firstly, just going back to the generic erosion debate heading into 2022. Taking a different angle, obviously, post the acquisition of Celgene that was accretive to your overall operating margin, the question from a lot of us have followed. Celgene, historically, along with Bristol has been -- the belief was Revlimid drove a lot of that margin for Celgene. And with that going away, even with new brands ramping up, is there enough from the portfolio and steady state growth of maybe Eliquis and Opdivo to offset an impact operationally from EBITDA? Or will there need to be bridging, like you said, of additional cost efficiencies from the organization? So that's one, essentially getting to whether there could be a lost year or 2 of EBITDA growth from the existing portfolio.
Secondly, a quick one for me. It's been brought up a lot why the team has not aggressively moved to start studies in more of a mild to moderate population for Zeposia in ulcerative colitis. So any thoughts around the development plan there would be appreciated."

And the other thing I would say is that we've been very disciplined from the standpoint of reallocating resources from those LOE brands to our launch brands which gives us further confidence in that. 
And the last thing is if you think about the portfolio and the launches, many of those products have strong margins, as you talked about on the inline with Opdivo being a high-margin product, but also some of the other ones that are in the launch portfolio like Zeposia as well as Reblozyl. Those products have nice margins as well. So that's what gives us confidence in our ability to keep those operating margins in that low to mid-40s as we progress."
