Before we begin our review, I would like to caution everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements about management's goals, plans and expectations, our future financial performance and other matters. These statements are based on assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Included in these forward-looking statements are statements regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Bio-Rad's results and operations and steps Bio-Rad is taking in response to the pandemic. Our actual results may differ materially from these plans and expectations and the impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown. We cannot be certain that Bio-Rad's responses to the pandemic will be successful, that the demand for Bio-Rad's COVID '19 related products is sustainable or that Bio-Rad will be able to meet this demand. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and I encourage you to review our filings with the SEC where we discuss in detail the risk factors in our business. The company does not intend to update any forward-looking statements made during the call today. 
Our remarks today will also include references to non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted income per share, which are financial measures that are not defined under generally accepted accounting principles. Investors should review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP results contained in our earnings release. 
I will now turn the call over to Ilan Daskal, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer."

I'd just like to take a few minutes to review our current state of operations around the world. As an opening comment, I would like to recognize the tremendous contributions and flexibility of our employees around the world during 2020. Their response to the shifting needs of operating in a pandemic have been truly exemplary. 
So at the onset of the pandemic, we set ourselves 3 key areas of focus to manage through this challenging period, which we continue with into 2021. As a quick reminder these are, the ongoing safety of our employees, continuing manufacturing operations to ensure product supply and support of our customers, and making sure we continue to make progress on our core strategies. As we closed out 2020 and entered into 2021, we've now achieved a steady state for operating in the pandemic, reflecting employee safety, work from home and adoption of company and local policy and practices. 
Overall, we have experienced minimal internal transmission of COVID across the company, and where we have suspected cases, have found the internal testing of employees in the U.S. using our Droplet Digital PCR platform to be very valuable in maximizing productivity. 
As we enter 2021, we are well positioned to meet market and customer demands driven by the pandemic and our manufacturing sites and R&D is operating effectively. In addition, our commercial organization has deployed digital tools where appropriate to minimize on-site visits to only the essentials required to keep customers up and running on our platforms. 
So with that brief overview, I will pass it back to Ilan. Thank you."

And now I would like to review the fourth quarter and full year results for 2020. Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2020 were $789.8 million, which is a 26.5% increase on a reported basis versus $624.4 million in Q4 of 2019. On a currency-neutral basis, sales increased 24.4%. The fourth quarter sales included a $32 million of damages award related to intellectual property litigation with 10x Genomics, covering the period between 2015 and 2018. Excluding the $32 million, the fourth quarter year-over-year currency-neutral revenue growth was 19.4%. 
The fourth quarter year-over-year revenue growth also benefited from an easy compare of about $10 million revenue carryover to Q1 of 2020 related to the December 2019 cyber attack. 
On a geographic basis, we experienced currency-neutral growth across all 3 regions. We saw strong demand for products associated with COVID-19 testing and related research. Generally, we are seeing most academic and diagnostics labs now running between 70% and 90% capacity, which is similar to what we saw in Q3. We estimate that COVID-19 related sales were about $132 million in the quarter. 
Sales of Life Science Group in the fourth quarter of 2020 were $428.5 million, compared to $242 million in Q4 of 2019, which is a 77.1% increase on a reported basis, and a 73.9% increase on a currency-neutral basis, and it was driven by our PCR product lines as well as strong performance in the biopharma segment. The fourth quarter revenue also included a $32 million damages award related to intellectual property litigation. Excluding the $32 million damages award, the currency-neutral revenue growth was 60.9%. The year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter was across all of the Life Science key product areas. 
Process media, which can fluctuate on a quarterly basis, saw strong double-digit year-over-year growth in the quarter over the same quarter last year. Excluding Process Media sales and the $32 million damages award, the underlying Life Science business grew 64.6% on a currency-neutral basis versus Q4 of 2019. Growth in the overall Life Science segment was offset by continued softness in academic research demand as these led around the globe are still operating below capacity; however, we believe that some of the demand was associated with larger-than-normal end-of-year budget release. 
On a geographic basis, Life Science currency-neutral year-over-year sales grew across all regions. 
Last month, the FDA granted an EUA for our COVID qPCR assay kit, which runs on Bio-Rad's existing CFX PCR platforms as well as qPCR systems for other -- from other providers. The assay kit is a multiplex test that targets 2 separate regions in the viral genome to ensure greater sensitivity and tolerance to potential mutations. 
In addition, earlier today, we received an EUA approval from the FDA for COVID, flu A and flu B qPCR syndromic multiplex test. This test, which allows discrimination between each of the 3 different viruses, also runs on Bio-Rad's CFX PCR platforms as well as qPCR systems from other providers. 
Sales of clinical diagnostics products in the fourth quarter were $359.6 million compared to $379 million in Q4 of 2019, which is a 5.1% decline on a reported basis, and a 6.6% decline on a currency-neutral basis. During the fourth quarter, strength in our Quality Controls products was offset by weakness across the rest of the Diagnostics portfolio. Resurgence of COVID cases during the fourth quarter did impact the recovery of routine testing trends and elective surgeries. 
On a geographic basis, the Diagnostics Group was relatively flat in the Americas, but posted declines in the other regions. 
The reported gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 58.3% on a GAAP basis and compares to 52.9% in Q4 of 2019. The current quarter gross margin benefited mainly from better product mix, lower service costs, higher manufacturing utilization, as well as $23 million gross margin benefit associated with the 10x Genomics damages award. 
Amortization related to prior acquisitions recorded in cost of goods sold was $4.6 million compared to $4.5 million in Q4 of 2019. 
SG&A expenses for Q4 of 2020 were $219.1 million or 27.7% of sales compared to $214.2 million or 34.3% in Q4 of 2019. The year-over-year SG&A expenses benefited from ongoing cost savings initiatives and lower discretionary expenses and was offset somewhat by higher employee-related expenses. Total amortization expense related to acquisitions recorded in SG&A for the quarter was $2.4 million versus $2.1 million in Q4 of 2019. 
Research and development expense in Q4 was $65.8 million or 8.3% of sales compared to $57.1 million or 9.1% of sales in Q4 of 2019. 
Q4 operating income was $175.2 million or 22.2% of sales compared to $59.2 million or 9.5% of sales in Q4 of 2019. 
Looking below the operating line, the change in fair market value of equity securities holdings added $904 million of income to the reported results and is substantially related to holdings of the shares of Sartorius AG. 
During the quarter, interest and other income resulted in a net expense of $1 million compared to $5.8 million of expense last year. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 22.2% compared to 20.9% for the same period in in 2019. Our GAAP tax rate in 2020 and 2019 were affected by the large unrealized gains in equity securities. In addition, the 2019 tax rate included a discrete benefit, which allowed us to apply higher foreign tax credits. 
Reported net income for the fourth quarter was $839.1 million and diluted earnings per share were $27.81. This is an increase from last year and is again substantially related to changes in the valuation of the Sartorius Holdings. 
Moving on to the fourth quarter non-GAAP results. Looking at the results on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded certain atypical and unique items that impacted both, the gross and operating margins as well as other income. These items are detailed in the reconciliation table in the press release. Looking at the non-GAAP results for the fourth quarter, in sales, we have excluded a $32 million damages awards. In cost of goods sold, we have excluded $8.7 million IP license costs associated with the damages award, $4.6 million of amortization of purchased intangibles, and a small restructuring benefit. These exclusions moved the gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2020 to a non-GAAP gross margin of 58.2% versus 54.1% in Q4 of 2019. 
Non-GAAP SG&A in the fourth quarter of 2020 was 28.2% versus 31.7% in Q4 of 2019. In SG&A, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded amortization of purchased intangibles of $2.4 million, legal-related expenses of $6.3 million and restructuring and acquisition-related benefits of $3.1 million. Non-GAAP R&D expense in the fourth quarter of 2020 was 8.7% versus 8.2% in Q4 of 2019. In R&D, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded a small restructuring benefit. The cumulative sum of these non-GAAP adjustments result in moving the quarterly operating margin from 22.2% on a GAAP basis to 21.4% on a non-GAAP basis. This non-GAAP operating margin compares to a non-GAAP operating margin in Q4 of 2019 of 14.3%. 
We have also excluded certain items below the operating line, which are the increase in value of the Sartorius Equity Holdings of $904.3 million, $2.1 million associated with Venture Investments, and $3 million of interest income associated with the 10x damages award. 
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 24.3% compared to 17.7% in 2019. The non-GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2019 was lower compared to 2020 due to a discrete benefit, which enabled us to apply higher foreign tax credits. 
And finally, non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $121 million or $4.01 diluted earnings per share compared to $70 million and $2.32 per share in Q4 of 2019. 
Moving on to the full year results. Net sales for the full year of 2020 were $2.546 billion on a reported basis. Excluding the 10x damages award of $32 million, sales were $2.514 billion, which is 8.9% growth on a currency-neutral basis. We estimate that COVID-19-related sales were about $313 million. Sales of Life Science Group for 2020 were $1.2318 billion. Excluding the 10x damages award of $32 million, the year-over-year growth was 35% on a currency-neutral basis. 
The majority of the year-over-year growth was driven by our core PCR products, Droplet Digital PCR and Process Media. 
On a geographic basis, Life Science currency-neutral full year-over-year sales grew across all 3 regions. Sales of Clinical Diagnostics Products for 2020 were $1.305 billion, which is down 7.1% on a currency-neutral basis. On a full year basis, Clinical Labs have seen a significant negative impact of the pandemic, which was slightly offset by growth within Quality Controls. On a geographic basis, Clinical Diagnostics' full year-over-year sales so declines across all regions. 
The full year non-GAAP gross margin was 56.9% compared to 55% in 2019. The year-over-year margin increase was driven mainly by product mix and manufacturing efficiencies, which was somewhat offset by higher logistics cost. Full year GAAP SG&A -- sorry, full year non-GAAP SG&A was 30.9% compared to 34.4% in 2019. The lower SG&A was driven by our ongoing cost savings initiatives and lower discretionary expenses, offset somewhat by higher employee-related expenses. Full year non-GAAP R&D was 9.1% versus 8.5% in 2019, and full year non-GAAP operating income was 17% compared to 12% in 2019. 
Lastly, the non-GAAP effective tax rate for the full year of 2020 was 24% compared to 24.1% in 2019. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for 2020 was consistent with our guidance of 24%. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Total cash and short-term investments at the end of 2020 was $997 million compared to $1.12 billion at the end of 2019 and $1.16 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2020. In December, we repaid the $425 million of outstanding senior notes. Year-end inventory decreased by about $18 million from the third quarter of 2020. The decrease in inventory was driven by higher demand for COVID-19-related products. During the fourth quarter, we did not purchase any shares of our stock. We had a total of $273 million available for potential share buybacks. 
Full year share buybacks was about 292,000 shares for $100 million. In 2019, we purchased about 88,000 shares of our stock for $28 million. For the fourth quarter of 2020, net cash generated from operating activities was $284.7 million, which compares to $159.8 million in Q4 of 2019. For the full year of 2020, net cash generated from operations was $575.3 million versus $457.9 million in 2019. The adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 25.2% of sales. The adjusted EBITDA in Q4 of 2019 was 18.7%. Full year adjusted EBITDA included the Sartorius dividend, was $546.4 million or about 21.7% compared to 17.5% in 2019. 
Net capital expenditures for the fourth quarter of 2020 were $39.2 million, and full year CapEx spend was $98.9 million. Depreciation and amortization for the fourth quarter was $36.2 million and $138.1 million for the full year. 
In December, we communicated our long-range plan. We project revenues to grow to an overall range of $2.75 billion and $2.85 billion by the end of 2023. This growth will be driven by Droplet Digital PCR, Single Cell Applications, Clinical Diagnostics, Bioproduction and increasing growth in Biopharma customers. We expect non-GAAP gross margin in 2023 to land in a range of 57% to 57.5%. We expect this positive increase to come from footprint optimization and better capacity utilization. Adjusted EBITDA margin should be in the range of 23% and 24% based on top line growth, productivity improvements, and SG&A leverage. 
Last week, we initiated a strategy-driven restructuring plan to improve operating performance as part of our 2023 goals. The restructuring plan primarily impacts our operations in Europe and includes the elimination of certain positions, the consolidation of certain functions, and the relocation of certain manufacturing operations from Europe to Asia. The restructuring plan is expected to eliminate a total of approximately 530 positions, approximately 200 positions in manufacturing and 330 positions across our SG&A and R&D functions. And subsequently, creation of a total of about 325 new positions, approximately 100 new positions in manufacturing and 225 new positions across SG&A and R&D functions. The restructuring plan will be implemented in phases over the next 2 years. As a result of this restructuring plan, we expect to incur between approximately $125 million and $130 million in total cost, which we anticipate will consist of approximately $86 million cash expenditures in the form of onetime termination benefits to the affected employees, approximately $19 million in capital expenses associated with the restructuring plan, and about $20 million to $25 million in onetime transition costs. We anticipate about $80 million to $90 million of restructuring charges related to this restructuring plan will be recorded in the first quarter of 2021 with the balance recorded by the end of 2022. 
Moving on to the non-GAAP guidance for 2021. While we are pleased with the overall performance in 2020, we continue to be uncertain about the duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, although we assume a gradual return to pre-pandemic activity levels and normalized business mix. We are guiding a currency-neutral revenue growth in 2021 to be between 4.5% and 5%. We estimate about 10% to 11% revenue growth for the Diagnostics Group. The Life Science Group year-over-year revenue is expected to be about flat as we project the COVID-related sales in 2021 to be about half versus 2020. 
We continue to assume that we will experience quarterly revenue fluctuations for Process Media, although we estimate an overall double-digit growth for the full year. 
Full year non-GAAP gross margin is projected between 56.2% and 56.5%, and full year non-GAAP operating margin to be between 16% and 16.5%. We estimate a non-GAAP full year tax rate to be between 24% and 25%. CapEx is projected between $120 million and $130 million, and full year adjusted EBITDA margin of about 21%. 
And now I'll turn the call to Norman for a few comments."

I'd just like to take a few minutes to review our current state of operations around the world. As an opening comment, I would like to recognize the tremendous contributions and flexibility of our employees around the world during 2020. Their response to the shifting needs of operating in a pandemic have been truly exemplary. 
So at the onset of the pandemic, we set ourselves 3 key areas of focus to manage through this challenging period, which we continue with into 2021. As a quick reminder these are, the ongoing safety of our employees, continuing manufacturing operations to ensure product supply and support of our customers, and making sure we continue to make progress on our core strategies. As we closed out 2020 and entered into 2021, we've now achieved a steady state for operating in the pandemic, reflecting employee safety, work from home and adoption of company and local policy and practices.
Overall, we have experienced minimal internal transmission of COVID across the company, and where we have suspected cases, have found the internal testing of employees in the U.S. using our Droplet Digital PCR platform to be very valuable in maximizing productivity.
As we enter 2021, we are well positioned to meet market and customer demands driven by the pandemic, and our manufacturing sites and R&D is operating effectively. In addition, our commercial organization has deployed digital tools where appropriate to minimize on-site visits to only the essentials required to keep customers up and running on our platforms.
So with that brief overview, I will pass it back to Ilan. Thank you."

And now I would like to review the fourth quarter and full year results for 2020. Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2020 were $789.8 million, which is a 26.5% increase on a reported basis versus $624.4 million in Q4 of 2019. On a currency-neutral basis, sales increased 24.4%. The fourth quarter sales include a $32 million of damages award related to intellectual property litigation with 10x Genomics, covering the period between 2015 and 2018. Excluding the $32 million, the fourth quarter year-over-year currency-neutral revenue growth was 19.4%.
The fourth quarter year-over-year revenue growth also benefited from an easy compare of about $10 million revenue carryover to Q1 of 2020 related to the December 2019 cyber attack.
On a geographic basis, we experienced currency-neutral growth across all 3 regions. We saw strong demand for products associated with COVID-19 testing and related research. Generally, we are seeing most academic and diagnostics labs now running between 70% and 90% capacity, which is similar to what we saw in Q3. We estimate that COVID-19-related sales were about $132 million in the quarter.
Sales of Life Science Group in the fourth quarter of 2020 were $428.5 million, compared to $242 million in Q4 of 2019, which is a 77.1% increase on a reported basis, and a 73.9% increase on a currency-neutral basis. And it was driven by our PCR product lines as well as strong performance in the Biopharma segment. The fourth quarter revenue also included a $32 million damages award related to intellectual property litigation. Excluding the $32 million damages award, the currency-neutral revenue growth was 60.9%. The year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter was across all of the Life Science key product areas.
Process Media, which can fluctuate on a quarterly basis, saw strong double-digit year-over-year growth in the quarter over the same quarter last year. Excluding Process Media sales and the $32 million damages award, the underlying Life Science business grew 64.6% on a currency-neutral basis versus Q4 of 2019. Growth in the overall Life Science segment was offset by continued softness in academic research demand as this led around the globe, are still operating below capacity; however, we believe that some of the demand was associated with larger-than-normal end-of-year budget release. On a geographic basis, Life Science currency-neutral year-over-year sales grew across all regions.
Last month, the FDA granted an EUA for our COVID qPCR assay kit, which runs on Bio-Rad's existing CFX PCR platforms as well as qPCR systems for other -- from other providers. The assay kit is a multiplex test that targets 2 separate regions in the viral genome to ensure greater sensitivity and tolerance to potential mutations.
In addition, earlier today, we received an EUA approval from the FDA for COVID, flu A and flu B qPCR syndromic multiplex test. This test, which allows discrimination between each of the 3 different viruses, also runs on Bio-Rad's CFX PCR platforms as well as qPCR systems from other providers.
Sales of Clinical Diagnostics products in the fourth quarter were $359.6 million compared to $379 million in Q4 of 2019, which is a 5.1% decline on a reported basis, and a 6.6% decline on a currency-neutral basis. During the fourth quarter, strength in our Quality Controls products was offset by weakness across the rest of the Diagnostics portfolio. Resurgence of COVID cases during the fourth quarter did impact the recovery of routine testing trends and elective surgeries.
On a geographic basis, the Diagnostics Group was relatively flat in the Americas, but posted declines in the other regions.
The reported gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 58.3% on a GAAP basis and compares to 52.9% in Q4 of 2019. The current quarter gross margin benefited mainly from better product mix, lower service costs, higher manufacturing utilization, as well as $23 million gross margin benefit associated with the 10x Genomics damages award.
Amortization related to prior acquisitions recorded in cost of goods sold was $4.6 million compared to $4.5 million in Q4 of 2019.
SG&A expenses for Q4 of 2020 were $219.1 million or 27.7% of sales compared to $214.2 million or 34.3% in Q4 of 2019. The year-over-year SG&A expenses benefited from ongoing cost savings initiatives and lower discretionary expenses, and was offset somewhat by higher employee-related expenses. Total amortization expense related to acquisitions recorded in SG&A for the quarter was $2.4 million versus $2.1 million in Q4 of 2019.
Research and development expense in Q4 was $65.8 million or 8.3% of sales compared to $57.1 million or 9.1% of sales in Q4 of 2019.
Q4 operating income was $175.2 million or 22.2% of sales compared to $59.2 million or 9.5% of sales in Q4 of 2019.
Looking below the operating line, the change in fair market value of equity securities holdings added $904 million of income to the reported results and is substantially related to holdings of the shares of Sartorius AG.
During the quarter, interest and other income resulted in a net expense of $1 million compared to $5.8 million of expense last year. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 22.2% compared to 20.9% for the same period in in 2019. Our GAAP tax rate in 2020 and 2019 were affected by the large unrealized gains in equity securities. In addition, the 2019 tax rate included a discrete benefit, which allowed us to apply higher foreign tax credits.
Reported net income for the fourth quarter was $839.1 million and diluted earnings per share were $27.81. This is an increase from last year and is again substantially related to changes in the valuation of the Sartorius Holdings.
Moving on to the fourth quarter non-GAAP results. Looking at the results on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded certain atypical and unique items that impacted both, the gross and operating margins as well as other income. These items are detailed in the reconciliation table in the press release. Looking at the non-GAAP results for the fourth quarter, in sales, we have excluded the $32 million damages awards. In cost of goods sold, we have excluded $8.7 million IP license costs associated with the damages award, $4.6 million of amortization of purchased intangibles, and a small restructuring benefit. These exclusions moved the gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2020 to a non-GAAP gross margin of 58.2% versus 54.1% in Q4 of 2019.
Non-GAAP SG&A in the fourth quarter of 2020 was 28.2% versus 31.7% in Q4 of 2019. In SG&A, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded amortization of purchased intangibles of $2.4 million, legal-related expenses of $6.3 million, and restructuring and acquisition-related benefits of $3.1 million. Non-GAAP R&D expense in the fourth quarter of 2020 was 8.7% versus 8.2% in Q4 of 2019. In R&D, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded a small restructuring benefit. The cumulative sum of these non-GAAP adjustments result in moving the quarterly operating margin from 22.2% on a GAAP basis to 21.4% on a non-GAAP basis. This non-GAAP operating margin compares to a non-GAAP operating margin in Q4 of 2019 of 14.3%.
We have also excluded certain items below the operating line, which are the increase in value of the Sartorius Equity Holdings of $904.3 million, $2.1 million associated with Venture Investments, and $3 million of interest income associated with the 10x damages award.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 24.3% compared to 17.7% in 2019. The non-GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2019 was lower compared to 2020 due to a discrete benefit, which enabled us to apply higher foreign tax credits.
And finally, non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $121 million or $4.01 diluted earnings per share compared to $70 million and $2.32 per share in Q4 of 2019.
Moving on to the full year results. Net sales for the full year of 2020 were $2.546 billion on a reported basis. Excluding the 10x damages award of $32 million, sales were $2.514 billion, which is 8.9% growth on a currency-neutral basis. We estimate that COVID-19-related sales were about $313 million. Sales of Life Science Group for 2020 were $1.2318 billion. Excluding the 10x damages award of $32 million, the year-over-year growth was 35% on a currency-neutral basis.
The majority of the year-over-year growth was driven by our core PCR products, Droplet Digital PCR and Process Media.
On a geographic basis, Life Science currency-neutral full year-over-year sales grew across all 3 regions. Sales of Clinical Diagnostics Products for 2020 were $1.305 billion, which is down 7.1% on a currency-neutral basis. On a full year basis, Clinical Labs have seen a significant negative impact of the pandemic, which was slightly offset by growth within Quality Controls. On a geographic basis, Clinical Diagnostics' full year-over-year sales so declined across all regions.
The full year non-GAAP gross margin was 56.9% compared to 55% in 2019. The year-over-year margin increase was driven mainly by product mix and manufacturing efficiencies, which was somewhat offset by higher logistics cost. Full year GAAP SG&A -- sorry, full year non-GAAP SG&A was 30.9% compared to 34.4% in 2019. The lower SG&A was driven by our ongoing cost savings initiatives and lower discretionary expenses, offset somewhat by higher employee-related expenses. Full year non-GAAP R&D was 9.1% versus 8.5% in 2019, and full year non-GAAP operating income was 17% compared to 12% in 2019.
Lastly, the non-GAAP effective tax rate for the full year of 2020 was 24% compared to 24.1% in 2019. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for 2020 was consistent with our guidance of 24%.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Total cash and short-term investments at the end of 2020 was $997 million compared to $1.12 billion at the end of 2019 and $1.16 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2020. In December, we repaid the $425 million of outstanding senior notes. Year-end inventory decreased by about $18 million from the third quarter of 2020. The decrease in inventory was driven by higher demand for COVID-19-related products. 
During the fourth quarter, we did not purchase any shares of our stock. We had a total of $273 million available for potential share buybacks. Full year share buybacks was about 292,000 shares for $100 million. In 2019, we purchased about 88,000 shares of our stock for $28 million.
For the fourth quarter of 2020, net cash generated from operating activities was $284.7 million, which compares to $159.8 million in Q4 of 2019. For the full year of 2020, net cash generated from operations was $575.3 million versus $457.9 million in 2019. The adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 25.2% of sales. The adjusted EBITDA in Q4 of 2019 was 18.7%. Full year adjusted EBITDA included the Sartorius dividend, was $546.4 million or about 21.7% compared to 17.5% in 2019.
Net capital expenditures for the fourth quarter of 2020 were $39.2 million, and full year CapEx spend was $98.9 million. Depreciation and amortization for the fourth quarter was $36.2 million and $138.1 million for the full year.
In December, we communicated our long-range plan. We project revenues to grow to an overall range of $2.75 billion and $2.85 billion by the end of 2023. This growth will be driven by Droplet Digital PCR, Single Cell Applications, Clinical Diagnostics, Bioproduction and increasing growth in Biopharma customers. We expect non-GAAP gross margin in 2023 to land in a range of 57% to 57.5%. We expect this positive increase to come from footprint optimization and better capacity utilization. Adjusted EBITDA margin should be in the range of 23% and 24% based on top line growth, productivity improvements, and SG&A leverage.
Last week, we initiated a strategy-driven restructuring plan to improve operating performance as part of our 2023 goals. The restructuring plan primarily impacts our operations in Europe and includes the elimination of certain positions, the consolidation of certain functions, and the relocation of certain manufacturing operations from Europe to Asia. The restructuring plan is expected to eliminate a total of approximately 530 positions; approximately 200 positions in manufacturing and 330 positions across our SG&A and R&D functions. And subsequently, creation of a total of about 325 new positions; approximately 100 new positions in manufacturing and 225 new positions across SG&A and R&D functions. The restructuring plan will be implemented in phases over the next 2 years. 
As a result of this restructuring plan, we expect to incur between approximately $125 million and $130 million in total cost, which we anticipate will consist of approximately $86 million cash expenditures in the form of onetime termination benefits to the affected employees, approximately $19 million in capital expenses associated with the restructuring plan, and about $20 million to $25 million in onetime transition costs. We anticipate about $80 million to $90 million of restructuring charges related to this restructuring plan will be recorded in the first quarter of 2021 with the balance recorded by the end of 2022.
Moving on to the non-GAAP guidance for 2021. While we are pleased with the overall performance in 2020, we continue to be uncertain about the duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, although we assume a gradual return to pre-pandemic activity levels and normalized business mix. We are guiding a currency-neutral revenue growth in 2021 to be between 4.5% and 5%. We estimate about 10% to 11% revenue growth for the Diagnostics Group. The Life Science Group year-over-year revenue is expected to be about flat, as we project the COVID-related sales in 2021 to be about half versus 2020.
We continue to assume that we will experience quarterly revenue fluctuations for Process Media, although we estimate an overall double-digit growth for the full year.
Full year non-GAAP gross margin is projected between 56.2% and 56.5%, and full year non-GAAP operating margin to be between 16% and 16.5%. We estimate the non-GAAP full year tax rate to be between 24% and 25%. CapEx is projected between $120 million and $130 million, and full year adjusted EBITDA margin of about 21%.
And now I'll turn the call to Norman for a few comments."

I'd just like to take a few minutes to review our current state of operations around the world. As an opening comment, I would like to recognize the tremendous contributions and flexibility of our employees around the world during 2020. Their response to the shifting needs of operating in a pandemic have been truly exemplary. 
So at the onset of the pandemic, we set ourselves 3 key areas of focus to manage through this challenging period, which we continue with into 2021. As a quick reminder these are, the ongoing safety of our employees, continuing manufacturing operations to ensure product supply and support of our customers, and making sure we continue to make progress on our core strategies. As we closed out 2020 and entered into 2021, we've now achieved a steady state for operating in the pandemic, reflecting employee safety, work from home and adoption of company and local policy and practices. 
Overall, we have experienced minimal internal transmission of COVID across the company, and where we have suspected cases, have found the internal testing of employees in the U.S. using our Droplet Digital PCR platform to be very valuable in maximizing productivity. 
As we enter 2021, we are well positioned to meet market and customer demands driven by the pandemic and our manufacturing sites and R&D is operating effectively. In addition, our commercial organization has deployed digital tools where appropriate to minimize on-site visits to only the essentials required to keep customers up and running on our platforms. 
So with that brief overview, I will pass it back to Ilan. Thank you."

And now I would like to review the fourth quarter and full year results for 2020. Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2020 were $789.8 million, which is a 26.5% increase on a reported basis versus $624.4 million in Q4 of 2019. On a currency-neutral basis, sales increased 24.4%. The fourth quarter sales included a $32 million of damages award related to intellectual property litigation with 10x Genomics, covering the period between 2015 and 2018. Excluding the $32 million, the fourth quarter year-over-year currency-neutral revenue growth was 19.4%. 
The fourth quarter year-over-year revenue growth also benefited from an easy compare of about $10 million revenue carryover to Q1 of 2020 related to the December 2019 cyber attack. 
On a geographic basis, we experienced currency-neutral growth across all 3 regions. We saw strong demand for products associated with COVID-19 testing and related research. Generally, we are seeing most academic and diagnostics labs now running between 70% and 90% capacity, which is similar to what we saw in Q3. We estimate that COVID-19-related sales were about $132 million in the quarter. 
Sales of Life Science Group in the fourth quarter of 2020 were $428.5 million, compared to $242 million in Q4 of 2019, which is a 77.1% increase on a reported basis, and a 73.9% increase on a currency-neutral basis, and it was driven by our PCR product lines as well as strong performance in the biopharma segment. The fourth quarter revenue also included a $32 million damages award related to intellectual property litigation. Excluding the $32 million damages award, the currency-neutral revenue growth was 60.9%. The year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter was across all of the Life Science key product areas. 
Process media, which can fluctuate on a quarterly basis, saw strong double-digit year-over-year growth in the quarter over the same quarter last year. Excluding Process Media sales and the $32 million damages award, the underlying Life Science business grew 64.6% on a currency-neutral basis versus Q4 of 2019. Growth in the overall Life Science segment was offset by continued softness in academic research demand as these led around the globe are still operating below capacity; however, we believe that some of the demand was associated with larger than normal end-of-year budget release. 
On a geographic basis, Life Science currency-neutral year-over-year sales grew across all regions. 
Last month, the FDA granted an EUA for our COVID qPCR assay kit, which runs on Bio-Rad's existing CFX PCR platforms as well as qPCR systems for other -- from other providers. The assay kit is a multiplex test that targets 2 separate regions in the viral genome to ensure greater sensitivity and tolerance to potential mutations. 
In addition, earlier today, we received an EUA approval from the FDA for COVID, flu A and flu B qPCR syndromic multiplex test. This test, which allows discrimination between each of the 3 different viruses, also runs on Bio-Rad's CFX PCR platforms as well as qPCR systems from other providers. 
Sales of clinical diagnostics products in the fourth quarter were $359.6 million compared to $379 million in Q4 of 2019, which is a 5.1% decline on a reported basis, and a 6.6% decline on a currency-neutral basis. During the fourth quarter, strength in our Quality Controls products was offset by weakness across the rest of the Diagnostics portfolio. Resurgence of COVID cases during the fourth quarter did impact the recovery of routine testing trends and elective surgeries. 
On a geographic basis, the Diagnostics Group was relatively flat in the Americas, but posted declines in the other regions. 
The reported gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 58.3% on a GAAP basis and compares to 52.9% in Q4 of 2019. The current quarter gross margin benefited mainly from better product mix, lower service costs, higher manufacturing utilization, as well as $23 million gross margin benefit associated with the 10x Genomics damages award. 
Amortization related to prior acquisitions recorded in cost of goods sold was $4.6 million compared to $4.5 million in Q4 of 2019. 
SG&A expenses for Q4 of 2020 were $219.1 million or 27.7% of sales compared to $214.2 million or 34.3% in Q4 of 2019. The year-over-year SG&A expenses benefited from ongoing cost savings initiatives and lower discretionary expenses and was offset somewhat by higher employee-related expenses. Total amortization expense related to acquisitions recorded in SG&A for the quarter was $2.4 million versus $2.1 million in Q4 of 2019. 
Research and development expense in Q4 was $65.8 million or 8.3% of sales compared to $57.1 million or 9.1% of sales in Q4 of 2019. 
Q4 operating income was $175.2 million or 22.2% of sales compared to $59.2 million or 9.5% of sales in Q4 of 2019. 
Looking below the operating line, the change in fair market value of equity securities holdings added $904 million of income to the reported results and is substantially related to holdings of the shares of Sartorius AG. 
During the quarter, interest and other income resulted in a net expense of $1 million compared to $5.8 million of expense last year. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 22.2% compared to 20.9% for the same period in 2019. Our GAAP tax rate in 2020 and 2019 were affected by the large unrealized gains in equity securities. In addition, the 2019 tax rate included a discrete benefit, which allowed us to apply higher foreign tax credits. 
Reported net income for the fourth quarter was $839.1 million and diluted earnings per share were $27.81. This is an increase from last year and is, again, substantially related to changes in the valuation of the Sartorius Holdings. 
Moving on to the fourth quarter non-GAAP results. Looking at the results on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded certain atypical and unique items that impacted both the gross and operating margins as well as other income. These items are detailed in the reconciliation table in the press release. Looking at the non-GAAP results for the fourth quarter, in sales, we have excluded a $32 million damages awards. In cost of goods sold, we have excluded $8.7 million IP license costs associated with the damages award, $4.6 million of amortization of purchased intangibles, and a small restructuring benefit. These exclusions moved the gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2020 to a non-GAAP gross margin of 58.2% versus 54.1% in Q4 of 2019. 
Non-GAAP SG&A in the fourth quarter of 2020 was 28.2% versus 31.7% in Q4 of 2019. In SG&A, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded amortization of purchased intangibles of $2.4 million, legal-related expenses of $6.3 million and restructuring and acquisition-related benefits of $3.1 million. Non-GAAP R&D expense in the fourth quarter of 2020 was 8.7% versus 8.2% in Q4 of 2019. In R&D, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded a small restructuring benefit. The cumulative sum of these non-GAAP adjustments result in moving the quarterly operating margin from 22.2% on a GAAP basis to 21.4% on a non-GAAP basis. This non-GAAP operating margin compares to a non-GAAP operating margin in Q4 of 2019 of 14.3%. 
We have also excluded certain items below the operating line, which are the increase in value of the Sartorius Equity Holdings of $904.3 million, $2.1 million associated with Venture Investments, and $3 million of interest income associated with the 10x damages award. 
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 24.3% compared to 17.7% in 2019. The non-GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2019 was lower compared to 2020 due to a discrete benefit, which enabled us to apply higher foreign tax credits. 
And finally, non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $121 million or $4.01 diluted earnings per share compared to $70 million and $2.32 per share in Q4 of 2019. 
Moving on to the full year results. Net sales for the full year of 2020 were $2.546 billion on a reported basis. Excluding the 10x damages award of $32 million, sales were $2.514 billion, which is 8.9% growth on a currency-neutral basis. We estimate that COVID-19-related sales were about $313 million. Sales of Life Science Group for 2020 were $1.2318 billion. Excluding the 10x damages award of $32 million, the year-over-year growth was 35% on a currency-neutral basis. 
The majority of the year-over-year growth was driven by our core PCR products, Droplet Digital PCR and Process Media. 
On a geographic basis, Life Science currency-neutral full year-over-year sales grew across all 3 regions. Sales of Clinical Diagnostics Products for 2020 were $1.305 billion, which is down 7.1% on a currency-neutral basis. On a full year basis, Clinical Labs have seen a significant negative impact of the pandemic, which was slightly offset by growth within Quality Controls. On a geographic basis, Clinical Diagnostics' full year-over-year sales saw declines across all regions. 
The full year non-GAAP gross margin was 56.9% compared to 55% in 2019. The year-over-year margin increase was driven mainly by product mix and manufacturing efficiencies, which was somewhat offset by higher logistics cost. Full year GAAP SG&A -- sorry, full year non-GAAP SG&A was 30.9% compared to 34.4% in 2019. The lower SG&A was driven by our ongoing cost savings initiatives and lower discretionary expenses, offset somewhat by higher employee-related expenses. Full year non-GAAP R&D was 9.1% versus 8.5% in 2019, and full year non-GAAP operating income was 17% compared to 12% in 2019. 
Lastly, the non-GAAP effective tax rate for the full year of 2020 was 24% compared to 24.1% in 2019. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for 2020 was consistent with our guidance of 24%. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Total cash and short-term investments at the end of 2020 was $997 million compared to $1.120 billion at the end of 2019 and $1.160 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2020. In December, we repaid the $425 million of outstanding senior notes. Year-end inventory decreased by about $18 million from the third quarter of 2020. The decrease in inventory was driven by higher demand for COVID-19-related products. During the fourth quarter, we did not purchase any shares of our stock. We had a total of $273 million available for potential share buybacks. 
Full year share buybacks was about 292,000 shares for $100 million. In 2019, we purchased about 88,000 shares of our stock for $28 million. For the fourth quarter of 2020, net cash generated from operating activities was $284.7 million, which compares to $159.8 million in Q4 of 2019. For the full year of 2020, net cash generated from operations was $575.3 million versus $457.9 million in 2019. The adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 25.2% of sales. The adjusted EBITDA in Q4 of 2019 was 18.7%. Full year adjusted EBITDA included the Sartorius dividend, was $546.4 million or about 21.7% compared to 17.5% in 2019. 
Net capital expenditures for the fourth quarter of 2020 were $39.2 million, and full year CapEx spend was $98.9 million. Depreciation and amortization for the fourth quarter was $36.2 million and $138.1 million for the full year. 
In December, we communicated our long-range plan. We project revenues to grow to an overall range of $2.75 billion and $2.85 billion by the end of 2023. This growth will be driven by Droplet Digital PCR, single-cell applications, clinical diagnostics, bioproduction and increasing growth in Biopharma customers. We expect non-GAAP gross margin in 2023 to land in a range of 57% to 57.5%. We expect this positive increase to come from footprint optimization and better capacity utilization. Adjusted EBITDA margin should be in the range of 23% and 24% based on top line growth, productivity improvements, and SG&A leverage. 
Last week, we initiated a strategy-driven restructuring plan to improve operating performance as part of our 2023 goals. The restructuring plan primarily impacts our operations in Europe and includes the elimination of certain positions, the consolidation of certain functions, and the relocation of certain manufacturing operations from Europe to Asia. The restructuring plan is expected to eliminate a total of approximately 530 positions, approximately 200 positions in manufacturing and 330 positions across our SG&A and R&D functions. And subsequently, creation of a total of about 325 new positions, approximately 100 new positions in manufacturing and 225 new positions across SG&A and R&D functions. The restructuring plan will be implemented in phases over the next 2 years. 
As a result of this restructuring plan, we expect to incur between approximately $125 million and $130 million in total cost, which we anticipate will consist of: approximately $86 million cash expenditures in the form of onetime termination benefits to the affected employees; approximately $19 million in capital expenses associated with the restructuring plan; and about $20 million to $25 million in onetime transition costs. We anticipate about $80 million to $90 million of restructuring charges related to this restructuring plan will be recorded in the first quarter of 2021 with the balance recorded by the end of 2022. 
Moving on to the non-GAAP guidance for 2021. While we are pleased with the overall performance in 2020, we continue to be uncertain about the duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, although we assume a gradual return to pre-pandemic activity levels and normalized business mix. We are guiding a currency-neutral revenue growth in 2021 to be between 4.5% and 5%. We estimate about 10% to 11% revenue growth for the Diagnostics Group. The Life Science Group year-over-year revenue is expected to be about flat as we project the COVID-related sales in 2021 to be about half versus 2020. 
We continue to assume that we will experience quarterly revenue fluctuations for Process Media, although we estimate an overall double-digit growth for the full year. 
Full year non-GAAP gross margin is projected between 56.2% and 56.5%, and full year non-GAAP operating margin to be between 16% and 16.5%. We estimate a non-GAAP full year tax rate to be between 24% and 25%. CapEx is projected between $120 million and $130 million and full year adjusted EBITDA margin of about 21%. 
And now I'll turn the call to Norman for a few comments."

And in North America, we're very close to pre-COVID performance. The real material dynamic is related to Europe and the step-up in restrictions and lockdowns that we saw in Q4 had a pretty big impact on elective surgeries. So I would say blood typing is a real story there in Europe as an area that still is kind of getting back to pre-COVID kind of routine levels. And then in China as well, we saw a shift -- a little bit of a shift from typical wellness programs to COVID-related infectious disease program. So that moderated a bit the diabetes business. So it kind of puts and takes regionally, puts and takes within different product lines, but certainly, things continue to move in the right direction with North America being kind of the bright spot there."

Before we begin our review, I would like to caution everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements about management's goals, plans and expectations, our future financial performance and other matters. These statements are based on assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Included in these forward-looking statements are statements regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Bio-Rad's results and operations and steps Bio-Rad is taking in response to the pandemic. Our actual results may differ materially from these plans and expectations, and the impact and the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown. We cannot be certain that Bio-Rad's responses to the pandemic will be successful, that the demand for Bio-Rad's COVID-19-related products is sustainable or that Bio-Rad will be able to meet this demand. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and I encourage you to review our filings with the SEC where we discuss in detail the risk factors in our business. The company does not intend to update any forward-looking statements made during the call today. Our remarks today will also include references to non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted income per share which are financial measures that are not defined under generally accepted accounting principles.

As expected, COVID continues to have an impact on our operations, but as previously communicated, we have now adapted well to this environment, and our employees around the world continue to perform to the highest standards. We continue our focus on the 3 areas previously communicated, the ongoing safety of our employees; continuing manufacturing operations to ensure product supply and support of our customers, and making sure we continue to make progress on our core strategies. Overall, we continue to be very pleased with our employee safety despite the increases in COVID in some areas of the world. 
Our internal COVID transmission rates remain extremely low, and we are starting to benefit from the vaccination programs. In Q1, we have maintained the work from home policies we adopted in 2020 and are continuing to monitor the pandemic closely as we assess the right timing for a more general return to the workplace. As we enter Q2, we expect to continue to experience the impact of the pandemic for at least the coming quarter, but are confident in our ability to meet customer demand while progressing our core strategies and new product development objectives. 
As the global economy trends towards recovery, we're also paying close attention to our supply chain as accelerated demand for raw materials has the potential to cause constraints and prolong higher-than-typical logistics costs. Provided there is positive global progress on controlling COVID, we anticipate operations starting to return to more normal operating practice in the second half of the year.

On a currency-neutral basis, sale",1470,"Thank you, Andy. Now I would like to review the results of the first quarter. Net sales for the first quarter of 2021 were $726.8 million, which is a 27.1% increase on a reported basis versus $571.6 million in Q1 of 2020. On a currency-neutral basis, sales increased 23.4%. The first quarter year-over-year revenue growth was impacted by tough compare of about $10 million revenue carryover to Q1 of 2020 related to the December 2019 cyber attack. On a geographic basis, we experienced currency-neutral growth across all 3 regions. 
We continued to see strong demand for products associated with COVID-19 testing and related research. Generally, we are seeing most academic and diagnostic labs now running about 90% capacity, which is an improvement to what we saw in Q4. We estimate that COVID-19-related sales were about $94 million in the quarter. Sales of the Life Science Group in the first quarter of 2021 were $366.5 million compared to $227.2 million in Q1 of 2020, which is a 61.3% increase on a reported basis. and a 56.9% increase on a currency-neutral basis. The year-over-year growth in the first quarter was driven by the continued strength of COVID-19-related qPCR products. In addition, we saw strong double-digit year-over-year sales growth in Droplet Digital PCR, Western Block and antibody products. In addition, Process Media, which can fluctuate on a quarterly basis, saw strong double-digit year-over-year growth in the quarter over the same quarter last year. Excluding Process Media sales, the underlying Life Science business grew 56.2% on a currency-neutral basis versus Q1 of 2020. On a geographic basis, Life Science currency-neutral year-over-year sales grew across all regions. In addition to continued adoption of Droplet Digital PCR in BioPharma, we also saw good demand for the QX ONE in wastewater testing applications for COVID, and we expedited the introduction of COVID variant assays, which are being well received. Key opinion leaders continue to highlight the sensitivity advantage of Droplet Digital PCR. 
Sales of the Clinical Diagnostics Group in the first quarter were $358.5 million, compared to $340.3 million in Q1 of 2020, which is a 5.4% growth on a reported basis, and a 2.2% growth on a currency-neutral basis. During the first quarter, the Diagnostics Group posted solid growth in diabetes and in quality controls. We started to see a recovery of market demand for non-COVID business, with diagnostics labs returning to about 90% of pre-COVID levels. The recovery of routine testing and elective surgeries is still progressing. On a geographic basis, the Diagnostics group posted growth in Asia. The reported gross margin for the first quarter of 2021 was 55.1% on a GAAP basis, and compares to 55.5% in Q1 of 2020. The current quarter gross margin percentage declined mainly due to expenses associated with the restructuring initiative that we communicated earlier this year, offset by better product mix, lower service costs and higher manufacturing utilization. Amortization related to prior acquisitions recorded in cost of goods sold was $4.6 million compared to $3.9 million in Q1 of 2020. SG&A expenses for Q1 of 2021 were $225.9 million or 31.1% of sales compared to $193.7 million or 33.9% in Q1 of 2020. The year-over-year SG&A expenses increased mainly due to the expenses associated with the restructuring initiatives and higher employee-related expenses, and it was offset slightly by a $5 million cybersecurity insurance settlement related to the 2019 cyber attack as well as lower discretionary spend. 
Total amortization expense related to acquisitions recorded in SG&A for the quarter was $2.4 million versus $2 million in Q1 of 2020. 
Research and development expense in Q1 was $73.9 million or 10.2% of sales compared to $49.3 million or 8.6% in Q1 of 2020. The year-over-year R&D expenses increased due to expenses associated with the restructuring initiative and increased project spend. Q1 operating income was $100.9 million or 13.9% of sales compared to $74.4 million or 13% in Q1 of 2020. 
Looking below the operating line. The change in fair market value of equity securities holdings added $1,179 million of income to the reported results, which is substantially related to holdings of the shares of Sartorius AG. During the quarter, interest and other income resulted in net other income of $16.9 million compared to $3.3 million of expense last year. Q1 of 2021 included $19 million of dividend income from Sartorius, which was declared this year in Q1. In 2020, the Sartorius dividend was declared in the second quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.7% compared to 23.7% in Q1 of 2020. The tax rates for both periods were driven by the large unrealized gain in equity securities. The year-over-year increase in our effective tax rate was due to the restructuring initiative announced earlier this year. 
Reported net income for the first quarter was $977.4 million, and diluted earnings per share were $32.38. This is an increase from last year and is substantially related to changes in the valuation of the Sartorius holdings. 
Moving on to the non-GAAP results. Looking at the results on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded certain atypical and unique items that impacted both the gross and operating margins as well as other income. These items are detailed in the reconciliation table in the press release. 
In cost of goods sold, we have excluded $4.6 million of amortization of purchased intangibles, $24 million of restructuring-related expenses and a small legal reserve benefit. These exclusions moved the gross margin for the first quarter of 2021 to a non-GAAP gross margin of 59% versus 55.9% in Q1 of 2020. 
Non-GAAP SG&A in the first quarter of 2021 was 25.4% versus 33.3% in Q1 of 2020. In SG&A, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded restructuring-related expenses of $34.7 million, legal-related expenses of $4.4 million, and amortization of purchased intangibles of $2.4 million. 
In R&D, we have excluded $16.9 million of restructuring-related expenses. The non-GAAP R&D expense in Q1 was consequently 7.9%. The cumulative sum of these non-GAAP adjustments result in moving the quarterly operating margin from 13.9% on a GAAP basis to 25.8% on a non-GAAP basis. This non-GAAP operating margin compares to a non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 of 2020 of 13.9%. We have also excluded certain items below the operating line, which are the increasing value of the Sartorius equity holdings of $1,179 million, and $1.8 million of loss associated with venture investments. 
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.6% versus 25.7% in Q1 of 2020. The tax rate was impacted by changes in the geographic mix of earnings. And finally, non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2021 was $157.4 million, or $5.21 diluted earnings per share compared to $57.6 million and $1.91 per share in Q1 of 2020. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Total cash and short-term investments at the end of Q1 were $1,025 million, compared to $997 million at the end of 2020. During the first quarter, we purchased 89,506 shares of our stock for a total of $50 million at an average price of approximately $559 per share. 
For the first quarter of 2021, net cash generated from operations was $114 million, which compares to $63 million in Q1 of 2020. The improvement is mainly driven by higher operating profits. The adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $232 million or 31.9% of sales, and excluding the Sartorius dividend, was 29.3%. The adjusted EBITDA in Q1 of 2020 was $107.4 million or 18.8% of sales, which did not include the 2020 Sartorius dividend. Net capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2021 were $19.5 million, and depreciation and amortization for the first quarter was $32.7 million. 
Moving on to the guidance. We began the year with a projection of between 4.5% and 5% non-GAAP sales growth, and a non-GAAP operating margin of between 16% and 16.5%. Even though we continue to be uncertain about the duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, given the results of the first quarter and our current outlook, we are now guiding currency-neutral revenue growth in 2021 to be between 5.5% and 6%. This includes COVID-related sales, which we estimate to be between $170 million and $180 million versus our prior estimate of about $150 million and $160 million. We project most of the 2021 COVID-19-related sales to occur during the first half of the year, and we continue to assume a continued gradual return to pre-pandemic activity and a more normalized business mix. 
Full year non-GAAP gross margin is now projected between 56.5% and 57% versus our previous guidance of 56.2% and 56.5%. And full year non-GAAP operating margin to be about 17%, and full year adjusted EBITDA margin to be about 22% versus previous guidance of 21%.

Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. Today, we will review the first quarter results of 2021. With me on the phone today are Norman Schwartz, our Chief Executive Officer; Ilan Daskal, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Andy Last, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Annette Tumolo, President of the Life Science Group; and Dara Wright, President of the Clinical Diagnostics Group. 
Before we begin our review, I would like to caution everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements about management's goals, plans and expectations, our future financial performance and other matters. These statements are based on assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Included in these forward-looking statements are statements regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Bio-Rad's results and operations and steps Bio-Rad is taking in response to the pandemic. Our actual results may differ materially from these plans and expectations, and the impact and the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown. 
We cannot be certain that Bio-Rad's responses to the pandemic will be successful, that the demand for Bio-Rad's COVID-19-related products is sustainable or that Bio-Rad will be able to meet this demand. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and I encourage you to review our filings with the SEC where we discuss in detail the risk factors in our business. The company does not intend to update any forward-looking statements made during the call today. 
Our remarks today will also include references to non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted income per share, which are financial measures that are not defined under generally accepted accounting principles. Investors should review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP results contained in our earnings release. 
I will now turn the call over to Ilan Daskal, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer."

As expected, COVID continues to have an impact on our operations, but as previously communicated, we have now adapted well to this environment, and our employees around the world continue to perform to the highest standards. We continue our focus on the 3 areas previously communicated, the ongoing safety of our employees; continuing manufacturing operations to ensure product supply and support of our customers; and making sure we continue to make progress on our core strategies. Overall, we continue to be very pleased with our employee safety despite the increases in COVID in some areas of the world. 
Our internal COVID transmission rates remain extremely low, and we are starting to benefit from the vaccination programs. In Q1, we have maintained the work from home policies we adopted in 2020 and are continuing to monitor the pandemic closely as we assess the right timing for a more general return to the workplace. As we enter Q2, we expect to continue to experience the impact of the pandemic for at least the coming quarter, but are confident in our ability to meet customer demand while progressing our core strategies and new product development objectives. 
And as the global economy trends towards recovery, we're also paying close attention to our supply chain as accelerated demand for raw materials has the potential to cause constraints and prolong higher-than-typical logistics costs. Provided there is positive global progress on controlling COVID, we anticipate operations starting to return to more normal operating practice in the second half of the year. 
So thank you, and I'll pass it back to Ilan."

Now I would like to review the results of the first quarter.

On a currency-neutral basis, sale",1468,"Thank you, Andy. Now I would like to review the results of the first quarter. Net sales for the first quarter of 2021 were $726.8 million, which is a 27.1% increase on a reported basis versus $571.6 million in Q1 of 2020. On a currency-neutral basis, sales increased 23.4%. The first quarter year-over-year revenue growth was impacted by a tough compare of about $10 million revenue carryover to Q1 of 2020 related to the December 2019 cyber-attack. On a geographic basis, we experienced currency-neutral growth across all 3 regions. 
We continued to see strong demand for product associated with COVID-19 testing and related research. Generally, we are seeing most academic and diagnostic labs now running about 90% capacity, which is an improvement to what we saw in Q4. We estimate that COVID-19-related sales were about $94 million in the quarter. Sales of the Life Science Group in the first quarter of 2021 were $366.5 million compared to $227.2 million in Q1 of 2020, which is a 61.3% increase on a reported basis, and a 56.9% increase on a currency-neutral basis. 
The year-over-year growth in the first quarter was driven by the continued strength of COVID-19-related qPCR products. In addition, we saw strong double-digit year-over-year sales growth in Droplet Digital PCR, Western Block and antibody products. In addition, Process Media, which can fluctuate on a quarterly basis, saw strong double-digit year-over-year growth in the quarter over the same quarter last year. Excluding Process Media sales, the underlying Life Science business grew 56.2% on a currency-neutral basis versus Q1 of 2020. 
On a geographic basis, Life Science currency-neutral year-over-year sales grew across all regions. In addition to continued adoption of Droplet Digital PCR in BioPharma, we also saw good demand for the QX ONE in wastewater testing applications for COVID, and we expedited the introduction of COVID variant assays, which are being well received. Key opinion leaders continue to highlight the sensitivity advantage of Droplet Digital PCR. 
Sales of the Clinical Diagnostics Group in the first quarter were $358.5 million, compared to $340.3 million in Q1 of 2020, which is a 5.4% growth on a reported basis, and a 2.2% growth on a currency-neutral basis. During the first quarter, the Diagnostics Group posted solid growth in diabetes and in quality controls. We started to see a recovery of market demand for non-COVID business, with diagnostics labs returning to about 90% of pre-COVID levels. The recovery of routine testing and elective surgeries is still progressing. 
On a geographic basis, the Diagnostics group posted growth in Asia. The reported gross margin for the first quarter of 2021 was 55.1% on a GAAP basis, and compares to 55.5% in Q1 of 2020. The current quarter gross margin percentage declined mainly due to expenses associated with the restructuring initiative that we communicated earlier this year, offset by better product mix, lower service costs and higher manufacturing utilization. 
Amortization related to prior acquisitions recorded in cost of goods sold was $4.6 million compared to $3.9 million in Q1 of 2020. SG&A expenses for Q1 of 2021 were $225.9 million or 31.1% of sales compared to $193.7 million or 33.9% in Q1 of 2020. The year-over-year SG&A expenses increased mainly due to expenses associated with the restructuring initiative and higher employee-related expenses, and it was offset slightly by a $5 million cybersecurity insurance settlement related to the 2019 cyber-attack as well as lower discretionary spend. 
Total amortization expense related to acquisitions recorded in SG&A for the quarter was $2.4 million versus $2 million in Q1 of 2020. 
Research and development expense in Q1 was $73.9 million or 10.2% of sales compared to $49.3 million or 8.6% in Q1 of 2020. The year-over-year R&D expenses increased due to expenses associated with the restructuring initiative and increased project spend. Q1 operating income was $100.9 million or 13.9% of sales compared to $74.4 million or 13% in Q1 of 2020. 
Looking below the operating line. The change in fair market value of equity securities holdings added $1.179 billion of income to the reported results, which is substantially related to holdings of the shares of Sartorius AG. During the quarter, interest and other income resulted in net other income of $16.9 million compared to $3.3 million of expense last year. Q1 of 2021 included $19 million of dividend income from Sartorius, which was declared this year in Q1. In 2020, the Sartorius dividend was declared in the second quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.7% compared to 23.7% in Q1 of 2020. The tax rates for both periods were driven by the large unrealized gain in equity securities. The year-over-year increase in our effective tax rate was due to the restructuring initiative announced earlier this year. 
Reported net income for the first quarter was $977.4 million, and diluted earnings per share were $32.38. This is an increase from last year and is substantially related to changes in the valuation of the Sartorius holdings. 
Moving on to the non-GAAP results. Looking at the results on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded certain atypical and unique items that impacted both the gross and operating margins as well as other income. These items are detailed in the reconciliation table in the press release. 
In cost of goods sold, we have excluded $4.6 million of amortization of purchased intangibles, $24 million of restructuring-related expenses and a small legal reserve benefit. These exclusions moved the gross margin for the first quarter of 2021 to a non-GAAP gross margin of 59% versus 55.9% in Q1 of 2020. 
Non-GAAP SG&A in the first quarter of 2021 was 25.4% versus 33.3% in Q1 of 2020. In SG&A, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded restructuring-related expenses of $34.7 million, legal-related expenses of $4.4 million, and amortization of purchased intangibles of $2.4 million. 
In R&D, we have excluded $16.9 million of restructuring-related expenses. The non-GAAP R&D expense in Q1 was consequently 7.9%. The cumulative sum of these non-GAAP adjustments result in moving the quarterly operating margin from 13.9% on a GAAP basis to 25.8% on a non-GAAP basis. This non-GAAP operating margin compares to a non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 of 2020 of 13.9%. We have also excluded certain items below the operating line, which are the increasing value of the Sartorius equity holdings of $1.179 billion, and $1.8 million of loss associated with venture investments. 
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.6% versus 25.7% in Q1 of 2020. The tax rate was impacted by changes in the geographic mix of earnings. And finally, non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2021 was $157.4 million, or $5.21 diluted earnings per share compared to $57.6 million and $1.91 per share in Q1 of 2020. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Total cash and short-term investments at the end of Q1 were $1.025 billion, compared to $997 million at the end of 2020. During the first quarter, we purchased 89,506 shares of our stock for a total of $50 million at an average price of approximately $559 per share. 
For the first quarter of 2021, net cash generated from operations was $114 million, which compares to $63 million in Q1 of 2020. The improvement is mainly driven by higher operating profits. The adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $232 million or 31.9% of sales, and excluding the Sartorius dividend, was 29.3%. The adjusted EBITDA in Q1 of 2020 was $107.4 million or 18.8% of sales, which did not include the 2020 Sartorius dividend. Net capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2021 were $19.5 million, and depreciation and amortization for the first quarter was $32.7 million. 
Moving on to the guidance. We began the year with a projection of between 4.5% and 5% non-GAAP sales growth, and a non-GAAP operating margin of between 16% and 16.5%. Even though we continue to be uncertain about the duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, given the results of the first quarter and our current outlook, we are now guiding currency-neutral revenue growth in 2021 to be between 5.5% and 6%. This includes COVID-related sales, which we estimate to be between $170 million and $180 million versus our prior estimate of about $150 million and $160 million. We project most of the 2021 COVID-19-related sales to occur during the first half of the year, and we continue to assume a continued gradual return to pre-pandemic activity and a more normalized business mix. 
Full year non-GAAP gross margin is now projected between 56.5% and 57% versus our previous guidance of 56.2% and 56.5%. And full year non-GAAP operating margin to be about 17%, and full year adjusted EBITDA margin to be about 22% versus previous guidance of 21%.

Our actual results may differ materially from these plans and expectations, and the impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and I encourage you to review our filings with the SEC, where we discuss in detail the risk factors in our business. The company does not intend to update any forward-looking statements made during the call today. 
Finally, our remarks today will include references to non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share which are financial measures that are not defined under generally accepted accounting principles.

So I'd like to take a few minutes to review our current state of operations around the world. Overall, Bio-Rad has adapted well to the working constraints that COVID has imposed upon us, and we find ourselves able to respond and react well to everyday operational changes and demands. We continue to make solid progress on our core strategies, support of our customers and the safety of our employees. 
With improvement in our end markets after the significant downturn a year ago,  we are responding well to increased demand. But as with other manufacturers in Life Sciences, we are having to work hard to procure raw materials in some challenged areas such as plastics and electronic components as well as dealing with increased pressure on raw material costs. We also continue to experience higher than typical logistics costs, as indicated in our Q1 call. 
With the emergence of the COVID-19 delta variant, we are maintaining our work from home policies for the near term as we work on return to the workplace plans targeted for later this quarter. And we continue to monitor the global pandemic situation carefully given the fluidity the delta variance has created. Employee safety remains a principal focus, and we are pleased with our safety record and the growing vaccination status of our organization. 
As we enter Q3, we expect the emergence of the delta variant will continue to create some challenges, and we are maintaining vigilance and flexibility as a result. Overall, we expect to see continued improvement in our end markets through the second half of the year as our customers continue to adapt. However, the new delta variant clearly introduces an element of uncertainty as we move forward. Thank you for your attention, and I'll pass it back to Ilan now."

Sales of our core products in the second quarter of last year were negatively impacted by the pandemic. And generally, we are seeing a continued gradual capacity improvement at both academic and diagnostic labs, which we estimate between 90% and 95% of pre-COVID levels. We estimate that the COVID-19-related sales were about $68 million in the quarter. Sales of the Life Science Group in the second quarter of 2021 were $334.2 million compared to $252.1 million in Q2 of 2020, which is a 32.6% increase on a reported basis and a 27.1% increase on a currency-neutral basis. 
The year-over-year sales growth in the second quarter was driven mainly by increases in Western Blotting, Droplet Digital PCR and qPCR products. We have seen strong growth in the biopharma market for our Droplet Digital PCR platform. We are also seeing a healthy uptake for DDPCR in wastewater solutions. Government funding towards public health labs is driving increased demand for our DDPCR products that offer automated solutions with high accuracy and sensitivity. 
Process Media, which can fluctuate on a quarterly basis, saw a year-over-year double-digit growth versus the same quarter last year. Excluding Process Media sales, the underlying Life Science business grew 29.1% on a currency neutral basis versus Q2 of 2020. 
On a geographic basis, Life Science currency-neutral year-over-year sales grew across all regions. Before moving on, I would like to highlight the broad legal settlement with Tenax Genomics announced earlier this week. This settlement resolves the multiyear global litigation Tenax over outstanding issues in the field of single-cell and includes a global cross-license agreement. 
In addition to past and future royalties, Bio-Rad received broad freedom to operate in the single cell market and maintained exclusivity to our micro well single cell IP. We estimate that the future royalty payments from this legal settlement could total $110 million to $140 million over the life of the agreement, which runs through the year 2030. This includes payments of $32 million in the third quarter for back royalties owed to Bio-Rad for the period from November 2018 through December 2020 as well as for settlement fees and interest. 
Sales of the Clinical Diagnostics Group in the second quarter were $380.2 million compared to $283.2 million in Q2 of 2020, which is a 34.3% increase on a reported basis and a 28% increase on a currency-neutral basis. During the second quarter, the diagnostics group posted double-digit growth across all of its product lines. The year-over-year growth was driven by a recovery of routine testing.  Elective surgery recovery is still progressing, although at a slower pace. 
On a geographic basis, the diagnostics group currency-neutral year-over-year sales grew across all regions. Our Diagnostics group announced last month the partnership with CGN, which is a global leader in multiplex molecular diagnostics. Bio-Rad will exclusively market the CGN test in the U.S., pending regulatory approvals. CGN's diagnostic products have high sensitivity and specificity and are optimized to work with Bio-Rad CFX real-time PCR systems. 
The reported gross margin for the second quarter of 2021 was 56.1% on a GAAP basis and compares to 54.6% in Q2 of 2020. Recall that the gross margin in Q2 of 2020 included an $8 million customs duty charge. And excluding that charge, the Q2 gross margin further improved this quarter as a result of our productivity and efficiency initiatives. However, as mentioned, we currently see increased pressure on raw material costs and higher logistics costs 
Amortization related to prior acquisitions recorded in cost of goods sold was $4.6 million and compared to $5 million in Q2 of 2020. SG&A expenses for Q2 of 2021 were $213.4 million or 29.8% of sales compared to $189.3 million or 35.3% in Q2 of 2020. Increases in SG&A expenses was mainly the result of employee-related performance compensation expense. 
Total amortization expense related to acquisitions recorded in SG&A for the quarter was $2.4 million versus $2.3 million in Q2 of 2020. Research and development expense in Q2 was $63.4 million or 8.9% of sales compared to $52 million or 9.7% of sales in Q2 of 2020. Q2 operating income was $124.8 million, or 17.4% of sales compared to $51.7 million or 9.6% of sales in Q2 of 2020. 
Looking below the operating line, the change in fair market value of equity securities holdings added $1.031 billion of income to the reported results and is substantially related to the holdings of the shares of Sartorius AG. Also during the quarter, interest and other income resulted in net other income of $1.3 million primarily due to foreign exchange and compared to $10.7 million of income last year. 
Q2 of 2020 includes an $8.9 million dividend from Sartorius, which was declared in June and was paid in July. In 2021, the Sartorius dividend was declared in the first quarter. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2021 was 21% compared to 22.4% for the same period in 2020. The tax rate for both periods were driven by the large unrealized gain in equity securities. In addition, the second quarter of 2021 effective tax rate was lower also due to a lapse of statute of limitations of certain tax reserves. 
Reported net income for the second quarter was $914.1 million and diluted earnings per share were $30.32. This is a decrease from last year and is related to changes in valuation of the Sartorius Holdings. 
Moving on to the non-GAAP results. Looking at the results on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded certain atypical and unique items that impacted both the gross and operating margins as well as other income. These items are detailed in the reconciliation table in the press release. Looking at the non-GAAP results for the second quarter in cost of goods sold, we have excluded $4.6 million of amortization of purchased intangibles and $1.2 million of restructuring-related expenses. These exclusions moved the gross margin for the second quarter of 2021 to a non-GAAP gross margin of 56.9% versus 55.5% in Q2 of 2020. 
Non-GAAP SG&A in the second quarter of 2021 was 29.2% versus 33.9% in Q2 of 2020. In SG&A, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded amortization of purchased intangibles of $2.4 million, legal-related expenses of $8.8 million and restructuring and acquisition-related benefits of $7 million. Non-GAAP R&D expense in the second quarter of 2021 was 9.1% versus 9.8% in Q2 of 2020. 
In R&D, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded $2.1 million of restructuring benefits. The cumulative sum of these non-GAAP adjustments result in moving the quarterly operating margin from 17.4% on a GAAP basis to 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis. This non-GAAP operating margin compares to a non-GAAP operating margin in Q2 of 2020 of 11.8%. 
We have also excluded certain items below the operating line, which are the increase in value of the Sartorius equity holdings of $1.031 billion and the $1.8 million loss associated with venture investments. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2021 was 21.5% compared to 23.8% for the same period in 2020. The lower rate in 2021 was driven by the geographic mix of earnings. 
And finally, non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2021 was $106.6 million or $3.54 diluted earnings per share compared to $48.3 million or $1.61 per share in Q2 of 2020. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Total cash and short-term investments at the end of Q2 were $1.167 billion compared to $1.025 billion at the end of Q1 of 2021. During the second quarter, we did not purchase any shares of our stock. For the second quarter of 2021, net cash generated from operating activities was $154.6 million which compares to $92.1 million in Q2 of 2020. This increase mainly reflects higher operating profits. 
The adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2021 was 22.3% of sales. The adjusted EBITDA in Q2 of 2020 was 18.6% and  excluding the Sartorius dividend was 16.9%. Net capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2021 were $23.4 million and depreciation and amortization for the second quarter was $33.7 million. 
Moving on to the guidance. Andy previously alluded to continued uncertainties surrounding the pandemic, which could create some challenges and we look -- sorry, as we look to the better half of this year. That being said, with customers continuing to adapt in this environment, we assume a gradual return to pre-pandemic activity and the more normalized business mix during the second half of 2021. 
We are now guiding non-GAAP currency-neutral revenue growth to be between 10% and 10.5% for 2021 versus our prior guidance of 5.5% to 6%. This updated outlook assumes the full year COVID-related sales to be between $200 million and $210 million, of which approximately $40 million to $50 million are projected for the second half of 2021. 
Excluding COVID-related sales, the non-GAAP year-over-year currency-neutral sales growth in the second half is expected to be between 13% and 14%. This represents between 4.5% and 5.5% growth in the second half of 2021 over the first half of 2021. Full year non-GAAP gross margin is now projected to be between 57% and 57.5%. Full year non-GAAP operating margin is forecasted to be about 19%, which assumes higher operating expenses in the second half of 2021 versus the first half as we are anticipating continued gradual return to more normal activity levels. This guidance excludes any benefit related to the settlement with Tenax Genomics. 
Our updated annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for 2021 is projected to be between 23% and 24%. Full year adjusted EBITDA margin is forecasted to be between 23% and 23.5%. 
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now open the line to take your questions. Operator?"

Yes, when you think about the margin and let's start with the gross margin, we do see already a lot of benefit from the various initiatives that we had around the efficiencies and productivity. And that was definitely part of the results for this quarter and will continue to be part of the guidance in the second half of the year. 
There were some headwinds associated with FX, et cetera. But for the most part, the benefit is associated with the ongoing initiatives around productivity and initiative. Similarly, we continue to see the fall through not only from the higher guidance on the top line and obviously, improved utilization in the second half, but continued also benefits from those efficiencies and productivity. 
And then you have the mix impact for the COVID versus first half versus second half. Obviously, the drop of the COVID related sales to about $40 million to $50 million in the second half does create kind of some level of headwind to the overall margins."

Before we begin our review, I'd like to caution everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements about management's goals, plans, expectations, our future financial performance and other matters. These statements are based on assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Included in these forward-looking statements are commentary regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Bio-Rad's results, operations and steps Bio-Rad is taking in response to the pandemic. Our actual results may differ materially from these plans and expectations, and the impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and I encourage you to review our filings with the SEC where we discuss in detail the risk factors in our business. The company does not intend to update any forward-looking statements made during the call today.
Finally, our remarks today will include references to non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share, which are financial measures that are not defined under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Investors should review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP results contained in our earnings release.

So I'd like to take a few minutes to review our current state of operations around the world. Overall, Bio-Rad has adapted well to the working constraints that COVID has imposed upon us, and we find ourselves able to respond and react well to everyday operational changes and demands. We continue to make solid progress on our core strategies, support of our customers and the safety of our employees.
With improvement in our end markets after the significant downturn a year ago, we're responding well to increased demand. But as with other manufacturers in life sciences, we are having to work hard to procure raw materials in some challenged areas, such as plastics and electronic components, as well as dealing with increased pressure on raw material costs. We also continue to experience higher than typical logistics costs as indicated in our Q1 call.
With the emergence of the COVID-19 delta variant, we are maintaining our work from home policies for the near term as we work on return to the workplace plans targeted for later this quarter, and we continue to monitor the global pandemic situation carefully given the fluidity the delta variance has created. Employee safety remains a principal focus, and we are pleased with our safety record and the growing vaccination status of our organization.
As we enter Q3, we expect the emergence of the delta variant will continue to create some challenges, and we are maintaining vigilance and flexibility as a result. Overall, we expect to see continued improvement in our end markets through the second half of the year as our customers continue to adapt. However, the new delta variant clearly introduces an element of uncertainty as we move forward.
Thank you for your attention, and I'll pass it back to Ilan now."

Now I would like to review the results of the second quarter.

Net sales for the second quarter of 2021 were $715.9 million, which is a 33.4% increase on a reported basis versus $536.9 million in Q2 of 2020. On a currency-neutral basis, sales increased 27.5%. On a geographic basis, we experienced currency-neutral growth across all 3 regions.
Sales of our core products in the second quarter of last year were negatively impacted by the pandemic. And generally, we are seeing a continued gradual capacity improvement at both academic and diagnostic labs, which we estimate between 90% and 95% of pre-COVID levels. We estimate that the COVID-19-related sales were about $68 million in the quarter.
Sales of the Life Science group in the second quarter of 2021 were $334.2 million compared to $252.1 million in Q2 of 2020, which is a 32.6% increase on a reported basis and a 27.1% increase on a currency-neutral basis. The year-over-year sales growth in the second quarter was driven mainly by increases in western blotting, Droplet Digital PCR and qPCR products. We have seen strong growth in the biopharma market for our Droplet Digital PCR platform. We are also seeing a healthy uptake for ddPCR in wastewater solutions. Government funding towards public health labs is driving increased demand for our ddPCR products that offer automated solutions with high accuracy and sensitivity. Process Media, which can fluctuate on a quarterly basis, saw a year-over-year double-digit growth versus the same quarter last year. Excluding Process Media sales, the underlying Life Science business grew 29.1% on a currency-neutral basis versus Q2 of 2020. On a geographic basis, Life Science currency-neutral year-over-year sales grew across all regions.
Before moving on, I would like to highlight the broad legal settlement with 10x Genomics announced earlier this week. This settlement resolves the multiyear global litigation with 10x over outstanding issues in the field of single cell and includes a global cross-license agreement. In addition to past and future royalties, Bio-Rad received broad freedom to operate in the single-cell market and maintained exclusivity to our microwell single-cell IP. We estimate that the future royalty payments from this legal settlement could total $110 million to $140 million over the life of the agreement, which runs through the year 2030. This includes payments of $32 million in the third quarter for back royalties owed to Bio-Rad for the period from November 2018 through December 2020 as well as for settlement fees and interests.
Sales of the Clinical Diagnostics group in the second quarter were $380.2 million compared to $283.2 million in Q2 of 2020, which is a 34.3% increase on a reported basis and a 28% increase on a currency-neutral basis. During the second quarter, the diagnostics group posted double-digit growth across all of its product lines. The year-over-year growth was driven by a recovery of routine testing. Elective surgery recovery is still progressing although at a slower pace. On a geographic basis, the diagnostics group currency-neutral year-over-year sales grew across all regions. Our diagnostics group announced last month a partnership with Seegene, which is a global leader in multiplex molecular diagnostics. Bio-Rad will exclusively market the Seegene tests in the U.S., pending regulatory approvals. Seegene's diagnostic products have high sensitivity and specificity and are optimized to work with Bio-Rad's CFX Real-Time PCR Systems.
The reported gross margin for the second quarter of 2021 was 56.1% on a GAAP basis and compares to 54.6% in Q2 of 2020. Recall that the gross margin in Q2 of 2020 included an $8 million customs duty charge. And excluding that charge, the Q2 gross margin further improved this quarter as a result of our productivity and efficiency initiatives. However, as mentioned, we currently see increased pressure on raw material costs and higher logistics costs.
Amortization related to prior acquisitions recorded in cost of goods sold was $4.6 million and compares to $5 million in Q2 of 2020. SG&A expenses for Q2 of 2021 were $213.4 million or 29.8% of sales compared to $189.3 million or 35.3% in Q2 of 2020. Increases in SG&A expenses was mainly the result of employee-related performance compensation expense. Total amortization expense related to acquisitions recorded in SG&A for the quarter was $2.4 million versus $2.3 million in Q2 of 2020.
Research and development expense in Q2 was $63.4 million or 8.9% of sales compared to $52 million or 9.7% of sales in Q2 of 2020. Q2 operating income was $124.8 million or 17.4% of sales compared to $51.7 million or 9.6% of sales in Q2 of 2020.
Looking below the operating line, the change in fair market value of equity securities holdings added $1.031 billion of income to the reported results and is substantially related to the holdings of the shares of Sartorius AG. Also during the quarter, interest and other income resulted in net other income of $1.3 million primarily due to foreign exchange and compared to $10.7 million of income last year. Q2 of 2020 includes an $8.9 million dividend from Sartorius, which was declared in June and was paid in July. In 2021, the Sartorius dividend was declared in the first quarter.
The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2021 was 21% compared to 22.4% for the same period in 2020. The tax rate for both periods were driven by the large unrealized gain in equity securities. In addition, the second quarter of 2021 effective tax rate was lower also due to a lapse of statute of limitations of certain tax reserves. Reported net income for the second quarter was $914.1 million, and diluted earnings per share were $30.32. This is a decrease from last year and is related to changes in valuation of the Sartorius holdings.
Moving on to the non-GAAP results. Looking at the results on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded certain atypical and unique items that impacted both the gross and operating margins as well as other income. These items are detailed in the reconciliation table in the press release.
Looking at the non-GAAP results for the second quarter. In cost of goods sold, we have excluded $4.6 million of amortization of purchased intangibles and $1.2 million of restructuring-related expenses. These exclusions moved the gross margin for the second quarter of 2021 to a non-GAAP gross margin of 56.9% versus 55.5% in Q2 of 2020. Non-GAAP SG&A in the second quarter of 2021 was 29.2% versus 33.9% in Q2 of 2020. In SG&A, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded amortization of purchased intangibles of $2.4 million, legal-related expenses of $8.8 million and restructuring and acquisition-related benefits of $7 million.
Non-GAAP R&D expense in the second quarter of 2021 was 9.1% versus 9.8% in Q2 of 2020. In R&D, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded $2.1 million of restructuring benefits. The cumulative sum of these non-GAAP adjustments result in moving the quarterly operating margin from 17.4% on a GAAP basis to 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis. This non-GAAP operating margin compares to a non-GAAP operating margin in Q2 of 2020 of 11.8%.
We have also excluded certain items below the operating line, which are the increase in value of the Sartorius equity holdings of $1.031 billion and the $1.8 million loss associated with venture investments. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2021 was 21.5% compared to 23.8% for the same period in 2020. The lower rate in 2021 was driven by the geographic mix of earnings. And finally, non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2021 was $106.6 million or $3.54 diluted earnings per share compared to $48.3 million or $1.61 per share in Q2 of 2020.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Total cash and short-term investments at the end of Q2 were $1.167 billion compared to $1.025 billion at the end of Q1 of 2021. During the second quarter, we did not purchase any shares of our stock. For the second quarter of 2021, net cash generated from operating activities was $154.6 million, which compares to $92.1 million in Q2 of 2020. This increase mainly reflects higher operating profits. The adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2021 was 22.3% of sales. The adjusted EBITDA in Q2 of 2020 was 18.6% and excluding the Sartorius dividend was 16.9%. Net capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2021 were $23.4 million, and depreciation and amortization for the second quarter was $33.7 million.
Moving on to the guidance. Andy previously alluded to continued uncertainties surrounding the pandemic, which could create some challenges and we look -- sorry, as we look to the better half of this year. That being said, with customers continuing to adapt in this environment, we assume a gradual return to pre-pandemic activity and the more normalized business mix during the second half of 2021. We are now guiding non-GAAP currency-neutral revenue growth to be between 10% and 10.5% for 2021 versus our prior guidance of 5.5% to 6%. This updated outlook assumes the full year COVID-related sales to be between $200 million and $210 million, of which approximately $40 million to $50 million are projected for the second half of 2021.
Excluding COVID-related sales, the non-GAAP year-over-year currency-neutral sales growth in the second half is expected to be between 13% and 14%. This represents between 4.5% and 5.5% growth in the second half of 2021 over the first half of 2021. Full year non-GAAP gross margin is now projected to be between 57% and 57.5%. Full year non-GAAP operating margin is forecasted to be about 19%, which assumes higher operating expenses in the second half of 2021 versus the first half as we are anticipating continued gradual return to more normal activity levels. This guidance excludes any benefit related to the settlement with 10x Genomics. Our updated annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for 2021 is projected to be between 23% and 24%. Full year adjusted EBITDA margin is forecasted to be between 23% and 23.5%.

Yes, when you think about the margin, and let's start with the gross margin, we do see already a lot of benefit from the various initiatives that we had [indiscernible] around the efficiencies and productivity. And that was definitely part of the results for this quarter and will continue to be part of the guidance in the second half of the year. There were some headwinds associated with FX, et cetera. But for the most part, the benefit is associated with the ongoing initiatives around productivity and initiative. Similarly, we continue to see the [ fall-through ] not only from the higher guidance on the top line and obviously improved utilization in the second half, but continued also benefits from those efficiencies and productivity. And then -- sorry. And then you have the mix impact for the COVID versus -- first half versus second half. Obviously, the drop of the COVID-related sales to about $40 million to $50 million in the second half does create kind of some level of headwind to the overall margins."

Good afternoon. Thank you all for joining us. Today, we will review the second quarter 2021 financial results and provide an update on key business trends for Bio-Rad.
With me on the phone today are Norman Schwartz, our Chief Executive Officer; Ilan Daskal, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Andy Last, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Annette Tumolo, President of the Life Science Group; and Dara Wright, President of the Clinical Diagnostics Group.
Before we begin our review, I'd like to caution everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements about management's goals, plans, expectations, our future financial performance and other matters. These statements are based on assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Included in these forward-looking statements are commentary regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Bio-Rad's results, operations and steps Bio-Rad is taking in response to the pandemic. Our actual results may differ materially from these plans and expectations, and the impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and I encourage you to review our filings with the SEC where we discuss in detail the risk factors in our business. The company does not intend to update any forward-looking statements made during the call today.
Finally, our remarks today will include references to non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share, which are financial measures that are not defined under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Investors should review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP results contained in our earnings release.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Ilan Daskal, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer."

So I'd like to take a few minutes to review our current state of operations around the world. Overall, Bio-Rad has adapted well to the working constraints that COVID has imposed upon us, and we find ourselves able to respond and react well to everyday operational changes and demands. We continue to make solid progress on our core strategies, support of our customers and the safety of our employees.
With improvement in our end markets after the significant downturn a year ago, we're responding well to increased demand. But as with other manufacturers in life sciences, we are having to work hard to procure raw materials in some challenged areas, such as plastics and electronic components, as well as dealing with increased pressure on raw material costs. We also continue to experience higher than typical logistics costs as indicated in our Q1 call.
With the emergence of the COVID-19 delta variant, we are maintaining our work from home policies for the near term as we work on return to the workplace plans targeted for later this quarter, and we continue to monitor the global pandemic situation carefully given the fluidity the delta variance has created. Employee safety remains a principal focus, and we are pleased with our safety record and the growing vaccination status of our organization.
As we enter Q3, we expect the emergence of the delta variant will continue to create some challenges, and we are maintaining vigilance and flexibility as a result. Overall, we expect to see continued improvement in our end markets through the second half of the year as our customers continue to adapt. However, the new delta variant clearly introduces an element of uncertainty as we move forward.
Thank you for your attention, and I'll pass it back to Ilan now."

Now I would like to review the results of the second quarter. Net sales for the second quarter of 2021 were $715.9 million, which is a 33.4% increase on a reported basis versus $536.9 million in Q2 of 2020. On a currency-neutral basis, sa",1673,"Thank you, Andy. Now I would like to review the results of the second quarter. Net sales for the second quarter of 2021 were $715.9 million, which is a 33.4% increase on a reported basis versus $536.9 million in Q2 of 2020. On a currency-neutral basis, sales increased 27.5%. On a geographic basis, we experienced currency-neutral growth across all 3 regions.
Sales of our core products in the second quarter of last year were negatively impacted by the pandemic. And generally, we are seeing a continued gradual capacity improvement at both academic and diagnostic labs, which we estimate between 90% and 95% of pre-COVID levels. We estimate that the COVID-19-related sales were about $68 million in the quarter.
Sales of the Life Science group in the second quarter of 2021 were $334.2 million compared to $252.1 million in Q2 of 2020, which is a 32.6% increase on a reported basis and a 27.1% increase on a currency-neutral basis. The year-over-year sales growth in the second quarter was driven mainly by increases in western blotting, Droplet Digital PCR and qPCR products. We have seen strong growth in the biopharma market for our Droplet Digital PCR platform. We are also seeing a healthy uptake for ddPCR in wastewater solutions. Government funding towards public health labs is driving increased demand for our ddPCR products that offer automated solutions with high accuracy and sensitivity. Process Media, which can fluctuate on a quarterly basis, saw a year-over-year double-digit growth versus the same quarter last year. Excluding Process Media sales, the underlying Life Science business grew 29.1% on a currency-neutral basis versus Q2 of 2020. On a geographic basis, Life Science currency-neutral year-over-year sales grew across all regions.
Before moving on, I would like to highlight the broad legal settlement with 10x Genomics announced earlier this week. This settlement resolves the multiyear global litigation with 10x over outstanding issues in the field of single cell and includes a global cross-license agreement. In addition to past and future royalties, Bio-Rad received broad freedom to operate in the single-cell market and maintained exclusivity to our microwell single-cell IP. We estimate that the future royalty payments from this legal settlement could total $110 million to $140 million over the life of the agreement, which runs through the year 2030. This includes payments of $32 million in the third quarter for back royalties owed to Bio-Rad for the period from November 2018 through December 2020 as well as for settlement fees and interests.
Sales of the Clinical Diagnostics group in the second quarter were $380.2 million compared to $283.2 million in Q2 of 2020, which is a 34.3% increase on a reported basis and a 28% increase on a currency-neutral basis. During the second quarter, the diagnostics group posted double-digit growth across all of its product lines. The year-over-year growth was driven by a recovery of routine testing. Elective surgery recovery is still progressing although at a slower pace. On a geographic basis, the diagnostics group currency-neutral year-over-year sales grew across all regions. Our diagnostics group announced last month a partnership with Seegene, which is a global leader in multiplex molecular diagnostics. Bio-Rad will exclusively market the Seegene tests in the U.S., pending regulatory approvals. Seegene's diagnostic products have high sensitivity and specificity and are optimized to work with Bio-Rad's CFX Real-Time PCR Systems.
The reported gross margin for the second quarter of 2021 was 56.1% on a GAAP basis and compares to 54.6% in Q2 of 2020. Recall that the gross margin in Q2 of 2020 included an $8 million customs duty charge. And excluding that charge, the Q2 gross margin further improved this quarter as a result of our productivity and efficiency initiatives. However, as mentioned, we currently see increased pressure on raw material costs and higher logistics costs.
Amortization related to prior acquisitions recorded in cost of goods sold was $4.6 million and compares to $5 million in Q2 of 2020. SG&A expenses for Q2 of 2021 were $213.4 million or 29.8% of sales compared to $189.3 million or 35.3% in Q2 of 2020. Increases in SG&A expenses was mainly the result of employee-related performance compensation expense. Total amortization expense related to acquisitions recorded in SG&A for the quarter was $2.4 million versus $2.3 million in Q2 of 2020.
Research and development expense in Q2 was $63.4 million or 8.9% of sales compared to $52 million or 9.7% of sales in Q2 of 2020. Q2 operating income was $124.8 million or 17.4% of sales compared to $51.7 million or 9.6% of sales in Q2 of 2020.
Looking below the operating line, the change in fair market value of equity securities holdings added $1.031 billion of income to the reported results and is substantially related to the holdings of the shares of Sartorius AG. Also during the quarter, interest and other income resulted in net other income of $1.3 million primarily due to foreign exchange and compared to $10.7 million of income last year. Q2 of 2020 includes an $8.9 million dividend from Sartorius, which was declared in June and was paid in July. In 2021, the Sartorius dividend was declared in the first quarter.
The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2021 was 21% compared to 22.4% for the same period in 2020. The tax rate for both periods were driven by the large unrealized gain in equity securities. In addition, the second quarter of 2021 effective tax rate was lower also due to a lapse of statute of limitations of certain tax reserves. Reported net income for the second quarter was $914.1 million, and diluted earnings per share were $30.32. This is a decrease from last year and is related to changes in valuation of the Sartorius holdings.
Moving on to the non-GAAP results. Looking at the results on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded certain atypical and unique items that impacted both the gross and operating margins as well as other income. These items are detailed in the reconciliation table in the press release.
Looking at the non-GAAP results for the second quarter. In cost of goods sold, we have excluded $4.6 million of amortization of purchased intangibles and $1.2 million of restructuring-related expenses. These exclusions moved the gross margin for the second quarter of 2021 to a non-GAAP gross margin of 56.9% versus 55.5% in Q2 of 2020. Non-GAAP SG&A in the second quarter of 2021 was 29.2% versus 33.9% in Q2 of 2020. In SG&A, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded amortization of purchased intangibles of $2.4 million, legal-related expenses of $8.8 million and restructuring and acquisition-related benefits of $7 million.
Non-GAAP R&D expense in the second quarter of 2021 was 9.1% versus 9.8% in Q2 of 2020. In R&D, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded $2.1 million of restructuring benefits. The cumulative sum of these non-GAAP adjustments result in moving the quarterly operating margin from 17.4% on a GAAP basis to 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis. This non-GAAP operating margin compares to a non-GAAP operating margin in Q2 of 2020 of 11.8%.
We have also excluded certain items below the operating line, which are the increase in value of the Sartorius equity holdings of $1.031 billion and the $1.8 million loss associated with venture investments. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2021 was 21.5% compared to 23.8% for the same period in 2020. The lower rate in 2021 was driven by the geographic mix of earnings. And finally, non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2021 was $106.6 million or $3.54 diluted earnings per share compared to $48.3 million or $1.61 per share in Q2 of 2020.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Total cash and short-term investments at the end of Q2 were $1.167 billion compared to $1.025 billion at the end of Q1 of 2021. During the second quarter, we did not purchase any shares of our stock. For the second quarter of 2021, net cash generated from operating activities was $154.6 million, which compares to $92.1 million in Q2 of 2020. This increase mainly reflects higher operating profits. The adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2021 was 22.3% of sales. The adjusted EBITDA in Q2 of 2020 was 18.6% and excluding the Sartorius dividend was 16.9%. Net capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2021 were $23.4 million, and depreciation and amortization for the second quarter was $33.7 million.
Moving on to the guidance. Andy previously alluded to continued uncertainties surrounding the pandemic, which could create some challenges and we look -- sorry, as we look to the better half of this year. That being said, with customers continuing to adapt in this environment, we assume a gradual return to pre-pandemic activity and the more normalized business mix during the second half of 2021. We are now guiding non-GAAP currency-neutral revenue growth to be between 10% and 10.5% for 2021 versus our prior guidance of 5.5% to 6%. This updated outlook assumes the full year COVID-related sales to be between $200 million and $210 million, of which approximately $40 million to $50 million are projected for the second half of 2021.
Excluding COVID-related sales, the non-GAAP year-over-year currency-neutral sales growth in the second half is expected to be between 13% and 14%. This represents between 4.5% and 5.5% growth in the second half of 2021 over the first half of 2021. Full year non-GAAP gross margin is now projected to be between 57% and 57.5%. Full year non-GAAP operating margin is forecasted to be about 19%, which assumes higher operating expenses in the second half of 2021 versus the first half as we are anticipating continued gradual return to more normal activity levels. This guidance excludes any benefit related to the settlement with 10x Genomics. Our updated annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for 2021 is projected to be between 23% and 24%. Full year adjusted EBITDA margin is forecasted to be between 23% and 23.5%.

And that was definitely part of the results for this quarter and will continue to be part of the guidance in the second half of the year. There were some headwinds associated with FX, et cetera. But for the most part, the benefit is associated with the ongoing initiatives around productivity and initiative. Similarly, we continue to see the [ fall-through ] not only from the higher guidance on the top line and obviously improved utilization in the second half, but continued also benefits from those efficiencies and productivity. And then -- sorry. And then you have the mix impact for the COVID versus -- first half versus second half.

To start with, I'd like to take a moment to thank Annette Tumolo, our President of the Life Science Group for nearly 33 years of service at Bio-Rad as she plans to retire at the end of this year. Annette's efforts and leadership have contributed to significant growth for the Life Science Group and Bio-Rad, and the company has started a search for a successor, and we will provide an update in the coming months. 
Now I'd like to take a few minutes to review our current state of operations around the world. We're now entering the seventh consecutive quarter of operating within the COVID pandemic, and so I shall make my comments brief as we have now established an operating cadence with embedded employee safety practices. Our end markets continued to show improvement during Q3, with demand pickup in both life science and diagnostic markets in all regions. The supply chain constraints highlighted in our Q2 call, however, have persisted in particular, for supply and cost of plastic raw materials, electronic components and higher logistics costs. To date, we have been able to balance supply and demand through careful management. However, we see this supply constraint trends continuing through year-end and into 2022, and thus increasing the challenge of adequately meeting customer demand. 
As a result of the COVID-19 Delta variant, we recently pushed out our return to the workplace day for the U.S. into early November. During Q3, we introduced a mandatory vaccination requirement for all employees in the U.S. and are extremely pleased with the results of this decision. We are believing -- we believe we are maintaining our commitment to a safe workplace for all our employees. As we enter Q4, we expect COVID-related demand for our products to be sequentially lower. And overall, we believe the majority of our end markets are approaching close to normal operations, although we recognize that COVID will continue to create dynamic market challenges. 
So at this point, I'll turn it back to Ilan. Thank you."

Net sales for the third quarter of 2021 were $747 million, which is a 15.4% increase on a reported basis versus the $647.3 million in Q3 of 2020. On a currency-neutral basis, sales increased 13.8%. The third quarter sales include a $32 million settlement for back royalties from 10x. Excluding the debt royalties, the Q3 year-over-year currency-neutral revenue growth was 9%. 
On a geographic basis, we experienced strong currency-neutral growth in the Americas and in Asia, while growth in Europe declined slightly due to a tough year-over-year compare of COVID-related sales. We estimate that COVID-19-related sales were about $57 million in the quarter as we continue to benefit from spikes in demand in geographies where new outbreaks have occurred. 
Sales of the Life Science Group in the third quarter of 2021 were $373.5 million compared to $324 million in Q3 of 2020, which is a 15.3% increase on a reported basis and a 13.9% increase on a currency-neutral basis. Excluding the $32 million settlement for back royalties, the underlying Life Science business grew 4.1% on a currency-neutral basis versus Q3 of 2020. The year-over-year sales growth in the third quarter was driven mainly by increases in Droplet Digital PCR products and excluding COVID-related sales, our core qPCR business also experienced nice growthQ,driven by strong uptake of our newer generation CFX Opus platform. 
Process Media, which can fluctuate on a quarterly basis, saw strong year-over-year double-digit growth versus the same quarter last year. Excluding Process Media sales and the $32 million settlement for back royalties, the underlying Life Science business declined 2% on a currency-neutral basis versus Q3 of 2020 due to lower COVID-related sales. When also excluding COVID-related sales, Life Science year-over-year currency-neutral revenue growth was 21.8%. 
Overall, we have seen strong growth in the biopharma market for our Droplet Digital PCR platform. We also continue to see steady adoption of ddPCR in wastewater solutions, supported by government funding towards public health labs. On a geographic basis, Life Science currency-neutral year-over-year sales grew across the Americas and Asia but declined in Europe. When excluding COVID-related sales, European region revenue posted a double-digit increase from the year-ago period. 
Sales of the Clinical Diagnostics Group in the third quarter were $372.2 million compared to $322.2 million in Q3 of 2020, which is a 15.5% increase on a reported basis and a 13.7% increase on a currency-neutral basis. During the third quarter, the Diagnostics Group posted growth across all of its product lines. The year-over-year growth was driven by a recovery of routine testing, which appears to be approaching normal levels, with the exception of blood typing, which is progressing at a slower pace. On a geographic basis, the Diagnostics Group currency-neutral year-over-year sales grew double digits across all regions. 
The reported gross margin for the third quarter of 2021 was 58.6% on a GAAP basis and compares to 56.7% in Q3 of 2020. The Q3 2021 gross margin improvement was mainly driven by the settlement payments as well as our productivity and efficiency initiatives. Amortization related to prior acquisitions recorded in cost of goods sold was $4.7 million as compared to $4.8 million in Q3 of 2020. 
SG&A expenses for Q3 of 2021 were $216.2 million or 28.9% of sales compared to $198.2 million or 30.6% in Q3 of 2020. Increases in SG&A spend was mainly the result of employee-related expense. Total amortization expense related to acquisitions recorded in SG&A for the quarter was $2.4 million versus $2.3 million in Q3 of 2020. Research and development expense in Q3 was $64.5 million or 8.6% of sales compared to $59.5 million or 9.2% of sales in Q3 of 2020. Q3 operating income was $156.8 million or 21% of sales compared to $109.6 million or 16.9% of sales in Q3 of 2020. 
Looking below the operating line, the change in fair market value of equity securities holdings added $4.869 billion of income to the reported results and is substantially related to holdings of the shares of Sartorius AG. Also during the quarter, interest and other income resulted in a net expense of $3.2 million, primarily due to foreign exchange losses and compared to $5.5 million of expense last year. 
The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2021 was 21.8% compared to 21.9% for the same period in 2020. The tax rate for both periods were driven by the large unrealized gain in equity securities. Reported net income for the third quarter was $3,928 billion, and diluted earnings per share were $129.96. This is an increase from last year and is largely related to changes in valuation of the Sartorius holdings. 
Moving on to the non-GAAP results. Looking at the results on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded certain atypical and unique items that impacted both the gross and operating margin as well as other income. These items are detailed in the reconciliation table in the press release. Looking at the non-GAAP results for the third quarter, in sales, we have excluded $32 million related to 10x legal settlement. In cost of goods sold, we have excluded $4.7 million of amortization of purchased intangibles, $4.1 million in IP license costs associated with the debt royalty payment and a small restructuring cost. These exclusions moved the gross margin for the third quarter of 2021 to a non-GAAP gross margin of 57.9% versus 57.5% in Q3 of 2020. 
Non-GAAP SG&A in the third quarter of 2021 was 29.6% versus 29.4% in Q3 of 2020. In SG&A, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded amortization of purchased intangibles of $2.4 million, legal-related expenses of $2.3 million and a small restructuring and acquisition-related benefit. Non-GAAP R&D expense in the third quarter of 2021 was 9% versus 9.2% in Q3 of 2020. In R&D, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded a small restructuring cost. 
The cumulative sum of these non-GAAP adjustments result in moving the quarterly operating margin from 21% on a GAAP basis to 19.4% on a non-GAAP basis. This non-GAAP operating margin compares to a non-GAAP operating margin of 18.8% in Q3 of 2020. We have also excluded certain items below the operating line, which are the increase in value of the Sartorius equity holdings of $4.869 billion and about a $2 million loss associated with venture investments. 
The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2021 was 18% compared to 22.5% for the same period in 2020. The low rate in 2021 was driven by the geographic mix of earnings. In addition, the effective tax rate was lower as a result of an increase in compensation-related tax deductions. And finally, non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2021 was $112.2 million or $3.71 diluted earnings per share, and that compares to $90.3 million and $3 per share in Q3 of 2020. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Total cash and short-term investments at the end of Q3 were $1.343 billion compared to $1.167 billion at the end of Q2 of 2021. During the third quarter, we did not purchase any shares of our stock. For the third quarter of 2021, net cash generated from operating activities was $230.4 million, which compares to $135.7 million in Q3 of 2020. This increase mainly reflects higher operating profits. 
Following the end of the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Dropworks for approximately $125 million in cash.  Dropworks is developing a droplet-based digital PCR system that could provide a more cost-effective solution to streamline the digital PCR workflow for life science research and diagnostic applications. We see Dropworks as accelerating Bio-Rad's entry into the lower-end segment of the digital PCR business and allow for expansion in the $2.5 billion to $3 billion qPCR segment, thereby significantly increasing the opportunity for our ddPCR platforms. 
The adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2021 was 23.1% of sales. The adjusted EBITDA in Q3 of 2020 was 22.9%. Net capital expenditures for the third quarter of 2021 were $34.6 million, and depreciation and amortization for the third quarter was $33.7 million. 
Moving on to the guidance. Overall, we expect a continued trend to a more normalized growth rate. However, we are seeing increased supply chain constraints that creates an elevated level of uncertainty around timing of customer deliveries. We are now guiding full year 2021 non-GAAP currency-neutral revenue growth to be between 12% and 13% versus our prior guidance of 10% to 10.5%. This updated outlook reflects a wider revenue range due to the supply challenges, which we are experiencing. 
Full year COVID-related sales are now expected in the range of $240 million and $245 million versus our prior guidance of $200 million to $210 million. Full year non-GAAP gross margin is now projected to be between 57.5% and 57.8% versus prior guidance of 57% and 57.5%. Full year non-GAAP operating margin is forecasted to be about 19.5% versus prior guidance of 19%. Our updated guidance assumes higher operating expenses in Q4 as we continue to anticipate a gradual return to more normal activity levels. 
Our updated annual non-GAAP effective tax rate is projected to be between 21% and 22%. The lower rate versus our prior guidance is mainly due to an increase in compensation-related tax deductions. Full year adjusted EBITDA margin is now forecasted to be between 23.5% and 24% versus prior guidance of 23% and 23.5%. Lastly, with the uncertainties surrounding COVID, we are now planning to hold our Investor Day in February due to our preference to host an in-person event. 
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now open the line to take your questions. Operator?"

To start with, I'd like to take a moment to thank Annette Tumolo, our President of the Life Science Group for nearly 33 years of service at Bio-Rad as she plans to retire at the end of this year. Annette's efforts and leadership have contributed to significant growth for the Life Science Group and Bio-Rad, and the company has started a search for a successor, and we will provide an update in the coming months.  
Now I'd like to take a few minutes to review our current state of operations around the world. We're now entering the seventh consecutive quarter of operating within the COVID pandemic, and so I shall make my comments brief as we have now established an operating cadence with embedded employee safety practices. Our end markets continued to show improvement during Q3, with demand pickup in both life science and diagnostic markets in all regions. The supply chain constraints highlighted in our Q2 call, however, have persisted in particular, for supply and cost of plastic raw materials, electronic components and higher logistics costs. To date, we have been able to balance supply and demand through careful management. However, we see this supply constraint trends continuing through year-end and into 2022, and thus increasing the challenge of adequately meeting customer demand.  
As a result of the COVID-19 Delta variant, we recently pushed out our return to the workplace date for the U.S. into early November. During Q3, we introduced a mandatory vaccination requirement for all employees in the U.S. and are extremely pleased with the results of this decision. We are believing -- we believe we are maintaining our commitment to a safe workplace for all our employees. As we enter Q4, we expect COVID-related demand for our products to be sequentially lower. And overall, we believe the majority of our end markets are approaching close to normal operations, although we recognize that COVID will continue to create dynamic market challenges.  
So at this point, I'll turn it back to Ilan. Thank you."

Now I would like to review the results of the third quarter.

On a currency-neutral basis, sa",1609,"Thank you, Andy. Now I would like to review the results of the third quarter. Net sales for the third quarter of 2021 were $747 million, which is a 15.4% increase on a reported basis versus the $647.3 million in Q3 of 2020. On a currency-neutral basis, sales increased 13.8%. The third quarter sales include a $32 million settlement for back royalties from 10x. Excluding the back royalties, the Q3 year-over-year currency-neutral revenue growth was 9%.  
On a geographic basis, we experienced strong currency-neutral growth in the Americas and in Asia, while growth in Europe declined slightly due to a tough year-over-year compare of COVID-related sales. We estimate that COVID-19-related sales were about $57 million in the quarter as we continue to benefit from spikes in demand in geographies where new outbreaks have occurred.  
Sales of the Life Science Group in the third quarter of 2021 were $373.5 million compared to $324 million in Q3 of 2020, which is a 15.3% increase on a reported basis and a 13.9% increase on a currency-neutral basis. Excluding the $32 million settlement for back royalties, the underlying Life Science business grew 4.1% on a currency-neutral basis versus Q3 of 2020. The year-over-year sales growth in the third quarter was driven mainly by increases in Droplet Digital PCR products and excluding COVID-related sales, our core qPCR business also experienced nice growth driven by strong uptake of our newer generation CFX Opus platform.  
Process Media, which can fluctuate on a quarterly basis, saw strong year-over-year double-digit growth versus the same quarter last year. Excluding Process Media sales and the $32 million settlement for back royalties, the underlying Life Science business declined 2% on a currency-neutral basis versus Q3 of 2020 due to lower COVID-related sales. When also excluding COVID-related sales, Life Science year-over-year currency-neutral revenue growth was 21.8%.  
Overall, we have seen strong growth in the biopharma market for our Droplet Digital PCR platform. We also continue to see steady adoption of ddPCR in wastewater solutions, supported by government funding towards public health labs. On a geographic basis, Life Science currency-neutral year-over-year sales grew across the Americas and Asia but declined in Europe. When excluding COVID-related sales, European region revenue posted a double-digit increase from the year-ago period.  
Sales of the Clinical Diagnostics Group in the third quarter were $372.2 million compared to $322.2 million in Q3 of 2020, which is a 15.5% increase on a reported basis and a 13.7% increase on a currency-neutral basis. During the third quarter, the Diagnostics Group posted growth across all of its product lines. The year-over-year growth was driven by a recovery of routine testing, which appears to be approaching normal levels, with the exception of blood typing, which is progressing at a slower pace.  On a geographic basis, the Diagnostics Group currency-neutral year-over-year sales grew double digits across all regions.  
The reported gross margin for the third quarter of 2021 was 58.6% on a GAAP basis and compares to 56.7% in Q3 of 2020. The Q3 2021 gross margin improvement was mainly driven by the settlement payments as well as our productivity and efficiency initiatives. Amortization related to prior acquisitions recorded in cost of goods sold was $4.7 million as compared to $4.8 million in Q3 of 2020.  
SG&A expenses for Q3 of 2021 were $216.2 million or 28.9% of sales compared to $198.2 million or 30.6% in Q3 of 2020. Increases in SG&A spend was mainly the result of employee-related expense. Total amortization expense related to acquisitions recorded in SG&A for the quarter was $2.4 million versus $2.3 million in Q3 of 2020. Research and development expense in Q3 was $64.5 million or 8.6% of sales compared to $59.5 million or 9.2% of sales in Q3 of 2020.  Q3 operating income was $156.8 million or 21% of sales compared to $109.6 million or 16.9% of sales in Q3 of 2020.  
Looking below the operating line, the change in fair market value of equity securities holdings added $4.869 billion of income to the reported results and is substantially related to holdings of the shares of Sartorius AG. Also during the quarter, interest and other income resulted in a net expense of $3.2 million, primarily due to foreign exchange losses and compared to $5.5 million of expense last year.  
The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2021 was 21.8% compared to 21.9% for the same period in 2020. The tax rate for both periods were driven by the large unrealized gain in equity securities. Reported net income for the third quarter was $3.928 billion, and diluted earnings per share were $129.96. This is an increase from last year and is largely related to changes in valuation of the Sartorius holdings.  
Moving on to the non-GAAP results. Looking at the results on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded certain atypical and unique items that impacted both the gross and operating margin as well as other income. These items are detailed in the reconciliation table in the press release. Looking at the non-GAAP results for the third quarter, in sales, we have excluded $32 million related to 10x legal settlement. In cost of goods sold, we have excluded $4.7 million of amortization of purchased intangibles, $4.1 million in IP license costs associated with the debt royalty payment and a small restructuring cost. These exclusions moved the gross margin for the third quarter of 2021 to a non-GAAP gross margin of 57.9% versus 57.5% in Q3 of 2020.  
Non-GAAP SG&A in the third quarter of 2021 was 29.6% versus 29.4% in Q3 of 2020. In SG&A, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded amortization of purchased intangibles of $2.4 million, legal-related expenses of $2.3 million and a small restructuring and acquisition-related benefit. Non-GAAP R&D expense in the third quarter of 2021 was 9% versus 9.2% in Q3 of 2020. In R&D, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded a small restructuring cost.  
The cumulative sum of these non-GAAP adjustments result in moving the quarterly operating margin from 21% on a GAAP basis to 19.4% on a non-GAAP basis. This non-GAAP operating margin compares to a non-GAAP operating margin of 18.8% in Q3 of 2020. We have also excluded certain items below the operating line, which are the increase in value of the Sartorius equity holdings of $4.869 billion and about a $2 million loss associated with venture investments.  
The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2021 was 18% compared to 22.5% for the same period in 2020. The low rate in 2021 was driven by the geographic mix of earnings. In addition, the effective tax rate was lower as a result of an increase in compensation-related tax deductions. And finally, non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2021 was $112.2 million or $3.71 diluted earnings per share, and that compares to $90.3 million and $3 per share in Q3 of 2020.  
Moving on to the balance sheet. Total cash and short-term investments at the end of Q3 were $1.343 billion compared to $1.167 billion at the end of Q2 of 2021. During the third quarter, we did not purchase any shares of our stock. For the third quarter of 2021, net cash generated from operating activities was $230.4 million, which compares to $135.7 million in Q3 of 2020. This increase mainly reflects higher operating profits.  
Following the end of the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Dropworks for approximately $125 million in cash.  Dropworks is developing a droplet-based digital PCR system that could provide a more cost-effective solution to streamline the digital PCR workflow for life science research and diagnostic applications. We see Dropworks as accelerating Bio-Rad's entry into the lower-end segment of the digital PCR business and allow for expansion in the $2.5 billion to $3 billion qPCR segment, thereby significantly increasing the opportunity for our ddPCR platforms.  
The adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2021 was 23.1% of sales. The adjusted EBITDA in Q3 of 2020 was 22.9%. Net capital expenditures for the third quarter of 2021 were $34.6 million, and depreciation and amortization for the third quarter was $33.7 million.  
Moving on to the guidance. Overall, we expect a continued trend to a more normalized growth rate. However, we are seeing increased supply chain constraints that creates an elevated level of uncertainty around timing of customer deliveries. We are now guiding full year 2021 non-GAAP currency-neutral revenue growth to be between 12% and 13% versus our prior guidance of 10% to 10.5%. This updated outlook reflects a wider revenue range due to the supply challenges, which we are experiencing.  
Full year COVID-related sales are now expected in the range of $240 million and $245 million versus our prior guidance of $200 million to $210 million. Full year non-GAAP gross margin is now projected to be between 57.5% and 57.8% versus prior guidance of 57% and 57.5%. Full year non-GAAP operating margin is forecasted to be about 19.5% versus prior guidance of 19%. Our updated guidance assumes higher operating expenses in Q4 as we continue to anticipate a gradual return to more normal activity levels.  
Our updated annual non-GAAP effective tax rate is projected to be between 21% and 22%. The lower rate versus our prior guidance is mainly due to an increase in compensation-related tax deductions. Full year adjusted EBITDA margin is now forecasted to be between 23.5% and 24% versus prior guidance of 23% and 23.5%. Lastly, with the uncertainties surrounding COVID, we are now planning to hold our Investor Day in February due to our preference to host an in-person event.
