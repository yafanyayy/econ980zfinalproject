Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported another highly successful year for Abbott during what's been the single most disruptive health care event in our lifetimes. For the full year, we reported organic sale",1636,"Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported another highly successful year for Abbott during what's been the single most disruptive health care event in our lifetimes. For the full year, we reported organic sales growth of nearly 10% and ongoing earnings per share of $3.65, which reflects double-digit growth and is at the upper end of our guidance range we set last January when we were expecting a normal economy. Performance like this after the pandemic struck is a real achievement and demonstrates the strength of our diversified business model. 
The normal times, it maximizes our growth opportunities and during the pandemic, it's been tested by a global crisis and proven to be highly resilient. It should come as no surprise that our performance was led by our Diagnostics business. COVID-19 dominated the year for us and the world, and our primary response came in the form of diagnostic tests to identify the virus. In total, we delivered more than 400 million COVID tests since the start of the pandemic, including more than 300 million tests in the fourth quarter alone. 
But as we've discussed before, the year was not all Diagnostics and COVID. Our more consumer-facing businesses, Nutrition, Diabetes Care and Established Pharmaceuticals all contribute growth for the year, and we continue to launch an impressive stream of innovations across our businesses. And I'll touch on some of these new products in more detail in just a moment. 
We exited 2020 with tremendous momentum, including total sales growth of more than 28% and ongoing earnings per share growth of more than 50% in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to 2021. We're forecasting another year of top-tier performance. As we announced this morning, we forecast ongoing earnings per share of at least $5 in 2021, reflecting growth of more than 35% compared to last year. And because we're building on top of our strong 2020 performance, our forecasted 2021 earnings per share is more than 50% higher than our pre-pandemic EPS in 2019, which is highly unique and differentiated in this environment. 
I'll now provide more details on our 2020 results before turning over the call to Bob. And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased around 4.5% for both the fourth quarter and full year. 
Strong growth of Ensure, our market-leading complete and balanced nutrition brand and Glucerna, our leading diabetes nutrition brand, led to double-digit growth in Adult Nutrition for both the quarter and full year. In Pediatric Nutrition, U.S. sales growth of more than 5% last year was led by increased market share of Similac, our market-leading infant formula brand. International Pediatric Nutrition sales continued to be impacted by challenging market conditions in Greater China. 
During the past year, we continue to expand our Nutrition portfolio with several new product and line extensions, including the continued rollout of infant formula products across our Similac brand family that contain human oligosaccharide or HMO, which supports a healthy immune system; global expansion of our PediaSure, Glucerna and Ensure brands, including the continued rollout of ensure high-protein products; and the launch of 4 new Pedialyte rehydration products: Pedialyte Zero Sugar, Sport, Organic and Immune Support. For 2021, we're forecasting similar sales growth for our global Nutrition business and a continued strong cadence of new product introductions. 
Turning to Medical Devices, where sales were relatively flat in the fourth quarter. Strong double-digit growth in Diabetes Care was offset by lower sales in our Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation businesses due to challenging conditions as COVID case rates surge in certain geographies towards the end of the quarter. As we saw throughout last summer and fall, we expect procedure volumes to improve in these businesses as COVID case rates subside. 
In Diabetes Care, sales grew nearly 30% for the fourth quarter and full year, led by FreeStyle Libre, our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring system. In the U.S., Libre sales grew 50% last year. And outside the U.S., Libre sales grew 40%, surpassing $2 billion of international sales for the full year 2020. 
This past year was possibly our most productive ever in terms of new product approvals and launches across our Medical Device portfolio. Let me touch on a handful. 
First, the approval of MitraClip Gen 4, the latest generation of our market-leading system to repair a leaky mitral heart valve. Just last week in the U.S., Medicare expanded reimbursement coverage for MitraClip, which significantly expands the eligible patient population that can benefit from this life-changing technology; CE Mark of 10 Tendyne, a first-of-its-kind, minimally invasive device to replace a faulty mitral valve; and the CE Mark of TriClip, our minimally invasive clip technology to repair a leaky tricuspid heart valve. Long considered the forgotten valve, TriClip brings an important new solution to patients that have previously had very few treatment options. 
Abbott now offers minimally invasive device therapies for 3 valves in the heart: the aortic, the mitral and the tricuspid valves. We also launched 2 cardiac rhythm defibrillation products under our Gallant brand that include Bluetooth capabilities to align with our strategy in remote monitoring and digitally connected care. 
Also saw the approval of En Site X, our next-generation 3D cardiac mapping technology; and U.S. approval of FreeStyle Libre 2 and CE Mark for Libre 3, the latest generations of our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring systems; and CE Mark of Libre Sense Glucose Sport, the first product in our strategy to expand use of our wearable biosensor technology into mass-market opportunities beyond diabetes. As you can see, it was a highly productive year for our pipeline, and quite frankly, there's even more I could highlight. 
In 2021, we're forecasting continued strong double-digit growth in our Diabetes Care business, led by FreeStyle Libre and steady improvements in our Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation businesses, fueled by the continued business recovery, the society works its way through COVID-19 and on the strength of our recent and upcoming new product launches. 
Moving to Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD, where sales increased 3.5% in the fourth quarter, reflecting sequential improvement versus the prior quarter. Despite COVID, EPD sales increased 2% overall in 2020, demonstrating the resilience of our business model even in this challenging environment. Growth this past year was led by sales in India, Russia, China and Brazil. 
During the year, EPD continued to strengthen its portfolio with more than 50 new product launches across our key emerging markets. As we've discussed before, new product introductions in EPD are more incremental in nature, and the steady cadence of portfolio expansion and refreshment we're achieving is an important element of our sustainable growth strategy. We forecast demand and growth rate improvements in EPD during 2021 and as well as a continued steady cadence of new product introductions that will contribute to growth. 
And I'll wrap up with our Diagnostic business, where sales grew nearly 110% in the quarter, driven by $2.4 billion of COVID testing-related sales. We realized very early that a variety of different testing solutions would be required to tackle the pandemic. 
With that understanding, starting last March, we developed and launched an entire portfolio of tests to target the virus. The biggest contribution in the fourth quarter came from our rapid lateral flow test to detect the virus, which includes BinaxNOW in the U.S. and Panbio internationally. These are highly portable, reliable and affordable tests and in just 50 minutes can detect if someone is infectious without the use of an instrument, which means the test can be performed in virtually any setting, such as physician office, pharmacies, urgent care centers, workplace settings and even at home. 
As part of our pandemic response efforts, we also developed and launched a digital solution that pairs with these tests called NaVICA, which allows people to receive and display test results on their mobile devices. But our efforts didn't stop at developing these tests. We also ramped up manufacturing capacity on a massive scale and now producing more than 100 million of these 2 tests combined per month. 
While our COVID testing efforts have clearly received a lot of attention, we've also remained focused on the launch and rollout of Alinity, our suite of innovative diagnostic instruments. We continue to retain existing businesses and capture share at strong rates. And we continue to build on our test menus for these instruments. 
Last year, we initiated the U.S. launch of Alinity m for molecular testing. This launch included a COVID test, which helped jump-start demand for this innovative, highly automated and differentiated molecular testing platform. 
And earlier this month, we announced U.S. FDA clearance for the first rapid handheld blood test for concussions. This test measures certain biomarkers found in blood after a head trauma event and produce the result within 15 minutes after a plasma sample is inserted in our i-STAT Alinity handheld device. 
Building on this initial clearance, we're also working on a whole blood point-of-care test under FDA breakthrough designation. And our vision is to develop a 15-minute portable test that can be used in any settings where people might experience head injuries that require quick evaluation. 
So in summary, despite the challenging environment, we achieved the upper end of the EPS range we set last January before anyone knew the extent of the COVID pandemic, demonstrating the strength, resilience of our diversified business model and our superior execution. Our new product pipeline continues to be incredibly productive, delivering groundbreaking innovations and a steady cadence of important new products, with more on the horizon. 
We continue to lead in the area of diagnostic testing for COVID, which is helping to fight the virus, and accelerating our long-term decentralized testing strategy. And we're forecasting more than 35% adjusted EPS growth in 2021, which is truly unique in this environment. 
I'll now turn over the call to Bob. Bob?"

As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. 
Turning to our results. Sales for the fourth quarter increased 28.4%, which was led by strong performance in Nutrition and Diabetes Care, along with global COVID testing-related sales of $2.4 billion in the quarter. Foreign exchange had a favorable impact of 0.3% on sales, which was somewhat favorable compared to expectations had exchange rates held steady since the time of our earnings call in October. Reported sales increased 28.7% in the quarter. 
Regarding other aspects of the P&L. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.5% of sales. R&D investment was 6% of sales, and SG&A expense was 23.5% of sales. Our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate of 14.1% reflects the adjustment required to align our tax expense with our revised full year effective tax rate of 15%. This is somewhat lower than the estimate we provided in October due to a shift in the mix of our geographic and business income. 
Turning to our outlook for the full year 2021. Today, we issued guidance for full year adjusted earnings per share of at least $5. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a favorable impact of approximately 3.5% on our reported sales, which includes an expected favorable impact of approximately 3% on our first quarter reported sales. We forecast full year net interest expense of around $515 million, nonoperating income of around $230 million and a full year adjusted tax rate of 15%. 
With that, we'll now open the call for questions."

And specifically, I guess the way I'd ask the question is, I'm sure investors would love some perspective on how COVID testing impacts that guidance, how you're thinking about the base business. And maybe most importantly, given how much higher $5 is compared to expectations, I'm sure investors would love to hear your early thoughts on whether or not Abbott can grow at its sort of traditional rate off of that $5 number next year.

I guess we've been looking at 2021 for several months right now. I think one of the things as we're going into it is that we knew, I mean, a lot of companies were going to be forecasting double-digit growth goin",930,"Sure. Bob, you hit on all the points there. I guess we've been looking at 2021 for several months right now. I think one of the things as we're going into it is that we knew, I mean, a lot of companies were going to be forecasting double-digit growth going into 2021, a lot of that probably based on comps, where we saw a decrease in EPS. And that was -- that's not the case for Abbott. We're not coming out of a hole. And as I said in my remarks, the $5 -- the at least $5 target for 2021, it's about 50% higher than where we were in 2019. 
And what I can say is that we are, Bob and myself, as we manage the business, especially over these last couple of months and going into this year, we've been looking at 2-year CAGRs across our businesses. And then -- I think that's the right way to look at it is to kind of look at what happened in 2020. And it's easy for some of the businesses to come up and post double-digit kind of growth for us. So we're really looking on a 2-year CAGR basis. 
The points that you touched on are all the points that we've looked at, and we've been modeling several different scenarios. So I'll touch on those because they're all elements of how how we build to our at least $5. First of all, obviously, COVID testing it's been a big driver for us, and it will continue to be a big driver. I expect testing demand is still going to remain high even as the vaccines roll out. I don't think we've even seen testing demand peak yet. 
So we built a lot of capacity, and we've talked about that over the last year, the capacity that we built. But we didn't put it all in. We didn't put it all in into that $5. So -- but we don't all see it going away either. But there's enough capacity there -- testing capacity, sufficient testing capacity for us to be able to meet this kind of growing demand right now. 
The other part of our forecast here, without a doubt, is looking at our base business and the recovery of our base business, specifically the ones that were hit probably more heavily by the COVID, which was some of our device businesses and our routine testing and routine lab testing. These are important procedures and life-saving procedures. They're important routine tests to do. So you can't just keep pushing them out indefinitely. And what we saw in Q3 of last year as those rates -- hospitalization rates start to come down, we started to see the pickup of our procedures and of our core testing. And we actually saw growth in several months in Q3 and going into Q4. And obviously, that got impacted probably around Thanksgiving. 
So we've seen that these can recover, and we do have that modeled in into that $5, which is a recovery of these businesses at a similar rate of what we saw in Q3 and summer in the fall. 
I'd say the third kind of key element in there is our consumer businesses that probably weren't as impacted and did pretty well during the pandemic. We expect those businesses to either continue their trajectory or get better. I mean I think Nutrition had a really great year last year. I expect them to have a very similar year this year with a lot of new product launches. EPD should get sequentially better. We saw that in Q4. Early indications in January show that recovery continuing. 
And quite frankly, Libre, I expect to do better with all the innovation and investment we're making there. So those businesses will do well. 
And then the fourth element that we've modeled a lot is spending and ability to reinvest in the businesses and areas that we thought that we could do with more investment, whether it's SG&A, and more specifically in R&D, and accelerate some of our programs. I think you saw some of that in our Q4 results, where we beat consensus while at the same time, investing more in R&D and SG&A. 
So we looked at these 4 elements here, Bob, and we modeled it variety of different ways and just feel really good that this was a good floor, a good starting point at $5. Quite frankly, if anything, we could have significant upside over here. And it's just really going to depend a little bit on how we think about COVID testing going forward. 
So I kind of saw the $5 here as, okay, it's a 37% increase versus 2020, which grew 13%. And we've got probable upside to that, while at the same time, an opportunity to invest in the business, invest in SG&A, more specifically in R&D. We've got a leading COVID test portfolio with a variety of different tests and capacity that we haven't dialed all in, quite frankly, if I had put all that capacity, and I think maybe you would have a little bit of time believing that, but it's there. 
And I think we've got an exciting base business like -- like you'd mentioned here that is poised for recovery. I mean we've got great portfolios, real strong brands, rich pipelines, strong leadership position. So I think the $5 here was definitely a good starting point, factoring all those elements in here, and we'll be able to kind of build from there as the year progresses."

It's a little premature to just skip across all the way to 2022. But we have -- but listen, when -- we didn't do 2021 in isolation. So yes, we looked at 2022 and looked at all those different scenarios that I talked about. So I can probably give you",511,"Sure. It's a little premature to just skip across all the way to 2022. But we have -- but listen, when -- we didn't do 2021 in isolation. So yes, we looked at 2022 and looked at all those different scenarios that I talked about. So I can probably give you some general comments over here. I mean I think we're forecasting a lot of growth this year, and we're going to be looking to build on it. 
Prior to the pandemic, The Street consensus for 2023 EPS was just under $5. So we're targeting that EPS, this level this year. So in essence, we've we've pulled forward at least 2 full years of EPS growth. And our mindset here, Bob, is going to be that we're going to maintain that pull-forward indefinitely. We always start our process with a double-digit target every year. That's been our identity. And I have no intention of changing that identity. 
Of course, there's a couple of factors here that we need to contemplate. But even looking at those factors, we feel good that we've got the different elements here to be able to deliver on that double digit. One of those is obviously COVID and COVID testing. And even if COVID testing starts to mature a little bit in 2022, we believe there's a significant portion that's still very sustainable. 
Can we predict it perfectly today? No, I can't, not to the level that you're accustomed to get from us. But I also think that the ability to do testing in a decentralized manner -- people talk a lot about how the pandemic has accelerated digital transformation in businesses, accelerated transformation in the business models. The pandemic has accelerated our decentralized testing strategy. And I think the -- I think I talked about this in the last call. I think a lot of the testing channels that we're building here that have emerged, I don't see them going away. 
On top of that, we -- as I said, we've got investment and investment spending into SG&A, but more specifically into R&D. We believe R&D is the more sustainable spend. It's the spend that allows us to sustain our top line growth rate. So I would expect that these investments that we've made in Q4 and definitely into 2021 that, that will have an impact on our base business growth rate. We've always talked about our base business being sustainable at 7 to 8, and I would expect these investments to be able to accelerate on that. 
And I guess the third part to that question of yours about confidence on delivering double digits in 2022 is we've got a great balance sheet, and we've got strong financial health and a lot of strategic flexibility there. So I lay all of these elements out here: sustained COVID testing, the investment in the business and the strong balance sheet, just gives me confidence that even with all these different models here that we'll be able to kind of continue to deliver that identity of double-digit growth."

So let me talk about kind of numbers and ranges here then, and then I'll spend time talk a little bit about sustainability of the testing. As I said, I don't see the demand just kind of dropping off even with the vaccine rollout. We achieved $2.4 bi",828,"Sure. So let me talk about kind of numbers and ranges here then, and then I'll spend time talk a little bit about sustainability of the testing. As I said, I don't see the demand just kind of dropping off even with the vaccine rollout. We achieved $2.4 billion in Q4. So if you annualize that, it'll go -- it will annualize for around $10 billion. So I can expect probably Q1 is going to be at that range of about $2.5 billion or so. 
And if you'd say, ""Okay. What does the full year range look like?"" Probably can't go beyond Q1 in terms of exactly how it's going to look like, but you can be in that $6.5 billion to $7 billion range, I would think. But we've got, as I said, plenty of capacity to go above that. So that's probably what's incorporated here, Matt, in the $5. 
But I think the big point here is the sustainability of this. And to your question there, I think a good portion is sustainable. I think a substantial portion is sustainable, which is why we were a first mover and a leader here. We started with with our lab-based systems. Those were the probably the obvious part in the strategy. Since we knew we had a lot of capital equipment out in the labs, we started with that strategy to take advantage of the systems out there. And you saw that rollout happen. 
But we also knew that in a pandemic, you were going to need to add on top of that testing infrastructure. You're going to have to add faster testing, and testing could be done at a much significant scale and that was more affordable, which is why we developed those 2 lateral flow tests. There's been a lot of visibility to BinaxNOW here in the U.S. 
We haven't talked a lot about Panbio. But Panbio uses the same technology, the same kind of antibodies. And we've got a whole supply chain that's been built outside of the United States that supplies all of the markets that we're supporting with Panbio. So both those products, they've been the bulk of our sales. We saw that in Q4. There's a lot of capacity that we've built around them, and that would continue to build around them. 
And the clinical utility of them is really strong. I mean they've been -- a lot of studies are showing their reliability here at finding people that are infectious. And I think that's a key distinction here is your ability to use these tests in a way for -- being able to find those people that are infectious and not necessarily those that were infectious and that might have some remnants of DNA of the virus in their system. So I think it's sustainable. 
And I think you need to take 2 kind of views here on that, at least this is how we're looking at it. First of all, we need to think globally about this. Sometimes, we get very focused on the U.S. and what's going on in here in the U.S., but you've got 8 billion-plus people around the world. You've got a variety of different countries that are experiencing different cycles in the disease, different cycles in their vaccination strategies. So once you really take a bigger view here, this is not going to be something that will just be done in the next couple of quarters here, if you take a real global perspective. 
And the second thing that I think is just reframing the testing. I think we think about the sustainability of testing when we think about Q2 and Q3 of last year. Long lines, not enough volume, long turnaround times, $150, $200 tests. That might be not sustainable -- not as sustainable. But if you position yourself into a 2021, 2022 world where you now have fast, easier, much more scalable test, digital tests that are priced more accessibility and affordability, I think that's the sustained kind of business here that we see. 
So when you think about that maturing of the COVID testing market, we kind of see PCR kind of maturing first, and then we see the rapid part of the business being sustained. And listen, we've built a lot of capacity, as I said. It's probably $12 million, $13 million, $14 billion of capacity that we built in there. We haven't put it all in, but it's there. 
And then the other part that I talked about was just the sustainability of [indiscernible] '22 and into 2023 as we've accelerated our point-of-care testing strategy. And everything we're doing in fighting the virus has not only a direct impact of helping reopen the economy, et cetera, but it's also seeding the market. And it's building these new testing channels. We've got testing going on at airports, hotels, urgent care, retail, universities, et cetera. So we believe that's pretty sustainable, too."

So the manufacturing, the regulatory, the R&D, and more importantly, the commercial infrastructure to be able to look across the world and support governments, workplaces, et cetera, on rolling out antigen testing internationally. So I think it's done very well. 
We've been able to kind of leverage some of the kind of joint development of Binax and Panbio. But the demand that we're seeing internationally, I would characterize also as probably just starting. It hasn't even peaked either. So I think we've got a lot of opportunity with Panbio internationally, too. And I think the teams have done a really good job there."

Yes, there's oppo",1000,"Sure. I'll probably say the following. A lot of it's going towards R&D, Robbie. And as I said, I think that's the more sustainable spend. It's the one that allows us to build more sustainability in our top line and building R&D programs. Yes, there's opportunity to accelerate SG&A and put some of that cash to use in SG&A. And there are some businesses that could definitely benefit with more SG&A. And there's a pretty strong return as we put those in there, whether it's Libre or Nutrition. But a lot of the focus of this reinvestment here is going into R&D. 
And quite frankly, I think our pipeline has been highly productive and maybe a little bit underappreciated, I think. There's a lot of focus that goes into kind of key 3 products that you guys like to write about them as the big 3, and they get a lot of attention. And quite frankly, they should, whether it's Libre, MitraClip and Alinity. They're large multibillion-dollar segments that are underpenetrated. And we've been making clear and intentional investments in those businesses. 
I'm not going to spend a lot of time going through those, but you kind of know them, right? So Libre with Libre 3. We've got Libre 4 in development. We've been making investments in new applications for the Libre platform outside of diabetes. And MitraClip, obviously, we've got this opportunity with the CMS reimbursement. We have a fifth generation MitraClip that's also in development. And we're investing in a significant amount of clinical trials here to expand expand the market for us, and we'll continue to do that. 
Probably the one I'm more excited about here is the moderate risk for DMR that we've announced also. And then Alinity, you also know the story. I mean we got 6 new systems where we're increasing the menu and expanding that geographically. So that has a lot of attention, continues to have a lot of attention, and we do resource those opportunities because they're that big. But I think it's misleading here to think that that's the sum of our innovation strategy. We're so much more than that. 
On the EPD and the Nutrition side, we're going to continue to invest in line extensions and portfolio refreshment. This is the model that we know drive the returns we need for these businesses. And I think the team has now hit their stride in terms of how to do this and how to effectively roll this out with local portfolios. EPDs rolled out over 50 products. I expect that to continue. Nutrition has done over 20, and I expect that to continue also. 
In Diagnostics, outside of Alinity, outside of COVID, now we've been investing a lot in expanding our rapid testing portfolio. I've been talking about this, about the opportunity we have to take advantage of these new channels that we've built and increase the penetration with different assays. So whether it's going beyond COVID or flu with RSV, strep. We've got a sexually transmitted disease platform for ID NOW, which we're excited about also, which I think has got a great opportunity. 
And then this rapid concussion test, Robbie, I think is a great opportunity for us. Probably the biggest opportunity we have is if -- once we work through to have a whole blood test, I can envision here an opportunity across the 25,000 high schools in the U.S., the 5,000 colleges, all the sporting leagues, and that's going to take us another 1.5 years or a bit or so to get there, but I think it's a great opportunity. 
And then the device portfolio is going to continue to get a lot of investment the way we have. Obviously, Tendyne and Cephea, we want to be a leader in mitral. We've launched Tendyne in Europe. We're funding our Cephea program so that we can have a transfemoral/transseptal program for the replacement of the mitral valve. I'm very pleased with the progress we've seen on Tendyne. 
TriClip, I've talked about the opportunity with Triclip. It's not going to be as large as mitral, but it will be 30%, 35% the size of the mitral market. And we're still in the early innings here of development -- of clinical evidence development, and we're going to be leading there. 
We've made investments in increasing the competitiveness of our CRM portfolio. We've just started to roll out now more global basis, our new 2 -- our 2 new defibrillator products under the Gallant. And we've been working hard at our leadless program and making the investments in the leadless program so that not only can we come out with a single-chamber product and then be able to upgrade it to a dual-chamber product. 
I like the program. I like what we've done with it. I think we have a value proposition -- a differentiated value proposition versus the competition. 
CardioMEMS is another study that we've been funding, and there's probably going to be required some build-out of the commercial infrastructure to be able to support the rollout of that product. If you think about the opportunity we have with CardioMEMS, even at a 10% to 15% penetration on that population, you're looking at a $1 billion opportunity for us. So that is obviously getting a lot of attention. 
And then I'm very excited to come into the U.S. with the LAA and the TAVR product sometime this year. I think these are great opportunities. I like the product that we have, especially on the LAA side with Amulet. It does very well in Europe. And we'll be funding those programs, too. 
So it's more than the big 3. There's a lot here. And quite frankly, Bob and I are already going to the businesses and say, ""Okay. What was below the line that you didn't show us in the planning process?"" and ""Can we get going on those, too?"" So that's where a lot of the investment goes into R&D."

As I said in the previous question, though, David, I mean we've got a lot of organic opportunities to invest in. And I like those organic opportunities. So they obviously do get a lot of our attention right now. 
But if you think about M&A, yes, it's got to be a good fit strategically, and it's got to align with our growth orientation here. I mean I'm not going to look at something that's going to dilute our top line growth rate, and obviously, is able to generate a return for our shareholders. So there's a lot of activity. There's a lot of, I'd say, high valuations right now so. 
But to the extent that we do something this year, it would be more like tuck-in in nature to be able to kind of augment some of these portfolios. So that's probably the better way to put it to you."

But it's still top of our priorities here because it's such a huge opportunity for us. We had a real strong quarter in Q4. We exited with a lot of momentum going into this year, especially in the U.S. I think global sales were $0.75 billion, up 35%. 
And I expect the absolute dollar amount to get bigger. And usually when that happens, we think, well, gee, law of big numbers, right, the percentages are going to go down. And I don't think so. I think that we're going to see continuing growth rate expansion on our Libre business here. So I kind of look at Libre as a 2021 growth that should start at 40% and go from there. 
A lot of focus on the U.S. on the rollout -- on Libre 2 rollout. We're seeing a lot of the trend shifts, whether it's revenue, whether it's new users. I think the superior accuracy messaging here is definitely coming through, and it's got all the other advantages of our value proposition. 
I think one of the good things about the pharmacy channel is that there's a lot of available data. There's a lot of available third-party audited data. And when I do the reviews with the team, we spend a lot of time looking at them. And I tell me you can't hide behind these -- you can't hide when we're in the pharmacy, like all this data is available. 
And I think it's done really well in the U.S. Obviously, I want it to do better, but I can't look at it and not be objective that there's obviously been a trend shift here, whether it's NBRxs, TRxs, refill rates, et cetera. One of them that I'm extremely happy to see is the Rx fulfillment rate. So when a consumer goes to the pharmacy with a prescription, swipes the card, do they get that prescription filled, right? And there's factors that drive somebody to not get it filled. It's usually a copay. 
And what we've seen with the Libre Rx fulfillment rate is at about 9 out of 10 get filled. And you compare that to our competitor at about 6 out of 10, I think the value proposition here is really strong, meaning that we can invest in DTC advertising. We can invest more in this platform. And we're seeing the value proposition come through as it relates to Rx fulfillment rates. 
So I'd say the focus on U.S. is. Now to your question on L3, we're already here. We've been working through, say, the reimbursement contracting process. It probably got delayed a little bit in Q4 in terms of our expectations, given some of the focus of a lot of the international countries focusing on COVID. But we're all ready. Manufacturing is ready. In fact, between Libre 2 and Libre 3, we've got hundreds of millions of sensors here of capacity. And I think that ties a little bit to the expectation that we have for this segment, which is you've got close to 80 million people that could benefit from this target, which is why we took a very different approach in our strategy, a much mass-market approach that -- develop a product that's consumer-friendly, intuitive, make sure that it can provide measurable benefits and price it for mass adoption. And that's working out very well. 
So we should see a Libre 3 launch international in Q1. And then in the U.S., we'll issue a release when we get approval."

So on the device side, as I said in the earlier comments here, Larry, I think we're going to -- we're looking at what we saw in Q3 and correlating those -- that drop in rates. Not an absolute drop, so not trying to mirror the absolute number of hospitalizations, but at least the rate of decline of hospitalizations and tying it into the increase in the procedures. A lot of these procedures are  life-saving. Some of them are electives, some of them are life-saving. And we're hearing a lot of our accounts in the U.S. and international are really wanting to kind of push stronger and a sense here that with a vaccine, they feel more confident to be able to build it. 
So I think you'll see probably the biggest comp issue, I'd say, is probably Q2. I mean I think that's when we saw the big drop. Q1 was probably more towards the end of the quarter, the last 2 weeks of March. So I kind of see the more normalization growth rates. So that -- those kind of growth rates that you saw from our device business, excluding diabetes, to look more like that in -- starting in Q3.

We see more normalization kind of coming through our manufacturing plants as well as that volume kind of normalizes.

So on EPD, yes, we did see a nice recovery. I mean when we looked at how the impact of COVID progressed geographically, we saw it, for some reason, kind of trail a little bit kind of the developed markets, whether it was Europe and the U.S. We really started to feel the impact on our EPD business, which is, as you know, mostly emerging markets, started to see it coming out of Q2 and then big in Q3 as a lot of those countries kind of shut down. And the way the model works is you still need a prescription and you need your physician or you need to go to your hospital to get that prescription. 
So when we looked at Q4, we're actually not surprised, but it was good to see that it came in a little bit higher than what we had expected because we were trying to model it very similar to what we saw in some of the other businesses. And it came back faster. 
At the same time, there's -- it's not a nice kind of linear forecast in these markets. And there's -- it does tend to bounce up around. I mean we had a 9%, 10% growth in Q1. There was some stocking effect there in kind of February and March in some of the markets, so we'll have a comp over there. But what I -- what we look at is we're looking at the IMS demand market progression in all these markets that we're competing in. 
And we're seeing a nice recovery. So I expect that just to sequentially kind of get better, and I guess similar to the comment on devices, get back to that high single-digit growth rate towards second half. 
Oh, and then you also had a question on change of care. I mean I think a lot has happened, right? And we've tried to focus on the areas that we feel that we can contribute and benefit. One of them I've talked about is this decentralization of testing and how the pandemic has accelerated that decentralization for us. We believed in it. We believe that we could drive it and create a whole new testing channel when we did the Alere acquisition. And this has kind of brought it forward about -- probably about 2 years in terms of where we are today versus where we thought we were going to be. 
So that's an important part for us. Being able to have access to fast, affordable and digitally connected testing is something that I think is going to be here and here to stay. Whether it's a COVID test or other tests, I think that is a change a little bit in the delivery, at least on the diagnostic side. 
And then the other side that I'd say is one that we've been working on for quite some is the connectivity of our devices and the intersection of digital and health care and how those devices are being connected. You've seen what we've done across all of our portfolio on devices, and we'll continue to position our products in such a way where we can develop them and take advantage of that. 
For Neuromodulation, we've just announced here a very interesting platform, which I think is going to have a significant impact on how that business and business model works with a much more connected care platform, where patients get to report their outcomes and eventually get to remote programming, which is a huge change in that business model. 
So I'd say the COVID testing, accelerating decentralization of testing and connected care are probably the 2 pandemic-driven changes that we're focusing on taking advantage of."

I guess on the modeling thing, listen, you could say there could be a dropoff, but you could say there could be an increase or it could stay. So I think the modeling piece here is a little bit difficult. I think we're going to have a lot more understanding as we get towards the summer. But I think, at least for the first half, you've got -- we've got sufficient capacity here to kind of explore the demand that exists both in the U.S. and globally. 
So yes, I'm not sure right now that you can kind of easily kind of just put that model down like that, but it's just too soon. 
Regarding your question on mutations and the impact there. A lot of the mutations here -- I don't want to get too wonky here. But we've been looking at this, Vijay, since the beginning. We have a group of, we call them the virus hunters. They're constantly looking and studying and getting their hands on samples to be able to kind of, not only test our existing products but even to develop new ones. And I'd say, right now, the mutations are happening. The ones that you've referenced, the South African one and the U.K. one, those are happening on what we would call the spike protein or what we call the S protein. The rapid antigen test that we have are actually targeting the NeoClasp protein, what we call the N protein. 
So -- and silico analysis says no impact. The U.K. NIH kind of did a study on Panbio and found the U.K. variant to not influence the sensitivity of the Panbio, but we're also collecting as many samples as we can from U.K., South Africa, Brazil, et cetera, and making sure that we're constantly studying that to ensure that there's no change to the sensitivity of the test that we've developed. 
On the molecular side, whether it's ID NOW -- ID NOW looks at a different gene, the RpDp genes. It's completely different thing, and similar thing also with the PCR. So I think those are, right now, from everything we know, wouldn't be impacted by the mutations. We're more focused on the antigen with the mutations on those protein sequences. So I feel good about that right now. But obviously, we're constantly vigilant here. 
So let me just close here. I'd say we had a real strong 2020, very strong performance, almost 10% top line growth, 13% EPS. We're forecasting 2021 here at least $5. And like I said, I think we've got opportunity to have upside to that. But still already at $5, it's already at a 37% increase. And in that $5, we're also making a lot of investments in R&D to be able to sustain our growth going forward. So we feel confident about maintaining our double digit in 2022. Significant portion of our COVID testing, we believe, is sustainable. We've made investments or have a plan here to lay out investments in our base business that I think will accelerate our growth rate. And in some of the questions here, we've got a strong balance sheet here. So you combine those 3 elements here, I think we've got not only a strong '21 forecast but a pretty good line of sight here in terms of delivering double digits for 2022. So thanks."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported another highly successful year for Abbott during what's been the single most disruptive health care event in our lifetimes. For the full year, we reported organic sale",1633,"Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported another highly successful year for Abbott during what's been the single most disruptive health care event in our lifetimes. For the full year, we reported organic sales growth of nearly 10% and ongoing earnings per share of $3.65, which reflects double-digit growth and is at the upper end of our guidance range we set last January when we were expecting a normal economy. Performance like this after the pandemic struck is a real achievement and demonstrates the strength of our diversified business model.  
The normal times, it maximizes our growth opportunities, and during the pandemic, it's been tested by a global crisis and proven to be highly resilient. It should come as no surprise that our performance was led by our Diagnostics business. COVID-19 dominated the year for us and the world, and our primary response came in the form of diagnostic tests to identify the virus.  
In total, we delivered more than 400 million COVID tests since the start of the pandemic, including more than 300 million tests in the fourth quarter alone.  
But as we've discussed before, the year was not all Diagnostics and COVID. Our more consumer-facing businesses, Nutrition, Diabetes Care and Established Pharmaceuticals all contribute growth for the year, and we continue to launch an impressive stream of innovations across our businesses. And I'll touch on some of these new products in more detail in just a moment.  
We exited 2020 with tremendous momentum, including total sales growth of more than 28% and ongoing earnings per share growth of more than 50% in the fourth quarter.  
Turning to 2021. We're forecasting another year of top-tier performance. As we announced this morning, we forecast ongoing earnings per share of at least $5 in 2021, reflecting growth of more than 35% compared to last year. And because we're building on top of our strong 2020 performance, our forecasted 2021 earnings per share is more than 50% higher than our pre-pandemic EPS in 2019, which is highly unique and differentiated in this environment.  
I'll now provide more details on our 2020 results before turning over the call to Bob. And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased around 4.5% for both the fourth quarter and full year.  
Strong growth of Ensure, our market-leading complete and balanced nutrition brand, and Glucerna, our leading diabetes nutrition brand, led to double-digit growth in Adult Nutrition for both the quarter and full year. In Pediatric Nutrition, U.S. sales growth of more than 5% last year was led by increased market share of Similac, our market-leading infant formula brand. International Pediatric Nutrition sales continued to be impacted by challenging market conditions in Greater China.  
During the past year, we continue to expand our Nutrition portfolio with several new product and line extensions, including the continued rollout of infant formula products across our Similac brand family that contain human oligosaccharide or HMO, which supports a healthy immune system. Global expansion of our PediaSure, Glucerna and Ensure brands, including the continued rollout of Ensure high-protein products; and the launch of 4 new Pedialyte rehydration products: Pedialyte Zero Sugar, Sport, Organic and Immune Support.  
For 2021, we're forecasting similar sales growth for our global Nutrition business and a continued strong cadence of new product introductions.  
Turning to Medical Devices, where sales were relatively flat in the fourth quarter. Strong double-digit growth in Diabetes Care was offset by lower sales in our Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation businesses due to challenging conditions as COVID case rates surged in certain geographies towards the end of the quarter. As we saw throughout last summer and fall, we expect procedure volumes to improve in these businesses as COVID case rates subside.  
In Diabetes Care, sales grew nearly 30% for the fourth quarter and full year, led by FreeStyle Libre, our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring system. In the U.S., Libre sales grew 50% last year. And outside the U.S., Libre sales grew 40%, surpassing $2 billion of international sales for the full year 2020.  
This past year was possibly our most productive ever in terms of new product approvals and launches across our Medical Device portfolio. Let me touch on a handful.  
First, the approval of MitraClip Gen 4, the latest generation of our market-leading system to repair a leaky mitral heart valve. Just last week in the U.S., Medicare expanded reimbursement coverage for MitraClip, which significantly expands the eligible patient population that can benefit from this life-changing technology.  
CE Mark of Tendyne, a first-of-its-kind minimally invasive device to replace a faulty mitral valve; and the CE Mark of TriClip, our minimally invasive clip technology to repair a leaky tricuspid heart valve. Long considered the forgotten valve, TriClip brings an important new solution to patients that have previously had very few treatment options.  
Abbott now offers minimally invasive device therapies for 3 valves in the heart: the aortic, the mitral and the tricuspid valves. We also launched 2 cardiac rhythm defibrillation products under our Gallant brand that include Bluetooth capabilities to align with our strategy in remote monitoring and digitally connected care.  
Also saw the approval of EnSite X, our next-generation 3D cardiac mapping technology; and U.S. approval of FreeStyle Libre 2 and CE Mark for Libre 3, the latest generations of our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring systems; and CE Mark of Libre Sense Glucose Sport, the first product in our strategy to expand use of our wearable biosensor technology into mass-market opportunities beyond diabetes. As you can see, it was a highly productive year for our pipeline, and quite frankly, there's even more I could highlight.  
In 2021, we're forecasting continued strong double-digit growth in our Diabetes Care business, led by FreeStyle Libre, and steady improvements in our Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation businesses, fueled by the continued business recovery, the society works its way through COVID-19 and on the strength of our recent and upcoming new product launches.  
Moving to Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD, where sales increased 3.5% in the fourth quarter, reflecting sequential improvement versus the prior quarter. Despite COVID, EPD sales increased 2% overall in 2020, demonstrating the resilience of our business model even in this challenging environment. Growth this past year was led by sales in India, Russia, China and Brazil.  
During the year, EPD continued to strengthen its portfolio with more than 50 new product launches across our key emerging markets. As we've discussed before, new product introductions in EPD are more incremental in nature, and the steady cadence of portfolio expansion and refreshment we're achieving is an important element of our sustainable growth strategy. We forecast demand and growth rate improvements in EPD during 2021 as well as a continued steady cadence of new product introductions that will contribute to growth.  
And I'll wrap up with our Diagnostic business, where sales grew nearly 110% in the quarter, driven by $2.4 billion of COVID testing-related sales. We realized very early that a variety of different testing solutions would be required to tackle the pandemic.  
With that understanding, starting last March, we developed and launched an entire portfolio of tests to target the virus. The biggest contribution in the fourth quarter came from our rapid lateral flow test to detect the virus, which includes BinaxNOW in the U.S. and Panbio internationally. These are highly portable, reliable and affordable tests and in just 50 minutes can detect if someone is infectious without the use of an instrument, which means the test can be performed in virtually any setting, such as physician office, pharmacies, urgent care centers, workplace settings and even at home.  
As part of our pandemic response efforts, we also developed and launched a digital solution that pairs with these tests called NAVICA, which allows people to receive and display test results on their mobile devices. But our efforts didn't stop at developing these tests. We also ramped up manufacturing capacity on a massive scale and now producing more than 100 million of these 2 tests combined per month.  
While our COVID testing efforts have clearly received a lot of attention, we've also remained focused on the launch and rollout of Alinity, our suite of innovative diagnostic instruments. We continue to retain existing businesses and capture share at strong rates. And we continue to build on our test menus for these instruments.  
Last year, we initiated the U.S. launch of Alinity m for molecular testing. This launch included a COVID test, which helped jump-start demand for this innovative, highly automated and differentiated molecular testing platform.  
And earlier this month, we announced U.S. FDA clearance for the first rapid handheld blood test for concussions. This test measures certain biomarkers found in blood after a head trauma event and produce the result within 15 minutes after a plasma sample is inserted in our i-STAT Alinity handheld device.  
Building on this initial clearance, we're also working on a whole blood point-of-care test under FDA breakthrough designation. And our vision is to develop a 15-minute portable test that can be used in any settings where people might experience head injuries that require quick evaluation.  
So in summary, despite the challenging environment, we achieved the upper end of the EPS range we set last January before anyone knew the extent of the COVID pandemic, demonstrating the strength, resilience of our diversified business model and our superior execution. Our new product pipeline continues to be incredibly productive, delivering groundbreaking innovations and a steady cadence of important new products, with more on the horizon.  
We continue to lead in the area of diagnostic testing for COVID, which is helping to fight the virus, and accelerating our long-term decentralized testing strategy. And we're forecasting more than 35% adjusted EPS growth in 2021, which is truly unique in this environment.  
I'll now turn over the call to Bob. Bob?"

As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis.  
Turning to our results. Sales for the fourth quarter increased 28.4%, which was led by strong performance in Nutrition and Diabetes Care, along with global COVID testing-related sales of $2.4 billion in the quarter. Foreign exchange had a favorable impact of 0.3% on sales, which was somewhat favorable compared to expectations had exchange rates held steady since the time of our earnings call in October. Reported sales increased 28.7% in the quarter.  
Regarding other aspects of the P&L. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.5% of sales. R&D investment was 6% of sales. And SG&A expense was 23.5% of sales. Our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate of 14.1% reflects the adjustment required to align our tax expense with our revised full year effective tax rate of 15%. This is somewhat lower than the estimate we provided in October due to a shift in the mix of our geographic and business income.  
Turning to our outlook for the full year 2021. Today, we issued guidance for full year adjusted earnings per share of at least $5. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a favorable impact of approximately 3.5% on our reported sales, which includes an expected favorable impact of approximately 3% on our first quarter reported sales. We forecast full year net interest expense of around $515 million, nonoperating income of around $230 million and a full year adjusted tax rate of 15%.  
With that, we'll now open the call for questions."

And specifically, I guess the way I'd ask the question is, I'm sure investors would love some perspective on how COVID testing impacts that guidance, how you're thinking about the base business. And maybe most importantly, given how much higher $5 is compared to expectations, I'm sure investors would love to hear your early thoughts on whether or not Abbott can grow at its sort of traditional rates off of that $5 number next year.

I guess we've been looking at 2021 for several months right now. I think one of the things as we're going into it is that we knew, I mean, a lot of companies were going to be forecasting double-digit growth goin",927,"Sure, Bob. You hit on all the points there. I guess we've been looking at 2021 for several months right now. I think one of the things as we're going into it is that we knew, I mean, a lot of companies were going to be forecasting double-digit growth going into 2021, a lot of that probably based on comps, where we saw a decrease in EPS. And that was -- that's not the case for Abbott. We're not coming out of a hole. And as I said in my remarks, the $5 -- the at least $5 target for 2021 is about 50% higher than where we were in 2019. 
And what I can say is that we are, Bob and myself, as we manage the business, especially over these last couple of months and going into this year, we've been looking at 2-year CAGRs across our businesses. And then -- I think that's the right way to look at it, is to kind of look at what happened in 2020. And it's easy for some of the businesses to come up and post double-digit kind of growth for us. So we're really looking on a 2-year CAGR basis. 
The points that you touched on are all the points that we've looked at, and we've been modeling several different scenarios. So I'll touch on those because they're all elements of how we built to our at least $5. First of all, obviously, COVID testing, it's been a big driver for us, and it will continue to be a big driver. I expect testing demand is still going to remain high even as the vaccines roll out. I don't think we've even seen testing demand peak yet. 
So we built a lot of capacity, and we've talked about that over the last year, the capacity that we built. But we didn't put it all in. We didn't put it all in into that $5. So -- but we don't all see it going away either. But there's enough capacity there, testing capacity, sufficient testing capacity for us to be able to meet this kind of growing demand right now. 
The other part of our forecast here, without a doubt, is looking at our base business and the recovery of our base business, specifically the ones that were hit probably more heavily by the COVID, which was some of our device businesses and our routine testing and routine lab testing. These are important procedures and life-saving procedures. They're important routine tests to do. So you can't just keep pushing them out indefinitely. And what we saw in Q3 of last year as those rates -- hospitalization rates start to come down, we started to see the pickup of our procedures and of our core testing. And we actually saw growth in several months in Q3 and going into Q4. And obviously, that got impacted probably around Thanksgiving. 
So we've seen that these can recover, and we do have that modeled in into that $5, which is a recovery of these businesses at a similar rate of what we saw in Q3 in summer and the fall. 
I'd say the third kind of key element in there is our consumer businesses that probably weren't as impacted and did pretty well during the pandemic. We expect those businesses to either continue their trajectory or get better. I mean I think Nutrition had a really great year last year. I expect them to have a very similar year this year with a lot of new product launches. EPD should get sequentially better. We saw that in Q4. Early indications in January show that recovery continuing. 
And quite frankly, Libre, I expect to do better with all the innovation and investment we're making there. So those businesses will do well. 
And then the fourth element that we've modeled a lot is spending and ability to reinvest in the businesses and areas that we thought that we could do with more investment, whether it's SG&A, and more specifically in R&D, and accelerate some of our programs. I think you saw some of that in our Q4 results, where we beat consensus while at the same time, investing more in R&D and SG&A. 
So we looked at these 4 elements here, Bob, and we modeled it variety of different ways and just feel really good that this was a good floor, a good starting point at $5. Quite frankly, if anything, we could have significant upside over here. And it's just really going to depend a little bit on how we think about COVID testing going forward. 
So I kind of saw the $5 here as, okay, it's a 37% increase versus 2020, which grew 13%. And we've got probable upside to that, while at the same time, an opportunity to invest in the business, invest in SG&A, more specifically in R&D. We've got a leading COVID test portfolio here with a variety of different tests and capacity that we haven't dialed all in. Quite frankly, if I had put all that capacity in, I think maybe you would have a little bit of time believing that, but it's there. 
And I think we've got an exciting base business like you'd mentioned here that is poised for recovery. I mean we've got great portfolios, real strong brands, rich pipelines, strong leadership position. So I think the $5 here was definitely a good starting point, factoring all those elements in here, and we'll be able to kind of build from there as the year progresses."

It's a little premature to just skip across all the way to 2022. But we have -- but listen, when -- we didn't do 2021 in isolation. So yes, we looked at 2022 and looked at all those different scenarios that I talked about. So I can probably give you",512,"Sure. It's a little premature to just skip across all the way to 2022. But we have -- but listen, when -- we didn't do 2021 in isolation. So yes, we looked at 2022 and looked at all those different scenarios that I talked about. So I can probably give you some general comments over here. I mean I think we're forecasting a lot of growth this year, and we're going to be looking to build on it. 
Prior to the pandemic, The Street consensus for 2023 EPS was just under $5. So we're targeting that EPS, this level this year. So in essence, we've we've pulled forward at least 2 full years of EPS growth. And our mindset here, Bob, is going to be that we're going to maintain that pull-forward indefinitely. We always start our process with a double-digit target every year. That's been our identity. And I have no intention of changing that identity. 
Of course, there's a couple of factors here that we need to contemplate. But even looking at those factors, we feel good that we've got the different elements here to be able to deliver on that double digit. One of those is obviously COVID and COVID testing. And even if COVID testing starts to mature a little bit in 2022, we believe there's a significant portion that's still very sustainable. 
Can we predict it perfectly today? No, I can't, not to the level that you're accustomed to get from us. But I also think that the ability to do testing in a decentralized manner, people talk a lot about how the pandemic has accelerated digital transformation in businesses, accelerated transformation in the business models. The pandemic has accelerated our decentralized testing strategy. And I think the -- I think I talked about this in the last call. I think a lot of the testing channels that we're building here that have emerged, I don't see them going away. 
On top of that, we -- as I said, we've got investment and investment spending into SG&A, but more specifically into R&D. We believe R&D is the more sustainable spend. It's the spend that allows us to sustain our top line growth rate. So I would expect that these investments that we've made in Q4 and definitely into 2021 that, that will have an impact on our base business growth rate. We've always talked about our base business being sustainable at [ 7 to 8 ], and I would expect these investments to be able to accelerate on that. 
And I guess the third part to that question of yours about confidence on delivering double digits in 2022 is we've got a great balance sheet, and we've got strong financial health and a lot of strategic flexibility there. So I lay all of these elements out here: sustained COVID testing, the investment in the business and the strong balance sheet, just gives me confidence that even with all these different models here that we'll be able to kind of continue to deliver that identity of double-digit growth."

You came in really strong here in Q4 with a big step-up sequentially. What are you assuming in the $5 for testing throughout the year, if you could discuss some of the different product lines? And then maybe if you could provide some high-level thoughts on how much of a tail of testing we might see into '22 and beyond?"

So let me talk about kind of numbers and ranges here then, and then I'll spend time talking a little bit about sustainability of the testing. As I said, I don't see the demand just kind of dropping off even with the vaccine rollout. We achieved $2.4",831,"Sure. So let me talk about kind of numbers and ranges here then, and then I'll spend time talking a little bit about sustainability of the testing. As I said, I don't see the demand just kind of dropping off even with the vaccine rollout. We achieved $2.4 billion in Q4. So if you annualize that, it'll go -- it will annualize for around $10 billion. So I can expect probably Q1 is going to be at that range of about $2.5 billion or so. 
And if you'd say, ""Okay. What does the full year range look like?"" I probably can't go beyond Q1 in terms of exactly how it's going to look like, but you can be in that $6.5 billion to $7 billion range, I would think. But we've got, as I said, plenty of capacity to go above that. So that's probably what's incorporated here, Matt, in the $5. 
But I think the big point here is the sustainability of this. And to your question there, I think a good portion is sustainable. I think a substantial portion is sustainable, which is why we were a first mover and a leader here. We started with our lab-based systems. Those were the probably the obvious part in the strategy. Since we knew we had a lot of capital equipment out in the labs, we started with that strategy to take advantage of the systems out there. And you saw that rollout happen. 
But we also knew that in a pandemic, you were going to need to add on top of that testing infrastructure. You're going to have to add faster testing, and testing that could be done at a much significant scale and that was more affordable, which is why we developed those 2 lateral flow tests. There's been a lot of visibility to BinaxNOW here in the U.S. 
We haven't talked a lot about Panbio. But Panbio uses the same technology, the same kind of antibodies. And we've got a whole supply chain that's been built outside of the United States that supplies all of the markets that we're supporting with Panbio. So both those products, they've been the bulk of our sales. We saw that in Q4. There's a lot of capacity that we've built around them, and that would continue to build around them. 
And the clinical utility of them is really strong. I mean they've been -- a lot of studies are showing their reliability here at finding people that are infectious. And I think that's a key distinction here, is your ability to use these tests in a way for being able to find those people that are infectious and not necessarily those that were infectious and that might have some remnants of DNA of the virus in their system. So I think it's sustainable. 
And I think you need to take 2 kind of views here on that, at least this is how we're looking at it. First of all, we need to think globally about this. Sometimes, we get very focused on the U.S. and what's going on in here in the U.S., but you've got 8 billion-plus people around the world. And you've got a variety of different countries that are experiencing different cycles in the disease, different cycles in their vaccination strategies. So once you really take a bigger view here, this is not going to be something that will just be done in the next couple of quarters here, if you take a real global perspective. 
And the second thing that I think is just reframing the testing. I think we think about the sustainability of testing when we think about Q2 and Q3 of last year. Long lines, not enough volume, long turnaround times, $150, $200 tests. That might be not sustainable -- not as sustainable. But if you position yourself into a 2021, 2022 world where you now have fast, easier, much more scalable test, digital tests that are priced for more accessibility and affordability, I think that's the sustained kind of business here that we see. 
So when you think about that maturing of the COVID testing market, we kind of see PCR kind of maturing first, and then we see the rapid part of the business being sustained. And listen, we've built a lot of capacity, as I said. It's probably $12 million, $13 million, $14 billion of capacity that we built in there. We haven't put it all in, but it's there. 
And then the other part that I talked about was just the sustainability of it past '22 and into 2023 as we've accelerated our point-of-care testing strategy. And everything we're doing in fighting the virus has not only a direct impact of helping reopen the economy, et cetera, but it's also seeding the market. And it's building these new testing channels. We've got testing going on at airports, hotels, urgent care, retail, universities, et cetera. So we believe that's pretty sustainable, too."

So the manufacturing, the regulatory, the R&D, and more importantly, the commercial infrastructure to be able to look across the world and support governments, workplaces, et cetera, on rolling out antigen testing internationally. So I think it's done very well. 
We've been able to kind of leverage some of the kind of joint development of Binax and Panbio. But the demand that we're seeing internationally, I would characterize also as probably just starting. It hasn't even peaked either. So I think we've got a lot of opportunity with Panbio internationally, too. And I think the teams have done a really good job there."

It's the one that allows us to build more sustainability in our top line and building R&D programs. Yes, there's opportunity to accelerate SG&A and put some of that cash to use in SG&A. And there are some businesses that could definitely benefit with more SG&A. And there's a pretty strong return as we put those in there, whether it's Libre or Nutrition. But a lot of the focus of this reinvestment here is going into R&D. 
And quite frankly, I think our pipeline has been highly productive and maybe a little bit underappreciated, I think. There's a lot of focus that goes into kind of key 3 products that you guys like to write about them as the big 3, and they get a lot of attention. And quite frankly, they should, whether it's Libre, MitraClip and Alinity. They're large multibillion-dollar segments that are underpenetrated. And we've been making clear and intentional investments in those businesses. 
I'm not going to spend a lot of time going through those, but you kind of know them, right? So Libre with Libre 3. We've got Libre 4 in development. We've been making investments in new applications for the Libre platform outside of diabetes. And MitraClip, obviously, we've got this opportunity with the CMS reimbursement. We have a fifth generation MitraClip that's also in development. And we're investing in a significant amount of clinical trials here to expand the market for us, and we'll continue to do that. 
Probably the one I'm more excited about here is the moderate risk for DMR that we've announced also. And then Alinity, you also know the story. I mean we've got 6 new systems where we're increasing the menu and expanding that geographically. So that has a lot of attention, continues to have a lot of attention, and we do resource those opportunities because they're that big. But I think it's misleading here to think that that's the sum of our innovation strategy. We're so much more than that. 
On the EPD and the Nutrition side, we're going to continue to invest in line extensions and portfolio refreshment. This is the model that we know drive the returns we need for these businesses. And I think the team has now hit their stride in terms of how to do this and how to effectively roll this out with local portfolios. EPDs rolled out over 50 products. I expect that to continue. Nutrition has done over 20, and I expect that to continue also. 
In Diagnostics, outside of Alinity, outside of COVID, we've been investing a lot in expanding our rapid testing portfolio. I've been talking about this, about the opportunity we have to take advantage of these new channels that we built and increase the penetration with different assays. So whether it's going beyond COVID or flu with RSV, strep, we've got a sexually transmitted disease platform for ID NOW, which we're excited about also, which I think has got a great opportunity. 
And then this rapid concussion test, Robbie, I think, is a great opportunity for us. Probably the biggest opportunity we have is if -- once we work through to have a whole blood test, I can envision here an opportunity across the 25,000 high schools in the U.S., the 5,000 colleges, all the sporting leagues, and that's going to take us another 1.5 years or a bit or so to get there, but I think it's a great opportunity. 
And then the device portfolio is going to continue to get a lot of investment the way we have. Obviously, Tendyne and Cephea, we want to be a leader in mitral. We've launched Tendyne in Europe. We're funding our Cephea program so that we can have a transfemoral/transseptal program for the replacement of the mitral valve. I'm very pleased with the progress we've seen on Tendyne. 
TriClip, I've talked about the opportunity with Triclip. It's not going to be as large as mitral, but it will be 30%, 35% the size of the mitral market. And we're still in the early innings here of development -- of clinical evidence development, and we're going to be leading there. 
We've made investments in increasing the competitiveness of our CRM portfolio. We've just started to roll out now more global basis, our new 2 -- our 2 new defibrillator products under the Gallant. And we've been working hard at our leadless program and making the investments in the leadless program so that not only can we come out with a single-chamber product and then be able to upgrade it to a dual-chamber product. 
I like the program. I like what we've done with it. I think we have a value proposition -- a differentiated value proposition versus the competition. 
CardioMEMS is another study that we've been funding, and there's probably going to be required some build-out of the commercial infrastructure to be able to support the rollout of that product. If you think about the opportunity we have with CardioMEMS, even at a 10% to 15% penetration on that population, you're looking at a $1 billion opportunity for us. So that is obviously getting a lot of attention. 
And then I'm very excited to come into the U.S. with the LAA and the TAVR product sometime this year. I think these are great opportunities. I like the product that we have, especially on the LAA side with Amulet. It does very well in Europe. And we'll be funding those programs, too. 
So it's more than the big 3. There's a lot here. And quite frankly, Bob and I are already going to the businesses and say, ""Okay. What was below the line that you didn't show us in the planning process?"" and ""Can we get going on those, too?"" So that's where a lot of the investment goes into R&D."

As I said in the previous question, though, David, I mean we've got a lot of organic opportunities to invest in. And I like those organic opportunities. So they obviously do get a lot of our attention right now. 
But if you think about M&A, yes, it's got to be a good fit strategically, and it's got to align with our growth orientation here. I mean I'm not going to look at something that's going to dilute our top line growth rate, and obviously, is able to generate a return for our shareholders. So there's a lot of activity. There's a lot of, I'd say, high valuations right now so. 
But to the extent that we do something this year, it would be more like tuck-in in nature to be able to kind of augment some of these portfolios. So that's probably the better way to put it to you."

Is it next quarter?

So when is the push in Europe? And where can that platform go with investment?"

But it's still top of our priorities here because it's such a huge opportunity for us. We had a real strong quarter in Q4. We exited with a lot of momentum going into this year, especially in the U.S. I think global sales were $0.75 billion, up 35%. 
And I expect the absolute dollar amount to get bigger. And usually when that happens, we think, well, gee, law of big numbers, right, the percentages are going to go down. And I don't think so. I think that we're going to see continuing growth rate expansion on our Libre business here. So I kind of look at Libre as a 2021 growth that should start at 40% and go from there. 
A lot of focus on the U.S. on the rollout -- on Libre 2 rollout. We're seeing a lot of the trend shifts, whether it's revenue, whether it's new users. I think the superior accuracy messaging here is definitely coming through, and it's got all the other advantages of our value proposition. 
I think one of the good things about the pharmacy channel is that there's a lot of available data. There's a lot of available third-party audited data. And when I do the reviews with the team, we spend a lot of time looking at them. And it tells me you can't hide behind these -- you can't hide when we're in the pharmacy, like all this data is available. 
And I think it's done really well in the U.S. Obviously, I want it to do better, but I can't look at it and not be objective that there's obviously been a trend shift here, whether it's NBRxs, TRxs, refill rates, et cetera. One of them that I'm extremely happy to see is the Rx fulfillment rate. So when a consumer goes to the pharmacy with a prescription, swipes the card, do they get that prescription filled, right? And there's factors that drive somebody to not get it filled. It's usually a copay. 
And what we've seen with the Libre Rx fulfillment rate is that about 9 out of 10 get filled. And you compare that to our competitor at about 6 out of 10, I think the value proposition here is really strong, meaning that we can invest in DTC advertising. We can invest more in this platform. And we're seeing the value proposition come through as it relates to Rx fulfillment rates. 
So I'd say the focus on U.S. is., now to your question on L3, we're already here. We've been working through, say, the reimbursement contracting process. It probably got delayed a little bit in Q4 in terms of our expectations, given some of the focus of a lot of the international countries focusing on COVID. But we're all ready. Manufacturing is ready. In fact, between Libre 2 and Libre 3, we've got hundreds of millions of sensors here of capacity. And I think that ties a little bit to the expectation that we have for this segment, which is you've got close to 80 million people that could benefit from this target, which is why we took a very different approach in our strategy, a much mass-market approach that develop a product that's consumer-friendly, intuitive, make sure that it can provide measurable benefits and price it for mass adoption. And that's working out very well. 
So we should see a Libre 3 launch international in Q1. And then in the U.S., we'll issue a release when we get approval."

And we're hearing a lot of our accounts in the U.S. and international are really wanting to kind of push stronger and a sense here that with a vaccine, they feel more confident to be able to build it. 
So I think you'll see probably the biggest comp issue, I'd say, is probably Q2. I mean I think that's when we saw the big drop. Q1 was probably more towards the end of the quarter, the last 2 weeks of March. So I kind of see the more normalization growth rates.

I mean when we looked at how the impact of COVID progressed geographically, we saw it, for some reason, kind of trail a little bit kind of the developed markets, whether it was Europe and the U.S. We reall",622,"Sure. So on EPD, yes, we did see a nice recovery. I mean when we looked at how the impact of COVID progressed geographically, we saw it, for some reason, kind of trail a little bit kind of the developed markets, whether it was Europe and the U.S. We really started to feel the impact on our EPD business, which is, as you know, mostly emerging markets, started to see it coming out of Q2 and then big in Q3 as a lot of those countries kind of shut down. And the way the model works is you still need a prescription and you need your physician or you need to go to your hospital to get that prescription. 
So when we looked at Q4, we're actually not surprised, but it was good to see that it came in a little bit higher than what we had expected because we were trying to model it very similar to what we saw in some of the other businesses. And it came back faster. 
At the same time, there's -- it's not a nice kind of linear forecast in these markets. And there's -- it does tend to bounce up around. I mean, we had a 9%, 10% growth in Q1. There was some stocking effect there in kind of February and March in some of the markets, so we'll have a comp over there. But what I -- what we look at is we're looking at the IMS demand market progression in all these markets that we're competing in. 
And we're seeing a nice recovery. So I expect that just to sequentially kind of get better, and I guess similar to the comment on devices, get back to that high single-digit growth rate towards second half. 
Oh, and then you also had a question on change of care. I mean I think a lot has happened, right? And we've tried to focus on the areas that we feel that we can contribute and benefit. One of them I've talked about is this decentralization of testing and how the pandemic has accelerated that decentralization for us. We believed in it. We believe that we could drive it and create a whole new testing channel when we did the Alere acquisition. And this has kind of brought it forward about -- probably about 2 years in terms of where we are today versus where we thought we're going to be. 
So that's an important part for us. Being able to have access to fast, affordable and digitally connected testing is something that I think is going to be here and here to stay. Whether it's a COVID test or other tests, I think that is a change a little bit in the delivery, at least on the diagnostic side. 
And then the other side that I'd say is one that we've been working on for quite some bit is the connectivity of our devices and the intersection of digital and health care and how those devices are being connected. You've seen what we've done across all of our portfolio on devices, and we'll continue to position our products in such a way where we can develop them and take advantage of that. 
For Neuromodulation, we've just announced here a very interesting platform, which I think is going to have a significant impact on how that business and business model works with a much more connected care platform, where patients get to report their outcomes and eventually get to remote programming, which is a huge change in that business model. 
So I'd say the COVID testing, accelerating decentralization of testing and connected care are probably the 2 pandemic-driven changes that we're focusing on taking advantage of."

So I think the modeling piece here is a little bit difficult. I think we're going to have a lot more underst",564,"Yes. I guess on the modeling thing, listen, you could say there could be a dropoff, but you could say there could be an increase or it could stay. So I think the modeling piece here is a little bit difficult. I think we're going to have a lot more understanding as we get towards the summer. But I think, at least for the first half, you've got -- we've got sufficient capacity here to kind of explore the demand that exists both in the U.S. and globally. 
So yes, I'm not sure right now that you can kind of easily kind of just put that model down like that, but it's just too soon. 
Regarding your question on mutations and the impact there, a lot of the mutations here -- I don't want to get too wonky here. But we've been looking at this, Vijay, since the beginning. We have a group of, we call them the virus hunters. They're constantly looking and studying and getting their hands on samples to be able to kind of, not only test our existing products but even to develop new ones. And I'd say, right now, the mutations are happening. The ones that you've referenced, the South African one and the U.K. one, those are happening on what we would call the spike protein or what we call the S protein. The rapid antigen test that we have are actually targeting the nucleocapsid protein, what we call the N protein. 
So in silico analysis says no impact. The U.K. NIH kind of did a study on Panbio and found the U.K. variant to not influence the sensitivity of the Panbio, but we're also collecting as many samples as we can from U.K., South Africa, Brazil, et cetera, and making sure that we're constantly studying that to ensure that there's no change to the sensitivity of the test that we've developed. 
On the molecular side, whether it's ID NOW -- ID NOW looks at a different gene, the RPDP genes. It's completely different thing, and similar thing also with the PCR. So I think those are, right now, from everything we know, wouldn't be impacted by the mutations. We're more focused on the antigen with the mutations on those protein sequences. So I feel good about that right now. But obviously, we're constantly vigilant here. 
So let me just close here. I'd say we had a real strong 2020, very strong performance, almost 10% top line growth, 13% EPS. We're forecasting 2021 here at least $5. And like I said, I think we've got opportunity to have upside to that. But still already at $5, it's already at a 37% increase. And in that $5, we're also making a lot of investments in R&D to be able to sustain our growth going forward. So we feel confident about maintaining our double digit in 2022. Significant portion of our COVID testing, we believe, is sustainable. We've made investments or have a plan here to lay out investments in our base business that I think will accelerate our growth rate. And in some of the questions here, we've got a strong balance sheet here. So you combine those 3 elements here, I think we've got not only a strong '21 forecast but a pretty good line of sight here in terms of delivering double digits for 2022. So thanks."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported another highly successful year for Abbott during what's been the single most disruptive health care event in our lifetimes.

Today, we reported another highly successful year for Abbott during what's been the single most disruptive health care event in our lifetimes. For the full year, we reported organic sales growth of nearly 10% and ongoing earnings per share of $3.65, which reflects double-digit growth and is at the upper end of our guidance range we set last January when we were expecting a normal economy. Performance like this after the pandemic struck is a real achievement and demonstrates the strength of our diversified business model. 
The normal times, it maximizes our growth opportunities, and during the pandemic, it's been tested by a global crisis and proven to be highly resilient. It should come as no surprise that our performance was led by our Diagnostics business. COVID-19 dominated the year for us and the world, and our primary response came in the form of diagnostic tests to identify the virus. 
In total, we delivered more than 400 million COVID tests since the start of the pandemic, including more than 300 million tests in the fourth quarter alone. 
But as we've discussed before, the year was not all Diagnostics and COVID. Our more consumer-facing businesses, Nutrition, Diabetes Care and Established Pharmaceuticals all contribute growth for the year, and we continue to launch an impressive stream of innovations across our businesses. And I'll touch on some of these new products in more detail in just a moment. 
We exited 2020 with tremendous momentum, including total sales growth of more than 28% and ongoing earnings per share growth of more than 50% in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to 2021. We're forecasting another year of top-tier performance. As we announced this morning, we forecast ongoing earnings per share of at least $5 in 2021, reflecting growth of more than 35% compared to last year. And because we're building on top of our strong 2020 performance, our forecasted 2021 earnings per share is more than 50% higher than our pre-pandemic EPS in 2019, which is highly unique and differentiated in this environment. 
I'll now provide more details on our 2020 results before turning over the call to Bob. And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased around 4.5% for both the fourth quarter and full year. 
Strong growth of Ensure, our market-leading complete and balanced nutrition brand, and Glucerna, our leading diabetes nutrition brand, led to double-digit growth in Adult Nutrition for both the quarter and full year. In Pediatric Nutrition, U.S. sales growth of more than 5% last year was led by increased market share of Similac, our market-leading infant formula brand. International Pediatric Nutrition sales continued to be impacted by challenging market conditions in Greater China. 
During the past year, we continue to expand our Nutrition portfolio with several new product and line extensions, including the continued rollout of infant formula products across our Similac brand family that contain human oligosaccharide or HMO, which supports a healthy immune system. Global expansion of our PediaSure, Glucerna and Ensure brands, including the continued rollout of Ensure high-protein products; and the launch of 4 new Pedialyte rehydration products: Pedialyte Zero Sugar, Sport, Organic and Immune Support. 
For 2021, we're forecasting similar sales growth for our global Nutrition business and a continued strong cadence of new product introductions. 
Turning to Medical Devices, where sales were relatively flat in the fourth quarter. Strong double-digit growth in Diabetes Care was offset by lower sales in our Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation businesses due to challenging conditions as COVID case rates surged in certain geographies towards the end of the quarter. As we saw throughout last summer and fall, we expect procedure volumes to improve in these businesses as COVID case rates subside. 
In Diabetes Care, sales grew nearly 30% for the fourth quarter and full year, led by FreeStyle Libre, our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring system. In the U.S., Libre sales grew 50% last year. And outside the U.S., Libre sales grew 40%, surpassing $2 billion of international sales for the full year 2020. 
This past year was possibly our most productive ever in terms of new product approvals and launches across our Medical Device portfolio. Let me touch on a handful. 
First, the approval of MitraClip Gen 4, the latest generation of our market-leading system to repair a leaky mitral heart valve. Just last week in the U.S., Medicare expanded reimbursement coverage for MitraClip, which significantly expands the eligible patient population that can benefit from this life-changing technology. 
CE Mark of Tendyne, a first-of-its-kind minimally invasive device to replace a faulty mitral valve; and the CE Mark of TriClip, our minimally invasive clip technology to repair a leaky tricuspid heart valve. Long considered the forgotten valve, TriClip brings an important new solution to patients that have previously had very few treatment options. 
Abbott now offers minimally invasive device therapies for 3 valves in the heart: the aortic, the mitral and the tricuspid valves. We also launched 2 cardiac rhythm defibrillation products under our Gallant brand that include Bluetooth capabilities to align with our strategy in remote monitoring and digitally connected care. 
Also saw the approval of EnSite X, our next-generation 3D cardiac mapping technology; and U.S. approval of FreeStyle Libre 2 and CE Mark for Libre 3, the latest generations of our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring systems; and CE Mark of Libre Sense Glucose Sport, the first product in our strategy to expand use of our wearable biosensor technology into mass-market opportunities beyond diabetes. As you can see, it was a highly productive year for our pipeline, and quite frankly, there's even more I could highlight. 
In 2021, we're forecasting continued strong double-digit growth in our Diabetes Care business, led by FreeStyle Libre, and steady improvements in our Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation businesses, fueled by the continued business recovery, the society works its way through COVID-19 and on the strength of our recent and upcoming new product launches. 
Moving to Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD, where sales increased 3.5% in the fourth quarter, reflecting sequential improvement versus the prior quarter. Despite COVID, EPD sales increased 2% overall in 2020, demonstrating the resilience of our business model even in this challenging environment. Growth this past year was led by sales in India, Russia, China and Brazil. 
During the year, EPD continued to strengthen its portfolio with more than 50 new product launches across our key emerging markets. As we've discussed before, new product introductions in EPD are more incremental in nature, and the steady cadence of portfolio expansion and refreshment we're achieving is an important element of our sustainable growth strategy. We forecast demand and growth rate improvements in EPD during 2021 as well as a continued steady cadence of new product introductions that will contribute to growth. 
And I'll wrap up with our Diagnostic business, where sales grew nearly 110% in the quarter, driven by $2.4 billion of COVID testing-related sales. We realized very early that a variety of different testing solutions would be required to tackle the pandemic. 
With that understanding, starting last March, we developed and launched an entire portfolio of tests to target the virus. The biggest contribution in the fourth quarter came from our rapid lateral flow test to detect the virus, which includes BinaxNOW in the U.S. and Panbio internationally. These are highly portable, reliable and affordable tests and in just 50 minutes can detect if someone is infectious without the use of an instrument, which means the test can be performed in virtually any setting, such as physician office, pharmacies, urgent care centers, workplace settings and even at home. 
As part of our pandemic response efforts, we also developed and launched a digital solution that pairs with these tests called NAVICA, which allows people to receive and display test results on their mobile devices. But our efforts didn't stop at developing these tests. We also ramped up manufacturing capacity on a massive scale and now producing more than 100 million of these 2 tests combined per month. 
While our COVID testing efforts have clearly received a lot of attention, we've also remained focused on the launch and rollout of Alinity, our suite of innovative diagnostic instruments. We continue to retain existing businesses and capture share at strong rates. And we continue to build on our test menus for these instruments. 
Last year, we initiated the U.S. launch of Alinity m for molecular testing. This launch included a COVID test, which helped jump-start demand for this innovative, highly automated and differentiated molecular testing platform. 
And earlier this month, we announced U.S. FDA clearance for the first rapid handheld blood test for concussions. This test measures certain biomarkers found in blood after a head trauma event and produce the result within 15 minutes after a plasma sample is inserted in our i-STAT Alinity handheld device. 
Building on this initial clearance, we're also working on a whole blood point-of-care test under FDA breakthrough designation. And our vision is to develop a 15-minute portable test that can be used in any settings where people might experience head injuries that require quick evaluation. 
So in summary, despite the challenging environment, we achieved the upper end of the EPS range we set last January before anyone knew the extent of the COVID pandemic, demonstrating the strength, resilience of our diversified business model and our superior execution. Our new product pipeline continues to be incredibly productive, delivering groundbreaking innovations and a steady cadence of important new products, with more on the horizon. 
We continue to lead in the area of diagnostic testing for COVID, which is helping to fight the virus, and accelerating our long-term decentralized testing strategy. And we're forecasting more than 35% adjusted EPS growth in 2021, which is truly unique in this environment. 
I'll now turn over the call to Bob. Bob?"

As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. 
Turning to our results. Sales for the fourth quarter increased 28.4%, which was led by strong performance in Nutrition and Diabetes Care, along with global COVID testing-related sales of $2.4 billion in the quarter. Foreign exchange had a favorable impact of 0.3% on sales, which was somewhat favorable compared to expectations had exchange rates held steady since the time of our earnings call in October. Reported sales increased 28.7% in the quarter. 
Regarding other aspects of the P&L. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.5% of sales. R&D investment was 6% of sales. And SG&A expense was 23.5% of sales. Our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate of 14.1% reflects the adjustment required to align our tax expense with our revised full year effective tax rate of 15%. This is somewhat lower than the estimate we provided in October due to a shift in the mix of our geographic and business income. 
Turning to our outlook for the full year 2021. Today, we issued guidance for full year adjusted earnings per share of at least $5. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a favorable impact of approximately 3.5% on our reported sales, which includes an expected favorable impact of approximately 3% on our first quarter reported sales. We forecast full year net interest expense of around $515 million, nonoperating income of around $230 million and a full year adjusted tax rate of 15%. 
With that, we'll now open the call for questions."

I guess we've been looking at 2021 for several months right now. I think one of the things as we're going into it is that we knew, I mean, a lot of companies were going to be forecasting double-digit growth goin",927,"Sure, Bob. You hit on all the points there. I guess we've been looking at 2021 for several months right now. I think one of the things as we're going into it is that we knew, I mean, a lot of companies were going to be forecasting double-digit growth going into 2021, a lot of that probably based on comps, where we saw a decrease in EPS. And that was -- that's not the case for Abbott. We're not coming out of a hole. And as I said in my remarks, the $5 -- the at least $5 target for 2021 is about 50% higher than where we were in 2019. 
And what I can say is that we are, Bob and myself, as we manage the business, especially over these last couple of months and going into this year, we've been looking at 2-year CAGRs across our businesses. And then -- I think that's the right way to look at it, is to kind of look at what happened in 2020. And it's easy for some of the businesses to come up and post double-digit kind of growth for us. So we're really looking on a 2-year CAGR basis. 
The points that you touched on are all the points that we've looked at, and we've been modeling several different scenarios. So I'll touch on those because they're all elements of how we built to our at least $5. First of all, obviously, COVID testing, it's been a big driver for us, and it will continue to be a big driver. I expect testing demand is still going to remain high even as the vaccines roll out. I don't think we've even seen testing demand peak yet. 
So we built a lot of capacity, and we've talked about that over the last year, the capacity that we built. But we didn't put it all in. We didn't put it all in into that $5. So -- but we don't all see it going away either. But there's enough capacity there, testing capacity, sufficient testing capacity for us to be able to meet this kind of growing demand right now. 
The other part of our forecast here, without a doubt, is looking at our base business and the recovery of our base business, specifically the ones that were hit probably more heavily by the COVID, which was some of our device businesses and our routine testing and routine lab testing. These are important procedures and life-saving procedures. They're important routine tests to do. So you can't just keep pushing them out indefinitely. And what we saw in Q3 of last year as those rates -- hospitalization rates start to come down, we started to see the pickup of our procedures and of our core testing. And we actually saw growth in several months in Q3 and going into Q4. And obviously, that got impacted probably around Thanksgiving. 
So we've seen that these can recover, and we do have that modeled in into that $5, which is a recovery of these businesses at a similar rate of what we saw in Q3 in summer and the fall. 
I'd say the third kind of key element in there is our consumer businesses that probably weren't as impacted and did pretty well during the pandemic. We expect those businesses to either continue their trajectory or get better. I mean I think Nutrition had a really great year last year. I expect them to have a very similar year this year with a lot of new product launches. EPD should get sequentially better. We saw that in Q4. Early indications in January show that recovery continuing. 
And quite frankly, Libre, I expect to do better with all the innovation and investment we're making there. So those businesses will do well. 
And then the fourth element that we've modeled a lot is spending and ability to reinvest in the businesses and areas that we thought that we could do with more investment, whether it's SG&A, and more specifically in R&D, and accelerate some of our programs. I think you saw some of that in our Q4 results, where we beat consensus while at the same time, investing more in R&D and SG&A. 
So we looked at these 4 elements here, Bob, and we modeled it variety of different ways and just feel really good that this was a good floor, a good starting point at $5. Quite frankly, if anything, we could have significant upside over here. And it's just really going to depend a little bit on how we think about COVID testing going forward. 
So I kind of saw the $5 here as, okay, it's a 37% increase versus 2020, which grew 13%. And we've got probable upside to that, while at the same time, an opportunity to invest in the business, invest in SG&A, more specifically in R&D. We've got a leading COVID test portfolio here with a variety of different tests and capacity that we haven't dialed all in. Quite frankly, if I had put all that capacity in, I think maybe you would have a little bit of time believing that, but it's there. 
And I think we've got an exciting base business like you'd mentioned here that is poised for recovery. I mean we've got great portfolios, real strong brands, rich pipelines, strong leadership position. So I think the $5 here was definitely a good starting point, factoring all those elements in here, and we'll be able to kind of build from there as the year progresses."

It's a little premature to just skip across all the way to 2022. But we have -- but listen, when -- we didn't do 2021 in isolation. So yes, we looked at 2022 and looked at all those different scenarios that I talked about. So I can probably give you",511,"Sure. It's a little premature to just skip across all the way to 2022. But we have -- but listen, when -- we didn't do 2021 in isolation. So yes, we looked at 2022 and looked at all those different scenarios that I talked about. So I can probably give you some general comments over here. I mean I think we're forecasting a lot of growth this year, and we're going to be looking to build on it. 
Prior to the pandemic, The Street consensus for 2023 EPS was just under $5. So we're targeting that EPS, this level this year. So in essence, we've pulled forward at least 2 full years of EPS growth. And our mindset here, Bob, is going to be that we're going to maintain that pull-forward indefinitely. We always start our process with a double-digit target every year. That's been our identity. And I have no intention of changing that identity. 
Of course, there's a couple of factors here that we need to contemplate. But even looking at those factors, we feel good that we've got the different elements here to be able to deliver on that double digit. One of those is obviously COVID and COVID testing. And even if COVID testing starts to mature a little bit in 2022, we believe there's a significant portion that's still very sustainable. 
Can we predict it perfectly today? No, I can't, not to the level that you're accustomed to get from us. But I also think that the ability to do testing in a decentralized manner, people talk a lot about how the pandemic has accelerated digital transformation in businesses, accelerated transformation in the business models. The pandemic has accelerated our decentralized testing strategy. And I think the -- I think I talked about this in the last call. I think a lot of the testing channels that we're building here that have emerged, I don't see them going away. 
On top of that, we -- as I said, we've got investment and investment spending into SG&A, but more specifically into R&D. We believe R&D is the more sustainable spend. It's the spend that allows us to sustain our top line growth rate. So I would expect that these investments that we've made in Q4 and definitely into 2021 that, that will have an impact on our base business growth rate. We've always talked about our base business being sustainable at [ 7 to 8 ], and I would expect these investments to be able to accelerate on that. 
And I guess the third part to that question of yours about confidence on delivering double digits in 2022 is we've got a great balance sheet, and we've got strong financial health and a lot of strategic flexibility there. So I lay all of these elements out here: sustained COVID testing, the investment in the business and the strong balance sheet, just gives me confidence that even with all these different models here that we'll be able to kind of continue to deliver that identity of double-digit growth."

And then maybe if you could provide some high-level thoughts on how much of a tail of testing we might see into '22 and beyond?"

So let me talk about kind of numbers and ranges here then, and then I'll spend time talking a little bit about sustainability of the testing. As I said, I don't see the demand just kind of dropping off even with the vaccine rollout. We achieved $2.4",831,"Sure. So let me talk about kind of numbers and ranges here then, and then I'll spend time talking a little bit about sustainability of the testing. As I said, I don't see the demand just kind of dropping off even with the vaccine rollout. We achieved $2.4 billion in Q4. So if you annualize that, it'll go -- it will annualize for around $10 billion. So I can expect probably Q1 is going to be at that range of about $2.5 billion or so. 
And if you'd say, ""Okay. What does the full year range look like?"" I probably can't go beyond Q1 in terms of exactly how it's going to look like, but you can be in that $6.5 billion to $7 billion range, I would think. But we've got, as I said, plenty of capacity to go above that. So that's probably what's incorporated here, Matt, in the $5. 
But I think the big point here is the sustainability of this. And to your question there, I think a good portion is sustainable. I think a substantial portion is sustainable, which is why we were a first mover and a leader here. We started with our lab-based systems. Those were the probably the obvious part in the strategy. Since we knew we had a lot of capital equipment out in the labs, we started with that strategy to take advantage of the systems out there. And you saw that rollout happen. 
But we also knew that in a pandemic, you were going to need to add on top of that testing infrastructure. You're going to have to add faster testing, and testing that could be done at a much significant scale and that was more affordable, which is why we developed those 2 lateral flow tests. There's been a lot of visibility to BinaxNOW here in the U.S. 
We haven't talked a lot about Panbio. But Panbio uses the same technology, the same kind of antibodies. And we've got a whole supply chain that's been built outside of the United States that supplies all of the markets that we're supporting with Panbio. So both those products, they've been the bulk of our sales. We saw that in Q4. There's a lot of capacity that we've built around them, and that would continue to build around them. 
And the clinical utility of them is really strong. I mean they've been -- a lot of studies are showing their reliability here at finding people that are infectious. And I think that's a key distinction here, is your ability to use these tests in a way for being able to find those people that are infectious and not necessarily those that were infectious and that might have some remnants of DNA of the virus in their system. So I think it's sustainable. 
And I think you need to take 2 kind of views here on that, at least this is how we're looking at it. First of all, we need to think globally about this. Sometimes, we get very focused on the U.S. and what's going on in here in the U.S., but you've got 8 billion-plus people around the world. And you've got a variety of different countries that are experiencing different cycles in the disease, different cycles in their vaccination strategies. So once you really take a bigger view here, this is not going to be something that will just be done in the next couple of quarters here, if you take a real global perspective. 
And the second thing that I think is just reframing the testing. I think we think about the sustainability of testing when we think about Q2 and Q3 of last year. Long lines, not enough volume, long turnaround times, $150, $200 tests. That might be not sustainable -- not as sustainable. But if you position yourself into a 2021, 2022 world where you now have fast, easier, much more scalable test, digital tests that are priced for more accessibility and affordability, I think that's the sustained kind of business here that we see. 
So when you think about that maturing of the COVID testing market, we kind of see PCR kind of maturing first, and then we see the rapid part of the business being sustained. And listen, we've built a lot of capacity, as I said. It's probably $12 million, $13 million, $14 billion of capacity that we built in there. We haven't put it all in, but it's there. 
And then the other part that I talked about was just the sustainability of it past '22 and into 2023 as we've accelerated our point-of-care testing strategy. And everything we're doing in fighting the virus has not only a direct impact of helping reopen the economy, et cetera, but it's also seeding the market. And it's building these new testing channels. We've got testing going on at airports, hotels, urgent care, retail, universities, et cetera. So we believe that's pretty sustainable, too."

So the manufacturing, the regulatory, the R&D, and more importantly, the commercial infrastructure to be able to look across the world and support governments, workplaces, et cetera, on rolling out antigen testing internationally. So I think it's done very well. 
We've been able to kind of leverage some of the kind of joint development of Binax and Panbio. But the demand that we're seeing internationally, I would characterize also as probably just starting. It hasn't even peaked either. So I think we've got a lot of opportunity with Panbio internationally, too. And I think the teams have done a really good job there."

It's the one that allows us to build more sustainability in our top line and building R&D programs. Yes, there's opportunity to accelerate SG&A and put some of that cash to use in SG&A. And there are some businesses that could definitely benefit with more SG&A. And there's a pretty strong return as we put those in there, whether it's Libre or Nutrition. But a lot of the focus of this reinvestment here is going into R&D. 
And quite frankly, I think our pipeline has been highly productive and maybe a little bit underappreciated, I think. There's a lot of focus that goes into kind of key 3 products that you guys like to write about them as the big 3, and they get a lot of attention. And quite frankly, they should, whether it's Libre, MitraClip and Alinity. They're large multibillion-dollar segments that are underpenetrated. And we've been making clear and intentional investments in those businesses. 
I'm not going to spend a lot of time going through those, but you kind of know them, right? So Libre with Libre 3. We've got Libre 4 in development. We've been making investments in new applications for the Libre platform outside of diabetes. And MitraClip, obviously, we've got this opportunity with the CMS reimbursement. We have a fifth generation MitraClip that's also in development. And we're investing in a significant amount of clinical trials here to expand the market for us, and we'll continue to do that. 
Probably the one I'm more excited about here is the moderate risk for DMR that we've announced also. And then Alinity, you also know the story. I mean we've got 6 new systems where we're increasing the menu and expanding that geographically. So that has a lot of attention, continues to have a lot of attention, and we do resource those opportunities because they're that big. But I think it's misleading here to think that that's the sum of our innovation strategy. We're so much more than that. 
On the EPD and the Nutrition side, we're going to continue to invest in line extensions and portfolio refreshment. This is the model that we know drive the returns we need for these businesses. And I think the team has now hit their stride in terms of how to do this and how to effectively roll this out with local portfolios. EPDs rolled out over 50 products. I expect that to continue. Nutrition has done over 20, and I expect that to continue also. 
In Diagnostics, outside of Alinity, outside of COVID, we've been investing a lot in expanding our rapid testing portfolio. I've been talking about this, about the opportunity we have to take advantage of these new channels that we built and increase the penetration with different assays. So whether it's going beyond COVID or flu with RSV, strep, we've got a sexually transmitted disease platform for ID NOW, which we're excited about also, which I think has got a great opportunity. 
And then this rapid concussion test, Robbie, I think, is a great opportunity for us. Probably the biggest opportunity we have is if -- once we work through to have a whole blood test, I can envision here an opportunity across the 25,000 high schools in the U.S., the 5,000 colleges, all the sporting leagues, and that's going to take us another 1.5 years or a bit or so to get there, but I think it's a great opportunity. 
And then the device portfolio is going to continue to get a lot of investment the way we have. Obviously, Tendyne and Cephea, we want to be a leader in mitral. We've launched Tendyne in Europe. We're funding our Cephea program so that we can have a transfemoral/transseptal program for the replacement of the mitral valve. I'm very pleased with the progress we've seen on Tendyne. 
TriClip, I've talked about the opportunity with TriClip. It's not going to be as large as mitral, but it will be 30%, 35% the size of the mitral market. And we're still in the early innings here of development -- of clinical evidence development, and we're going to be leading there. 
We've made investments in increasing the competitiveness of our CRM portfolio. We've just started to roll out now more global basis, our new 2 -- our 2 new defibrillator products under the Gallant. And we've been working hard at our leadless program and making the investments in the leadless program so that not only can we come out with a single-chamber product and then be able to upgrade it to a dual-chamber product. 
I like the program. I like what we've done with it. I think we have a value proposition -- a differentiated value proposition versus the competition. 
CardioMEMS is another study that we've been funding, and there's probably going to be required some build-out of the commercial infrastructure to be able to support the rollout of that product. If you think about the opportunity we have with CardioMEMS, even at a 10% to 15% penetration on that population, you're looking at a $1 billion opportunity for us. So that is obviously getting a lot of attention. 
And then I'm very excited to come into the U.S. with the LAA and the TAVR product sometime this year. I think these are great opportunities. I like the product that we have, especially on the LAA side with Amulet. It does very well in Europe. And we'll be funding those programs, too. 
So it's more than the big 3. There's a lot here. And quite frankly, Bob and I are already going to the businesses and say, ""Okay. What was below the line that you didn't show us in the planning process?"" and ""Can we get going on those, too?"" So that's where a lot of the investment goes into R&D."

As I said in the previous question, though, David, I mean we've got a lot of organic opportunities to invest in. And I like those organic opportunities. So they obviously do get a lot of our attention right now. 
But if you think about M&A, yes, it's got to be a good fit strategically, and it's got to align with our growth orientation here. I mean I'm not going to look at something that's going to dilute our top line growth rate, and obviously, is able to generate a return for our shareholders. So there's a lot of activity. There's a lot of, I'd say, high valuations right now so. 
But to the extent that we do something this year, it would be more like tuck-in in nature to be able to kind of augment some of these portfolios. So that's probably the better way to put it to you."

But it's still top of our priorities here because it's such a huge opportunity for us. We had a real strong quarter in Q4. We exited with a lot of momentum going into this year, especially in the U.S. I think global sales were $0.75 billion, up 35%. 
And I expect the absolute dollar amount to get bigger. And usually when that happens, we think, well, gee, law of big numbers, right, the percentages are going to go down. And I don't think so. I think that we're going to see continuing growth rate expansion on our Libre business here. So I kind of look at Libre as a 2021 growth that should start at 40% and go from there. 
A lot of focus on the U.S. on the rollout -- on Libre 2 rollout. We're seeing a lot of the trend shifts, whether it's revenue, whether it's new users. I think the superior accuracy messaging here is definitely coming through, and it's got all the other advantages of our value proposition. 
I think one of the good things about the pharmacy channel is that there's a lot of available data. There's a lot of available third-party audited data. And when I do the reviews with the team, we spend a lot of time looking at them. And it tells me you can't hide behind these -- you can't hide when we're in the pharmacy, like all this data is available. 
And I think it's done really well in the U.S. Obviously, I want it to do better, but I can't look at it and not be objective that there's obviously been a trend shift here, whether it's NBRxs, TRxs, refill rates, et cetera. One of them that I'm extremely happy to see is the Rx fulfillment rate. So when a consumer goes to the pharmacy with a prescription, swipes the card, do they get that prescription filled, right? And there's factors that drive somebody to not get it filled. It's usually a copay. 
And what we've seen with the Libre Rx fulfillment rate is that about 9 out of 10 get filled. And you compare that to our competitor at about 6 out of 10, I think the value proposition here is really strong, meaning that we can invest in DTC advertising. We can invest more in this platform. And we're seeing the value proposition come through as it relates to Rx fulfillment rates. 
So I'd say the focus on U.S. is., now to your question on L3, we're already here. We've been working through, say, the reimbursement contracting process. It probably got delayed a little bit in Q4 in terms of our expectations, given some of the focus of a lot of the international countries focusing on COVID. But we're all ready. Manufacturing is ready. In fact, between Libre 2 and Libre 3, we've got hundreds of millions of sensors here of capacity. And I think that ties a little bit to the expectation that we have for this segment, which is you've got close to 80 million people that could benefit from this target, which is why we took a very different approach in our strategy, a much mass-market approach that develop a product that's consumer-friendly, intuitive, make sure that it can provide measurable benefits and price it for mass adoption. And that's working out very well. 
So we should see a Libre 3 launch international in Q1. And then in the U.S., we'll issue a release when we get approval."

And we're hearing a lot of our accounts in the U.S. and international are really wanting to kind of push stronger and a sense here that with a vaccine, they feel more confident to be able to build it. 
So I think you'll see probably the biggest comp issue, I'd say, is probably Q2. I mean I think that's when we saw the big drop. Q1 was probably more towards the end of the quarter, the last 2 weeks of March. So I kind of see the more normalization growth rates. So that -- those kind of growth rates that you saw from our device business, excluding diabetes, to look more like that in -- starting in Q3. But we'll have a nice build, I think, to there as the year progresses."

We saw steady improvement in the fourth quarter on gross margin from the prior quarter. It was up about 100 basis points. And we saw that kind of steady improvement coming out of the second quarter, where we saw the impact of the decline in kind of the Medical Device area. And so third quarter, fourth quarter is getting improvement. And we would expect that to continue, to go steadily up as we see recovery in those base businesses. We see more normalization kind of coming through our manufacturing plants as well as that volume kind of normalizes. 
In the fourth quarter, you did also see the impact of some of the investments that we're making in that capacity that Robert talked about. And so that was a bit of an offset that you saw kind of come through in the fourth quarter."

I mean when we looked at how the impact of COVID progressed geographically, we saw it, for some reason, kind of trail a little bit kind of the developed markets, whether it was Europe and the U.S. We reall",622,"Sure. So on EPD, yes, we did see a nice recovery. I mean when we looked at how the impact of COVID progressed geographically, we saw it, for some reason, kind of trail a little bit kind of the developed markets, whether it was Europe and the U.S. We really started to feel the impact on our EPD business, which is, as you know, mostly emerging markets, started to see it coming out of Q2 and then big in Q3 as a lot of those countries kind of shut down. And the way the model works is you still need a prescription and you need your physician or you need to go to your hospital to get that prescription. 
So when we looked at Q4, we're actually not surprised, but it was good to see that it came in a little bit higher than what we had expected because we were trying to model it very similar to what we saw in some of the other businesses. And it came back faster. 
At the same time, there's -- it's not a nice kind of linear forecast in these markets. And there's -- it does tend to bounce up around. I mean, we had a 9%, 10% growth in Q1. There was some stocking effect there in kind of February and March in some of the markets, so we'll have a comp over there. But what I -- what we look at is we're looking at the IMS demand market progression in all these markets that we're competing in. 
And we're seeing a nice recovery. So I expect that just to sequentially kind of get better, and I guess similar to the comment on devices, get back to that high single-digit growth rate towards second half. 
Oh, and then you also had a question on change of care. I mean I think a lot has happened, right? And we've tried to focus on the areas that we feel that we can contribute and benefit. One of them I've talked about is this decentralization of testing and how the pandemic has accelerated that decentralization for us. We believed in it. We believe that we could drive it and create a whole new testing channel when we did the Alere acquisition. And this has kind of brought it forward about -- probably about 2 years in terms of where we are today versus where we thought we're going to be. 
So that's an important part for us. Being able to have access to fast, affordable and digitally connected testing is something that I think is going to be here and here to stay. Whether it's a COVID test or other tests, I think that is a change a little bit in the delivery, at least on the diagnostic side. 
And then the other side that I'd say is one that we've been working on for quite some bit is the connectivity of our devices and the intersection of digital and health care and how those devices are being connected. You've seen what we've done across all of our portfolio on devices, and we'll continue to position our products in such a way where we can develop them and take advantage of that. 
For Neuromodulation, we've just announced here a very interesting platform, which I think is going to have a significant impact on how that business and business model works with a much more connected care platform, where patients get to report their outcomes and eventually get to remote programming, which is a huge change in that business model. 
So I'd say the COVID testing, accelerating decentralization of testing and connected care are probably the 2 pandemic-driven changes that we're focusing on taking advantage of."

I guess on the modeling thing, listen, you could say there could be a drop-off, but you could say there could be an increase or it could stay. So I think the modeling piece here is a little bit difficult. I think we're going to have a lot more understanding as we get towards the summer. But I think, at least for the first half, you've got -- we've got sufficient capacity here to kind of explore the demand that exists both in the U.S. and globally. 
So yes, I'm not sure right now that you can kind of easily kind of just put that model down like that, but it's just too soon. 
Regarding your question on mutations and the impact there, a lot of the mutations here -- I don't want to get too wonky here. But we've been looking at this, Vijay, since the beginning. We have a group of, we call them the virus hunters. They're constantly looking and studying and getting their hands on samples to be able to kind of, not only test our existing products but even to develop new ones. And I'd say, right now, the mutations are happening. The ones that you've referenced, the South African one and the U.K. one, those are happening on what we would call the spike protein or what we call the S protein. The rapid antigen test that we have are actually targeting the nucleocapsid protein, what we call the N protein. 
So in silico analysis says no impact. The U.K. NIH kind of did a study on Panbio and found the U.K. variant to not influence the sensitivity of the Panbio, but we're also collecting as many samples as we can from U.K., South Africa, Brazil, et cetera, and making sure that we're constantly studying that to ensure that there's no change to the sensitivity of the test that we've developed. 
On the molecular side, whether it's ID NOW -- ID NOW looks at a different gene, the RPDP genes. It's completely different thing, and similar thing also with the PCR. So I think those are, right now, from everything we know, wouldn't be impacted by the mutations. We're more focused on the antigen with the mutations on those protein sequences. So I feel good about that right now. But obviously, we're constantly vigilant here. 
So let me just close here. I'd say we had a real strong 2020, very strong performance, almost 10% top line growth, 13% EPS. We're forecasting 2021 here at least $5. And like I said, I think we've got opportunity to have upside to that. But still already at $5, it's already at a 37% increase. And in that $5, we're also making a lot of investments in R&D to be able to sustain our growth going forward. So we feel confident about maintaining our double digit in 2022. Significant portion of our COVID testing, we believe, is sustainable. We've made investments or have a plan here to lay out investments in our base business that I think will accelerate our growth rate. And in some of the questions here, we've got a strong balance sheet here. So you combine those 3 elements here, I think we've got not only a strong '21 forecast but a pretty good line of sight here in terms of delivering double digits for 2022. So thanks."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported another highly successful year for Abbott during what's been the single most disruptive health care event in our lifetimes.

Today, we reported another highly successful year for Abbott during what's been the single most disruptive health care event in our lifetimes. For the full year, we reported organic sales growth of nearly 10% and ongoing earnings per share of $3.65, which reflects double-digit growth and is at the upper end of our guidance range we set last January when we were expecting a normal economy. Performance like this after the pandemic struck is a real achievement and demonstrates the strength of our diversified business model. 
The normal times, it maximizes our growth opportunities, and during the pandemic, it's been tested by a global crisis and proven to be highly resilient. It should come as no surprise that our performance was led by our Diagnostics business. COVID-19 dominated the year for us and the world, and our primary response came in the form of diagnostic tests to identify the virus. 
In total, we delivered more than 400 million COVID tests since the start of the pandemic, including more than 300 million tests in the fourth quarter alone. 
But as we've discussed before, the year was not all Diagnostics and COVID. Our more consumer-facing businesses, Nutrition, Diabetes Care and Established Pharmaceuticals all contribute growth for the year, and we continue to launch an impressive stream of innovations across our businesses. And I'll touch on some of these new products in more detail in just a moment. 
We exited 2020 with tremendous momentum, including total sales growth of more than 28% and ongoing earnings per share growth of more than 50% in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to 2021. We're forecasting another year of top-tier performance. As we announced this morning, we forecast ongoing earnings per share of at least $5 in 2021, reflecting growth of more than 35% compared to last year. And because we're building on top of our strong 2020 performance, our forecasted 2021 earnings per share is more than 50% higher than our pre-pandemic EPS in 2019, which is highly unique and differentiated in this environment. 
I'll now provide more details on our 2020 results before turning over the call to Bob. And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased around 4.5% for both the fourth quarter and full year. 
Strong growth of Ensure, our market-leading complete and balanced nutrition brand, and Glucerna, our leading diabetes nutrition brand, led to double-digit growth in Adult Nutrition for both the quarter and full year. In Pediatric Nutrition, U.S. sales growth of more than 5% last year was led by increased market share of Similac, our market-leading infant formula brand. International Pediatric Nutrition sales continued to be impacted by challenging market conditions in Greater China. 
During the past year, we continue to expand our Nutrition portfolio with several new product and line extensions, including the continued rollout of infant formula products across our Similac brand family that contain human oligosaccharide or HMO, which supports a healthy immune system. Global expansion of our PediaSure, Glucerna and Ensure brands, including the continued rollout of Ensure high-protein products; and the launch of 4 new Pedialyte rehydration products: Pedialyte Zero Sugar, Sport, Organic and Immune Support. 
For 2021, we're forecasting similar sales growth for our global Nutrition business and a continued strong cadence of new product introductions. 
Turning to Medical Devices, where sales were relatively flat in the fourth quarter. Strong double-digit growth in Diabetes Care was offset by lower sales in our Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation businesses due to challenging conditions as COVID case rates surged in certain geographies towards the end of the quarter. As we saw throughout last summer and fall, we expect procedure volumes to improve in these businesses as COVID case rates subside. 
In Diabetes Care, sales grew nearly 30% for the fourth quarter and full year, led by FreeStyle Libre, our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring system. In the U.S., Libre sales grew 50% last year. And outside the U.S., Libre sales grew 40%, surpassing $2 billion of international sales for the full year 2020. 
This past year was possibly our most productive ever in terms of new product approvals and launches across our Medical Device portfolio. Let me touch on a handful. 
First, the approval of MitraClip Gen 4, the latest generation of our market-leading system to repair a leaky mitral heart valve. Just last week in the U.S., Medicare expanded reimbursement coverage for MitraClip, which significantly expands the eligible patient population that can benefit from this life-changing technology. 
CE Mark of Tendyne, a first-of-its-kind minimally invasive device to replace a faulty mitral valve; and the CE Mark of TriClip, our minimally invasive clip technology to repair a leaky tricuspid heart valve. Long considered the forgotten valve, TriClip brings an important new solution to patients that have previously had very few treatment options. 
Abbott now offers minimally invasive device therapies for 3 valves in the heart: the aortic, the mitral and the tricuspid valves. We also launched 2 cardiac rhythm defibrillation products under our Gallant brand that include Bluetooth capabilities to align with our strategy in remote monitoring and digitally connected care. 
Also saw the approval of EnSite X, our next-generation 3D cardiac mapping technology; and U.S. approval of FreeStyle Libre 2 and CE Mark for Libre 3, the latest generations of our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring systems; and CE Mark of Libre Sense Glucose Sport, the first product in our strategy to expand use of our wearable biosensor technology into mass-market opportunities beyond diabetes. As you can see, it was a highly productive year for our pipeline, and quite frankly, there's even more I could highlight. 
In 2021, we're forecasting continued strong double-digit growth in our Diabetes Care business, led by FreeStyle Libre, and steady improvements in our Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation businesses, fueled by the continued business recovery, the society works its way through COVID-19 and on the strength of our recent and upcoming new product launches. 
Moving to Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD, where sales increased 3.5% in the fourth quarter, reflecting sequential improvement versus the prior quarter. Despite COVID, EPD sales increased 2% overall in 2020, demonstrating the resilience of our business model even in this challenging environment. Growth this past year was led by sales in India, Russia, China and Brazil. 
During the year, EPD continued to strengthen its portfolio with more than 50 new product launches across our key emerging markets. As we've discussed before, new product introductions in EPD are more incremental in nature, and the steady cadence of portfolio expansion and refreshment we're achieving is an important element of our sustainable growth strategy. We forecast demand and growth rate improvements in EPD during 2021 as well as a continued steady cadence of new product introductions that will contribute to growth. 
And I'll wrap up with our Diagnostic business, where sales grew nearly 110% in the quarter, driven by $2.4 billion of COVID testing-related sales. We realized very early that a variety of different testing solutions would be required to tackle the pandemic. 
With that understanding, starting last March, we developed and launched an entire portfolio of tests to target the virus. The biggest contribution in the fourth quarter came from our rapid lateral flow test to detect the virus, which includes BinaxNOW in the U.S. and Panbio internationally. These are highly portable, reliable and affordable tests and in just 50 minutes can detect if someone is infectious without the use of an instrument, which means the test can be performed in virtually any setting, such as physician office, pharmacies, urgent care centers, workplace settings and even at home. 
As part of our pandemic response efforts, we also developed and launched a digital solution that pairs with these tests called NAVICA, which allows people to receive and display test results on their mobile devices. But our efforts didn't stop at developing these tests. We also ramped up manufacturing capacity on a massive scale and now producing more than 100 million of these 2 tests combined per month. 
While our COVID testing efforts have clearly received a lot of attention, we've also remained focused on the launch and rollout of Alinity, our suite of innovative diagnostic instruments. We continue to retain existing businesses and capture share at strong rates. And we continue to build on our test menus for these instruments. 
Last year, we initiated the U.S. launch of Alinity m for molecular testing. This launch included a COVID test, which helped jump-start demand for this innovative, highly automated and differentiated molecular testing platform. 
And earlier this month, we announced U.S. FDA clearance for the first rapid handheld blood test for concussions. This test measures certain biomarkers found in blood after a head trauma event and produce the result within 15 minutes after a plasma sample is inserted in our i-STAT Alinity handheld device. 
Building on this initial clearance, we're also working on a whole blood point-of-care test under FDA breakthrough designation. And our vision is to develop a 15-minute portable test that can be used in any settings where people might experience head injuries that require quick evaluation. 
So in summary, despite the challenging environment, we achieved the upper end of the EPS range we set last January before anyone knew the extent of the COVID pandemic, demonstrating the strength, resilience of our diversified business model and our superior execution. Our new product pipeline continues to be incredibly productive, delivering groundbreaking innovations and a steady cadence of important new products, with more on the horizon. 
We continue to lead in the area of diagnostic testing for COVID, which is helping to fight the virus, and accelerating our long-term decentralized testing strategy. And we're forecasting more than 35% adjusted EPS growth in 2021, which is truly unique in this environment. 
I'll now turn over the call to Bob. Bob?"

As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. 
Turning to our results. Sales for the fourth quarter increased 28.4%, which was led by strong performance in Nutrition and Diabetes Care, along with global COVID testing-related sales of $2.4 billion in the quarter. Foreign exchange had a favorable impact of 0.3% on sales, which was somewhat favorable compared to expectations had exchange rates held steady since the time of our earnings call in October. Reported sales increased 28.7% in the quarter. 
Regarding other aspects of the P&L. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.5% of sales. R&D investment was 6% of sales. And SG&A expense was 23.5% of sales. Our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate of 14.1% reflects the adjustment required to align our tax expense with our revised full year effective tax rate of 15%. This is somewhat lower than the estimate we provided in October due to a shift in the mix of our geographic and business income. 
Turning to our outlook for the full year 2021. Today, we issued guidance for full year adjusted earnings per share of at least $5. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a favorable impact of approximately 3.5% on our reported sales, which includes an expected favorable impact of approximately 3% on our first quarter reported sales. We forecast full year net interest expense of around $515 million, nonoperating income of around $230 million and a full year adjusted tax rate of 15%.

And as I said in my remarks, the $5 -- the at least $5 target for 2021 is about 50% higher than where we were in 2019. 
And what I can say is that we are, Bob and myself, as we manage the business, especially over these last couple of months and going into this year, we've been looking at 2-year CAGRs across our businesses. And then -- I think that's the right way to look at it, is to kind of look at what happened in 2020. And it's easy for some of the businesses to come up and post double-digit kind of growth for us. So we're really looking on a 2-year CAGR basis. 
The points that you touched on are all the points that we've looked at, and we've been modeling several different scenarios. So I'll touch on those because they're all elements of how we built to our at least $5. First of all, obviously, COVID testing, it's been a big driver for us, and it will continue to be a big driver. I expect testing demand is still going to remain high even as the vaccines roll out. I don't think we've even seen testing demand peak yet. 
So we built a lot of capacity, and we've talked about that over the last year, the capacity that we built. But we didn't put it all in. We didn't put it all in into that $5. So -- but we don't all see it going away either. But there's enough capacity there, testing capacity, sufficient testing capacity for us to be able to meet this kind of growing demand right now. 
The other part of our forecast here, without a doubt, is looking at our base business and the recovery of our base business, specifically the ones that were hit probably more heavily by the COVID, which was some of our device businesses and our routine testing and routine lab testing. These are important procedures and life-saving procedures. They're important routine tests to do. So you can't just keep pushing them out indefinitely. And what we saw in Q3 of last year as those rates -- hospitalization rates start to come down, we started to see the pickup of our procedures and of our core testing. And we actually saw growth in several months in Q3 and going into Q4. And obviously, that got impacted probably around Thanksgiving. 
So we've seen that these can recover, and we do have that modeled in into that $5, which is a recovery of these businesses at a similar rate of what we saw in Q3 in summer and the fall. 
I'd say the third kind of key element in there is our consumer businesses that probably weren't as impacted and did pretty well during the pandemic. We expect those businesses to either continue their trajectory or get better. I mean I think Nutrition had a really great year last year. I expect them to have a very similar year this year with a lot of new product launches. EPD should get sequentially better. We saw that in Q4. Early indications in January show that recovery continuing. 
And quite frankly, Libre, I expect to do better with all the innovation and investment we're making there. So those businesses will do well. 
And then the fourth element that we've modeled a lot is spending and ability to reinvest in the businesses and areas that we thought that we could do with more investment, whether it's SG&A, and more specifically in R&D, and accelerate some of our programs. I think you saw some of that in our Q4 results, where we beat consensus while at the same time, investing more in R&D and SG&A. 
So we looked at these 4 elements here, Bob, and we modeled it variety of different ways and just feel really good that this was a good floor, a good starting point at $5. Quite frankly, if anything, we could have significant upside over here. And it's just really going to depend a little bit on how we think about COVID testing going forward. 
So I kind of saw the $5 here as, okay, it's a 37% increase versus 2020, which grew 13%. And we've got probable upside to that, while at the same time, an opportunity to invest in the business, invest in SG&A, more specifically in R&D. We've got a leading COVID test portfolio here with a variety of different tests and capacity that we haven't dialed all in. Quite frankly, if I had put all that capacity in, I think maybe you would have a little bit of time believing that, but it's there. 
And I think we've got an exciting base business like you'd mentioned here that is poised for recovery. I mean we've got great portfolios, real strong brands, rich pipelines, strong leadership position. So I think the $5 here was definitely a good starting point, factoring all those elements in here, and we'll be able to kind of build from there as the year progresses."

It's a little premature to just skip across all the way to 2022. But we have -- but listen, when -- we didn't do 2021 in isolation. So yes, we looked at 2022 and looked at all those different scenarios that I talked about. So I can probably give you",511,"Sure. It's a little premature to just skip across all the way to 2022. But we have -- but listen, when -- we didn't do 2021 in isolation. So yes, we looked at 2022 and looked at all those different scenarios that I talked about. So I can probably give you some general comments over here. I mean I think we're forecasting a lot of growth this year, and we're going to be looking to build on it. 
Prior to the pandemic, The Street consensus for 2023 EPS was just under $5. So we're targeting that EPS, this level this year. So in essence, we've pulled forward at least 2 full years of EPS growth. And our mindset here, Bob, is going to be that we're going to maintain that pull-forward indefinitely. We always start our process with a double-digit target every year. That's been our identity. And I have no intention of changing that identity. 
Of course, there's a couple of factors here that we need to contemplate. But even looking at those factors, we feel good that we've got the different elements here to be able to deliver on that double digit. One of those is obviously COVID and COVID testing. And even if COVID testing starts to mature a little bit in 2022, we believe there's a significant portion that's still very sustainable. 
Can we predict it perfectly today? No, I can't, not to the level that you're accustomed to get from us. But I also think that the ability to do testing in a decentralized manner, people talk a lot about how the pandemic has accelerated digital transformation in businesses, accelerated transformation in the business models. The pandemic has accelerated our decentralized testing strategy. And I think the -- I think I talked about this in the last call. I think a lot of the testing channels that we're building here that have emerged, I don't see them going away. 
On top of that, we -- as I said, we've got investment and investment spending into SG&A, but more specifically into R&D. We believe R&D is the more sustainable spend. It's the spend that allows us to sustain our top line growth rate. So I would expect that these investments that we've made in Q4 and definitely into 2021 that, that will have an impact on our base business growth rate. We've always talked about our base business being sustainable at [ 7 to 8 ], and I would expect these investments to be able to accelerate on that. 
And I guess the third part to that question of yours about confidence on delivering double digits in 2022 is we've got a great balance sheet, and we've got strong financial health and a lot of strategic flexibility there. So I lay all of these elements out here: sustained COVID testing, the investment in the business and the strong balance sheet, just gives me confidence that even with all these different models here that we'll be able to kind of continue to deliver that identity of double-digit growth."

And then maybe if you could provide some high-level thoughts on how much of a tail of testing we might see into '22 and beyond?"

So let me talk about kind of numbers and ranges here then, and then I'll spend time talking a little bit about sustainability of the testing. As I said, I don't see the demand just kind of dropping off even with the vaccine rollout. We achieved $2.4",831,"Sure. So let me talk about kind of numbers and ranges here then, and then I'll spend time talking a little bit about sustainability of the testing. As I said, I don't see the demand just kind of dropping off even with the vaccine rollout. We achieved $2.4 billion in Q4. So if you annualize that, it'll go -- it will annualize for around $10 billion. So I can expect probably Q1 is going to be at that range of about $2.5 billion or so. 
And if you'd say, ""Okay. What does the full year range look like?"" I probably can't go beyond Q1 in terms of exactly how it's going to look like, but you can be in that $6.5 billion to $7 billion range, I would think. But we've got, as I said, plenty of capacity to go above that. So that's probably what's incorporated here, Matt, in the $5. 
But I think the big point here is the sustainability of this. And to your question there, I think a good portion is sustainable. I think a substantial portion is sustainable, which is why we were a first mover and a leader here. We started with our lab-based systems. Those were the probably the obvious part in the strategy. Since we knew we had a lot of capital equipment out in the labs, we started with that strategy to take advantage of the systems out there. And you saw that rollout happen. 
But we also knew that in a pandemic, you were going to need to add on top of that testing infrastructure. You're going to have to add faster testing, and testing that could be done at a much significant scale and that was more affordable, which is why we developed those 2 lateral flow tests. There's been a lot of visibility to BinaxNOW here in the U.S. 
We haven't talked a lot about Panbio. But Panbio uses the same technology, the same kind of antibodies. And we've got a whole supply chain that's been built outside of the United States that supplies all of the markets that we're supporting with Panbio. So both those products, they've been the bulk of our sales. We saw that in Q4. There's a lot of capacity that we've built around them, and that would continue to build around them. 
And the clinical utility of them is really strong. I mean they've been -- a lot of studies are showing their reliability here at finding people that are infectious. And I think that's a key distinction here, is your ability to use these tests in a way for being able to find those people that are infectious and not necessarily those that were infectious and that might have some remnants of DNA of the virus in their system. So I think it's sustainable. 
And I think you need to take 2 kind of views here on that, at least this is how we're looking at it. First of all, we need to think globally about this. Sometimes, we get very focused on the U.S. and what's going on in here in the U.S., but you've got 8 billion-plus people around the world. And you've got a variety of different countries that are experiencing different cycles in the disease, different cycles in their vaccination strategies. So once you really take a bigger view here, this is not going to be something that will just be done in the next couple of quarters here, if you take a real global perspective. 
And the second thing that I think is just reframing the testing. I think we think about the sustainability of testing when we think about Q2 and Q3 of last year. Long lines, not enough volume, long turnaround times, $150, $200 tests. That might be not sustainable -- not as sustainable. But if you position yourself into a 2021, 2022 world where you now have fast, easier, much more scalable test, digital tests that are priced for more accessibility and affordability, I think that's the sustained kind of business here that we see. 
So when you think about that maturing of the COVID testing market, we kind of see PCR kind of maturing first, and then we see the rapid part of the business being sustained. And listen, we've built a lot of capacity, as I said. It's probably $12 million, $13 million, $14 billion of capacity that we built in there. We haven't put it all in, but it's there. 
And then the other part that I talked about was just the sustainability of it past '22 and into 2023 as we've accelerated our point-of-care testing strategy. And everything we're doing in fighting the virus has not only a direct impact of helping reopen the economy, et cetera, but it's also seeding the market. And it's building these new testing channels. We've got testing going on at airports, hotels, urgent care, retail, universities, et cetera. So we believe that's pretty sustainable, too."

So the manufacturing, the regulatory, the R&D, and more importantly, the commercial infrastructure to be able to look across the world and support governments, workplaces, et cetera, on rolling out antigen testing internationally. So I think it's done very well. 
We've been able to kind of leverage some of the kind of joint development of Binax and Panbio. But the demand that we're seeing internationally, I would characterize also as probably just starting. It hasn't even peaked either. So I think we've got a lot of opportunity with Panbio internationally, too. And I think the teams have done a really good job there."

It's the one that allows us to build more sustainability in our top line and building R&D programs. Yes, there's opportunity to accelerate SG&A and put some of that cash to use in SG&A. And there are some businesses that could definitely benefit with more SG&A. And there's a pretty strong return as we put those in there, whether it's Libre or Nutrition. But a lot of the focus of this reinvestment here is going into R&D. 
And quite frankly, I think our pipeline has been highly productive and maybe a little bit underappreciated, I think. There's a lot of focus that goes into kind of key 3 products that you guys like to write about them as the big 3, and they get a lot of attention. And quite frankly, they should, whether it's Libre, MitraClip and Alinity. They're large multibillion-dollar segments that are underpenetrated. And we've been making clear and intentional investments in those businesses. 
I'm not going to spend a lot of time going through those, but you kind of know them, right? So Libre with Libre 3. We've got Libre 4 in development. We've been making investments in new applications for the Libre platform outside of diabetes. And MitraClip, obviously, we've got this opportunity with the CMS reimbursement. We have a fifth generation MitraClip that's also in development. And we're investing in a significant amount of clinical trials here to expand the market for us, and we'll continue to do that. 
Probably the one I'm more excited about here is the moderate risk for DMR that we've announced also. And then Alinity, you also know the story. I mean we've got 6 new systems where we're increasing the menu and expanding that geographically. So that has a lot of attention, continues to have a lot of attention, and we do resource those opportunities because they're that big. But I think it's misleading here to think that that's the sum of our innovation strategy. We're so much more than that. 
On the EPD and the Nutrition side, we're going to continue to invest in line extensions and portfolio refreshment. This is the model that we know drive the returns we need for these businesses. And I think the team has now hit their stride in terms of how to do this and how to effectively roll this out with local portfolios. EPDs rolled out over 50 products. I expect that to continue. Nutrition has done over 20, and I expect that to continue also. 
In Diagnostics, outside of Alinity, outside of COVID, we've been investing a lot in expanding our rapid testing portfolio. I've been talking about this, about the opportunity we have to take advantage of these new channels that we built and increase the penetration with different assays. So whether it's going beyond COVID or flu with RSV, strep, we've got a sexually transmitted disease platform for ID NOW, which we're excited about also, which I think has got a great opportunity. 
And then this rapid concussion test, Robbie, I think, is a great opportunity for us. Probably the biggest opportunity we have is if -- once we work through to have a whole blood test, I can envision here an opportunity across the 25,000 high schools in the U.S., the 5,000 colleges, all the sporting leagues, and that's going to take us another 1.5 years or a bit or so to get there, but I think it's a great opportunity. 
And then the device portfolio is going to continue to get a lot of investment the way we have. Obviously, Tendyne and Cephea, we want to be a leader in mitral. We've launched Tendyne in Europe. We're funding our Cephea program so that we can have a transfemoral/transseptal program for the replacement of the mitral valve. I'm very pleased with the progress we've seen on Tendyne. 
TriClip, I've talked about the opportunity with TriClip. It's not going to be as large as mitral, but it will be 30%, 35% the size of the mitral market. And we're still in the early innings here of development -- of clinical evidence development, and we're going to be leading there. 
We've made investments in increasing the competitiveness of our CRM portfolio. We've just started to roll out now more global basis, our new 2 -- our 2 new defibrillator products under the Gallant. And we've been working hard at our leadless program and making the investments in the leadless program so that not only can we come out with a single-chamber product and then be able to upgrade it to a dual-chamber product. 
I like the program. I like what we've done with it. I think we have a value proposition -- a differentiated value proposition versus the competition. 
CardioMEMS is another study that we've been funding, and there's probably going to be required some build-out of the commercial infrastructure to be able to support the rollout of that product. If you think about the opportunity we have with CardioMEMS, even at a 10% to 15% penetration on that population, you're looking at a $1 billion opportunity for us. So that is obviously getting a lot of attention. 
And then I'm very excited to come into the U.S. with the LAA and the TAVR product sometime this year. I think these are great opportunities. I like the product that we have, especially on the LAA side with Amulet. It does very well in Europe. And we'll be funding those programs, too. 
So it's more than the big 3. There's a lot here. And quite frankly, Bob and I are already going to the businesses and say, ""Okay. What was below the line that you didn't show us in the planning process?"" and ""Can we get going on those, too?"" So that's where a lot of the investment goes into R&D."

I mean I'm not going to look at something that's going to dilute our top line growth rate, and obviously, is able to generate a return for our shareholders. So there's a lot of activity. There's a lot of, I'd say, high valuations right now so. 
But to the extent that we do something this year, it would be more like tuck-in in nature to be able to kind of augment some of these portfolios. So that's probably the better way to put it to you."

But it's still top of our priorities here because it's such a huge opportunity for us. We had a real strong quarter in Q4. We exited with a lot of momentum going into this year, especially in the U.S. I think global sales were $0.75 billion, up 35%. 
And I expect the absolute dollar amount to get bigger. And usually when that happens, we think, well, gee, law of big numbers, right, the percentages are going to go down. And I don't think so. I think that we're going to see continuing growth rate expansion on our Libre business here. So I kind of look at Libre as a 2021 growth that should start at 40% and go from there. 
A lot of focus on the U.S. on the rollout -- on Libre 2 rollout. We're seeing a lot of the trend shifts, whether it's revenue, whether it's new users. I think the superior accuracy messaging here is definitely coming through, and it's got all the other advantages of our value proposition. 
I think one of the good things about the pharmacy channel is that there's a lot of available data. There's a lot of available third-party audited data. And when I do the reviews with the team, we spend a lot of time looking at them. And it tells me you can't hide behind these -- you can't hide when we're in the pharmacy, like all this data is available. 
And I think it's done really well in the U.S. Obviously, I want it to do better, but I can't look at it and not be objective that there's obviously been a trend shift here, whether it's NBRxs, TRxs, refill rates, et cetera. One of them that I'm extremely happy to see is the Rx fulfillment rate. So when a consumer goes to the pharmacy with a prescription, swipes the card, do they get that prescription filled, right? And there's factors that drive somebody to not get it filled. It's usually a copay. 
And what we've seen with the Libre Rx fulfillment rate is that about 9 out of 10 get filled. And you compare that to our competitor at about 6 out of 10, I think the value proposition here is really strong, meaning that we can invest in DTC advertising. We can invest more in this platform. And we're seeing the value proposition come through as it relates to Rx fulfillment rates. 
So I'd say the focus on U.S. is., now to your question on L3, we're already here. We've been working through, say, the reimbursement contracting process. It probably got delayed a little bit in Q4 in terms of our expectations, given some of the focus of a lot of the international countries focusing on COVID. But we're all ready. Manufacturing is ready. In fact, between Libre 2 and Libre 3, we've got hundreds of millions of sensors here of capacity. And I think that ties a little bit to the expectation that we have for this segment, which is you've got close to 80 million people that could benefit from this target, which is why we took a very different approach in our strategy, a much mass-market approach that develop a product that's consumer-friendly, intuitive, make sure that it can provide measurable benefits and price it for mass adoption. And that's working out very well. 
So we should see a Libre 3 launch international in Q1. And then in the U.S., we'll issue a release when we get approval."

Not an absolute drop, so not trying to mirror the absolute number of hospitalizations, but at least the rate of decline of hospitalizations and tying it into the increase in the procedures. A lot of these procedures are lifesaving. Some of them are electives, some of them are lifesaving. And we're hearing a lot of our accounts in the U.S. and international are really wanting to kind of push stronger and a sense here that with a vaccine, they feel more confident to be able to build it. 
So I think you'll see probably the biggest comp issue, I'd say, is probably Q2. I mean I think that's when we saw the big drop. Q1 was probably more towards the end of the quarter, the last 2 weeks of March. So I kind of see the more normalization growth rates. So that -- those kind of growth rates that you saw from our device business, excluding diabetes, to look more like that in -- starting in Q3. But we'll have a nice build, I think, to there as the year progresses."

We see more normalization kind of coming through our manufacturing plants as well as that volume kind of normalizes.

So on EPD, yes, we did see a nice recovery. I mean when we looked at how the impact of COVID progressed geographically, we saw it, for some reason, kind of trail a little bit kind of the developed markets, whether it was Europe and the U.S. We really started to feel the impact on our EPD business, which is, as you know, mostly emerging markets, started to see it coming out of Q2 and then big in Q3 as a lot of those countries kind of shut down. And the way the model works is you still need a prescription and you need your physician or you need to go to your hospital to get that prescription. 
So when we looked at Q4, we're actually not surprised, but it was good to see that it came in a little bit higher than what we had expected because we were trying to model it very similar to what we saw in some of the other businesses. And it came back faster. 
At the same time, there's -- it's not a nice kind of linear forecast in these markets. And there's -- it does tend to bounce up around. I mean, we had a 9%, 10% growth in Q1. There was some stocking effect there in kind of February and March in some of the markets, so we'll have a comp over there. But what I -- what we look at is we're looking at the IMS demand market progression in all these markets that we're competing in. 
And we're seeing a nice recovery. So I expect that just to sequentially kind of get better, and I guess similar to the comment on devices, get back to that high single-digit growth rate towards second half. 
Oh, and then you also had a question on change of care. I mean I think a lot has happened, right? And we've tried to focus on the areas that we feel that we can contribute and benefit. One of them I've talked about is this decentralization of testing and how the pandemic has accelerated that decentralization for us. We believed in it. We believe that we could drive it and create a whole new testing channel when we did the Alere acquisition. And this has kind of brought it forward about -- probably about 2 years in terms of where we are today versus where we thought we're going to be. 
So that's an important part for us. Being able to have access to fast, affordable and digitally connected testing is something that I think is going to be here and here to stay. Whether it's a COVID test or other tests, I think that is a change a little bit in the delivery, at least on the diagnostic side. 
And then the other side that I'd say is one that we've been working on for quite some bit is the connectivity of our devices and the intersection of digital and health care and how those devices are being connected. You've seen what we've done across all of our portfolio on devices, and we'll continue to position our products in such a way where we can develop them and take advantage of that. 
For Neuromodulation, we've just announced here a very interesting platform, which I think is going to have a significant impact on how that business and business model works with a much more connected care platform, where patients get to report their outcomes and eventually get to remote programming, which is a huge change in that business model. 
So I'd say the COVID testing, accelerating decentralization of testing and connected care are probably the 2 pandemic-driven changes that we're focusing on taking advantage of."

I guess on the modeling thing, listen, you could say there could be a drop-off, but you could say there could be an increase or it could stay. So I think the modeling piece here is a little bit difficult. I think we're going to have a lot more understanding as we get towards the summer. But I think, at least for the first half, you've got -- we've got sufficient capacity here to kind of explore the demand that exists both in the U.S. and globally. 
So yes, I'm not sure right now that you can kind of easily kind of just put that model down like that, but it's just too soon. 
Regarding your question on mutations and the impact there, a lot of the mutations here -- I don't want to get too wonky here. But we've been looking at this, Vijay, since the beginning. We have a group of, we call them the virus hunters. They're constantly looking and studying and getting their hands on samples to be able to kind of, not only test our existing products but even to develop new ones. And I'd say, right now, the mutations are happening. The ones that you've referenced, the South African one and the U.K. one, those are happening on what we would call the spike protein or what we call the S protein. The rapid antigen test that we have are actually targeting the nucleocapsid protein, what we call the N protein. 
So in silico analysis says no impact. The U.K. NIH kind of did a study on Panbio and found the U.K. variant to not influence the sensitivity of the Panbio, but we're also collecting as many samples as we can from U.K., South Africa, Brazil, et cetera, and making sure that we're constantly studying that to ensure that there's no change to the sensitivity of the test that we've developed. 
On the molecular side, whether it's ID NOW -- ID NOW looks at a different gene, the RPDP genes. It's completely different thing, and similar thing also with the PCR. So I think those are, right now, from everything we know, wouldn't be impacted by the mutations. We're more focused on the antigen with the mutations on those protein sequences. So I feel good about that right now. But obviously, we're constantly vigilant here. 
So let me just close here. I'd say we had a real strong 2020, very strong performance, almost 10% top line growth, 13% EPS. We're forecasting 2021 here at least $5. And like I said, I think we've got opportunity to have upside to that. But still already at $5, it's already at a 37% increase. And in that $5, we're also making a lot of investments in R&D to be able to sustain our growth going forward. So we feel confident about maintaining our double digit in 2022. Significant portion of our COVID testing, we believe, is sustainable. We've made investments or have a plan here to lay out investments in our base business that I think will accelerate our growth rate. And in some of the questions here, we've got a strong balance sheet here. So you combine those 3 elements here, I think we've got not only a strong '21 forecast but a pretty good line of sight here in terms of delivering double digits for 2022. So thanks."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported the results of a very strong quarter. Ongoing earnings per share were $1.32, reflecting more than 100% growth compared to the prior year. Sales increased 33% on an organic basis in the quarter. 
At the start of the year, we issued full year guidance that reflected another year of strong performance, and through the first quarter, we're right on track with those expectations. Our full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance of at least $5 remains unchanged and reflects over 35% growth compared to last year. 
Our strong first quarter were comprised of several factors, including global COVID testing-related sales of $2.2 billion, with rapid tests compromising roughly 85% of those sales; strong sales growth across all 4 of our major business areas, which resulted in base business organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing-related sales, of nearly 6%; growth contributions and momentum from several recently launched products across all of our businesses; and the impact of significant investments we're making across our portfolio in R&D and commercial initiatives that will further strengthen our sustainable growth profile. 
I'll now summarize our first quarter results before turning the call over to Bob. And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased nearly 6.5% in the quarter. 
Performance was led by our Adult Nutrition business, with sales growth of more than 18% in the quarter. The pandemic has brought a lot of awareness to the value of good nutrition, including immune support, which is helping to bring new users into the category and more specifically to our market-leading Ensure and Glucerna brands. 
Pediatric Nutrition sales declined 2.5% in the quarter. Recall, during the first quarter of last year, this business experienced significant pantry stocking ahead of the shelter-in-place restrictions in several countries at the start of the global pandemic. Our sales growth this quarter in Pediatric Nutrition reflects that difficult year-over-year comparison. In the U.S. and several international markets, we continue to capture share with our leading portfolio of infant formula and toddler brands. 
In Diagnostics, sales increased 115%, which was led by significant demand for our portfolio of COVID-19 tests as well as improvement in the base business. As I mentioned earlier, strong COVID testing-related sales were led by our rapid point-of-care platforms, ID NOW, BinaxNOW, and Panbio as we continue to see demand shift towards rapid testing worldwide. 
During the quarter, BinaxNOW received U.S. Emergency Use Authorization for over-the-counter, nonprescription, self-use for people with or without symptoms. We began shipping test kits to major retailers yesterday. 
Just as importantly, our underlying base business continues to improve, driven by improving routine diagnostic testing levels and the continued rollout of our Alinity platforms. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, our core lab and molecular diagnostic businesses both achieved double-digit sales growth in the quarter.
Turning to Established Pharmaceuticals, where sales grew over 6% in the quarter, which is particularly strong given the comparison versus a strong first quarter last year. Performance in the quarter was led by double-digit sales growth in India, China and Brazil. And while we continue to see elevated COVID case levels across several emerging markets, the business is executing at a high level to ensure patients have access to our branded generic medicines. 
And lastly, I'll cover Medical Devices, where sales grew nearly 9% in the quarter, led by strong growth in structural heart, rhythm management, electrophysiology and diabetes care. Although procedure volumes across our cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses were impacted early in the year by elevated [ coast] case rates in certain countries including the U.S., we saw growth improve throughout the quarter and exited with good momentum. On average in March, U.S. procedure levels were up mid-single digits compared to pre-COVID baselines across our cardiovascular business with some areas even higher. 
In structural heart, sales were up mid-teens overall with growth contributions coming from several products within our innovative portfolio, including MitraClip, TriClip, Portico and others. MitraClip sales grew more than 15% in the U.S., where we achieved our highest number of monthly procedures ever in the month of March. In January, CMS expanded reimbursement covered for MitraClip, which significantly increases the number of people who can benefit from this market-leading device. 
And I'll wrap up with Diabetes Care, where growth was led by Freestyle Libre sales of nearly $830 million. The global user base for Libre has now surpassed 3 million users, driven by market expansion and awareness efforts as well as ongoing new product launch activity in every major market around the world. 
So in summary, we're off to a very strong start and right on track with our expectations for the year. All 4 of our major businesses are achieving strong growth. We're particularly pleased with the growth contributions and momentum of several recently launched products. And we're well positioned to achieve more than 35% EPS growth, as we have forecasted at the beginning of the year. 
And now I'll turn over the call to Bob to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Bob?"

As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.
Turning to our results. Sales for the first quarter increased 32.9%, which was led by strong performance across all of our businesses, along with strong global COVID testing-related sales. Organic sales growth was balanced, with 34% growth in the U.S. and 32% growth internationally. COVID testing-related sales were also balanced geographically, with a little more than half of those sales coming from international markets. 
Foreign exchange had a favorable year-over-year impact of 2.5% on first quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthen somewhat versus several currencies, which resulted in a slightly less favorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in January. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a favorable impact of approximately 4% on our second quarter reported sales and would now expect exchange to have a favorable impact of nearly 2% on our full year 2021 sales. 
Regarding other aspects of the P&L for the first quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.3% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 6% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 25.1% of sales. 
As Robert mentioned, the strength of our business performance has created an opportunity to significantly increase our investments in R&D and SG&A to further strengthen our pipeline and growth initiatives. During the first quarter, our combined investments in these areas increased approximately $200 million compared to the same quarter last year and was at the highest level since our separation with AbbVie. 
For the first quarter, net interest expense was $124 million. Nonoperating income was $73 million. And our adjusted tax rate was 15%, which is consistent with our full year effective tax rate from last year.
With that, we'll now open the call for questions."

We see this is a as a significant opportunity and quite frankly, a trend that's been happening overseas and is kind of now happening here in the U.S., which is this move, this accelerated move here from, say, more hospital lab-based testing to more rapid testing outside of that environment, where consumers and people can get the results at a much faster rate and quite frankly, with a little bit less hassle, less process. 
So we see this as a significant opportunity it's easy. It's affordable. And I think that's a key part here, Bob, as we think about surveillance testing and serial testing. It needs to contemplate those 2 areas, right? It needs to be affordable. It's difficult to do serial testing on PCR when you've got a cost of $100-plus and it takes between 2 to 3 days to get that. 
So I think we're in a great opportunity here to be able to capitalize on that. I think this is something that people are going to want to buy and have in their homes and stock up in their homes. Think of it as maybe a new -- your new element in your medicine cabinet. But we've been seeing this shift happen towards the end of last year and definitely into this quarter here, this move towards rapid. 
Specifically in the U.S., we've got a great position as a lot of this OTC is going to require understanding of the retail and the retail environment, the retail channel. And those are capabilities that as you know through our Nutrition business or our Diabetes business, we know how to operate and operate pretty well in there. So we're excited, and I think this is going to eliminate a lot of the barriers that exist for frequent testing. 
A key aspect of that is obviously scale. We have to have scale to be able to meet the demand. And quite frankly, we're probably the leaders here in terms of production. We've got an established capacity this quarter now, that we can do about 150 million rapid tests per month across all of our different platforms. 
So we feel very good about that position. We feel good about this opportunity. 
To your second question on 2022, yes we did -- you did mention our confidence back in January, and we commented it on our call. And to be honest, nothing's changed on that front. Nothing's changed over the last 90 days. 
We start our planning process every year. We target double-digit growth. And we talked about some of the key elements and laid out some of the key elements that allowed us to have that confidence to be able to drive that double digits in 2022, whether it's the pace of recovery of our base business, COVID testing, new product launches, investment spend, et cetera. None of that has changed. 
I mean if you look at the pace of our recovery on our base business, that's done very well. Cardio and neuro finished the quarter very strong. We grew double digits, as I said in my prepared remarks, in core lab and molecular diagnostics excluding COVID. Libre is growing rapidly. Nutrition and EPD are accelerating their growth rates with pipeline and a market that supports that sustained growth. We've got momentum with a lot of our product launches: MitraClip G4, TriClip, I'd say our mapping systems, our new CRM devices. 
And then we've got, coming out of this year going into next year, 4 key product launches that we feel very good about. We're very excited about them, given our position, given the product offering and the value proposition of them. And you know those are LAA -- entering the LAA market here in the U.S., potential expansion of indication for CardioMEMS, entering the leadless pacemaker with single chamber and then follow that with a dual chamber, entering the U.S. TAVR market. I mean all 4 of those opportunities are multibillion-dollar segments. And we've been working hard on the last call it, 18 months to get us ready to be in a position in 2022 to be able to capitalize on that. 
So the underlying base business, the pipeline, all of that is kind of heading in the right direction and don't see any changes. If anything, there's acceleration to kind of what we talked about 90 days ago. 
And we continue to believe a good portion of the COVID testing is sustainable. There's, as I said, there's a clear trend here to move towards rapid formats. We're the dominant producer here of these rapid tests, making about 150 million a month. So wherever that market goes, we know that we'll be the share leader here for sure. So you look at all these different components here, Bob, we still feel very confident about our double digit. 
The one thing I'll say is that as you look at all these different businesses, probably one thing that we can try and model now but it will probably be different, January is just how the mix of those businesses are going to contribute to that double-digit growth. It always ends up differently in terms of how we planned. We did double digit in '20, and it was very different versus how we set it up in January of 2020. 
So if you look at our history, we're pretty consistent about delivering on that. If there's any caution here I guess for next year, it already be seem to be priced here into our P/E. So -- but that being said, I don't think anything has changed here from the last 90 days from our perspective. We still very good about our double digit."

I mean I talked a lot about these in terms of the investments we're making. I'd say from a bigger picture perspective, we want to make sure that we're spending and investing a good portion of these COVID testing profits into the R&D portion of the P&L. We believe that is a very sustainable investment. 
And if I look across all of the businesses, in devices, in diagnostics, in rapid diagnostics, in nutrition, all of these businesses have opportunities to invest in R&D. And we've got clear programs across all of them to build the R&D programs that will sustain our growth beyond '22, '23, '24. 
A lot of the products that I just mentioned, whether it's the ones we've just launched over the last kind of quarter, 2 or 3 quarters; plus the 4 key areas that we're looking at entering in 2022, those are going to drive a lot of our revenue growth. And those have already been funded, but I would say the investment's here really looking into next-generation products in diagnostics, expansion in our portfolio and devices that will lead to new product launches in '23 and '24. 
And on the SG&A side, we're making sure that we're supporting our big growth products. I'd say probably a lot of the SG&A is going towards Libre and driving Libre awareness and growth both in the U.S. and international markets. And you'll start to see that ramp up even more as we go throughout the year, both in terms of the spend and the return on the top line. 
We're making investments also in Nutrition to strengthen our brand and capitalize on the expansion, especially in the adult nutrition side of the market. And expanding footprint in several of our device businesses where we know that clinical specialists and sales force, et cetera, is important to be able to support not only the expansion of our current products, but the launch of new products."

Obviously, there was obviously some -- a little bit of a slowdown in January. So we had a nice pickup I'd say in October, November where -- sorry, yes October, November, where we saw procedure growth rates return to growth. And I'd say December, January saw that decline as the cases increased, but saw real nice progression in the month of February and then very strong growth in March. 
And Rob, what we try to do also is we try to look at there's -- March is a tricky month because you've got those 2 weeks of last year where things kind of really kind of shut down. So we look at March not only versus last year, but also looking at it versus March of 2019 and quite frankly, the whole quarter versus 2019. And we actually see growth rates in this quarter that are higher than our pre-pandemic rates in 2019, in Q1 of 2019. So I think we saw a real nice growth. 
In core lab, that was very positive to see. We saw double-digit growth there, and that's a good indicator of routine testing coming back to hospitals, saw double-digit there. 
Our molecular diagnostic business, excluding COVID and PCR COVID testing, was up 30%. So that's a real positive sign that our strategy of utilizing the Alinity M to launch into the market with COVID and then kind of build off the menu is also having a positive impact over there, too. 
So I'd say very good exit rate. And as we look at the first 2 weeks of April, we look at it every week here, real nice progression. 
So I didn't see the bolus coming in and then the drop. I actually saw continued nice improvement in structural heart, in EP and even in CRM. So those are -- that's a nice trend as we're going into the second quarter, too. 
And we'll start to see a little bit of opening up here in Europe. I'd say the one area that was a little bit softer for us was Europe, given all the shutdowns there. But again, I'd say the first couple of weeks in Europe are looking pretty good."

And again, there's multiple ways of how we can get there in terms of business mix, et cetera. 
We do have a strong balance sheet, and that provides us a lot of strategic flexibility. We try to have a balanced approach there, Larry, in terms of balancing between the short and the long term, investing in the business and providing some of that return back to our shareholders. 
So whether it's in the form of dividend, we're committed to a strong growing dividend. It's an important part of our identity. 
On the share repurchasing, we've historically just really looked at share repurchasing to offset some of the dilution. We could be looking to do a little bit more than that going -- in this year, going into next year. 
And then from an M&A perspective, I'd say we're always actively monitoring. We're always actively looking. And you'll always hear me say that I'm not going to tip my hand and give up any kind of competitive advantage there. But if there's something that is attractive, something that has got growth, that won't dilute our top line growth profile, which I think is best in class, or that we can do better with, we're always going to be interested. But we're always going to be prudent about deploying our cash, Larry, always keeping our shareholders happy, balancing the long term, the short term, the internal and the external. 
And this is not a kind of a new CEO versus prior CEO philosophy. This has always been -- this has always been an Abbott philosophy. We're good stewards of that capital and good stewards of finding that right balance that I just described."

Yes, there was a little bit of a -- you've got a little bit of a balance here between Q1 and Q2. So Q1 last year, we saw some stocking up in international and in the U.S. So I look at our 30% here and on top of a pretty strong quarter last year as really positive momentum. 
We'll have some effect on the reverse side of that in Q2. So then it becomes really a second half, can we kind of sustain this kind of mid-30s and accelerate it into the 40s in the second half? And the answer is we believe so. We've got a great portfolio. We've got great momentum and making the investments, whether it's field force, whether it's consumer advertising not just in the U.S  but around the world, significant investments to building awareness for the category. 
I mean we've achieved 3 million -- surpassed 3 million users around the world. That's 3 -- we could say, hey, that's 3x our next competitor, but the reality is the penetration for us and for the categories is still pretty significant. So there's plenty of room here for us to invest and grow, and we'll be doing that on the back of our -- not only our commercial investments, but also R&D. 
Your question on Libre 3, that's -- we launched that into Europe at the end of this quarter. We're right where we want to be. 
We start off usually small and focused here, Larry. We learn. We learn with the consumer. We learn with the HCP in terms of what resonates. We learn with our manufacturing. We've got a lot of capabilities in terms of how to manufacture at scale. 
But there's always a little bit of a learning curve here. It is a new platform. And we learn with insurance, and insurance switches over and all those things. And once we get all of that kind of lined up, then we accelerate and we go break. But I've got -- we've got a lot of strategic flexibility here with Libre 2 and Libra 3. I think we're in a great position. 
Feedback has been really good. I mean we've launched this with about over 1,000 HCPs. We've got close to a couple of hundred patients that we've now kind of just tried to see what their reactions are with the products, and it's been extremely positive. There's a lot of social media there. I'm not very fluent in German, but I can tell a facial expression of awesomeness and coolness and amazement factor, and you can see those in the videos of these patients that are using it. 
So I think this is going to set a whole new standard for us on every dimension: size, ease of use, accuracy, [ alarm] performance, wear experience, all that. It's all great. It's all good. 
So regarding your question on Libre time frame, I think you answered it. So that's good. I'm not going to provide any details here. But I'm just really excited about Libre 3 and the combination of the portfolio, having both 2 and 3. I just think it provides us a lot of strategic flexibility."

But it just shows our commitment to this segment because we believe we've got a great product, great product portfolio, a pipeline, and it's a great segment here. 
So I think you had another question on MitraClip. MitraClip did very well in the quarter. Obviously, it got impacted by COVID last year. It was on a great trajectory. It kind of got slowed down as obviously the ICU beds and hospitals moved towards treating COVID. 
But we had great growth in Q1. We're up in the mid-teens in the U.S. So that was good. 
As I said in my prepared comments, we had our highest number of procedures ever in the month of March. And that wasn't just catch-up because I've looked at the procedures in the first 2 weeks of April, and they continue to move up. So that's very positive for us. 
And we're making our investments, not only on the pipeline side, new versions of MitraClip, but also more importantly in market development, so really to expand the funnel of patients being treated, creating those patient referral networks with the cardiologists and our implanting centers. So that's done very well. 
And I think the NCD that got approved in January, opens up a significant opportunity for us with MitraClip. Remember, we're only about 5% to 6%, maybe 7% penetrated right now in the total available market here. And I think that we've got a lot of runway for growth in the mitral space. 
And I think you also had a question on CardioMEMS. We expect to file for a label expansion relatively soon. This would also significantly broaden the U.S. market opportunity. And we plan to pursue CMS reimbursement after we obtained that label expansion. 
This segment continues to grow. Our Q1 growth in CardioMEMS, it was north of 20%. And that market has started to recover also from the pandemic, and I like the position we have in them."

You called out R&D, and we've seen DTC has been stepping up. I think there's a lot of Libre commercials there now. 
I guess my question is when you think about these investments and the sustainability, historically, we've thought about Abbott is driving 7% growth. That was your algorithm pre-COVID. Do you think that the investments could lead to more sustainable, higher post-COVID organic growth? And then how quickly can you toggle them up and down if the environment changes quickly, to manage earnings?"

So I'd say on the base business side, our identity, our target was really sustaining a 7% to 8% growth rate pre-COVID.

And I'd say with these investments that we're making, excluding any kind of year-over-year comp, we'd probably be at the higher end of that 7% to 8% range I mean once you factor in maybe a Q1 comparison on the base business. Next year, you're probably growing a little bit higher than that, Matt. But at the high end of that 7% to 8% is what we're looking at, with all these investments and product development and portfolio development. 
As I said, a big portion of our COVID cash flows and profits, part of it goes to our shareholders, but part of it goes back into the business. And we've got a lot of flexibility here to toggle that investment up or down if we need to. I mean I'd probably say that each business has their list of go-to areas that we've all agreed to are kind of next steps. If we have more opportunity to invest in the business, we know exactly -- we know exactly where to go. 
As it relates to toggling down, yes I mean I wouldn't be toggling down R&D. I think that's more of a sustainable kind of investment that sustains our growth rate. It's easier to toggle on SG&A, and we've got that capabilities also if we need to."

We've definitely been elevated to a kind of high level of partnership here with a lot of hospitals and IDNs and institutions as it relates to their kind of COVID testing. There's been a large set of accounts that we've historically been out of and now had the opportunity to place our instruments and show what we can do. 
So the answer to that is yes on the core lab for sure. You saw -- you're seeing a little bit of that strategy play out in the molecular side of the business, where we haven't seen these kind of growth rates in our molecular business excluding COVID in a very long time. And we were up close to 30% excluding COVID testing. A lot of that has to do with the instruments that we're placing and getting the test pull-through on the other assays on the other tests. 
So on the rapid side, too, I wouldn't just look at it from a core lab perspective. The sustainability of COVID is -- one portion of it is the actual COVID test. The other portion of it is the installed base that we're placing as a result of that. 
I've talked a little bit about this building sustainability of a rapid testing channel beyond just COVID, and COVID is allowing us to do that. But if you think about, for example, our ID NOW instrument, where we basically ceded the market here for an opportunity to do much more in the world outside of COVID by placing these instruments. We had roughly about 19,000 boxes in the U.S. in 2019, and we're currently at 75,000 boxes. So we almost quadrupled our installed base there. 
And will they all be as productive from a COVID testing perspective at the highest level of pandemic 1, 2 years out? No, probably not, but they'll be very productive with all of our other assays. And that installed base will continue to grow and will continue to produce for us. 
So to answer your question, yes, I do think this is a great opportunity here for us to continue to roll out our Alinity platform on the core lab, on the molecular side and continue to build our rapid testing channel in the rapids business."

So kind of growth rate in our diagnostic business, the way to think about it is, at least how we've modeled it is we'll see our let's call it non-COVID diagnostic business continue to accelerate, continue to grow. Obviously, you'll have comps over there, Joanne, in Q2 and Q3. That will be producing some mid-teens kind of growth numbers in this business. 
But I think we always look at it, at least the way we're managing it here, is we're always looking at on a 2-year CAGR. So if we can get back up to that kind of 10%, 11%, 12% growth rate that we were seeing in our core lab business that -- on a 2-year CAGR, that's basically our target to be able to get to those numbers. 
COVID testing, it's difficult to forecast right now. I can't give you an exact quarterly progression of that. I think the range that we've given last call, I continue to reiterate it. But it's going to be a little bit difficult here to get the exact calendarization, the exact mix, the exact geography right in terms of the COVID testing. 
What I will say though is that I do continue to believe that the shift from lab-based PCR will still play a role in COVID, but I think that the bigger role will be played by the rapid testing as it relates to surveillance. And as I said, I think we're well positioned there. 
I think you had -- your second question was regarding some of the other devices. I'd say listen, I'm very pleased with CRM. I'm not saying that we've completely turned it around, but it's a great progression that we're seeing here. The launch of our ICDs and CRT-Ds with the Gallant brand with Bluetooth capability in Europe and U.S., all of the numbers show that we're picking up share, and that's the ultimate measure here. 
And I'm excited about the ability for us to enter the leadless segment in next year with our product and the capabilities that -- and the value proposition that, that product will bring versus competitive systems. So I think that's done very well. 
I'd say heart failure one of the challenges there is probably -- that's probably the slowest part of the device portfolio to recover. A lot of those procedures require some ICU stays. So I think that was one where we saw a little bit of impact to market. I'd say our share has started pretty high around the mid-80s, 85%. And so that's mostly a market condition that we'll see come back. But I think that the CardioMEMS is another great opportunity for us where we saw growth in the quarter for 26%. 
So I don't know if I covered all the device areas that you wanted me to hit on."

We recently launched our remote programming and monitoring system, the NeuroSphere. I think that's going to create a whole new opportunity for us in terms of business model, in terms of our ability to service the patients and the physicians better with that. So we started to roll it out in the U.S. 
I think it applies to both SCS and DBS, too. We've gotten great feedback on that. So I think that we'll see sequential improvement on our performance in neuro not only as we lap the comps, but also as the NeuroSphere gets widely used. And then we've got a nice pipeline of products to be launching towards the end of the year here."

And then specifically on medical devices just a follow-up to Joanne's question, should we be thinking about potential the bolstering heart failure vascular neuromod to some of the softer businesses here? I mean you have such a pipeline and had such success with internal development initiatives, is this medical device an area where you can add? 
And then lastly, just on the structural heart business. I mean in the U.S., you're going to be adding Amulet and Portico in the near term. And just how are you thinking about that -- you mentioned a specialized sales force. Should we be thinking about individual sales teams for MitraClip, TAVR and left atrial appendage occlusion? And how could that all shape out?"

So I think on the M&A side, you'll hear me say the same thing, which is I think it always starts off strategically. Does the business that we're looking at have a strategic fit to Abbott, both from a market position, from a financial standpoint? So we wouldn't be looking at anything that doesn't fit us strategically just to fill an EPS. We want businesses that we can grow, that we can obviously operate and can fit well into the company. 
So I think it always starts like that. It always starts with the strategic fit. And then if it's attractive, if the timing is right, then we'll look at it. 
I think all the areas that you mentioned are all areas that we look at. So we look at all those areas that you mentioned. We look at diagnostics. We look at all the areas we're always studying. And we're always paying attention to the new technologies, the new companies, et cetera. So I just won't tip my hand here and give anything away in terms of our competitive position here. 
So regarding your second question on sales forces, it always depends. But we tend to have a viewpoint here, Josh, where we believe that kind of focused and dedicated teams has always been best. That's kind of how we've run our businesses. It's how we've been our businesses for many, many decades. We don't try and bring things together that don't make sense just for the sake of synergies. 
If we believe we're in growth areas and growth businesses, then we'll fund them as growth business and growth areas. And quite frankly, all the businesses that you talked about in structural heart are areas of high potential growth. So we will treat them and resource them as such. 
So I'll just close here by saying we set guidance of at least $5, which is about 35% growth year-over-year. That's after a 13% growth in 2020.  And we feel very good about our first quarter. We feel that our first quarter puts us on track to achieve those -- at least those $5. We have multiple ways to get there. 
The COVID market is going to move more and more towards rapid, and our position in this segment of COVID testing is unmatched with our capabilities, our scale, et cetera. And we believe a good portion of those tests of that COVID testing market will remain at least into 2022. 
And I'm very pleased with the pace of recovery of our base business Abbot, or let's call it the non-COVID side of our business. And we're making investments in 2021, so we can accelerate our growth in 2022 and beyond, and we've talked about this also. So we feel very good about the position we're in today and the position we have this year and going into next year."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported the results of a very strong quarter. Ongoing earnings per share were $1.32, reflecting more than 100% growth compared to the prior year. Sales increased 33% on an organic basis in the quarter.  
At the start of the year, we issued full year guidance that reflected another year of strong performance, and through the first quarter, we're right on track with those expectations. Our full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance of at least $5 remains unchanged and reflects over 35% growth compared to last year.  
Our strong first quarter were comprised of several factors, including global COVID testing-related sales of $2.2 billion, with rapid tests compromising roughly 85% of those sales; strong sales growth across all 4 of our major business areas, which resulted in base business organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing-related sales, of nearly 6%; growth contributions and momentum from several recently launched products across all of our businesses; and the impact of significant investments we're making across our portfolio in R&D and commercial initiatives that will further strengthen our sustainable growth profile.  
I'll now summarize our first quarter results before turning the call over to Bob. And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased nearly 6.5% in the quarter. Performance was led by our Adult Nutrition business, with sales growth of more than 18% in the quarter. The pandemic has brought a lot of awareness to the value of good nutrition, including immune support, which is helping to bring new users into the category and more specifically to our market-leading Ensure and Glucerna brands.  
Pediatric Nutrition sales declined 2.5% in the quarter. Recall, during the first quarter of last year, this business experienced significant pantry stocking ahead of the shelter-in-place restrictions in several countries at the start of the global pandemic. Our sales growth this quarter in Pediatric Nutrition reflects that difficult year-over-year comparison. In the U.S. and several international markets, we continue to capture share with our leading portfolio of infant formula and toddler brands.  
In Diagnostics, sales increased 115%, which was led by significant demand for our portfolio of COVID-19 tests as well as improvement in the base business. As I mentioned earlier, strong COVID testing-related sales were led by our rapid point-of-care platforms, ID NOW, BinaxNOW and Panbio, as we continue to see demand shift towards rapid testing worldwide. During the quarter, BinaxNOW received U.S. Emergency Use Authorization for over-the-counter, nonprescription, self-use for people with or without symptoms. We began shipping test kits to major retailers yesterday.  
Just as importantly, our underlying base business continues to improve, driven by improving routine diagnostic testing levels and the continued rollout of our Alinity platforms. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, our Core Lab and Molecular Diagnostic businesses both achieved double-digit sales growth in the quarter. 
Turning to Established Pharmaceuticals, where sales grew over 6% in the quarter, which is particularly strong given the comparison versus a strong first quarter last year. Performance in the quarter was led by double-digit sales growth in India, China and Brazil. And while we continue to see elevated COVID case levels across several emerging markets, the business is executing at a high level to ensure patients have access to our branded generic medicines.  
And lastly, I'll cover Medical Devices, where sales grew nearly 9% in the quarter, led by strong growth in Structural Heart, Rhythm Management, Electrophysiology and Diabetes Care. Although procedure volumes across our cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses were impacted early in the year by elevated [ coast ] case rates in certain countries including the U.S., we saw growth improve throughout the quarter and exited with good momentum. On average in March, U.S. procedure levels were up mid-single digits compared to pre-COVID baselines across our cardiovascular business with some areas even higher.  
In Structural Heart, sales were up mid-teens overall with growth contributions coming from several products within our innovative portfolio, including MitraClip, TriClip, Portico and others. MitraClip sales grew more than 15% in the U.S., where we achieved our highest number of monthly procedures ever in the month of March. In January, CMS expanded reimbursement covered for MitraClip, which significantly increases the number of people who can benefit from this market-leading device.  
And I'll wrap up with Diabetes Care, where growth was led by Freestyle Libre sales of nearly $830 million. The global user base for Libre has now surpassed 3 million users, driven by market expansion and awareness efforts as well as ongoing new product launch activity in every major market around the world.  
So in summary, we're off to a very strong start and right on track with our expectations for the year. All 4 of our major businesses are achieving strong growth. We're particularly pleased with the growth contributions and momentum of several recently launched products. And we're well positioned to achieve more than 35% EPS growth, as we have forecasted at the beginning of the year. 
I'll now turn over the call to Bob to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Bob?"

As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance. 
Turning to our results. Sales for the first quarter increased 32.9%, which was led by strong performance across all of our businesses, along with strong global COVID testing-related sales. Organic sales growth was balanced, with 34% growth in the U.S. and 32% growth internationally. COVID testing-related sales were also balanced geographically, with a little more than half of those sales coming from international markets.  
Foreign exchange had a favorable year-over-year impact of 2.5% on first quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthen somewhat versus several currencies, which resulted in a slightly less favorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in January. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a favorable impact of approximately 4% on our second quarter reported sales and would now expect exchange to have a favorable impact of nearly 2% on our full year 2021 sales.  
Regarding other aspects of the P&L for the first quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.3% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 6% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 25.1% of sales. As Robert mentioned, the strength of our business performance has created an opportunity to significantly increase our investments in R&D and SG&A to further strengthen our pipeline and growth initiatives. During the first quarter, our combined investments in these areas increased approximately $200 million compared to the same quarter last year and was at the highest level since our separation with AbbVie.  
For the first quarter, net interest expense was $124 million. Nonoperating income was $73 million. And our adjusted tax rate was 15%, which is consistent with our full year effective tax rate from last year. 
With that, we'll now open the call for questions."

I don't think I can recall the last time the company put up 100% earnings growth, so impressive there.  
I guess I'd love to hear your thoughts on 2 important topics, Robert, if you don't mind, and that the first topic is BinaxNOW OTC. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about capacity and your early thoughts on how you think demand will play out for that product. So that's the first topic.  
And then I'll just go ahead and list the second one in the interest of time. The second topic is a little bit longer-term oriented, because last quarter you expressed some confidence in Abbott's ability to drive double-digit earnings growth in 2022 off of that $5 number for this year.  
And the question I would have is, based on what you're seeing today, has anything changed with your views? And then I think investors would also love to hear, if you assume a more conservative testing scenario, how does that impact that goal of double-digit earnings growth next year? So I just wanted to list this all upfront there."

On your first question regarding kind of the U.S. Binax OTC launch, so yes, we're very excited about that. We see this is a as a significant opportunity, and quite frankly, a trend that's been happening overseas and is kind of now happening",972,"Okay, thanks. On your first question regarding kind of the U.S. Binax OTC launch, so yes, we're very excited about that. We see this is a as a significant opportunity, and quite frankly, a trend that's been happening overseas and is kind of now happening here in the U.S., which is this move, this accelerated move here from, say, more hospital lab-based testing to more rapid testing outside of that environment, where consumers and people can get the results at a much faster rate, and quite frankly, with a little bit less hassle, less process. So we see this as a significant opportunity. It's easy and it's affordable. And I think that's a key part here, Bob, as we think about surveillance testing and serial testing. It needs to contemplate those 2 areas, right? It needs to be affordable.  
It's difficult to do serial testing on PCR when you've got a cost of $100-plus and takes between 2 to 3 days to get that. So I think we're in a great opportunity here to be able to capitalize on that. I think this is something that people are going to want to buy and have in their homes and stock up in their homes. Think of it as maybe your new element in your medicine cabinet. But we've been seeing this shift happen towards the end of last year and definitely into this quarter here, this move towards rapid. Specifically in the U.S., we've got a great position as a lot of this OTC is going to require understanding of the retail and the retail environment, the retail channel. And those are capabilities that, as you know through our Nutrition business, through our Diabetes business, we know how to operate and operate pretty well in there.  
So we're excited, and I think this is going to eliminate a lot of the barriers that exist for frequent testing. A key aspect of that is obviously scale. We have to have scale to be able to meet the demand. And quite frankly, we're probably the leaders here in terms of production. We've got an established capacity this quarter now, that we can do about 150 million rapid tests per month across all of our different platforms.  
So we feel very good about that position. We feel good about this opportunity.  
To your second question on 2022, yes, we did -- you did mention our confidence back in January, and we commented it on our call. And to be honest, nothing's changed on that front. Nothing's changed over the last 90 days.  
We start our planning process every year. We target double-digit growth. And we talked about some of the key elements and laid out some of the key elements that allowed us to have that confidence to be able to drive that double digit in 2022, whether it's the pace of recovery of our base business, COVID testing, new product launches, investment spend, et cetera. None of that has changed. I mean if you look at the pace of our recovery on our base business, that's done very well. Cardio and neuro finished the quarter very strong. We grew double digits, as I said in my prepared remarks, in Core Lab and Molecular Diagnostics excluding COVID. Libre is growing rapidly. Nutrition and EPD are accelerating their growth rates with pipeline and a market that supports that sustained growth. We've got momentum with a lot of our product launches: MitraClip G4, TriClip, I'd say our mapping systems, our new CRM devices.  
And then we've got coming out of this year going into next year, 4 key product launches that we feel very good about. We're very excited about them, given our position, given the product offering and the value proposition of them. And you know those are LAA -- entering the LAA market here in the U.S., potential expansion of indication for CardioMEMS, entering the leadless pacemaker with single chamber and then follow that with a dual chamber, entering the U.S. TAVR market. I mean all 4 of those opportunities are multibillion-dollar segments. And we've been working hard on the last, call it, 18 months to get us ready and to be in a position in 2022 to be able to capitalize on that. 
So the underlying base business, the pipeline, all of that is kind of heading in the right direction and don't see any changes. If anything, there's acceleration to kind of what we talked about 90 days ago. 
And we continue to believe a good portion of the COVID testing is sustainable. There's, as I said, there's a clear trend here to move towards rapid formats. We're the dominant producer here of these rapid tests, making about 150 million a month. So wherever that market goes, we know that we'll be the share leader here for sure. So you look at all these different components here, Bob, we still feel very confident about our double digit. 
The one thing I'll say is that as you look at all these different businesses, probably one thing that we can try and model now but it will probably be different, January is just how the mix of those businesses are going to contribute to that double-digit growth. It always ends up differently in terms of how we plan. We did double digit in '20, and it was very different versus how we set it up in January of 2020. 
So if you look at our history, we're pretty consistent about delivering on that. If there's any caution here, I guess, for next year, it'd already be -- seem to be priced here into our P/E. So -- but that being said, I don't think anything has changed here from the last 90 days from our perspective. We still feel very good about our double digit."

I mean I talked a lot about these in terms of the investments we're making. I'd say from a bigger picture perspective, we want to make sure that we're spending and investing a good portion of these COVID testing profits into the R&D portion of the P&L. We believe that is a very sustainable investment. 
And if I look across all of the businesses, in devices, in diagnostics, in rapid diagnostics, in nutrition, all of these businesses have opportunities to invest in R&D. And we've got clear programs across all of them to build the R&D programs that will sustain our growth beyond '22, '23, '24. 
A lot of the products that I just mentioned, whether it's the ones we've just launched over the last kind of quarter, 2 or 3 quarters, plus the 4 key areas that we're looking at entering in 2022, those are going to drive a lot of our revenue growth. And those have already been funded, but I would say the investments here are really looking into next-generation products in Diagnostics, expansion in our portfolio and devices that will lead to new product launches in '23 and '24. 
On the SG&A side, we're making sure that we're supporting our big growth products. I'd say probably a lot of the SG&A is going towards Libre and driving Libre awareness and growth, both in the U.S. and international markets. And you'll start to see that ramp up even more as we go throughout the year, both in terms of spend and the return on the top line. 
We're making investments also in Nutrition to strengthen our brand and capitalize on the expansion, especially in the adult nutrition side of the market. And expanding footprint in several of our device businesses where we know that clinical specialists and sales force, et cetera, is important to be able to support not only the expansion of our current products, but the launch of new products."

Obviously, there was obviously some -- a little bit of a slowdown in January. So we had a nice pickup, I'd say, in October, November where -- sorry, yes October, November, where we saw procedure growth rates return to growth. And I'd say December, January saw that decline as the cases increased, but saw real nice progression in the month of February and then very strong growth in March. 
And Rob, what we try to do also is we try to look at there's -- March is a tricky month because you've got those 2 weeks of last year where things kind of really kind of shut down. So we look at March not only versus last year, but also looking at it versus March of 2019, and quite frankly, the whole quarter versus 2019. And we actually see growth rates in this quarter that are higher than our pre-pandemic rates in 2019, in Q1 of 2019. So I think we saw a real nice growth. 
In Core Lab, that was very positive to see. We saw double-digit growth there, and that's a good indicator of routine testing coming back to hospitals, saw double digit there. 
Our Molecular Diagnostic business, excluding COVID and PCR COVID testing, was up 30%. So that's a real positive sign that our strategy of utilizing the Alinity M to launch into the market with COVID and then kind of build off the menu is also having a positive impact over there, too. 
So I'd say very good exit rate. And as we look at the first 2 weeks of April, and we look at it every week here, real nice progression. 
So I didn't see the bolus coming in and then the drop. I actually saw continued nice improvement in Structural Heart, in EP and even in CRM. So those are -- that's a nice trend as we're going into the second quarter, too. 
And we'll start to see a little bit of opening up here in Europe. I'd say the one area that was a little bit softer for us was Europe, given all the shutdowns there. But again, I'd say the first couple of weeks in Europe are looking pretty good."

And again, there's multiple ways of how we can get there in terms of business mix, et cetera. 
We do have a strong balance sheet, and that provides us a lot of strategic flexibility. We try to have a balanced approach there, Larry, in terms of balancing between the short and long-term investing in the business and providing some of that return back to our shareholders. 
So whether it's in the form of dividend, we're committed to a strong growing dividend. It's an important part of our identity. 
On the share repurchasing, we've historically just really looked at share repurchasing to offset some of the dilution. We could be looking to do a little bit more than that going -- in this year, going into next year. 
And then from an M&A perspective, I'd say we're always actively monitoring. We're always actively looking. And you'll always hear me say that I'm not going to tip my hand and give up any kind of competitive advantage there. But if there's something that is attractive, something that has got growth, that won't dilute our top line growth profile, which I think is best in class, or that we can do better with, we're always going to be interested. But we're always going to be prudent about deploying our cash, Larry, always keeping our shareholders happy, balancing the long term, the short term, the internal and the external. 
And this is not a kind of a new CEO versus prior CEO philosophy. This has always been an Abbott philosophy. We're good stewards of that capital and good stewards of finding that right balance that I just described."

We'll have some effect on the reverse side of that in Q2. So then it becomes really a second half, can we kind of sustain this kind of mid-30s and accelerate it into the 40s in the second half? And the answer is we believe so. We've got a great portfolio. We've got great momentum and making the investments, whether it's field force, whether it's direct-to-consumer advertising, not just in the U.S., but around the world, significant investments to building awareness for the category. 
I mean we've achieved 3 million -- surpassed 3 million users around the world. That's 3 -- we could say, hey, that's 3x our next competitor, but the reality is the penetration for us and for the categories is still pretty significant. So there's plenty of room here for us to invest and grow, and we'll be doing that on the back of our -- not only our commercial investments, but also R&D. 
Your question on Libre 3, that's -- we launched that into Europe at the end of this quarter. We're right where we want to be. 
We start off usually small and focused here, Larry. We learn. We learn with the consumer. We learn with the HCP in terms of what resonates. We learn with our manufacturing. We've got a lot of capabilities in terms of how to manufacture at scale. 
But there's always a little bit of a learning curve here. It is a new platform. And we learn with insurance, and insurance switches over and all those things. And once we get all of that kind of lined up, then we accelerate and we go break it. But I've got -- we've got a lot of strategic flexibility here with Libre 2 and Libre 3. I think we're in a great position. 
Feedback has been really good. I mean we've launched this with about over 1,000 HCPs. We've got close to a couple of hundred patients that we've now kind of just tried to see what their reactions are with the products, and it's been extremely positive. There's a lot of social media there. I'm not very fluent in German, but I can tell a facial expression of awesomeness and coolness and amazement factor, and you can see those in the videos of these patients that are using it. 
So I think this is going to set a whole new standard for us on every dimension: size, ease of use, accuracy, alarm performance, wear experience, all that. It's all great. It's all good. 
So regarding your question on Libre time frame, I think you answered it. So that's good. I'm not going to provide any details here. But I'm just really excited about Libre 3 and the combination of the portfolio, having both 2 and 3. I just think it provides us a lot of strategic flexibility."

And secondly, on just the progression of MitraClip, this has been a device and procedure that was a little bit more impacted by the slowdown over the winter. And just love to get a sense of what the trajectory looks like now heading into Q2."

So on the Amulet side, yes, listen, we've got experience in this category outside of the United States and the international markets, and the product does very well. We filed with the FDA late last year. We think this is a very attractive market. It's approaching about $1 billion today, and it's growing double digits. And as I said, I think Amulet is a very competitive product in its current form. 
We're obviously -- we'll obviously be investing as part of some of those R&D investments I mentioned in next generations there also. But even in its current format, performs very well, and we've got a great experience in Europe. 
We believe a lot in this market in this segment. And so we've also initiated our CATALYST trial. So we started a new trial late last year, and this is a trial comparing Amulet to NOAC drugs, which is currently the standard treatment option for people with AF that -- or at risk of a stroke. 
So we think that this will be a significant kind of growth driver after we launch also. Results there will take a little bit longer to divulge those, probably in the 2023 time frame. But it just shows our commitment to this segment because we believe we've got a great product, great product portfolio, a pipeline, and it's a great segment here. 
So I think you had another question on MitraClip. MitraClip did very well in the quarter. Obviously, it got impacted by COVID last year. It was on a great trajectory. It kind of got slowed down as as obviously the ICU beds and hospitals moved towards treating COVID. But we had great growth in Q1. We're up in the mid-teens in the U.S. So that was good. 
As I said in my prepared comments, we had our highest number of procedures ever in the month of March. And that wasn't just catch-up because I've looked at the procedures in the first 2 weeks of April and they continue to move up. So that's very positive for us. 
And we're making our investments, not only on the pipeline side, new versions of MitraClip, but also more importantly in the market development, so really to expand the funnel of patients being treated, creating those patient referral networks with the cardiologists and our implanting centers. So that's done very well. 
And I think the NCD that got approved in January, opens up a significant opportunity for us with MitraClip. Remember, we're only about 5% to 6%, maybe 7% penetrated right now in the total available market here. And I think that we've got a lot of runway for growth in the mitral space. 
And I think you also had a question on CardioMEMS. We expect to file for a label expansion relatively soon. This would also significantly broaden the U.S. market opportunity. And we plan to pursue CMS reimbursement after we obtain that label expansion. 
This segment continues to grow. Our Q1 growth in CardioMEMS was north of 20%. And that market has started to recover also from the pandemic, and I like the position we have in them."

You called out R&D, and we've seen DTC has been stepping up. I think there's a lot of Libre commercials there now. 
I guess my question is, when you think about these investments and the sustainability, historically, we've thought about Abbott is driving 7% growth. That was your algorithm pre-COVID. Do you think that the investments could lead to more sustainable, higher post-COVID organic growth? And then how quickly can you toggle them up and down if the environment changes quickly to manage earnings?"

Next year, you're probably growing a little bit higher than that, Matt. But at the high end of that 7% to 8% is what we're looking at, with all these investments and product development and portfolio development. 
As I said, a big portion of our COVID cash flows and profits, part of it goes to our shareholders, but part of it goes back into the business. And we've got a lot of flexibility here to toggle that investment up or down if we need to. I mean I'd probably say that each business has their list of go-to areas that we've all agreed to are kind of next steps. If we have more opportunity to invest in the business, we know exactly where to go. 
As it relates to toggling down, yes, I mean, I wouldn't be toggling down R&D. I think that's more of a sustainable kind of investment that sustains our growth rate. It's easier to toggle on SG&A, and we've got that capabilities also if we need to."

We've definitely been elevated to a kind of higher level of partnership here with a lot of hospitals and IDNs and institutions as it relates to their kind of COVID testing. There's been large set of accounts that we've historically been out of and now had the opportunity to place our instruments and show what we can do. 
So the answer to that is yes on the core lab for sure. You saw -- you're seeing a little bit of that strategy play out in the molecular side of the business, where we haven't seen these kind of growth rates in our molecular business, excluding COVID, in a very long time. And we were up close to 30%, excluding COVID testing. A lot of that has to do with the instruments that we're placing and getting the test pull-through on the other assays on the other tests. 
So on the rapid side, too, I wouldn't just look at it from a Core Lab perspective. The sustainability of COVID is one portion of it is the actual COVID test. The other portion of it is the installed base that we're placing as a result of that. 
I've talked a little bit about this building sustainability of a rapid testing channel beyond just COVID, and COVID is allowing us to do that. But if you think about, for example, our ID NOW instrument, where we basically ceded the market here for an opportunity to do much more in the world outside of COVID by placing these instruments, we had roughly about 19,000 boxes in the U.S. in 2019, and we're currently at 75,000 boxes. So we almost quadrupled our installed base there. 
And will they all be as productive from a COVID testing perspective at the highest level of the pandemic 1, 2 years out? No, probably not, but they'll be very productive with all of our other assays. And that installed base will continue to grow and will continue to produce for us. 
So to answer your question, yes, I do think this is a great opportunity here for us to continue to roll out our Alinity platform on the Core Lab, on the molecular side and continue to build our rapid testing channel in the rapids business."

So kind of growth rate in our diagnostic business, the way to think about it is, at least how we've modeled it, is we'll see our, let's call it, non-COVID diagnostic business continue to accelerate, continue to grow. Obviously, you'll have comps over there, Joanne, in Q2 and Q3. That will be producing some mid-teens kind of growth numbers in this business. 
But I think we always look at it, at least the way we're managing it here, is we're always looking at it on a 2-year CAGR. So if we can get back up to that kind of 10%, 11%, 12% growth rate that we were seeing in our Core Lab business that -- on a 2-year CAGR, that's basically our target to be able to get to those numbers. 
COVID testing, it's difficult to forecast right now. I can't give you an exact quarterly progression of that. I think the range that we've given last call, I'd continue to reiterate it. But it's going to be a little bit difficult here to get the exact calendarization, the exact mix, the exact geography right in terms of the COVID testing. 
What I will say though is that I do continue to believe that the shift from lab-based PCR will still play a role in COVID, but I think that the bigger role will be played by the rapid testing as it relates to surveillance. And as I said, I think we're well positioned there. 
I think you had -- your second question was regarding some of the other devices. I'd say, listen, I'm very pleased with CRM. I'm not saying that we've completely turned it around, but it's a great progression that we're seeing here. The launch of our ICDs and CRT-Ds with the Gallant brand with Bluetooth capability in Europe and U.S., all of the numbers show that we're picking up share, and that's the ultimate measure here. 
And I'm excited about the ability for us to enter the leadless segment in next year with our product and the capabilities that -- and the value proposition that, that product will bring versus competitive systems. So I think that's done very well. 
I'd say heart failure, one of the challenges there is probably -- that's probably the slowest part of the device portfolio to recover. A lot of those procedures require some ICU stays. So I think that one was one where we saw a little bit of impact to market. I'd say our share has started pretty high around the mid-80s, 85%. So that's mostly a market condition that we'll see come back. But I think that the CardioMEMS is another great opportunity for us where we saw growth in the quarter for 26%. 
So I don't know if I covered all the device areas that you wanted me to hit on."

We recently launched our remote programming and monitoring system, the NeuroSphere. I think that's going to create a whole new opportunity for us in terms of business model, in terms of our ability to service the patients and the physicians better with that. So we started to roll it out in the U.S. 
I think it applies to both SCS and DBS, too. We've gotten great feedback on that. So I think that we'll see sequential improvement on our performance in neuro not only as we lap the comps, but also as the NeuroSphere gets widely used. And then we've got a nice pipeline of products to be launching towards the end of the year here."

And then lastly, just on this Structural Heart business. I mean in the U.S., you're going to be adding Amulet and Portico in the near term.

So I think it always starts like that. It always starts with the strategic fit. And then if it's attractive, if the timing is right, then we'll look at it. 
I think all the areas that you mentioned are all areas that we look at. So we look at all those areas that you mentioned. We look at diagnostics. We look at all the areas we're always studying. And we're always paying attention to the new technologies, the new companies, et cetera. So I just won't tip my hand here and give anything away in terms of our competitive position here. 
So regarding your second question on sales forces, it always depends. But we tend to have a viewpoint here, Josh, where we believe that kind of focused and dedicated teams has always been best. That's kind of how we've run our businesses. It's how we've run our businesses for many, many decades. We don't try and bring things together that don't make sense just for the sake of synergies. 
If we believe we're in growth areas and growth businesses, then we'll fund them as growth business and growth areas. And quite frankly, all the businesses that you talked about in Structural Heart are areas of high potential growth. So we will treat them and resource them as such. 
So I'll just close here by saying we set guidance of at least $5, which is about 35% growth year-over-year. That's after a 13% growth in 2020. And we feel very good about our first quarter. We feel that our first quarter puts us on track to achieve those -- at least those $5. We have multiple ways to get there. 
The COVID market is going to move more and more towards rapid, and our position in this segment of COVID testing is unmatched with our capabilities, our scale, et cetera. And we believe a good portion of those tests, of that COVID testing market will remain at least into 2022. 
And I'm very pleased with the pace of recovery of our base business Abbott, or let's call it the non-COVID side of our business. And we're making investments in 2021, so we can accelerate our growth in 2022 and beyond, and we've talked about this also. So we feel very good about the position we're in today and the position we have this year and going into next year."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported the results of a very strong quarter. Ongoing earnings per share were $1.32, reflecting more than 100% growth compared to the prior year. Sales increased 33% on an organic basis in the quarter.  
At the start of the year, we issued full year guidance that reflected another year of strong performance, and through the first quarter, we're right on track with those expectations. Our full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance of at least $5 remains unchanged and reflects over 35% growth compared to last year.  
Our strong first quarter were comprised of several factors, including global COVID testing-related sales of $2.2 billion, with rapid tests compromising roughly 85% of those sales; strong sales growth across all 4 of our major business areas, which resulted in base business organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing-related sales, of nearly 6%; growth contributions and momentum from several recently launched products across all of our businesses; and the impact of significant investments we're making across our portfolio in R&D and commercial initiatives that will further strengthen our sustainable growth profile.  
I'll now summarize our first quarter results before turning the call over to Bob. And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased nearly 6.5% in the quarter. Performance was led by our Adult Nutrition business, with sales growth of more than 18% in the quarter. The pandemic has brought a lot of awareness to the value of good nutrition, including immune support, which is helping to bring new users into the category and more specifically to our market-leading Ensure and Glucerna brands.  
Pediatric Nutrition sales declined 2.5% in the quarter. Recall, during the first quarter of last year, this business experienced significant pantry stocking ahead of the shelter-in-place restrictions in several countries at the start of the global pandemic. Our sales growth this quarter in Pediatric Nutrition reflects that difficult year-over-year comparison. In the U.S. and several international markets, we continue to capture share with our leading portfolio of infant formula and toddler brands.  
In Diagnostics, sales increased 115%, which was led by significant demand for our portfolio of COVID-19 tests as well as improvement in the base business. As I mentioned earlier, strong COVID testing-related sales were led by our rapid point-of-care platforms, ID NOW, BinaxNOW and Panbio, as we continue to see demand shift towards rapid testing worldwide. During the quarter, BinaxNOW received U.S. Emergency Use Authorization for over-the-counter, nonprescription, self-use for people with or without symptoms. We began shipping test kits to major retailers yesterday.  
Just as importantly, our underlying base business continues to improve, driven by improving routine diagnostic testing levels and the continued rollout of our Alinity platforms. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, our Core Lab and Molecular Diagnostic businesses both achieved double-digit sales growth in the quarter. 
Turning to Established Pharmaceuticals, where sales grew over 6% in the quarter, which is particularly strong given the comparison versus a strong first quarter last year. Performance in the quarter was led by double-digit sales growth in India, China and Brazil. And while we continue to see elevated COVID case levels across several emerging markets, the business is executing at a high level to ensure patients have access to our branded generic medicines.  
And lastly, I'll cover Medical Devices, where sales grew nearly 9% in the quarter, led by strong growth in Structural Heart, Rhythm Management, Electrophysiology and Diabetes Care. Although procedure volumes across our cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses were impacted early in the year by elevated [ coast ] case rates in certain countries including the U.S., we saw growth improve throughout the quarter and exited with good momentum. On average in March, U.S. procedure levels were up mid-single digits compared to pre-COVID baselines across our cardiovascular business with some areas even higher.  
In Structural Heart, sales were up mid-teens overall with growth contributions coming from several products within our innovative portfolio, including MitraClip, TriClip, Portico and others. MitraClip sales grew more than 15% in the U.S., where we achieved our highest number of monthly procedures ever in the month of March. In January, CMS expanded reimbursement covered for MitraClip, which significantly increases the number of people who can benefit from this market-leading device.  
And I'll wrap up with Diabetes Care, where growth was led by Freestyle Libre sales of nearly $830 million. The global user base for Libre has now surpassed 3 million users, driven by market expansion and awareness efforts as well as ongoing new product launch activity in every major market around the world.  
So in summary, we're off to a very strong start and right on track with our expectations for the year. All 4 of our major businesses are achieving strong growth. We're particularly pleased with the growth contributions and momentum of several recently launched products. And we're well positioned to achieve more than 35% EPS growth, as we have forecasted at the beginning of the year. 
I'll now turn over the call to Bob to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Bob?"

As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.

As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance. 
Turning to our results. Sales for the first quarter increased 32.9%, which was led by strong performance across all of our businesses, along with strong global COVID testing-related sales. Organic sales growth was balanced, with 34% growth in the U.S. and 32% growth internationally. COVID testing-related sales were also balanced geographically, with a little more than half of those sales coming from international markets.  
Foreign exchange had a favorable year-over-year impact of 2.5% on first quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthen somewhat versus several currencies, which resulted in a slightly less favorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in January. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a favorable impact of approximately 4% on our second quarter reported sales and would now expect exchange to have a favorable impact of nearly 2% on our full year 2021 sales.  
Regarding other aspects of the P&L for the first quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.3% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 6% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 25.1% of sales. As Robert mentioned, the strength of our business performance has created an opportunity to significantly increase our investments in R&D and SG&A to further strengthen our pipeline and growth initiatives. During the first quarter, our combined investments in these areas increased approximately $200 million compared to the same quarter last year and was at the highest level since our separation with AbbVie.  
For the first quarter, net interest expense was $124 million. Nonoperating income was $73 million. And our adjusted tax rate was 15%, which is consistent with our full year effective tax rate from last year. 
With that, we'll now open the call for questions."

I guess I'd love to hear your thoughts on 2 important topics, Robert, if you don't mind, and that the first topic is BinaxNOW OTC. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about capacity and your early thoughts on how you think demand will play out for that product. So that's the first topic.  
And then I'll just go ahead and list the second one in the interest of time. The second topic is a little bit longer-term oriented, because last quarter you expressed some confidence in Abbott's ability to drive double-digit earnings growth in 2022 off of that $5 number for this year.  
And the question I would have is, based on what you're seeing today, has anything changed with your views? And then I think investors would also love to hear, if you assume a more conservative testing scenario, how does that impact that goal of double-digit earnings growth next year? So I just wanted to list this all upfront there."

On your first question regarding kind of the U.S. Binax OTC launch, so yes, we're very excited about that. We see this is a as a significant opportunity, and quite frankly, a trend that's been happening overseas and is kind of now happening",972,"Okay, thanks. On your first question regarding kind of the U.S. Binax OTC launch, so yes, we're very excited about that. We see this is a as a significant opportunity, and quite frankly, a trend that's been happening overseas and is kind of now happening here in the U.S., which is this move, this accelerated move here from, say, more hospital lab-based testing to more rapid testing outside of that environment, where consumers and people can get the results at a much faster rate, and quite frankly, with a little bit less hassle, less process. So we see this as a significant opportunity. It's easy and it's affordable. And I think that's a key part here, Bob, as we think about surveillance testing and serial testing. It needs to contemplate those 2 areas, right? It needs to be affordable.  
It's difficult to do serial testing on PCR when you've got a cost of $100-plus and takes between 2 to 3 days to get that. So I think we're in a great opportunity here to be able to capitalize on that. I think this is something that people are going to want to buy and have in their homes and stock up in their homes. Think of it as maybe your new element in your medicine cabinet. But we've been seeing this shift happen towards the end of last year and definitely into this quarter here, this move towards rapid. Specifically in the U.S., we've got a great position as a lot of this OTC is going to require understanding of the retail and the retail environment, the retail channel. And those are capabilities that, as you know through our Nutrition business, through our Diabetes business, we know how to operate and operate pretty well in there.  
So we're excited, and I think this is going to eliminate a lot of the barriers that exist for frequent testing. A key aspect of that is obviously scale. We have to have scale to be able to meet the demand. And quite frankly, we're probably the leaders here in terms of production. We've got an established capacity this quarter now, that we can do about 150 million rapid tests per month across all of our different platforms.  
So we feel very good about that position. We feel good about this opportunity.  
To your second question on 2022, yes, we did -- you did mention our confidence back in January, and we commented it on our call. And to be honest, nothing's changed on that front. Nothing's changed over the last 90 days.  
We start our planning process every year. We target double-digit growth. And we talked about some of the key elements and laid out some of the key elements that allowed us to have that confidence to be able to drive that double digit in 2022, whether it's the pace of recovery of our base business, COVID testing, new product launches, investment spend, et cetera. None of that has changed. I mean if you look at the pace of our recovery on our base business, that's done very well. Cardio and neuro finished the quarter very strong. We grew double digits, as I said in my prepared remarks, in Core Lab and Molecular Diagnostics excluding COVID. Libre is growing rapidly. Nutrition and EPD are accelerating their growth rates with pipeline and a market that supports that sustained growth. We've got momentum with a lot of our product launches: MitraClip G4, TriClip, I'd say our mapping systems, our new CRM devices.  
And then we've got coming out of this year going into next year, 4 key product launches that we feel very good about. We're very excited about them, given our position, given the product offering and the value proposition of them. And you know those are LAA -- entering the LAA market here in the U.S., potential expansion of indication for CardioMEMS, entering the leadless pacemaker with single chamber and then follow that with a dual chamber, entering the U.S. TAVR market. I mean all 4 of those opportunities are multibillion-dollar segments. And we've been working hard on the last, call it, 18 months to get us ready and to be in a position in 2022 to be able to capitalize on that. 
So the underlying base business, the pipeline, all of that is kind of heading in the right direction and don't see any changes. If anything, there's acceleration to kind of what we talked about 90 days ago. 
And we continue to believe a good portion of the COVID testing is sustainable. There's, as I said, there's a clear trend here to move towards rapid formats. We're the dominant producer here of these rapid tests, making about 150 million a month. So wherever that market goes, we know that we'll be the share leader here for sure. So you look at all these different components here, Bob, we still feel very confident about our double digit. 
The one thing I'll say is that as you look at all these different businesses, probably one thing that we can try and model now but it will probably be different, January is just how the mix of those businesses are going to contribute to that double-digit growth. It always ends up differently in terms of how we plan. We did double digit in '20, and it was very different versus how we set it up in January of 2020. 
So if you look at our history, we're pretty consistent about delivering on that. If there's any caution here, I guess, for next year, it'd already be -- seem to be priced here into our P/E. So -- but that being said, I don't think anything has changed here from the last 90 days from our perspective. We still feel very good about our double digit."

I mean I talked a lot about these in terms of the investments we're making. I'd say from a bigger picture perspective, we want to make sure that we're spending and investing a good portion of these COVID testing profits into the R&D portion of the P&L. We believe that is a very sustainable investment. 
And if I look across all of the businesses, in devices, in diagnostics, in rapid diagnostics, in nutrition, all of these businesses have opportunities to invest in R&D. And we've got clear programs across all of them to build the R&D programs that will sustain our growth beyond '22, '23, '24. 
A lot of the products that I just mentioned, whether it's the ones we've just launched over the last kind of quarter, 2 or 3 quarters, plus the 4 key areas that we're looking at entering in 2022, those are going to drive a lot of our revenue growth. And those have already been funded, but I would say the investments here are really looking into next-generation products in Diagnostics, expansion in our portfolio and devices that will lead to new product launches in '23 and '24. 
On the SG&A side, we're making sure that we're supporting our big growth products. I'd say probably a lot of the SG&A is going towards Libre and driving Libre awareness and growth, both in the U.S. and international markets. And you'll start to see that ramp up even more as we go throughout the year, both in terms of spend and the return on the top line. 
We're making investments also in Nutrition to strengthen our brand and capitalize on the expansion, especially in the adult nutrition side of the market. And expanding footprint in several of our device businesses where we know that clinical specialists and sales force, et cetera, is important to be able to support not only the expansion of our current products, but the launch of new products."

Obviously, there was obviously some -- a little bit of a slowdown in January. So we had a nice pickup, I'd say, in October, November where -- sorry, yes October, November, where we saw procedure growth rates return to growth. And I'd say December, January saw that decline as the cases increased, but saw real nice progression in the month of February and then very strong growth in March. 
And Rob, what we try to do also is we try to look at there's -- March is a tricky month because you've got those 2 weeks of last year where things kind of really kind of shut down. So we look at March not only versus last year, but also looking at it versus March of 2019, and quite frankly, the whole quarter versus 2019. And we actually see growth rates in this quarter that are higher than our pre-pandemic rates in 2019, in Q1 of 2019. So I think we saw a real nice growth. 
In Core Lab, that was very positive to see. We saw double-digit growth there, and that's a good indicator of routine testing coming back to hospitals, saw double digit there. 
Our Molecular Diagnostic business, excluding COVID and PCR COVID testing, was up 30%. So that's a real positive sign that our strategy of utilizing the Alinity M to launch into the market with COVID and then kind of build off the menu is also having a positive impact over there, too. 
So I'd say very good exit rate. And as we look at the first 2 weeks of April, and we look at it every week here, real nice progression. 
So I didn't see the bolus coming in and then the drop. I actually saw continued nice improvement in Structural Heart, in EP and even in CRM. So those are -- that's a nice trend as we're going into the second quarter, too. 
And we'll start to see a little bit of opening up here in Europe. I'd say the one area that was a little bit softer for us was Europe, given all the shutdowns there. But again, I'd say the first couple of weeks in Europe are looking pretty good."

And again, there's multiple ways of how we can get there in terms of business mix, et cetera. 
We do have a strong balance sheet, and that provides us a lot of strategic flexibility. We try to have a balanced approach there, Larry, in terms of balancing between the short and long-term investing in the business and providing some of that return back to our shareholders. 
So whether it's in the form of dividend, we're committed to a strong growing dividend. It's an important part of our identity. 
On the share repurchasing, we've historically just really looked at share repurchasing to offset some of the dilution. We could be looking to do a little bit more than that going -- in this year, going into next year. 
And then from an M&A perspective, I'd say we're always actively monitoring. We're always actively looking. And you'll always hear me say that I'm not going to tip my hand and give up any kind of competitive advantage there. But if there's something that is attractive, something that has got growth, that won't dilute our top line growth profile, which I think is best in class, or that we can do better with, we're always going to be interested. But we're always going to be prudent about deploying our cash, Larry, always keeping our shareholders happy, balancing the long term, the short term, the internal and the external.

We'll have some effect on the reverse side of that in Q2. So then it becomes really a second half, can we kind of sustain this kind of mid-30s and accelerate it into the 40s in the second half? And the answer is we believe so. We've got a great portfolio. We've got great momentum and making the investments, whether it's field force, whether it's direct-to-consumer advertising, not just in the U.S., but around the world, significant investments to building awareness for the category. 
I mean we've achieved 3 million -- surpassed 3 million users around the world. That's 3 -- we could say, hey, that's 3x our next competitor, but the reality is the penetration for us and for the categories is still pretty significant. So there's plenty of room here for us to invest and grow, and we'll be doing that on the back of our -- not only our commercial investments, but also R&D. 
Your question on Libre 3, that's -- we launched that into Europe at the end of this quarter. We're right where we want to be. 
We start off usually small and focused here, Larry. We learn. We learn with the consumer. We learn with the HCP in terms of what resonates. We learn with our manufacturing. We've got a lot of capabilities in terms of how to manufacture at scale. 
But there's always a little bit of a learning curve here. It is a new platform. And we learn with insurance, and insurance switches over and all those things. And once we get all of that kind of lined up, then we accelerate and we go break it. But I've got -- we've got a lot of strategic flexibility here with Libre 2 and Libre 3. I think we're in a great position. 
Feedback has been really good. I mean we've launched this with about over 1,000 HCPs. We've got close to a couple of hundred patients that we've now kind of just tried to see what their reactions are with the products, and it's been extremely positive. There's a lot of social media there. I'm not very fluent in German, but I can tell a facial expression of awesomeness and coolness and amazement factor, and you can see those in the videos of these patients that are using it. 
So I think this is going to set a whole new standard for us on every dimension: size, ease of use, accuracy, alarm performance, wear experience, all that. It's all great. It's all good. 
So regarding your question on Libre time frame, I think you answered it. So that's good. I'm not going to provide any details here. But I'm just really excited about Libre 3 and the combination of the portfolio, having both 2 and 3. I just think it provides us a lot of strategic flexibility."

So yes, I mean we received approval for the product several weeks ago, and we immediately started our manufacturing process. It is a different presentation from the previous Binax test in which we provide 2 tests and the necessary consumables to run those tests. So we started manufacturing that and began shipping literally yesterday to retailers. And we'll start with CVS, Walgreens, Walmart. And you can expect all the other retailers, food merchants, et cetera, to roll into that as we expand and start manufacturing and accelerating our manufacturing. 
So yes, we ship the product and the revenue is booked when the asset is transferred over to the retailer. But I think this is going to be, as I said, a great opportunity. It's a channel we know very well. I think few diagnostic companies that have this product have the capacity, the manufacturing scale and the channel experience and domain here to kind of really compete. 
So we feel very good about our position. And we'll start -- we start off with initial stocking orders. And then from them, we'll roll out more distribution. And we expect, given the price point here, Vijay, that there's going to be a great opportunity for a lot of households in the U.S. to be able to have testing on hand, ready to go at their house. So we expect that there'll be a nice repeat purchase also."

So on the Amulet side, yes, listen, we've got experience in this category outside of the United States and the international markets, and the product does very well. We filed with the FDA late last year. We think this is a very attractive market. It's approaching about $1 billion today, and it's growing double digits. And as I said, I think Amulet is a very competitive product in its current form. 
We're obviously -- we'll obviously be investing as part of some of those R&D investments I mentioned in next generations there also. But even in its current format, performs very well, and we've got a great experience in Europe. 
We believe a lot in this market in this segment. And so we've also initiated our CATALYST trial. So we started a new trial late last year, and this is a trial comparing Amulet to NOAC drugs, which is currently the standard treatment option for people with AF that -- or at risk of a stroke. 
So we think that this will be a significant kind of growth driver after we launch also. Results there will take a little bit longer to divulge those, probably in the 2023 time frame. But it just shows our commitment to this segment because we believe we've got a great product, great product portfolio, a pipeline, and it's a great segment here. 
So I think you had another question on MitraClip. MitraClip did very well in the quarter. Obviously, it got impacted by COVID last year. It was on a great trajectory. It kind of got slowed down as obviously the ICU beds and hospitals moved towards treating COVID. But we had great growth in Q1. We're up in the mid-teens in the U.S. So that was good. 
As I said in my prepared comments, we had our highest number of procedures ever in the month of March. And that wasn't just catch-up because I've looked at the procedures in the first 2 weeks of April and they continue to move up. So that's very positive for us. 
And we're making our investments, not only on the pipeline side, new versions of MitraClip, but also more importantly in the market development, so really to expand the funnel of patients being treated, creating those patient referral networks with the cardiologists and our implanting centers. So that's done very well. 
And I think the NCD that got approved in January, opens up a significant opportunity for us with MitraClip. Remember, we're only about 5% to 6%, maybe 7% penetrated right now in the total available market here. And I think that we've got a lot of runway for growth in the mitral space. 
And I think you also had a question on CardioMEMS. We expect to file for a label expansion relatively soon. This would also significantly broaden the U.S. market opportunity. And we plan to pursue CMS reimbursement after we obtain that label expansion. 
This segment continues to grow. Our Q1 growth in CardioMEMS was north of 20%. And that market has started to recover also from the pandemic, and I like the position we have in them."

You called out R&D, and we've seen DTC has been stepping up. I think there's a lot of Libre commercials there now. 
I guess my question is, when you think about these investments and the sustainability, historically, we've thought about Abbott is driving 7% growth. That was your algorithm pre-COVID. Do you think that the investments could lead to more sustainable, higher post-COVID organic growth? And then how quickly can you toggle them up and down if the environment changes quickly to manage earnings?"

Next year, you're probably growing a little bit higher than that, Matt. But at the high end of that 7% to 8% is what we're looking at, with all these investments and product development and portfolio development. 
As I said, a big portion of our COVID cash flows and profits, part of it goes to our shareholders, but part of it goes back into the business. And we've got a lot of flexibility here to toggle that investment up or down if we need to. I mean I'd probably say that each business has their list of go-to areas that we've all agreed to are kind of next steps. If we have more opportunity to invest in the business, we know exactly where to go. 
As it relates to toggling down, yes, I mean, I wouldn't be toggling down R&D. I think that's more of a sustainable kind of investment that sustains our growth rate. It's easier to toggle on SG&A, and we've got that capabilities also if we need to."

We've definitely been elevated to a kind of higher level of partnership here with a lot of hospitals and IDNs and institutions as it relates to their kind of COVID testing. There's been large set of accounts that we've historically been out of and now had the opportunity to place our instruments and show what we can do. 
So the answer to that is yes on the core lab for sure. You saw -- you're seeing a little bit of that strategy play out in the molecular side of the business, where we haven't seen these kind of growth rates in our molecular business, excluding COVID, in a very long time. And we were up close to 30%, excluding COVID testing. A lot of that has to do with the instruments that we're placing and getting the test pull-through on the other assays on the other tests. 
So on the rapid side, too, I wouldn't just look at it from a Core Lab perspective. The sustainability of COVID is one portion of it is the actual COVID test. The other portion of it is the installed base that we're placing as a result of that. 
I've talked a little bit about this building sustainability of a rapid testing channel beyond just COVID, and COVID is allowing us to do that. But if you think about, for example, our ID NOW instrument, where we basically ceded the market here for an opportunity to do much more in the world outside of COVID by placing these instruments, we had roughly about 19,000 boxes in the U.S. in 2019, and we're currently at 75,000 boxes. So we almost quadrupled our installed base there. 
And will they all be as productive from a COVID testing perspective at the highest level of the pandemic 1, 2 years out? No, probably not, but they'll be very productive with all of our other assays. And that installed base will continue to grow and will continue to produce for us. 
So to answer your question, yes, I do think this is a great opportunity here for us to continue to roll out our Alinity platform on the Core Lab, on the molecular side and continue to build our rapid testing channel in the rapids business."

So kind of growth rate in our diagnostic business, the way to think about it is, at least how we've modeled it, is we'll see our, let's call it, non-COVID diagnostic business continue to accelerate, continue to grow. Obviously, you'll have comps over there, Joanne, in Q2 and Q3. That will be producing some mid-teens kind of growth numbers in this business. 
But I think we always look at it, at least the way we're managing it here, is we're always looking at it on a 2-year CAGR. So if we can get back up to that kind of 10%, 11%, 12% growth rate that we were seeing in our Core Lab business that -- on a 2-year CAGR, that's basically our target to be able to get to those numbers. 
COVID testing, it's difficult to forecast right now. I can't give you an exact quarterly progression of that. I think the range that we've given last call, I'd continue to reiterate it. But it's going to be a little bit difficult here to get the exact calendarization, the exact mix, the exact geography right in terms of the COVID testing. 
What I will say though is that I do continue to believe that the shift from lab-based PCR will still play a role in COVID, but I think that the bigger role will be played by the rapid testing as it relates to surveillance. And as I said, I think we're well positioned there. 
I think you had -- your second question was regarding some of the other devices. I'd say, listen, I'm very pleased with CRM. I'm not saying that we've completely turned it around, but it's a great progression that we're seeing here. The launch of our ICDs and CRT-Ds with the Gallant brand with Bluetooth capability in Europe and U.S., all of the numbers show that we're picking up share, and that's the ultimate measure here. 
And I'm excited about the ability for us to enter the leadless segment in next year with our product and the capabilities that -- and the value proposition that, that product will bring versus competitive systems. So I think that's done very well. 
I'd say heart failure, one of the challenges there is probably -- that's probably the slowest part of the device portfolio to recover. A lot of those procedures require some ICU stays. So I think that one was one where we saw a little bit of impact to market. I'd say our share has started pretty high around the mid-80s, 85%. So that's mostly a market condition that we'll see come back. But I think that the CardioMEMS is another great opportunity for us where we saw growth in the quarter for 26%. 
So I don't know if I covered all the device areas that you wanted me to hit on."

We recently launched our remote programming and monitoring system, the NeuroSphere. I think that's going to create a whole new opportunity for us in terms of business model, in terms of our ability to service the patients and the physicians better with that. So we started to roll it out in the U.S. 
I think it applies to both SCS and DBS, too. We've gotten great feedback on that. So I think that we'll see sequential improvement on our performance in neuro not only as we lap the comps, but also as the NeuroSphere gets widely used. And then we've got a nice pipeline of products to be launching towards the end of the year here."

And then lastly, just on this Structural Heart business. I mean in the U.S., you're going to be adding Amulet and Portico in the near term.

So I think it always starts like that. It always starts with the strategic fit. And then if it's attractive, if the timing is right, then we'll look at it. 
I think all the areas that you mentioned are all areas that we look at. So we look at all those areas that you mentioned. We look at diagnostics. We look at all the areas we're always studying. And we're always paying attention to the new technologies, the new companies, et cetera. So I just won't tip my hand here and give anything away in terms of our competitive position here. 
So regarding your second question on sales forces, it always depends. But we tend to have a viewpoint here, Josh, where we believe that kind of focused and dedicated teams has always been best. That's kind of how we've run our businesses. It's how we've run our businesses for many, many decades. We don't try and bring things together that don't make sense just for the sake of synergies. 
If we believe we're in growth areas and growth businesses, then we'll fund them as growth business and growth areas. And quite frankly, all the businesses that you talked about in Structural Heart are areas of high potential growth. So we will treat them and resource them as such. 
So I'll just close here by saying we set guidance of at least $5, which is about 35% growth year-over-year. That's after a 13% growth in 2020. And we feel very good about our first quarter. We feel that our first quarter puts us on track to achieve those -- at least those $5. We have multiple ways to get there. 
The COVID market is going to move more and more towards rapid, and our position in this segment of COVID testing is unmatched with our capabilities, our scale, et cetera. And we believe a good portion of those tests, of that COVID testing market will remain at least into 2022. 
And I'm very pleased with the pace of recovery of our base business Abbott, or let's call it the non-COVID side of our business. And we're making investments in 2021, so we can accelerate our growth in 2022 and beyond, and we've talked about this also. So we feel very good about the position we're in today and the position we have this year and going into next year."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported results of a very strong quarter. Ongoing earnings per share were $1.17, reflecting more than 100% growth compared to the prior year. Sales increased 35% on an organic basis in the quarter compared to last year. 
Given the significant negative impact COVID had on demand for elective medical procedures and routine diagnostic testing last year. Comparing sales versus pre-pandemic levels in 2019 provides one of the more relevant measures of performance. On this comparison, excluding sales from our COVID testing business, organic sales grew nearly 11.5% in the second quarter, driven by strong sales growth across all 4 of our major businesses, including double-digit growth in Established Pharmaceuticals, Nutrition and Medical Devices. 
I'll now summarize our second quarter results before turning over the call to Bob. And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased 9.5% compared to last year. Strong growth in the quarter was led by mid-teens growth in Adult Nutrition, including more than 20% growth internationally. 
Since the beginning of the pandemic, we've seen 2 factors positively impact Adult Nutrition demand: new users are entering the category and existing customers have increased their usage. And as the global market leader, these dynamics are driving strong growth for our Ensure and Glucerna brands. 
In Pediatric Nutrition, sales grew nearly 4.5% in the quarter led by growth of nearly 9% in the U.S., where we continue to capture share with our leading portfolio of infant formula and toddler brands. Sales of PDL, our global rehydration brand grew strong double digits, driven by recently launched new products and increased investments we're making in direct-to-consumer promotion. 
Turning to diagnostics. Sales increased more than 55%, which includes $1.3 billion of COVID testing-related sales. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, underlying diagnostic sales increased 37% compared to last year. Strong sales growth in our underlying Diagnostic business is being driven by improving routine diagnostic testing as health care systems continue to recover from the pandemic as well as the continued rollout of our Alinity platforms. 
Excluding COVID testing-related sales, second quarter sales in core laboratory and molecular diagnostics grew mid-single digits compared to pre-pandemic levels in the second quarter of 2019. 
Moving to Established Pharmaceuticals, where sales grew nearly 15% in the quarter. Strong sales performance in the quarter was broad-based across several countries, including double-digit growth in India, China, Russia and Brazil, which led to overall sales growth of nearly 18.5% in our key emerging markets. 
While we continue to see COVID cases surge in several emerging markets, including the recent surge in India, our team is executing at a high level to meet market demand for our medicines. And lastly, I'll cover Medical Devices, where sales grew 45% in the quarter compared to last year and more than 15.5% compared to the second quarter of 2019. 
Strong growth in the quarter was led by structural heart electrophysiology, heart failure and diabetes care, all of which grew double digits compared to the second quarter of 2019. In Structural Heart, we achieved the highest number of micro code procedures ever in the second quarter, including a record number of procedures in the month of June. 
Now I'll wrap up with Diabetes Care where strong growth was led by FreeStyle Libre sales of more than $900 million. The global user base for Libre grew to approximately 3.5 million users, including approximately 1 million users in the U.S. driven by market expansion and awareness efforts as well as ongoing new product launch activity in every major market around the world. 
So in summary, we're achieving strong growth across all 4 of our major businesses, particularly pleased with the strong momentum and growth contributions we're seeing from several recently launched products and investments we're making in our key growth platforms. And our new product pipeline continues to be incredibly productive, delivering a steady cadence of new products with more to come over the next several months. 
I'll now turn over the call to Bob to discuss our results and outlook for the full year in more detail. Bob?"

As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance. Turning to our results. Sales for the second quarter increased 35% on an organic basis, which was led by strong performance across all of our businesses. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, organic sales growth was 29% versus last year and nearly 11.5% compared to the second quarter of 2019. 
Foreign exchange had a favorable year-over-year impact of 4.5% on second quarter sales, resulting in total reported sales growth of 39.5% in the quarter. Regarding other aspects of the P&L for the quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 56.9% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 6.2% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 25.8% of sales. 
Our second quarter adjusted tax rate was 14.4%, which reflects an adjustment to align our year-to-date tax rate with our revised full year effective tax rate forecast of 14.7%. The revised full year forecast is modestly lower than the estimate we provided in January due to a shift in the mix of our business and geographic income. 
Turning to our outlook for the full year 2021. Our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.30 to $4.50 remains unchanged and and reflects strong double-digit growth compared to last year and approximately 35% growth at the midpoint compared to our pre-pandemic adjusted earnings per share in 2019. 
We continue to forecast $4 billion to $4.5 billion in COVID testing-related sales for the full year 2021. And based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a favorable impact of around 2% on our full year 2021 sales. 
Turning to the outlook for the third quarter. We forecast adjusted earnings per share of at least $0.90 and which reflects continued strong growth and momentum in our core underlying business and a sequential step down in COVID testing-related sales compared to the second quarter. And based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a favorable impact of around 1% on our third quarter reported sales. 
With that, we'll now open the call for questions."

Listen, we obviously had a very strong quarter in terms of recovery. I mean we had planned to see that recovery in the U.S. and in Europe in certain Asian markets, and that recovery has largely played out the way we had anticipated. I'd say probably a little bit better even than what we thought. I don't think what we're seeing here with relating to like increase in COVID cases, I don't think that you'll see the same -- or at least we're not seeing the same kind of impact in terms of hospitals, shutting procedures down, stopping testing, et cetera. I think it's a very different situation where we are this year versus where we are last year, even though if you look at the case, global case counts, they're pretty much in line to where we were in October last year. We've got therapeutics. We've got vaccines. We've got testing. So we're not seeing that. 
On the device side, listen, our business has done very well. Overall, as I said in my comments, we're up double digits, mid-teens versus the second quarter largely driven by EP, heart failure, structural heart, diabetes, as I said. And actually, if you look at the cardiovascular specific recovery, we exited the first quarter at about a 2% growth versus March of 2019. And then if you look at the second quarter, our June growth rate was around about 7% versus June of 2019. So we're seeing this kind of sequential recovery in the procedures as evidenced by our growth rates in our procedures. And we were looking at data yesterday in the first couple of weeks of July are showing that same trajectory, whether it's in the U.S. or whether it's outside the U.S., generally. Obviously, there are some markets that have different kind of trends in paces. But I'd say, overall, we're seeing that recovery. And that's how we're looking at the rest of the year, Bob, is that continued trajectory in terms of recovery in procedures and diagnostic testing."

And so that was about a 1/3 [indiscernible] About 2/3 really was better performance in the base business versus how The Street had modeled that. And so the way we look at it, we gave a pretty wide range on earnings guidance back at the beginning of June. And that really kind of accounts for any kind of fluctuations or changes in the COVID testing in the back half of this year as well as kind of underlying base business performance. So we feel really comfortable about the range we have and feel that kind of captures different scenarios around COVID testing."

Obviously, from a top line perspective, we're going to have to lap some of our COVID sales that we had in Q3 and Q4. Obviously, if you looked at last year, that was really the height of our ramp-up in COVID sales. But the underlying business, excluding COVID sales, will be getting sequentially better every quarter. So we're looking at our base underlying business growing low double digits for the rest of the year. From a gross margin perspective, we'll see expansion in gross margin versus where we were in Q2. There's obviously maybe some friction on on some input costs, commodities, freight, et cetera, the team works hard to kind of offset those. So we'll see improvement also as the base business recovers and the margin profiles from that recovery expand. And we'll continue to make the ramp-up of investments that we talked about from an R&D and SG&A perspective. Some of those investments have a faster and more, I'd say, kind of more immediate return. So for example, direct-to-consumer advertising in Nutrition or Libre, for example, and some of those investments are a little bit more medium term, whether it's R&D programs or whether it's kind of getting ready for upcoming launches. So the real, I'd say, kind of factor here becomes COVID testing. And we gave guidance about a month ago about $4 billion to $4.5 billion after the 2 quarters were about $3 billion, $3.5 billion. So we've got between $0.5 billion and $1 billion to go in the next 6 months. And I think that's really the question here is how well testing play itself out in the next kind of second half year, whether it's variance, whether it's vaccination rates, et cetera. So that's just something that we're paying attention. And as Bob said, that's why our guidance range was pretty wide, which is ability to account for that."

The product is available in Europe and in those markets, albeit a smaller market than the U.S., we have a 50% market share. So we feel very good about our ability here to compete with the product we have. Regarding timing, it's one of those I can't give you an exact timing. It's definitely, we think, kind of in the second half. And then it's just going to depend in terms of impact this year versus next year. Obviously, the impact next year is larger. And that's just going to depend on when the approval hits this year. Obviously, if it's more towards the back end of the year, then we'll see less of an impact. If it's sooner, that will be an opportunity for us here to execute on that. On CardioMEMS, I guess, similar. We think this is another great opportunity. I mean, both these products were products when we began the St. Jude integration, both of these products were trials that we really wanted to invest in and drive on the clinical evidence and driving the clinical of these 2 products. So it's great to see we're in a position now to be able to kind of disclose and share the data from these trials that we put together. We filed our label expansion with the FDA on CardioMEMS this second quarter, more towards the end of the second quarter. And again, we think it's a great opportunity also.

Maybe perhaps can you talk about what's happening to device business? What was the sequential acceleration? And what is baked in for the back half? Should we continue to see some benefit from backlog and further acceleration?"

So if you look at our device portfolio, one of the parts of the portfolio that we've seen a little bit of a lagging recovery here has been in neuromodulation, where characterize that as a little bit even more elective than some of the other procedures. And we've seen say, like a little bit of a slower recovery trend in that business versus, say, for example, a structural heart, and EP or a diabetes business. Similar to Diagnostics, our immunoassay and clinical chemistry business that's growing high single digits in the second quarter versus the second quarter of 2019, and that's an improvement versus where we were in Q1. One of the issues that we see in our Diagnostic businesses, we're seeing a slower recovery in kind of blood donations and that obviously impacts our transfusion business. So kind of similar to neural on the diagnostic side, seem a little of a slower recovery. But I'd say those businesses that were more impacted by COVID in Q2 of last year. I'd say they've largely kind of recovered very well, very nicely and we expect that trend to continue in the second half."

I mean I think a lot of these device segments that we see kind of large opportunities. I think the key thing here is to make sure that you clinical evidence to be able to kind of create a strong kind of market development approach here. And when we looked at CardioMEMS at the time back in 2017, there were some issues with reimbursement CMS, certain of the max kind of work reimbursing, et cetera. And you had positive champions data. I'm aware of some of the perceived shortcomings of that trial. But there is also plenty of real-world evidence showing similar benefits and similar results that you had observed in Champion. So we looked at this and we believe that this was a significant opportunity in the cardiovascular space. We believe that monitoring pulmonary arterial pressure is a great indicator for prevention of acute heart failure. And decided to make the investment in a larger trial to either address the perceived shortcomings of champion or -- and/or augment the data set. So I'm hesitant to put a number around here, Vijay. But I think the viewpoint here is that this is an opportunity as we're building our Heart Failure portfolio together with our LVAD portfolio and even with MitraClip, quite frankly, to really have a comprehensive suite of solutions for it. And I think this is going to be an opportunity that we will be intentional about investing, whether it's trial, whether it clinical and field-based teams to drive it. We think the opportunity to expand the label to a Class II and Class IV presents a significant opportunity for us to expand the market and also the indication here to include CardioMEMS with elevated levels of BNP. So I think that this is a great opportunity. I guess your comment on mortality, I think that's important, but I also know in talking to health systems, that hospitalization and reduction in hospitalization is still very important. Some can argue that maybe you're just kicking the can down the road. But I think that if you look at and have conversations with the health care systems, they'll see this as an important reduction, any redemption of hospitalization for this patient population will be significantly important for them. So bottom line, yes, I think this is a great opportunity for us and we're being intentional about our investment. And making the right clinical evidence to support the adoption so that we can get to numbers that you're referencing or even bigger."

Listen, we had a real strong quarter as you saw, and as you mentioned, approaching that $1 billion mark on a quarterly perspective, sales above 40%. I think really important here, Larry, is the user base. And this is a different kind of device business. It's a -- we talked about it from a mass market opportunity versus other parts of our device portfolio that might be a little bit more, let's say, call it, niche versus the size of Libre. But the user base is super important because when you've got this kind of retention level, that we're seeing on the product. So between 80 and 90-plus percent globally. It really looks more like a subscription-like model. And when you're in that subscription-like model and you've got this recurring revenue, the user base is hugely important. And I think that's a lot of our focus right here, as we talked about this mass market is building the user base. 
And I think we've done a really good job internationally and in the U.S. But as we've talked about, okay, we've got 3.5 million users. I've talked about numbers all the way up to 80 million users potential for this product once you aggregate insulin users and type 2s, et cetera. So I think there's a real strong growth opportunity for us, and we're still in the early innings, as I've said. From a road map perspective, we're not deviating from kind of how we thought about this, right, which is we will continue to provide superior technology, superior experience to the user, whether it's with the product, whether it's how they get the product and still a value proposition that makes sense for a mass adoption. So that's all gone very well, and that will continue to go very well. Libre 3 we launched it in, I'd say, in Germany at the beginning of the year. Here, a lot of our focus in that launch, Larry was just more to understand kind of our marketing messaging, our positioning with our existing portfolio, reactions from physicians and even look at how other users from other CGMs kind of reacted to it. And basically surpassed my expectations as we went into that pilot launch. And so we'll be now transitioning to full launch mode of Libre 3, where we've got approval. Specifically in the U.S., obviously, it's understood that the backlog that exists in -- at the FDA regarding diabetes products. And I'm not going to comment on kind of timing here or expectations, but just that we're very excited kind of to be able to bring Libre 3 to the U.S. also and augment our portfolio with the product."

Given your strong balance sheet, we know valuations are relatively high. Are there areas where you think valuations look more attractive.

Do we think that we can execute and drive more value out of it? And that mindset hasn't changed independently of kind of dollar amount there. We're obviously actively looking. We constantly surveil and survey and pay attention and track. What I can say is that we've been probably actively moderating much more than where we were back in 2017. But there are some pretty elevated valuations right now, and I'm not going to do anything here that's kind of either dilute our profiles, our growth rates, et cetera. And key driver here is it being strategic. I actually think a lot of opportunity we have from a capital allocation back to kind of how you started the question was we've got a lot of opportunity internally. A lot of great returns that we can have with our capital as we deploy them to support these opportunities that we have in our pipeline, specifically regarding kind of manufacturing kind of ramp-up in capacity, whether it's Libre, whether it's MitraClip, seeing an opportunity here with adult nutrition as we've seen kind of several years here of strong kind of double-digit growth in Nutrition. So I think we've got a great opportunity to be able to provide a great return to our shareholders by looking at our internal opportunities also."

I would say we continue to see some of that kind of lowered kind of testing volumes in the U.S., whether it's PCR but probably a little bit more on the rapid side. We did a little bit better than what we had forecasted for the second quarter, and that was largely driven by international markets. Still about 80% of our sales are on the rapid side. But we did see higher international sales. And I'd say it's probably driven by Delta variant. A lot of those international sales are more, let's say, kind of tender driven. And we've got great visibility to where cases are rising and our positions in those markets. As a company, our relationships, our understanding of how health authorities in those countries are thinking about their testing. And what I can say is we become -- we definitely become a preferred supplier here because of our scale, our capacity, the quality of our products and our pricing. So the question here is going to be even with surges, are you going to see testing increase? I think we will. I think we will see some of that. The question will be geographically, where are we going to see it more? I think geographically, we'll see more internationally than at least what I think right now than what we'll see in the United States from a back half perspective."

That actually was up high single digits in Q2 versus Q2 of 2019. So we are seeing that recovery on the Core Lab. There are some assays that haven't recovered as much. What we've seen here in the U.S. is that we're seeing post-surgery policies here from certain hospitals do less overnight space. So when you're doing that, you're getting a little bit less of that. But I'd say that's offset with higher share gain and growth in in new accounts with the rollout of Alinity. So we're seeing that kind of high single digit. And as you mentioned, the issue is really kind of low low donation, blood donations that are impacting our transfusion business, at which we've got 60-plus-percent market share. So we're hoping to see -- we've been working with different agencies here to kind of bring awareness to this fact here because, obviously, there's inventory of blood, but if this rate of donations continues, then it will be a challenge for the U.S. So hopefully, we'll start to see that recover here as we get towards the end of the year."

Listen, we've talked about this a couple of times on a couple of calls already, and I just think it's a little bit too early to kind of provide that forecast given there's so many different kind of moving parts. We're starting our process right now. But I don't think the framework changes versus what we've talked about, which is our underlying business, so excluding COVA testing, it will clearly be very well positioned for very strong growth, top line and bottom line. Just based on the trends that we're seeing based on the pipeline, the new products that we have and the pipeline that that we have in place. So our underlying base business will clearly be set up for very strong top and bottom line growth. We've obviously got to look at COVID testing, and that's a factor here. We talked about it last call, it will be probably not very prudent here to assume a significant amount of COVID testing. Now if there's going to be demand of COVID testing, we've got plenty of capacity to meet it. And that's ultimately going to be kind of the factor here. As I said, we're going to start to kind of lap a little bit of this testing in Q3 and Q4 of this year. We've obviously had a real strong Q1 also. So that obviously has an impact and then having to look at our spend and modulate our spend here, but in a way that doesn't detract from our kind of long-term sustainable kind of growth even past 2022, 2023.

And then the second product on Structural heart is our tricuspid repair system. It's a great opportunity. It's got a potential kind of billion-dollar market opportunity for it. We've done very well with it, actually. Right now, our sales have kind of annualized right now on a $100 million basis, and we launched this in the middle of pandemic last year. So I think that's a great near-term opportunity. And then on CRM, we've made the investment here to get our leadless program back on track here regarding a single chamber and then making the investment on a dual chamber. And I think that's another kind of big opportunity that we'll have to continue our kind of growth recovery in our CRM. So we're targeting to enter this market. next year, again, with a single chamber and then build off there. So I think we've got great opportunity in the device space. And then in the diagnostics is the continuing of building the menu, the assays, the menu of assays. We're obviously making investments in our rapid business to capitalize on the  placements that we've made for ID NOW with COVID to be able to kind of not only drive flu, but other respiratory viruses that we think will be opportunity for us also.

I mean generally speaking, competition will always kind of drive further innovation, further investment. So 1 can kind of make the analysis here that when you're when you have a competitor coming into your segment, you'll do more to invest in the business and that investment will then drive the category. So I think on one side, I do believe in that, and I think you can see that's kind of had an impact. Definitely, when we came into the U.S. with Libre and kind of what happened to that market and what happens to the technology in terms of kind of making all the technologies better and et cetera. So the flip side of that is competition is -- you could potentially see, I guess, price as a lever to drive demand or to drive share capture. We've tried to focus every time we're entering markets with a value proposition that sustains our price and our pricing strategy and focus on the benefits that our solution will bring. And so I think you've got these 2 parts of kind of competition in markets. I'd say that's probably true for 2-player market or a 3-player market. So -- but listen, we're excited to come into the LAA market here in the U.S. We're obviously a player internationally. And we're making the investments. So for example, we've already begun our investment in market expansion in LAA with our CATALYST trial, which is comparing comparing our product to NOAC, which is the standard of care. And I know that competitors making kind of similar clinical excellence. I think that's good. I think that's positive. 
Okay. So that being said, I'd say here, if I just kind of sum up our results clearly demonstrated here that we're showing really strong growth across all of our businesses, devices, Diagnostics, our Established Pharmaceutical business and our Nutrition. And as I said in the beginning of the call, as we look to the second half of the year, we expect that growth to continue in our in our underlying business. I think to Joanne's question, maybe to Bob's question also optically, you're going to see a little bit of this, I'd say, artificial fog or lapping here or a comp versus for a few quarters as we kind of go through these sales that we've had from this big role that we played in COVID testing during the pandemic. But I don't I don't let that cloud kind of how we think about the business and how we think about the business long term. And I think our forecast here shows that we'll have a pretty differentiated underlying base business performance here. Our pipeline is highly productive, we've got a lot of ongoing launch activity and there's even more on the way here. So we're very excited about that, and we're investing across our key growth platforms. So we're feeling really good about our underlying base business and the momentum that we've got.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported results of a very strong quarter. Ongoing earnings per share were $1.17, reflecting more than 100% growth compared to the prior year. Sales increased 35% on an organic basis in the quarter compared to last year. 
Given the significant negative impact COVID had on demand for elective medical procedures and routine diagnostic testing last year, comparing sales versus pre-pandemic levels of 2019 provides one of the more relevant measures of performance. On this comparison, excluding sales from our COVID testing business, organic sales grew nearly 11.5% in the second quarter, driven by strong sales growth across all 4 of our major businesses, including double-digit growth in Established Pharmaceuticals, Nutrition and Medical Devices. 
I'll now summarize our second quarter results before turning over the call to Bob. And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased 9.5% compared to last year. Strong growth in the quarter was led by mid-teens growth in Adult Nutrition, including more than 20% growth internationally. 
Since the beginning of the pandemic, we've seen 2 factors positively impact Adult Nutrition demand: new users are entering the category and existing customers have increased their usage. And as the global market leader, these dynamics are driving strong growth for our Ensure and Glucerna brands. 
In Pediatric Nutrition, sales grew nearly 4.5% in the quarter, led by growth of nearly 9% in the U.S., where we continue to capture share with our leading portfolio of infant formula and toddler brands. Sales of Pedialyte, our global rehydration brand, grew strong double digits, driven by recently launched new products and increased investments we're making in direct-to-consumer promotion. 
Turning to Diagnostics. Sales increased more than 55%, which includes $1.3 billion of COVID testing-related sales. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, underlying Diagnostics sales increased 37% compared to last year. Strong sales growth in our underlying Diagnostic business is being driven by improving routine diagnostic testing as health care systems continue to recover from the pandemic as well as the continued rollout of our Alinity platforms. 
Excluding COVID testing-related sales, second quarter sales in Core Laboratory and Molecular Diagnostics grew mid-single digits compared to pre-pandemic levels in the second quarter of 2019. 
Moving to Established Pharmaceuticals, where sales grew nearly 15% in the quarter. Strong sales performance in the quarter was broad based across several countries, including double-digit growth in India, China, Russia and Brazil, which led to overall sales growth of nearly 18.5% in our key emerging markets. 
While we continue to see COVID cases surge in several emerging markets, including the recent surge in India, our team is executing at a high level to meet market demand for our medicines. And lastly, I'll cover Medical Devices, where sales grew 45% in the quarter compared to last year and more than 15.5% compared to the second quarter of 2019. 
Strong growth in the quarter was led by Structural Heart, Electrophysiology, Heart Failure and Diabetes Care, all of which grew double digits compared to the second quarter of 2019. In Structural Heart, we achieved the highest number of MitraClip procedures ever in the second quarter, including a record number of procedures in the month of June. 
Now I'll wrap up with Diabetes Care, where strong growth was led by FreeStyle Libre sales of more than $900 million. The global user base for Libre grew to approximately 3.5 million users, including approximately 1 million users in the U.S., driven by market expansion and awareness efforts as well as ongoing new product launch activity in every major market around the world. 
So in summary, we're achieving strong growth across all 4 of our major businesses, particularly pleased with the strong momentum and growth contributions we're seeing from several recently launched products and investments we're making in our key growth platforms. And our new product pipeline continues to be incredibly productive, delivering a steady cadence of new products with more to come over the next several months. 
I'll now turn over the call to Bob to discuss our results and outlook for the full year in more detail. Bob?"

As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance. 
Turning to our results. Sales for the second quarter increased 35% on an organic basis, which was led by strong performance across all of our businesses. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, organic sales growth was 29% versus last year and nearly 11.5% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Foreign exchange had a favorable year-over-year impact of 4.5% on second quarter sales, resulting in total reported sales growth of 39.5% in the quarter. 
Regarding other aspects of the P&L for the quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 56.9% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 6.2% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 25.8% of sales. 
Our second quarter adjusted tax rate was 14.4%, which reflects an adjustment to align our year-to-date tax rate with our revised full year effective tax rate forecast of 14.7%. The revised full year forecast is modestly lower than the estimate we provided in January due to a shift in the mix of our business and geographic income. 
Turning to our outlook for the full year 2021. Our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.30 to $4.50 remains unchanged and  reflects strong double-digit growth compared to last year and approximately 35% growth at the midpoint compared to our pre-pandemic adjusted earnings per share in 2019. 
We continue to forecast $4 billion to $4.5 billion in COVID testing-related sales for the full year 2021. And based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a favorable impact of around 2% on our full year 2021 sales. 
Turning to the outlook for the third quarter. We forecast adjusted earnings per share of at least $0.90, which reflects continued strong growth and momentum in our core underlying business and a sequential step-down in COVID testing-related sales compared to the second quarter. And based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a favorable impact of around 1% on our third quarter reported sales.

Listen, we obviously had a very strong quarter in terms of recovery. I mean we had planned to see that recovery in the U.S. and in Europe and in certain Asian markets, and that recovery has largely played out the way we had anticipated. I'd say probably a little bit better even than what we thought. I don't think what we're seeing here with relating to like increase in COVID cases, I don't think that you'll see the same -- or at least we're not seeing the same kind of impact in terms of hospitals shutting procedures down, stopping testing, et cetera. I think it's a very different situation where we are this year versus where we are last year, even though if you look at the case, global case counts, they're pretty much in line to where we were in October last year. We've got therapeutics. We've got vaccines. We've got testing. So we're not seeing that. 
On the device side, listen, our business has done very well. Overall, as I said in my comments, we're up double digits, mid-teens versus the second quarter largely driven by EP, Heart Failure, Structural Heart, Diabetes, as I said. And actually, if you look at the cardiovascular-specific recovery, we exited the first quarter at about a 2% growth versus March of 2019. And then if you look at the second quarter, our June growth rate was around about 7% versus June of 2019. So we're seeing this kind of sequential recovery in the procedures as evidenced by our growth rates in our procedures. And we were looking at data yesterday, the first couple of weeks of July are showing that same trajectory, whether it's in the U.S. or whether it's outside the U.S., generally. Obviously, there are some markets that have different kind of trends in paces. But I'd say, overall, we're seeing that recovery. And that's how we're looking at the rest of the year, Bob, is that continued trajectory in terms of recovery in procedures and diagnostic testing."

Why not boost the EPS a little bit? 
And then secondly, if you -- just curious if you think consensus estimates, as we look forward a little bit, are kind of reflecting the way you guys are viewing the world right now. And obviously, I'm specifically talking about next year. So any preliminary thoughts on whether consensus is sort of capturing the world as you see it?

Clearly, about 1/3 of that beat was due to the a little higher COVID sales than we have projected. Obviously, forecasting COVID is quite challenging. And so that was about 1/3 of beat. About 2/3 really was better performance in the base business versus how The Street had modeled that. And so the way we look at it, we gave a pretty wide range on earnings guidance back at the beginning of June. And that really kind of accounts for any kind of fluctuations or changes in the COVID testing in the back half of this year as well as kind of underlying base business performance. So we feel really comfortable about the range we have and feel that kind of captures different scenarios around COVID testing."

Obviously, from a top line perspective, we're going to have to lap some of our COVID sales that we had in Q3 and Q4. Obviously, if you looked at last year, that was really the height of our ramp-up in COVID sales. But the underlying business, excluding COVID sales, will be getting sequentially better every quarter. So we're looking at our base underlying business growing low double digits for the rest of the year. 
From a gross margin perspective, we'll see expansion in gross margin versus where we were in Q2. There's obviously maybe some friction on some input costs, commodities, freight, et cetera, the team works hard to kind of offset those. So we'll see improvement also as the base business recovers and the margin profiles from that recovery expand. And we'll continue to make the ramp-up of investments that we talked about from an R&D and SG&A perspective. Some of those investments have a faster and more, I'd say, kind of more immediate return. So for example, direct-to-consumer advertising in Nutrition or Libre, for example, and some of those investments are a little bit more medium term, whether it's R&D programs or whether it's kind of getting ready for upcoming launches. So the real, I'd say, kind of factor here becomes COVID testing. And we gave guidance about a month ago about $4 billion to $4.5 billion after the 2 quarters were about $3 billion, $3.5 billion. So we've got between $0.5 billion and $1 billion to go in the next 6 months. And I think that's really the question here is how will testing play itself out in the next kind of second half year, whether it's variance, whether it's vaccination rates, et cetera. So that's just something that we're paying attention. And as Bob said, that's why our guidance range was pretty wide, which is really to account for that."

The product is available in Europe and in those markets, albeit a smaller market than the U.S. We have a 50% market share. So we feel very good about our ability here to compete with the product we have. 
Regarding timing, it's one of those I can't give you an exact timing. It's definitely, we think, kind of in the second half. And then it's just going to depend in terms of impact this year versus next year. Obviously, the impact next year is larger. And that's just going to depend on when the approval hits this year. Obviously, if it's more towards the back end of the year, then we'll see less of an impact. If it's sooner, that will be an opportunity for us here to execute on that.
On CardioMEMS, I guess, similar. We think this is another great opportunity. I mean, both these products were products when we began the St. Jude integration, both of these products were trials that we really wanted to invest in and drive on the clinical evidence and driving the clinical evidence of these 2 products. So it's great to see we're in a position now to be able to kind of disclose and share the data from these trials that we put together. We filed our label expansion with the FDA on CardioMEMS this second quarter, more towards the end of the second quarter. And again, we think it's a great opportunity also. And probably in terms of an approval there, not really banking on that approval from a sales perspective this year."

So if you look at our device portfolio, one of the parts of the portfolio that we've seen a little bit of a lagging recovery here has been in Neuromodulation, where characterize that as a little bit even more elective than some of the other procedures. And we've seen, say, like a little bit of a slower recovery trend in that business versus, say, for example, a Structural Heart, an EP or a Diabetes business. Similar to Diagnostics, our immunoassay and clinical chemistry business, that's growing high single digits in the second quarter versus the second quarter of 2019, and that's an improvement versus where we were in Q1. One of the issues that we see in our Diagnostic businesses, we're seeing a slower recovery in kind of blood donations and that obviously impacts our transfusion business. So kind of similar to neuro on the diagnostic side, seen a little of a slower recovery. But I'd say those businesses that were more impacted by COVID in Q2 of last year, I'd say they've largely kind of recovered very well, very nicely, and we expect that trend to continue in the second half."

I mean I think a lot of these device segments that we see kind of large opportunities. I think the key thing here is to make sure that you clinical evidence to be able to kind of create a strong kind of market development approach here. And when we looked at CardioMEMS at the time back in 2017, there were some issues with reimbursement CMS, certain of the max kind of work reimbursing, et cetera. And you had positive champions data. I'm aware of some of the perceived shortcomings of that trial. But there is also plenty of real-world evidence showing similar benefits and similar results that you had observed in CHAMPION. So we looked at this and we believe that this was a significant opportunity in the cardiovascular space. We believe that monitoring pulmonary arterial pressure is a great indicator for prevention of acute heart failure. And decided to make the investment in a larger trial to either address the perceived shortcomings of CHAMPION or -- and/or augment the data set. So I'm hesitant to put a number around here, Vijay. But I think the viewpoint here is that this is an opportunity as we're building our Heart Failure portfolio together with our LVAD portfolio and even with MitraClip, quite frankly, to really have a comprehensive suite of solutions for it. And I think this is going to be an opportunity that we will be intentional about investing, whether it's trial, whether its clinical and field-based teams to drive it. We think the opportunity to expand the label to a Class II and Class IV presents a significant opportunity for us to expand the market and also the indication here to include CardioMEMS with elevated levels of BNP. So I think that this is a great opportunity. 
I guess your comment on mortality, I think that's important, but I also know, in talking to health systems, that hospitalization and reduction in hospitalization is still very important. Some can argue that maybe you're just kicking the can down the road. But I think that if you look at and have conversations with the health care systems, they'll see this as an important reduction, any redemption of hospitalization for this patient population will be significantly important for them. So bottom line, yes, I think this is a great opportunity for us and we're being intentional about our investment and making the right clinical evidence to support the adoption so that we can get to numbers that you're referencing or even bigger."

Listen, we had a real strong quarter, as you saw, and as you mentioned, approaching that $1 billion mark on a quarterly perspective, sales above 40%. I think really important here, Larry, is the user base. And this is a different kind of device business. It's a -- we talked about it from a mass market opportunity versus other parts of our device portfolio that might be a little bit more, let's say, call it, niche versus the size of Libre. But the user base is super important because when you've got this kind of retention level that we're seeing on the product, so between 80 and 90-plus percent globally, it really looks more like a subscription-like model. And when you're in that subscription-like model and you've got this recurring revenue, the user base is hugely important. And I think that's a lot of our focus right here, as we talked about this mass market, is building the user base. 
And I think we've done a really good job internationally and in the U.S. But as we've talked about, okay, we've got 3.5 million users. I've talked about numbers all the way up to 80 million users potential for this product once you aggregate insulin users and type 2s, et cetera. So I think this is a real strong growth opportunity for us, and we're still in the early innings, as I've said. From a road map perspective, we're not deviating from kind of how we thought about this, right, which is we will continue to provide superior technology, superior experience to the user, whether it's with the product, whether it's how they get the product and still a value proposition that makes sense for a mass adoption. So that's all gone very well, and that will continue to go very well. Libre 3, we launched it in, I'd say, in Germany at the beginning of the year. Here, a lot of our focus in that launch, Larry, was just more to understand kind of our marketing messaging, our positioning with our existing portfolio, reactions from physicians and even look at how other users from other CGMs kind of reacted to it. And it basically surpassed my expectations as we went into that pilot launch. And so we'll be now transitioning to full launch mode of Libre 3, where we've got approval. Specifically in the U.S., obviously, it's understood that the backlog that exists in -- at the FDA regarding diabetes products. And I'm not going to comment on kind of timing here or expectations, but just that we're very excited kind of to be able to bring Libre 3 to the U.S. also and augment our portfolio with the product."

I would say we continue to see some of that kind of lowered kind of testing volumes in the U.S., whether it's PCR but probably a little bit more on the rapid side. We did a little bit better than what we had forecasted for the second quarter, and that was largely driven by international markets. Still about 80% of our sales are on the rapid side. But we did see higher international sales. And I'd say, yes, it's probably driven by delta variant. A lot of those international sales are more, let's say, kind of tender driven. And we've got great visibility to where cases are rising and our positions in those markets. As a company, our relationships, our understanding of how health authorities in those countries are thinking about their testing.

And I think geographically, we'll see more internationally than, at least what I think right now, than what we'll see in the United States from a back half perspective."

Like at a high level, I would say, yes, we're seeing kind of that same kind of recovery trend, again, within its own kind of segment. Our immunoassay and clinical chemistry business, which represents about 80% of our core lab business, that actually was up high single digits in Q2 versus Q2 of 2019. So we are seeing that recovery on the core lab. There are some assays that haven't recovered as much. What we've seen here in the U.S. is that we're seeing post-surgery policies here from certain hospitals do less overnight stays. So when you're doing that, you're getting a little bit less of that. But I'd say that's offset with higher share gain and growth in new accounts with the rollout of Alinity. So we're seeing that kind of high single digit. And as you mentioned, the issue is really kind of low donation, blood donations that are impacting our transfusion business, at which we've got 65, 60-plus percent market share. So we're hoping to see -- we've been working with different agencies here to kind of bring awareness to this fact here because, obviously, there's inventory of blood. But if this rate of donations continues, then it will be a challenge for the U.S. So hopefully, we'll start to see that recover here as we get towards the end of the year."

Listen, we've talked about this a couple of times on a couple of calls already, and I just think it's a little bit too early to kind of provide that forecast given there's so many different kind of moving parts. We're starting our process right now. But I don't think the framework changes versus what we've talked about, which is our underlying business, so excluding COVID testing, it will clearly be very well positioned for very strong growth, top line and bottom line just based on the trends that we're seeing based on the pipeline, the new products that we have and the pipeline that we have in place. So our underlying base business will clearly be set up for very strong top and bottom line growth. We've obviously got to look at COVID testing, and that's a factor here. We talked about it last call. It'll be probably not very prudent here to assume a significant amount of COVID testing. Now if there's going to be demand of COVID testing, we've got plenty of capacity to meet it, and that's ultimately going to be kind of the factor here. As I said, we're going to start to kind of lap a little bit of this testing in Q3 and Q4 of this year. We've obviously had a real strong Q1 also. So that obviously has an impact. And then having to look at our spend and modulate our spend here, but in a way that doesn't detract from our kind of long-term sustainable kind of growth even past 2022, 2023. So we've got a lot of good momentum, a lot of ongoing and upcoming launch activity and I want to make sure that I capitalize on the positions and the opportunities that we've built upon."

We know our position and we know the choices and the strategy that we'll take as we enter this market here in the U.S., and I think it's great. It will be a great opportunity for us. 
And then the second product on Structural Heart is our tricuspid repair system. It's a great opportunity. It's got a potential kind of billion-dollar market opportunity for it. We've done very well with it, actually. Right now, our sales have kind of annualized right now on a $100 million basis, and we launched this in the middle of pandemic last year. So I think that's a great near-term opportunity. 
And then on CRM, we've made the investment here to get our leadless program back on track here regarding a single chamber and then making the investment on a dual chamber. And I think that's another kind of big opportunity that we'll have to continue our kind of growth recovery in our CRM. So we're targeting to enter this market. next year, again, with a single chamber and then build off there. So I think we've got great opportunity in the device space. And then in the diagnostics is the continuing of building the menu, the assays, the menu of assays. We're obviously making investments in our rapid business to capitalize on the  placements that we've made for ID NOW with COVID to be able to kind of not only drive flu, but other respiratory viruses that we think will be opportunity for us also. But I think those are probably more the near term, i.e., next kind of 12, 18 months and then a larger pipeline after that."

I mean generally speaking, competition will always kind of drive further innovation, further investment. So one can kind of make the analysis here that when you're -- when you have a competitor coming into your segment, you'll do more to invest in the business and that investment will then drive the category. So I think on one side, I do believe in that, and I think you can see how that's kind of had an impact. Definitely, when we came into the U.S. with Libre and kind of what happened to that market and what happened to the technology in terms of kind of making all the technologies better and et cetera. So the flip side of that is competition is -- you could potentially see, I guess, price as a lever to drive demand or to drive share capture. We've tried to focus every time we're entering markets with a value proposition that sustains our price and our pricing strategy and focus on the benefits that our solution will bring. And so I think you've got these 2 parts of kind of competition in markets. I'd say that's probably true for 2-player market or a 3-player market. So -- but listen, we're excited to come into the LAA market here in the U.S. We're obviously a player internationally and we're making the investments. So for example, we've already begun our investment in market expansion in LAA with our CATALYST trial, which is comparing  our product to NOAC, which is the standard of care. And I know that competitors making kind of similar clinical excellence. I think that's good. I think that's positive. 
Okay. So that being said, I'd say here, if I just kind of sum up, our results clearly demonstrated here that we're showing real strong growth across all of our businesses, devices, Diagnostics, our Established Pharmaceutical business and our Nutrition. And as I said in the beginning of the call, as we look to the second half of the year, we expect that growth to continue in our underlying business. I think to Joanne's question, maybe to Bob's question also optically, you're going to see a little bit of this, I'd say, artificial fog or lapping here or a comp versus for a few quarters as we kind of go through these sales that we've had from this big role that we played in COVID testing during the pandemic. But I don't let that cloud kind of how we think about the business and how we think about the business long term. And I think our forecast here shows that we'll have a pretty differentiated underlying base business performance here. Our pipeline is highly productive, we've got a lot of ongoing launch activity and there's even more on the way here. So we're very excited about that, and we're investing across our key growth platforms. So we're feeling really good about our underlying base business and the momentum that we've got.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported results of a very strong quarter. Ongoing earnings per share were $1.17, reflecting more than 100% growth compared to the prior year. Sales increased 35% on an organic basis in the quarter compared to last year. 
Given the significant negative impact COVID had on demand for elective medical procedures and routine diagnostic testing last year, comparing sales versus pre-pandemic levels of 2019 provides one of the more relevant measures of performance. On this comparison, excluding sales from our COVID testing business, organic sales grew nearly 11.5% in the second quarter, driven by strong sales growth across all 4 of our major businesses, including double-digit growth in Established Pharmaceuticals, Nutrition and Medical Devices. 
I'll now summarize our second quarter results before turning over the call to Bob. And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased 9.5% compared to last year. Strong growth in the quarter was led by mid-teens growth in Adult Nutrition, including more than 20% growth internationally.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, we've seen 2 factors positively impact Adult Nutrition demand: new users are entering the category and existing customers have increased their usage. And as the global market leader, these dynamics are driving strong growth for our Ensure and Glucerna brands. 
In Pediatric Nutrition, sales grew nearly 4.5% in the quarter, led by growth of nearly 9% in the U.S., where we continue to capture share with our leading portfolio of infant formula and toddler brands. Sales of Pedialyte, our global rehydration brand, grew strong double digits, driven by recently launched new products and increased investments we're making in direct-to-consumer promotion. 
Turning to Diagnostics. Sales increased more than 55%, which includes $1.3 billion of COVID testing-related sales. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, underlying Diagnostics sales increased 37% compared to last year. Strong sales growth in our underlying Diagnostic business is being driven by improving routine diagnostic testing as health care systems continue to recover from the pandemic as well as the continued rollout of our Alinity platforms. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, second quarter sales in Core Laboratory and Molecular Diagnostics grew mid-single digits compared to pre-pandemic levels in the second quarter of 2019. 
Moving to Established Pharmaceuticals, where sales grew nearly 15% in the quarter. Strong sales performance in the quarter was broad-based across several countries, including double-digit growth in India, China, Russia and Brazil, which led to overall sales growth of nearly 18.5% in our key emerging markets. While we continue to see COVID cases surge in several emerging markets, including the recent surge in India, our team is executing at a high level to meet market demand for our medicines.
And lastly, I'll cover Medical Devices, where sales grew 45% in the quarter compared to last year and more than 15.5% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Strong growth in the quarter was led by Structural Heart, Electrophysiology, Heart Failure and Diabetes Care, all of which grew double digits compared to the second quarter of 2019. In Structural Heart, we achieved the highest number of MitraClip procedures ever in the second quarter, including a record number of procedures in the month of June. 
Now I'll wrap up with Diabetes Care, where strong growth was led by FreeStyle Libre sales of more than $900 million. The global user base for Libre grew to approximately 3.5 million users, including approximately 1 million users in the U.S., driven by market expansion and awareness efforts as well as ongoing new product launch activity in every major market around the world. 
So in summary, we're achieving strong growth across all 4 of our major businesses, particularly pleased with the strong momentum and growth contributions we're seeing from several recently launched products and investments we're making in our key growth platforms. And our new product pipeline continues to be incredibly productive, delivering a steady cadence of new products with more to come over the next several months. 
I'll now turn over the call to Bob to discuss our results and outlook for the full year in more detail. Bob?"

As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance. 
Turning to our results. Sales for the second quarter increased 35% on an organic basis, which was led by strong performance across all of our businesses. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, organic sales growth was 29% versus last year and nearly 11.5% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Foreign exchange had a favorable year-over-year impact of 4.5% on second quarter sales, resulting in total reported sales growth of 39.5% in the quarter. 
Regarding other aspects of the P&L for the quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 56.9% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 6.2% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 25.8% of sales. 
Our second quarter adjusted tax rate was 14.4%, which reflects an adjustment to align our year-to-date tax rate with our revised full year effective tax rate forecast of 14.7%. The revised full year forecast is modestly lower than the estimate we provided in January due to a shift in the mix of our business and geographic income. 
Turning to our outlook for the full year 2021. Our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.30 to $4.50 remains unchanged and  reflects strong double-digit growth compared to last year and approximately 35% growth at the midpoint compared to our pre-pandemic adjusted earnings per share in 2019. 
We continue to forecast $4 billion to $4.5 billion in COVID testing-related sales for the full year 2021. And based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a favorable impact of around 2% on our full year 2021 sales. 
Turning to the outlook for the third quarter. We forecast adjusted earnings per share of at least $0.90, which reflects continued strong growth and momentum in our core underlying business and a sequential step-down in COVID testing-related sales compared to the second quarter. And based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a favorable impact of around 1% on our third quarter reported sales. 
With that, we'll now open the call for questions."

Listen, we obviously had a very strong quarter in terms of recovery. I mean we had planned to see that recovery in the U.S. and in Europe and in certain Asian markets, and that recovery has largely played out the way we had anticipated. I'd say probably a little bit better even than what we thought. I don't think what we're seeing here with relating to like increase in COVID cases, I don't think that you'll see the same -- or at least we're not seeing the same kind of impact in terms of hospitals shutting procedures down, stopping testing, et cetera. I think it's a very different situation where we are this year versus where we are last year, even though if you look at the case, global case counts, they're pretty much in line to where we were in October last year. We've got therapeutics. We've got vaccines. We've got testing. So we're not seeing that. 
On the device side, listen, our business has done very well. Overall, as I said in my comments, we're up double digits, mid-teens versus the second quarter largely driven by EP, Heart Failure, Structural Heart, Diabetes, as I said. And actually, if you look at the cardiovascular-specific recovery, we exited the first quarter at about a 2% growth versus March of 2019. And then if you look at the second quarter, our June growth rate was around about 7% versus June of 2019. So we're seeing this kind of sequential recovery in the procedures as evidenced by our growth rates in our procedures. And we were looking at data yesterday, the first couple of weeks of July are showing that same trajectory, whether it's in the U.S. or whether it's outside the U.S., generally. Obviously, there are some markets that have different kind of trends and paces. But I'd say, overall, we're seeing that recovery. And that's how we're looking at the rest of the year, Bob, is that continued trajectory in terms of recovery in procedures and diagnostic testing."

And then secondly, if you -- just curious if you think consensus estimates, as we look forward a little bit, are kind of reflecting the way you guys are viewing the world right now.

About 2/3 really was better performance in the base business versus how The Street had modeled that. And so the way we look at it, we gave a pretty wide range on earnings guidance back at the beginning of June. And that really kind of accounts for any kind of fluctuations or changes in the COVID testing in the back half of this year as well as kind of underlying base business performance. So we feel really comfortable about the range we have and feel that kind of captures different scenarios around COVID testing."

Obviously, from a top line perspective, we're going to have to lap some of our COVID sales that we had in Q3 and Q4.",342,"Bob, on the question of consensus for the rest of the year, I mean, I think this is how we're thinking about the second half of the year. Obviously, from a top line perspective, we're going to have to lap some of our COVID sales that we had in Q3 and Q4. Obviously, if you looked at last year, that was really the height of our ramp-up in COVID sales. But the underlying business, excluding COVID sales, will be getting sequentially better every quarter. So we're looking at our base underlying business growing low double digits for the rest of the year. 
From a gross margin perspective, we'll see expansion in gross margin versus where we were in Q2. There's obviously maybe some friction on some input costs, commodities, freight, et cetera, the team works hard to kind of offset those. So we'll see improvement also as the base business recovers and the margin profiles from that recovery expand. 
And we'll continue to make the ramp-up of investments that we talked about from an R&D and SG&A perspective. Some of those investments have a faster and more, I'd say, kind of more immediate return. So for example, direct-to-consumer advertising in Nutrition or Libre, for example, and some of those investments are a little bit more medium term, whether it's R&D programs or whether it's kind of getting ready for upcoming launches.
So the real, I'd say, kind of factor here becomes COVID testing. And we gave guidance about a month ago about $4 billion to $4.5 billion. After the 2 quarters, we're about $3 billion, $3.5 billion. So we've got between $0.5 billion and $1 billion to go in the next 6 months. And I think that's really the question here is how will testing play itself out in the next kind of second half year, whether it's variants, whether it's vaccination rates, et cetera. So that's just something that we're paying attention. And as Bob said, that's why our guidance range was pretty wide, which is really to account for that."

The product is available in Europe and in those markets, albeit a smaller market than the U.S. We have a 50% market share. So we feel very good about our ability here to compete with the product we have. 
Regarding timing, it's one of those I can't give you an exact timing. It's definitely, we think, kind of in the second half. And then it's just going to depend in terms of impact this year versus next year. Obviously, the impact next year is larger. And that's just going to depend on when the approval hits this year. Obviously, if it's more towards the back end of the year, then we'll see less of an impact. If it's sooner, that will be an opportunity for us here to execute on that.
On CardioMEMS, I guess, similar. We think this is another great opportunity. I mean, both these products were products when we began the St. Jude integration, both of these products were trials that we really wanted to invest in and drive on the clinical evidence and driving the clinical evidence of these 2 products. So it's great to see we're in a position now to be able to kind of disclose and share the data from these trials that we put together. We filed our label expansion with the FDA on CardioMEMS this second quarter, more towards the end of the second quarter. And again, we think it's a great opportunity also. And probably in terms of an approval there, not really banking on that approval from a sales perspective this year."

So the question I think people are asking is, if we had sequential improvements, is 11% versus 10%, that seems a little light. But I think that kind of ignores the business mix. Maybe perhaps can you talk about what's happening to device business? What was the sequential acceleration? And what is baked in for the back half? Should we continue to see some benefit from backlog and further acceleration?"

That growth rate has been increasing and has been sequentially improving, as I said, in the first question. Obviously, the recovery is not uniform across all businesses. So if you look at our device portfolio, one of the parts of the portfolio that we've seen a little bit of a lagging recovery here has been in Neuromodulation, where I'd characterize that as a little bit even more elective than some of the other procedures. And we've seen, say, like a little bit of a slower recovery trend in that business versus, say, for example, a Structural Heart, an EP or a Diabetes business.
Similar to Diagnostics, our immunoassay and clinical chemistry business, that's growing high single digits in the second quarter versus the second quarter of 2019, and that's an improvement versus where we were in Q1. One of the issues that we see in our Diagnostic businesses, we're seeing a slower recovery in kind of blood donations and that obviously impacts our transfusion business. So kind of similar to neuro on the diagnostic side, seen a little of a slower recovery. But I'd say those businesses that were more impacted by COVID in Q2 of last year, I'd say they've largely kind of recovered very well, very nicely, and we expect that trend to continue in the second half."

I mean I think a lot of these device segments that we see kind of large opportunities. I think the key thing here is to make sure that you put the clinical evidence to be able to kind of create a strong kind of market development approach here. And when we looked at CardioMEMS at the time back in 2017, where there were some issues with reimbursement in CMS, ascertaining the max kind of worth reimbursing, et cetera. And you had positive CHAMPION's data.
I'm aware of some of the perceived shortcomings of that trial, but there is also plenty of real-world evidence showing similar benefits and similar results that you had observed in CHAMPION. So we looked at this and we believe that this was a significant opportunity in the cardiovascular space. We believe that monitoring pulmonary arterial pressure is a great indicator for prevention of acute heart failure and decided to make the investment in a larger trial to either address the perceived shortcomings of CHAMPION or -- and/or augment the data set.
So I'm hesitant to put a number around here, Vijay. But I think the viewpoint here is that this is an opportunity as we're building our Heart Failure portfolio together with our LVAD portfolio and even with MitraClip, quite frankly, to really have a comprehensive suite of solutions for it. And I think this is going to be an opportunity that we will be intentional about investing, whether it's trial, whether it's clinical and field-based teams to drive it. We think the opportunity to expand the label to a Class II and Class IV presents a significant opportunity for us to expand the market and also the indication here to include CardioMEMS with elevated levels of BNP. So I think that this is a great opportunity. 
I guess your comment on mortality, I think that's important, but I also know, in talking to health systems, that hospitalization and reduction in hospitalization is still very important. Some can argue that maybe you're just kicking the can down the road. But I think that if you look at and have conversations with the health care systems, they'll see this as an important reduction. Any reduction of hospitalization for this patient population will be significantly important for them. So bottom line, yes, I think this is a great opportunity for us and we're being intentional about our investment and making the right clinical evidence to support the adoption so that we can get to numbers that you're referencing or even bigger."

Listen, we had a real strong quarter, as you saw, and as you mentioned, approaching that $1 billion mark on a quarterly perspective, sales above 40%. I think really important here, Larry, is the user base. And this is a different kind of device business. It's a -- we talked about it from a mass market opportunity versus other parts of our device portfolio that might be a little bit more, let's say, call it, nichey versus the size of Libre. But the user base is super important because when you've got this kind of retention level that we're seeing on the product, so between 80% and 90-plus percent globally, it really looks more like a subscription-like model. And when you're in that subscription-like model and you've got this recurring revenue, the user base is hugely important. And I think that's a lot of our focus right here, as we talked about this mass market, is building the user base. 
And I think we've done a really good job internationally and in the U.S. But as we've talked about, okay, we've got 3.5 million users. I've talked about numbers all the way up to 80 million users potential for this product once you aggregate insulin users and type 2s, et cetera. So I think this is a real strong growth opportunity for us, and we're still in the early innings, as I've said. From a road map perspective, we're not deviating from kind of how we thought about this, right, which is we will continue to provide superior technology, superior experience to the user, whether it's with the product, whether it's how they get the product and still a value proposition that makes sense for a mass adoption. So that's all gone very well, and that will continue to go very well. 
Libre 3, we launched it in, I'd say, in Germany at the beginning of the year here. A lot of our focus in that launch, Larry, was just more to understand kind of our marketing messaging, our positioning with our existing portfolio, reactions from physicians and even look at how other users from other CGMs kind of reacted to it. And it's basically surpassed my expectations as we went into that pilot launch. And so we'll be now transitioning to full launch mode of Libre 3, where we've got approval. Specifically in the U.S., obviously, it's understood that the backlog that exists in -- at the FDA regarding diabetes products. And I'm not going to comment on kind of timing here or expectations, but just that we're very excited kind of to be able to bring Libre 3 to the U.S. also and augment our portfolio with the product."

A lot of great returns that we can have with our capital as we deploy them to support these opportunities that we have in our pipeline, specifically regarding kind of manufacturing, kind of ramp-up in capacity, whether it's Libre, whether it's MitraClip, seeing an opportunity here with Adult Nutrition as we've seen kind of several years here of strong kind of double-digit growth in Nutrition.

We did a little bit better than what we had forecasted for the second quarter, and that was largely driven by international markets. Still about 80% of our sales are on the rapid side. But we did see higher international sales. And I'd say, yes, it's probably driven by delta variant. A lot of those international sales are more, let's say, kind of tender-driven. And we've got great visibility to where cases are rising and our positions in those markets.
As a company, our relationships, our understanding of how health authorities in those countries are thinking about their testing.

Our immunoassay and clinical chemistry business, which represents about 80% of our core lab business, that actually was up high single digits in Q2 versus Q2 of 2019. So we are seeing that recovery on the core lab. There are some assays that haven't recovered as much. What we've seen here in the U.S. is that we're seeing post-surgery policies here from certain hospitals do less overnight stays. So when you're doing that, you're getting a little bit less of that. But I'd say that's offset with higher share gain and growth in new accounts with the rollout of Alinity. So we're seeing that kind of high single digit.
And as you mentioned, the issue is really kind of low donation, blood donations that are impacting our transfusion business, which we've got 65%, 60-plus percent market share. So we're hoping to see -- we've been working with different agencies here to kind of bring awareness to this fact here because, obviously, there's inventory of blood.

We're starting our process right now. But I don't think the framework changes versus what we've talked about, which is our underlying business, so excluding COVID testing, it will clearly be very well positioned for very strong growth, top line and bottom line just based on the trends that we're seeing, based on the pipeline, the new products that we have in the pipeline that we have in place. So our underlying base business will clearly be set up for very strong top and bottom line growth.
We've obviously got to look at COVID testing, and that's a factor here. We talked about it last call. It'll be probably not very prudent here to assume a significant amount of COVID testing. Now if there's going to be demand of COVID testing, we've got plenty of capacity to meet it, and that's ultimately going to be kind of the factor here. As I said, we're going to start to kind of lap a little bit of this testing in Q3 and Q4 of this year. We've obviously had a real strong Q1 also. So that obviously has an impact.

So we've got a lot of good momentum, a lot of ongoing and upcoming launch activity and I want to make sure that I capitalize on the positions and the opportunities that we've built upon."

We know our position and we know the choices and the strategy that we'll take as we enter this market here in the U.S., and I think it's great. It will be a great opportunity for us. 
And then the second product on Structural Heart is our tricuspid repair system. It's a great opportunity. It's got a potential kind of billion-dollar market opportunity for it. We've done very well with it, actually. Right now, our sales have kind of annualized right now on a $100 million basis, and we launched this in the middle of pandemic last year. So I think that's a great near-term opportunity. 
And then on CRM, we've made the investment here to get our leadless program back on track here regarding a single chamber and then making the investment on a dual chamber. And I think that's another kind of big opportunity that we'll have to continue our kind of growth recovery in our CRM. So we're targeting to enter this market next year, again, with a single chamber and then build off there. So I think we've got great opportunity in the device space.
And then in the Diagnostics is the continuing of building the menu, the assays, the menu of assays. We're obviously making investments in our rapid business to capitalize on the  placements that we've made for ID NOW with COVID to be able to kind of not only drive flu, but other respiratory viruses that we think will be opportunity for us also. But I think those are probably more the near term, i.e., next kind of 12, 18 months and then a larger pipeline after that."

I mean generally speaking, competition will always kind of drive further innovation, further investment. So one can kind of make the analysis here that when you're -- when you have a competitor coming into your segment, you'll do more to invest in the business and that investment will then drive the category. So I think on one side, I do believe in that, and I think you can see how that's kind of had an impact. Definitely, when we came into the U.S. with Libre and kind of what happened to that market and what happened to the technology in terms of kind of making all the technologies better and et cetera. So the flip side of that is competition is -- you could potentially see, I guess, price as a lever to drive demand or to drive share capture. We've tried to focus every time we're entering markets with a value proposition that sustains our price and our pricing strategy and focus on the benefits that our solution will bring.
And so I think you've got these 2 parts of kind of competition in markets. I'd say that's probably true for a 2-player market or a 3-player market. So -- but listen, we're excited to come into the LAA market here in the U.S. We're obviously a player internationally and we're making the investments. So for example, we've already begun our investment in market expansion in LAA with our CATALYST trial, which is comparing  our product to NOAC, which is the standard of care. And I know that competitors are making kind of similar clinical investment. I think that's good. I think that's positive. 
Okay. So that being said, I'd say here, if I just kind of sum up, our results clearly demonstrated here that we're showing real strong growth across all of our businesses, devices, Diagnostics, our Established Pharmaceutical business and our Nutrition. And as I said in the beginning of the call, as we look to the second half of the year, we expect that growth to continue in our underlying business. I think to Joanne's question, maybe to Bob's question also, optically, you're going to see a little bit of this, I'd say, artificial fog or lapping here or a comp versus for a few quarters as we kind of go through these sales that we've had from this big role that we played in COVID testing during the pandemic.
But I don't let that cloud kind of how we think about the business and how we think about the business long term. And I think our forecast here shows that we'll have a pretty differentiated underlying base business performance here. Our pipeline is highly productive, we've got a lot of ongoing launch activity and there's even more on the way here. So we're very excited about that, and we're investing across our key growth platforms. So we're feeling really good about our underlying base business and the momentum that we've got.

247483,1682768170,2408029,"Abbott Laboratories, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2021",2021-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Abbott Laboratories","Executives","Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, we reported results of another very strong quarter. Ongoing earnings per share were $1.40, reflecting nearly 45% growth compared to last year, and sales increased more than 22% on",930,"Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. 
Today, we reported results of another very strong quarter. Ongoing earnings per share were $1.40, reflecting nearly 45% growth compared to last year, and sales increased more than 22% on an organic basis. Excluded COVID testing-related sales, which totaled $1.9 billion in the quarter, organic sales increased 12% versus last year. 
As we've seen since the start of the pandemic, our diversified mix of health care businesses continues to prove highly resilient. Even as COVID case rates surged in the U.S. and other geographies during the third quarter, strong growth in our more consumer-facing businesses, Nutritionals, Established Pharmaceuticals and Diabetes Care, mitigated the modest impacts we saw from the surges in certain areas of our hospital-based businesses. 
This has been a consistent theme throughout the pandemic, as evidenced by an increase in total company sales, excluding COVID test of 11% on an organic basis through the first 9 months of this year compared to our 2019 pre-pandemic baseline, which highlights that our growth is real and not simply a function of easy comps versus last year. As a result of our strong performance and outlook, today, we increased our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range now at $5 to $5.10, which reflects nearly 40% growth compared to last year. 
I'll now summarize our third quarter results before turning the call over to Bob, and I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased 9% compared to last year. Strong growth in the quarter was led by U.S. Pediatric and international Adult Nutrition. In Pediatric Nutrition, sales grew over 8.5% in the quarter, led by strong growth in the U.S. from continued share gains in our infant formula and toddler portfolio. Sales of Pedialyte, our market-leading rehydration brand, once again grew strong double digits, driven by market uptake of several recently launched new products as well as investments we're making in direct consumer promotion. 
In Adult Nutrition, sales grew over 9% in the quarter, including mid-teens growth internationally as we continue to see strong demand for our Ensure and Glucerna brands, including new users entering these categories and existing customers increasing their usage. 
Turning to Diagnostics. Sales increased more than 45% overall and 12.5%, excluding COVID testing-related sales. During the quarter, as the Delta variant spread and COVID cases surge particularly in the U.S., demand for testing increased significantly, most notably for rapid tests. In total, during the quarter, we sold more than 225 million COVID tests globally and have now shipped over 1 billion tests since the start of the pandemic. 
Over the last several months, we've learned that COVID vaccines, while a powerful tool, are not the lone solution needed in our global fight against this virus. Testing, particularly rapid testing, which is fast, affordable and easy to use is an important companion to vaccines and therapeutics. Abbott has established a global leadership position in rapid testing, including a supply capacity of more than 100 million tests per month. 
Moving to established pharmaceuticals, where sales grew more than 15%, driven by strong execution and a steady cadence of new product introductions. Strong sales performance in the quarter was broad based across several countries, including double-digit growth in China, Russia and India, which led to overall sales growth of 18% in our key emerging markets.
And lastly, I'll cover Medical Devices, where sales grew 13% in the quarter compared to last year and more than 16% compared to pre-pandemic sales in the third quarter of 2019. Strong performance in the quarter was led by double-digit growth in Rhythm Management, Structural Heart, Heart Failure and Diabetes Care. 
In Structural Heart, we continue to enhance our portfolio in large, fast-growing markets with the recent U.S. FDA approvals of Amulet, which closes the left atrial appendage in the heart to help reduce the risk of stroke and people with atrial fibrillation; and Portico for transcatheter aortic valve replacement. 
In Heart Failure, we announced results from the GUIDE-HF trial of our CardioMEMS system. As with many other recent and ongoing clinical trials across the health care industry, A portion of the CardioMEMS trial overlapped with the COVID-19 pandemic. After adjusting for this impact, CardioMEMS demonstrated a 28% reduction in heart failure hospitalizations. And we filed with the U.S. FDA for label expansion based on the trial data in the middle of this year. 
During the quarter, we also added an attractive growth platform to our vascular device portfolio with the acquisition of Walk Vascular, a commercial stage company with a minimally invasive thrombectomy system called GEDI that removes peripheral blood clots. Peripheral thrombectomy is a large, high-growth area where we can leverage our existing commercial presence. 
And I'll wrap up with Diabetes Care, where strong growth was led by FreeStyle Libre sales of nearly $1 billion. During the quarter, we added over 200,000 new users, bringing the total global user base for Libre to well over 3.5 million users. 
So in summary, we continue to achieve strong, well-balanced growth across all of our major businesses, which is being fueled by strong execution and a steady cadence of new products. COVID testing -- particularly COVID testing remains an important companion to vaccines and therapeutics and Abbott has established a strong leadership position in this area. And based on the strength of our performance and outlook, we're raising our EPS guidance for the year, which now reflects growth of nearly 40% compared to last year. 
I'll now turn over the call to Bob to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Bob?"

As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance. 
Turning to our results. Sales for the third quarter increased 22.4% on an organic basis which was led by strong performance across all of our businesses, along with global COVID testing-related sales of $1.9 billion in the quarter. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, organic sales growth was 12.1% versus last year and 11.7% compared to the third quarter of 2019. 
Foreign exchange had a favorable year-over-year impact of 1% on third quarter sales, resulting in total reported sales growth of 23.4% in the quarter. 
Regarding other aspects of the P&L for the quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.8% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 6% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 25% of sales. Our third quarter adjusted tax rate was 15.5%, which reflects an adjustment to align our year-to-date tax rate with our revised full year effective tax rate forecast of 15%. The revised full year forecast is modestly higher than the estimate we provided in July due to a shift in the mix of our business and geographic income. 
Turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter. We forecast $1 billion to $1.4 billion of COVID testing-related sales and forecast organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing-related sales, in the low double digits versus last year. And based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of around 0.5% on our fourth quarter reported sales. 
With that, we'll now open the call for questions."

I think regarding COVID testing, we obviously -- since the start here of the pandemic, we've been learning a lot. And I think one of the things that as we developed our strategy for that, we always believe that the rapid test was going to be a kind",896,"Sure. I think regarding COVID testing, we obviously -- since the start here of the pandemic, we've been learning a lot. And I think one of the things that as we developed our strategy for that, we always believe that the rapid test was going to be a kind of more sustainable part of the business. And I think we're pretty right there. I'd say the key thing that I -- and I made this in the comments, in the opening comments, the key thing that we learned over the last, let's say, a couple of months here is that the vaccine is just an incredible tool for the value. It's had a huge impact on public health around the world.
But alone, it's not enough. We know that dramatically reduces hospitalizations, dramatically reduces mortality. But I think we're all seeing here that even if you're vaccinated, you could still get and you could still transmit the virus. Obviously, you're not heading to a hospital, but I think we've all heard and seen stories of that. So I think that's the biggest kind of learning here for us as we go into Q4 and as we go into next year, is that testing is going to remain an important companion here. And even with therapeutics is still going to remain an important part of fighting the virus. 
And I think we've also learned a lot about understanding kind of the difference between symptomatic testing and screening testing. And we started to pay much closer attention to understanding the channels and the platforms that are more aligned to symptomatic testing versus screening testing. And we can definitely see a correlation on the symptomatic testing with cases going up, cases going down. 
What we don't see that correlation is on screening. So even as cases have started to come down a little in the U.S., actually screening demand has increased quite a bit. So -- So I think that is another kind of key learning as we think about going into Q4 and thinking about going into next year also. The other, I'd say, key distinction we've started to make is understanding kind of government purchasing a test versus kind of private. And I'd say in the beginning of the pandemic, most of our sales were focused to governments, whether international governments, federal government here in the U.S., state governments also. And that continues to be pretty strong. 
But what we've seen now grow pretty significantly. And I think it's aligned to the screening pieces, the private side of the market whether it's OTC, cash pay, whether it's a lot of companies. We've seen a lot of companies in the last couple of months here, signed contracts with us to ensure that they've got rapid testing to be able to give to their employees. So while we're not seeing -- we only see some shelf and stocking issues at the retail and those will work their way through that in the next couple of weeks, we are seeing still a lot of companies buy test to give to their employees. 
So I think all of this is basically saying, listen, I don't know how much is going to be there next year, but it's clearly here that, that screening segment of the market is going to be an important part, even with therapeutics and vaccines. So I think that's going to be an important part. Our base business is done very well, continues to be on a recovery trajectory here, Robbie. Started in Q2, we saw that in devices. We saw that in Diagnostics. Yes, there was some there was some softness during Q3 as Delta and cases increased here in the U.S. That's probably more in August and throughout half of September, we started to see it kind of re-picked back up again towards the end of the quarter, the first couple of weeks, we like what we're seeing here in terms of some pickup. 
But these were pockets. I wouldn't call it like a general softness and slowdown or pockets here in the U.S., some pockets in some countries. But generally speaking, that base business is doing very well. So when you think about 2022, I expect our base business -- our underlying base business to continue that momentum, very strong momentum across the board, especially with all of our new product launches. 
And the question here is going to be COVID. And I think it's going to be very difficult as we go into next year to be able to forecast a full number, a full year number of COVID next year. I think we're probably thinking about, okay, well, there's probably a COVID number that we're comfortable going into 2022. And then we'll have to update on a rolling quarterly basis here how COVID's going to play out throughout next year. 
So -- that's kind of how I see it. COVID testing will be there. We'll have to kind of do it more on a rolling basis as we go to next year. And our base business continues to accelerate. There was a little bit of softness in Q3, but I like what we're seeing in terms of recovery. And I like the portfolio that we built around our cardio business, our EPD business, our Nutrition business, our Diagnostic business. So that's all good."

We'll give our guidance in 2022 in January, like we always do, Robbie. And I want to see a little bit more in terms of how this pandemic is unfolding here, especially on the COVID side, but on the base business side. I think our base business, I would say, is we've been pretty good at forecasting our business both from a top line, from a margin on our base business. 
So I think what you can expect in 2022 is that base business getting even stronger with the rollout of all these product launches that we've announced over this year. And then the question here really is going to be kind of COVID testing. And like I said, we'll have a portion of it that, I think, we'll feel good about putting it in. And then we'll have to be updating on a rolling basis. 
And I think that's kind of how to think about it. The base business, which is probably the more sustainable piece, is building momentum and it will go into 2022 with a lot of growth opportunity. And then we'll have to kind of look at COVID on a more rolling basis."

So -- and I'll let Bob cover that. On Amulet, listen, we received approval",525,"Okay. Well, I'll take the Amulet and then I'll let Bob kind of talk to kind of the inflation supply chain. I mean I would just say it is manageable, but that we have a great team. So -- and I'll let Bob cover that. On Amulet, listen, we received approval in August. We already initiated the launch. I know there's a lot of anticipation, at least on the last 2 calls, about the data and when we're going to publish the data and why we're going to do it, the time that we were going to do it. 
And so we released that data really close to our approval. And I think that was a good strategy because it allowed our team to kind of prepare for that. I will say, regarding the data, I mean, you saw when we released the data, it's -- the product has got a lot of advantages versus the product that's on the market right now. We've got a pretty broad portfolio of sizes and that helps as you're looking at different anatomies and having a better fit there. The steerable sheath that we've got has resulted in great precision in the placement, and that's super important, especially when you're looking at transcatheter therapies. 
And then you saw the data of superior kind of closure rates without the need for blood thinners, right -- falling right at the procedure. And ultimately, that's why the patient went to the hospital or part of the reason why they went there. So I think we've got a great product here. I think the team has done a good job getting the contracts ready. 
Right now, I would say we have a goal of a certain amount of contracts by the end of this year. And in the first month, we've already gotten 40% of them of that target. So I think that we're going to definitely hit what we need to hit in terms of getting our contracts, accounts, the ones that we want to get on contract up and running so we could start to build the usage and familiarity with the system. 
We've got a really strong commercial presence here. And I think that's a key aspect in the rollout. The implants of these devices, the electrophysiologist or the interventional cardiologist, I mean we've got a lot of great products and a lot of great call point. So that's worked out very well, too. There's always a certain amount of coordination that's required there, and that coordination has been fantastic. I'm really pleased to see that. 
Initial feedback has been super positive. So very happy with the initial signs. Like you said, it's about a month, 1.5 months into it. All the signs that I'm seeing show that we'll have a great opportunity here to establish Amulet as another product in the category. And then on top of that, we're making the investments, like I said, to grow the category with all of our clinical trials. Catalyst is one of them that I think is important also. So I'd say 1.5 months, very, very pleased with what I'm seeing."

The global supply chains have not been able to keep up with the strong demand out there. And so like others, we're seeing some increased input costs across areas of our business. We're experiencing some higher shipping costs, and in some cases, higher commodity costs. I'd say the commodity costs are really more kind of in the Nutrition area of the business. 
In some areas, we have flexibility to adjust pricing a bit, and we plan to do that. In other areas, that flexibility doesn't exist and so we're working to mitigate the impacts we're seeing such as looking at other manufacturing costs. As Robert mentioned, we've got a very strong procurement organization and supply chain organizations, and they're doing a great job working with our suppliers. And our suppliers understand the critical nature of our products. And so it's been -- we've been successful in terms of ensuring that we're able to get what we need to support the business."

So we'll see margin expansion in that business. And that's a combination. Like Bob said, we've got gross margin improvement teams across all of our business that are working at ways to mitigate other manufacturing costs so that will be important to be able to drive margin expansion. 
And then just the nature of the mix as we continue to roll out our pipeline, which is predominantly focused, I'd say, on the med device side, we've got gross margin profiles there that are accretive to the company's gross margin. So I think a lot of it is really driven on the top line and driving our top line and the execution of these new product launches allows us to get that kind of margin expansion into 2022. 
And like I said, we -- the COVID piece is really just one where we're going to have to go quarter-by-quarter and update and roll our forecast every quarter. We'll have a number that we'll feel comfortable with. But those -- I'd say those are the kind of key drivers here, our product launches, our ongoing base business, margin expansions by mix and gross margin improvement. 
I want to keep the same profiles that we've got right now in our base business in terms of spend, R&D and SG&A. So those profiles, we wouldn't want to maintain. Obviously, if you look at our profile right now, it's a little bit distorted because of the COVID piece. But if you look historically where we've been in the low 7s in R&D and SG&A between 20% and 30%, that's where we're going to want to kind of land."

And so we've launched Libre 2, it's doing very well in the U.S. We've launched Libre 3 in Europe, and we'll obviously be rolling Libre 3 out. Regarding your question on analytes, yes, I mean that is an area that we are intentionally looking at, which is using the platform of Libre the manufacturing platform to be able to develop new analytes. 
You mentioned one that we've got particular experience in our blood glucose monitoring. We have a blood ketone system. So that, we believe, is an important aspect, especially for type 1 and pumpers. We think that, that's a real important kind of feature. If you look at going into the type 2 population, there's a lot of new drugs for type 2 where there are certain warnings regarding DKA, and we think that, that might also be an opportunity, too. 
But that's only one analyte, and we've got a pipeline here of analytes, a dedicated team that's only focused on looking at what are the business opportunities the market needs for that. And as we get closer to those launches, which will be coming up fairly soon, we'll be updating the market. But I'm really excited about using the Libre platform here to be able to kind of expand even beyond diabetes."

And what I read and what I see them is similar what I see here in the U.S. versus what we actually see in Europe, which is it's a great product. It's sized portfolio is an advantage. Its closure rate is also an advantage. 
And yes, we -- as I said, this is a multibillion-dollar market where we think that we can be a true competitor in also. But at the same time, invest to develop it. I think that's an important part here also, Larry. So as I mentioned, we're making investments in next-generation product. We're going to be making investments in the commercial infrastructure, which is not only to be there during the implant, but also to develop the patient referral network. 
And we're going to be investing in clinical trials. I think the CATALYST trial is going to be comparing it to NOACs. I think that will be a great opportunity to expand the market also. So I think it's a combination of kind of market expansion. And yes, we're competitive with our offering. We're competitive with our team.

This is a hugely important segment in Structural Heart. We want to be a structural heart leader. We had that vision when we put the businesses together with St. Jude. And we know that we need to be a true player here in the TAVI space. So I'm really looking at this for us as a long game. And what I mean by that is we're launching Portico [indiscernible] Navitor to your question, is a great second-generation device. We got it CE Marked and feedback is that it's a very, very competitive device, its clinical profile in high risk is really strong. 
And yes, I want to bring it to the U.S. also, but not because I feel we need to because Portico is not competitive. Portico is very competitive. But in this context of building a strategy here to be a real player in the TAVI space, we know that we're going to have to bring a second generation here in the U.S. We'll have to also look about how do we develop further on Navitor. 
So I think that we've got about a 5% share in Europe. That's not my aspiration for the TAVI space. To your point, there's 2 pretty well entrenched competitors in the market. And -- but we have a higher aspiration than just kind of a 5 share, which is what we have in Europe. So I think the combination here of investment in the team, investment in the pipeline and the clinical data, you're right, our low-risk -- intermediate low-risk trial kind of reads out a little bit later on. But it's there. We're investing in it because we see this as a big opportunity for us to be a real player in this market. 
So I'm excited about it, and I know the team is to be able to kind of be a real -- a go-to full-service player in the field of structural heart. Regarding CardioMems, listen, I think we -- the data, I think, was pretty compelling. I mean this is the second -- and you know this, Larry, this is the second RCT trial that we've done. And I'm a big believer in RCT trials and the need for them to be able to generate the clinical evidence -- We filed for the label expansion, the end of June. I think the data was very compelling. And part of it is expansion to Class II and Class IV and then also to be able to expand indication to patients with elevated BNP, which is today just for patients that have been previously hospitalized. 
So I think the combination here of the data, the fact that it is already the second RCT that we've done, a very large one also on top of CHAMPIONs -- the CHAMPIONs trial. I think there's a great opportunity here for us to develop this market. One of the things that we did in the quarter here also is we now have a more dedicated business unit for Heart Failure, where both the LVAD and CardioMEMS team are going to be combined under 1 GM, very similar to what we've done with our other businesses because we believe in the benefit of that focus and that attention to the business. 
So I think the combination of what we've submitted, our focus, this is a great opportunity for us in 2022 and beyond. I'm not going to comment on when -- all I can tell you is we filed it at the end of Q2. And I think the data is very strong, and we'll just leave it like that. And I'm highly hopeful that we'll be seeing that next year for sure."

Well, I would say this is probably out of our device businesses. The business that's had a little bit of a harder time in terms of recovering post COVID, it's probably more elective like you said, Cecilia. So it has been lagging a bit. It's been pretty flat, I would say, in terms of kind of its trajectory if we look at our trials and our implants. So -- but that's really something that we can't control in terms of kind of how that is going to bounce back. 
We have visibility to the pipeline of patients. We work closely with the surgery centers, and we've got visibility to that. We're not expecting a big bolus to come into and then we'll have to kind of see how Q1 and Q2 of next year looks like to be able to kind of give a better sense there. But what we can control, and that's what I focus -- we focus the team on is on our pipeline. 
And I think the team here has done a really good job. I'd highlight a couple of things here that we've done. NeuroSphere which is this novel remote care platform. We've launched it. It's the first kind of system that was approved by the FDA. We did a full market release at the end of June. And I really like the numbers we're seeing. We've done over 5,000 remote programming sessions. And not only is it a remote program, but it also allows us to get visibility of the patients in the funnel. So using the adoption of that tool is great because I think it will have a real big change on the sales and service kind of business model that exists in this business. 
So that's going very well, and I think that will help get better visibility. Another key thing here is entrance into the rechargeable, the rechargeable segment, which is about half of the market. We really don't have a competitive system in there, and the team has developed a rechargeable system that is best-in-class, significant advantages versus the market leaders in this segment. So we're looking forward to bringing that product to market next year. 
And then we've also made investments in trials. I think probably the most notable one is DISTINCT, which is an indication for nonsurgical lower back. We've completed enrollment in that study. So I think the combination of these factors here are important for us to be able to kind of take share. And then if we see the bolus of patients come back in Q1 and Q2, that will be an additional tailwind for us."

We know the customers. We have the call point. And we've got the capacity here to be able to leverage our manufacturing expertise here to be able to kind of scale up manufacturing. 
So this made perfect sense for us to be able to add it to the portfolio. And that integration is going pretty well. I don't expect any significant contributions in Q4.

So regarding the Q4 forecast of $1 billion to $1.4 billion here, our capacity is we can do significantly more than that, Vijay, especially as we've -- Q3, we didn't have the full ramp-up, but now we're finishing this month, we'll be in full ramp-up",323,"Okay.

So we can do more than the 1 4. I think the factor here that we're looking at is, as I said in the opening comments here in the first question, I continue to see the surveillance in the screening market to continue to increase, and that's with kind of Binax and ID now also. 
So we've got those businesses, everything we can make, we're rolling in here. I'd say the only question we've got here a little bit is on the symptomatic. And that's what you see maybe in this step-down here is assuming as cases decline in the U.S. that we're going to see a little bit of a decline in symptomatic testing. So that's a little -- that's one part of the factor. 
The other factor in the $1 billion to $1.4 billion is just pricing. We've got a market leadership position in rapid testing, especially in OTC. If you look at Nielsen data, you'll be able to see that we were at about 90% share. Before the month of September, we dropped to about 60 just because of supply and now we're back up to 75% share, and we're seeing a little bit of price pressure. So in that number, I've baked in some price pressure to ensure that we maintain that market leadership position as we see more market entrants come in. But if we don't need that price, then that will obviously drive another beat to that number, too. But -- so that's -- those are the drivers and the thinking there, Vijay, a little bit of pricing pressure and what are we going to see on the symptomatic testing."

So -- but it's a pretty big range, Vijay, in terms of what the maximum is and what the minimum is."

So maybe just a follow-up on some of the things you were just talking about sort of this concept of reinvesting the proceeds of this very strong COVID business. So there's a perception out there, I think, because COVID testing is maybe not permanent and hard to predict that it's somehow less important or harder to value than the rest of your businesses. But the last few months, obviously, in this quarter, $1.5 billion of upside in Q3 is, by our estimates, more than $0.5 billion in operating cash, and that goes up against your $2 billion or $2.5 billion operating cash run rate. 
So the question is, in addition to kind of being part of the solution as you've talked about to the pandemic, maybe drill down a little bit into some of the things you were just describing, opportunities to invest behind, which ones of your growth programs do you see an opportunity to sort of dial things up? And how, if at all, does this change maybe the way you think about M&A and your activity on that front?"
247483,1682768170,2408029,"Abbott Laboratories, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2021",2021-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Abbott Laboratories","Executives","Sure. I think you've captured pretty well all the elements there of how we look at COVID. As I said in the beginning, when we started this, there's definitely an opportunity to accelerate the strategy of decentralized testing because of COVID, and that st",970,"Sure. I think you've captured pretty well all the elements there of how we look at COVID. As I said in the beginning, when we started this, there's definitely an opportunity to accelerate the strategy of decentralized testing because of COVID, and that strategy has been in place, and that's an area that we are investing to ensure that we do have an ability to -- so we see more testing in pharmacy, more testing in urgent care centers and testing that goes beyond COVID that even goes beyond flu and RSV and viruses by developing assays that will be used on that rapid testing platform. 
So that's one investment for sure. You can see the impact on the investment on some of the business. You see it in Nutrition. So we have been putting more advertising and direct-to-consumer promotion in that business, and you could see the step-up in the growth rate there. We've obviously put investment into Libre, both on the SG&A side. You see -- we've rolled out a new TV commercial and funded that to a level that we feel is competitive, is leading in terms of messaging. Increased our sales force in the U.S. and other key markets for Libre so that we can call on more positions and you see the impact there on Libre. I mean, we did almost $1 billion of sales of Libre this quarter. And in the U.S., it's about 65%. 
We're making great progress in penetrating the type 2 population, whether it's non-insulin users or non-intensive insulin users. We've got about a 90% market share of that segment at least. So that growth is also being supported. And we've got all these new product launches that I've been talking about on the cardiovascular side that require feet on the street, whether it's sales force, clinical specialists, and we're funding that also. So I think that, that's very clearly where we're putting our investments. We've talked about R&D investments and making sure that we've got pipeline beyond '22 and '23, and that's been in the Diagnostics and Device areas also. 
So it's been pretty broad based. That $1 billion increase has kind of gone well across all the businesses. And if I ask my general managers and my presidents of my businesses, do they have a next tranche of where they would go, they would have that list ready to go, too. So there's no shortage of opportunity. 
And then the other topic you talked about or touched on was the cash flow generation -- And as a result of the COVID business, and yes, it has generated a lot of cash. We have invested some of that cash in the organic opportunities we have, whether it's manufacturing sites here in the U.S. for COVID, for MitraClip, for Libre. So we've made those internal investments, but we've also looked at where we could provide the best return to our shareholders. And you saw that in the form of our dividend increase at the beginning of this year, we increased our dividend by 25%. You saw that we also -- probably saw that we bought back shares in Q2. And we've stepped that up even further in Q3, and we've got capacity to do more of that in Q4, if that makes sense for our shareholders. 
So we find a way to kind of deploy that capital. And on the M&A side, I mean, I've talked about this. If we think there's a strategic fit for us, one that is financially justified for us that we can do better with it, that we can make it better and that there's value for our shareholders, we'll do that also. Right now, I'd say, I think the med tech and diagnostic valuations out there, especially for the ones that we would be interested in, in high-quality, high-growth assets is a little bit frothy. So we're in the mode of study and paying attention. 
I think the good news here is that we don't really need M&A to be able to support what I think is pretty top-tier performance here. So that's pretty comprehensive in terms of how we're looking at COVID and it both funds our internal organic growth and allows us to either provide some more value to shareholders through buybacks, dividends. And if there's a growth vehicle out that, I think will make sense, won't be shy for that also. 
So I'll just close here a little bit and just say our results, we're achieving very strong growth across all of our businesses. I'm very excited and proud about the pipeline that all the businesses have been focused on. We've historically really focused on our organic pipelines and that continues to be highly productive. We are entering to very new and attractive growth segments across our portfolio, and there's more products along the way there. 
So we're investing in our key platforms, as I've said, COVID testing is going to be an important companion to vaccines and therapeutics. At what level, I can't say right now for next year. I've given a range on what I think it's going to look like in Q4, and there could be opportunities there for us to do better than that. But I think the rapid test here is really the value proposition that's going to make sense going into next year, and we're a leader in that segment. We've built scale. We've built manufacturing and we know how to operate in this environment whether it's retail pharmacies or direct consumers. So our focus right now is we're going to finish strong 2021, enter into 2022 with a lot of momentum. And I think we're well-placed strategically here as we go into next year. So with that, I'll thank you all for joining us today."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us.  
Today, we reported results of another very strong quarter. Ongoing earnings per share were $1.40, reflecting nearly 45% growth compared to last year, and sales increased more than 22% on an organic basis. Excluded COVID testing-related sales, which totaled $1.9 billion in the quarter, organic sales increased 12% versus last year.  
As we've seen since the start of the pandemic, our diversified mix of health care businesses continues to prove highly resilient. Even as COVID case rates surged in the U.S. and other geographies during the third quarter, strong growth in our more consumer-facing businesses, Nutritionals, Established Pharmaceuticals and Diabetes Care, mitigated the modest impacts we saw from the surges in certain areas of our hospital-based businesses.  
This has been a consistent theme throughout the pandemic, as evidenced by an increase in total company sales, excluding COVID test of 11% on an organic basis through the first 9 months of this year compared to our 2019 pre-pandemic baseline, which highlights that our growth is real and not simply a function of easy comps versus last year. As a result of our strong performance and outlook, today, we increased our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range now at $5 to $5.10, which reflects nearly 40% growth compared to last year.  
I'll now summarize our third quarter results before turning the call over to Bob. And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased 9% compared to last year. Strong growth in the quarter was led by U.S. Pediatric and international Adult Nutrition. In Pediatric Nutrition, sales grew over 8.5% in the quarter, led by strong growth in the U.S. from continued share gains in our infant formula and toddler portfolio. Sales of Pedialyte, our market-leading rehydration brand, once again grew strong double digits, driven by market uptake of several recently launched new products as well as investments we're making in direct consumer promotion.  
In Adult Nutrition, sales grew over 9% in the quarter, including mid-teens growth internationally as we continue to see strong demand for our Ensure and Glucerna brands, including new users entering these categories and existing customers increasing their usage.  
Turning to Diagnostics. Sales increased more than 45% overall and 12.5%, excluding COVID testing-related sales. During the quarter, as the Delta variant spread and COVID cases surge particularly in the U.S., demand for testing increased significantly, most notably for rapid tests. In total, during the quarter, we sold more than 225 million COVID tests globally and have now shipped over 1 billion tests since the start of the pandemic.  
Over the last several months, we've learned that COVID vaccines, while a powerful tool, are not the lone solution needed in our global fight against this virus. Testing, particularly rapid testing, which is fast, affordable and easy to use is an important companion to vaccines and therapeutics. Abbott has established a global leadership position in rapid testing, including a supply capacity of more than 100 million tests per month.  
Moving to established pharmaceuticals, where sales grew more than 15%, driven by strong execution and a steady cadence of new product introductions. Strong sales performance in the quarter was broad based across several countries, including double-digit growth in China, Russia and India, which led to overall sales growth of 18% in our key emerging markets.  
And lastly, I'll cover Medical Devices, where sales grew 13% in the quarter compared to last year and more than 16% compared to pre-pandemic sales in the third quarter of 2019. Strong performance in the quarter was led by double-digit growth in Rhythm Management, Structural Heart, Heart Failure and Diabetes Care.  
In Structural Heart, we continue to enhance our portfolio in large, fast-growing markets with the recent U.S. FDA approvals of Amulet, which closes the left atrial appendage in the heart to help reduce the risk of stroke and people with atrial fibrillation; and Portico for transcatheter aortic valve replacement.  
In Heart Failure, we announced results from the GUIDE-HF trial of our CardioMEMS system. As with many other recent and ongoing clinical trials across the health care industry, a portion of the CardioMEMS trial overlapped with the COVID-19 pandemic. After adjusting for this impact, CardioMEMS demonstrated a 28% reduction in heart failure hospitalizations. And we filed with the U.S. FDA for label expansion based on the trial data in the middle of this year.  
During the quarter, we also added an attractive growth platform to our vascular device portfolio with the acquisition of Walk Vascular, a commercial stage company with a minimally invasive thrombectomy system called JETi that removes peripheral blood clots. Peripheral thrombectomy is a large, high-growth area where we can leverage our existing commercial presence.  
And I'll wrap up with Diabetes Care, where strong growth was led by FreeStyle Libre sales of nearly $1 billion. During the quarter, we added over 200,000 new users, bringing the total global user base for Libre to well over 3.5 million users.  
So in summary, we continue to achieve strong, well-balanced growth across all of our major businesses, which is being fueled by strong execution and a steady cadence of new products. COVID testing -- particularly COVID testing remains an important companion to vaccines and therapeutics, and Abbott has established a strong leadership position in this area. And based on the strength of our performance and outlook, we're raising our EPS guidance for the year, which now reflects growth of nearly 40% compared to last year.  
I'll now turn over the call to Bob to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Bob?"

As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.  
Turning to our results. Sales for the third quarter increased 22.4% on an organic basis, which was led by strong performance across all of our businesses, along with global COVID testing-related sales of $1.9 billion in the quarter. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, organic sales growth was 12.1% versus last year and 11.7% compared to the third quarter of 2019.  
Foreign exchange had a favorable year-over-year impact of 1% on third quarter sales, resulting in total reported sales growth of 23.4% in the quarter.  
Regarding other aspects of the P&L for the quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.8% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 6% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 25% of sales. Our third quarter adjusted tax rate was 15.5%, which reflects an adjustment to align our year-to-date tax rate with our revised full year effective tax rate forecast of 15%. The revised full year forecast is modestly higher than the estimate we provided in July due to a shift in the mix of our business and geographic income.  
Turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter. We forecast $1 billion to $1.4 billion of COVID testing-related sales and forecast organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing-related sales, in the low double digits versus last year. And based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of around 0.5% of 1% on our fourth quarter reported sales.  
With that, we'll now open the call for questions."

I think regarding COVID testing, we obviously -- since the start here of the pandemic, we've been learning a lot. And I think one of the things that as we developed our strategy for that, we always believe that the rapid test was going to be a kind",899,"Sure. I think regarding COVID testing, we obviously -- since the start here of the pandemic, we've been learning a lot. And I think one of the things that as we developed our strategy for that, we always believe that the rapid test was going to be a kind of more sustainable part of the business. And I think we were pretty right there. I'd say the key thing that I -- and I made this in the comments, in the opening comments, the key thing that we learned over the last, let's say, couple of months here is that the vaccine is just an incredible tool for the value. It's had a huge impact on public health around the world. 
But alone, it's not enough. We know that dramatically reduces hospitalizations, dramatically reduces mortality. But I think we're all seeing here that even if you're vaccinated, you could still get and you could still transmit the virus. Obviously, you're not heading to a hospital, but I think we've all heard and seen stories of that. So I think that's the biggest kind of learning here for us as we go into Q4 and as we go into next year is that testing is going to remain an important companion here. And even with therapeutics, it's still going to remain an important part of fighting the virus.  
And I think we've also learned a lot about understanding kind of the difference between symptomatic testing and screening testing. And we started to pay much closer attention to understanding the channels and the platforms that are more aligned to symptomatic testing versus screening testing. And we can definitely see a correlation on the symptomatic testing with cases going up, cases going down.  
What we don't see that correlation is, is on screening. So even as cases have started to come down a little bit in the U.S., actually screening demand has increased quite a bit. So I think that is another kind of key learning as we think about going into Q4 and thinking about going into next year also. The other, I'd say, key distinction we've started to make is understanding kind of government purchasing a test versus kind of private. And I'd say in the beginning of the pandemic, most of our sales were focused to governments, whether international governments, federal government here in the U.S., state governments also. And that continues to be pretty strong.  
But what we've seen now grew pretty significantly. And I think it's aligned to the screening pieces, the private side of the market, whether it's OTC, cash pay, whether it's a lot of companies. We've seen a lot of companies in the last couple of months here, signed contracts with us to ensure that they've got rapid testing to be able to give to their employees. So while we're not seeing -- we only see some shelf and stocking issues at the retail and those will work their way through that in the next couple of weeks, we are seeing still a lot of companies buy test to give to their employees.  
So I think all of this is basically saying, listen, I don't know how much is going to be there next year, but it's clearly here that, that screening segment of the market is going to be an important part, even with therapeutics and vaccines. So I think that's going to be an important part. Our base business has done very well, continues to be on a recovery trajectory here, Robbie. Started in Q2, we saw that in devices. We saw that in Diagnostics. Yes, there was some there was some softness during Q3 as Delta and cases increased here in the U.S. That's probably more in August and throughout half of September, we started to see it kind of re-picked back up again towards the end of the quarter, first couple of weeks. We like what we're seeing here in terms of some pickup.  
But these were pockets. I wouldn't call it like a general softness and slowdown or pockets here in the U.S., some pockets in some countries. But generally speaking, that base business is doing very well. So when you think about 2022, I expect our base business -- our underlying base business to continue that momentum, very strong momentum across the board, especially with all of our new product launches.  
And the question here is going to be COVID. And I think it's going to be very difficult, as we go into next year, to be able to forecast a full number, a full year number of COVID next year. I think we're probably thinking about, okay, well, there's probably a COVID number that we're comfortable going into 2022. And then we'll have to update on a rolling quarterly basis here how COVID's going to play out throughout next year.  
So that's kind of how I see it. COVID is going to -- COVID testing will be there. We'll have to kind of do it more on a rolling basis as we go to next year. And our base business continues to accelerate. There was a little bit of softness in Q3, but I like what we're seeing in terms of recovery. And I like the portfolio that we built around our cardio business, our EPD business, our Nutrition business, our Diagnostic business. So that's all good."

So I think what you can expect in 2022 is that base business getting even stronger with the rollout of all these product launches that we've announced over this year. And then the question here really is going to be kind of COVID testing. And like I said, we'll have a portion of it that, I think, we'll feel good about putting it in.

And in the interest of time, I'll just mention them both upfront because the first one is pretty straightforward. The first question is just on Amulet, and I realize it's very early in the launch. But just would love your sort of top-down comments on how things are going. And maybe any metrics you can share in terms of perhaps like the percentage of your U.S. coronary accounts that are now active with Amulet. So we'd love some just color there. 
And then the second question is more of a broad-based question. I was just wondering if you could provide just a little bit more detail on what you're seeing on inflation and supply chain because the headlines are obviously -- they're just constant. But the message from Abbott and other companies we follow just seems to be that it's sort of generally manageable. So just wondering if you can kind of talk to that a little bit, if you can quantify the headwinds or just give us a better understanding of why it's manageable and just put some perspective around it for us."

Well, I'll take the Amulet and then I'll let Bob kind of talk to kind of the inflation supply chain. I mean I would just say it is manageable, but -- that we have a great team.

I mean I would just say it is manageable, but -- that we have a great team. So -- and I'll let Bob cover that. 
On Amulet, listen, we received approval in August. We already initiated the launch. I know there's a lot of anticipation, at least on the last 2 calls, about the data and when we're going to publish the data and why we're going to do it, the time that we were going to do it. And so we released that data really close to our approval. And I think that was a good strategy because it allowed our team to kind of prepare for that. 
I will say, regarding the data, I mean, you saw when we released the data, it's -- the product has got a lot of advantages versus the product that's on the market right now. We've got a pretty broad portfolio of sizes, and that helps as you're looking at different anatomies and having a better fit there. The steerable sheath that we've got has resulted in great precision in the placement, and that's super important, especially when you're looking at transcatheter therapies. 
And then you saw the data of superior kind of closure rates without the need for blood thinners, right -- falling right at the procedure. And ultimately, that's why the patient went to the hospital or part of the reason why they went there. So I think we've got a great product here. I think the team has done a good job getting the contracts ready. 
Right now I would say we have a goal of certain amount of contracts by the end of this year. And in the first month, we've already gotten 40% of them of that target. So I think that we're going to definitely hit what we need to hit in terms of getting our contracts, our accounts, the ones that we want to get on contract up and running so we could start to build the usage and familiarity with the system. 
We've got a really strong commercial presence here. And I think that's a key aspect in the rollout. The implants of these devices, the electrophysiologist or the interventional cardiologist, I mean we've got a lot of great products and a lot of great call point. So that's worked out very well, too. There's always a certain amount of coordination that's required there, and that coordination has been fantastic. I'm really pleased to see that. 
Initial feedback has been super positive. So very happy with the initial signs. Like you said, it's about a month, 1.5 months into it. All the signs that I'm seeing show that we'll have a great opportunity here to establish Amulet as another product in the category. And then on top of that, we're making the investments, like I said, to grow the category with all of our clinical trials. Catalyst is one of them that I think is important also. So I'd say 1.5 months, very, very pleased with what I'm seeing."

The global supply chains have not been able to keep up with the strong demand out there. And so like others, we're seeing some increased input costs across areas of our business. We're experiencing some higher shipping costs, and in some cases, higher commodity costs. I'd say the commodity costs are really more kind of in the Nutrition area of the business. 
In some areas, we have flexibility to adjust pricing a bit, and we plan to do that. In other areas, that flexibility doesn't exist, and so we're working to mitigate the impacts we're seeing such as looking at other manufacturing costs. As Robert mentioned, we've got a very strong procurement organization and supply chain organizations, and they're doing a great job working with our suppliers. And our suppliers understand the critical nature of our products. And so it's been -- we've been successful in terms of ensuring that we're able to get what we need to support the business."

So we'll see margin expansion in that business. And that's a combination. Like Bob said, we've got gross margin improvement teams across all of our business that are working at ways to mitigate other manufacturing costs. So that will be important to be able to drive margin expansion. 
And then just the nature of the mix as we continue to roll out our pipeline, which is predominantly focused, I'd say, on the med device side, we've got gross margin profiles there that are accretive to the company's gross margin. So I think a lot of it is really driven on the top line and driving our top line. And the execution of these new product launches allows us to get that kind of margin expansion into 2022. 
And like I said, we -- the COVID piece is really just one where we're going to have to go quarter-by-quarter and update and roll our forecast every quarter. We'll have a number that we'll feel comfortable with. But those -- I'd say those are the kind of key drivers here, our product launches, our ongoing base business, margin expansions by mix and gross margin improvement. 
I want to keep the same profiles that we've got right now in our base business in terms of spend, R&D and SG&A. So those profiles, we wouldn't want to maintain. Obviously, if you look at our profiles right now, it's a little bit distorted because of the COVID piece. But if you look historically where we've been in the low 7s in R&D and SG&A between 20% and 30%, that's where we're going to want to kind of land."

Regarding your question on analytes, yes, I mean that is an area that we are intentionally looking at, which is using the platform of Libre, the manufacturing platform to be able to develop new analytes. 
You mentioned one that we've got particular experience in our blood glucose monitoring. We have a blood ketone system. So that, we believe, is an important aspect, especially for type 1 and pumpers. We think that, that's a real important kind of feature. If you look at going into the type 2 population, there's a lot of new drugs for type 2 where there are certain warnings regarding DKA. And we think that, that might also be an opportunity, too. 
But that's only one analyte, and we've got a pipeline here of analytes, a dedicated team that's only focused on looking at what are the business opportunities the market needs for that. And as we get closer to those launches, which will be coming up fairly soon, we'll be updating the market.

Its closure rate is also an advantage. 
And yes, we -- as I said, this is a multibillion-dollar market where we think that we can be a true competitor in also but, at the same time, invest to develop it. I think that's an important part here also, Larry. So as I mentioned, we're making investments in next-generation product. We're going to be making investments in the commercial infrastructure, which is not only to be there during the implant but also to develop the patient referral network. 
And we're going to be investing in clinical trials. I think the CATALYST trial is going to be comparing it to NOACs. I think that will be a great opportunity to expand the market also.

This is a hugely important segment in Structural Heart. We want to be a structural heart leader. We had that vision when we put the businesses together with St. Jude. And we know that we need to be a true player here in the TAVI space. So I'm really looking at this for us as a long game. And what I mean by that is we're launching Portico in the U.S. 
Navitor, to your question, is a great second-generation device. We got it CE Marked and feedback is that it's a very, very competitive device. Its clinical profile in high risk is really strong. And yes, I want to bring it to the U.S. also, but not because I feel we need to because Portico is not competitive. Portico is very competitive. But in this context of building a strategy here to be a real player in the TAVI space, we know that we're going to have to bring a second generation here in the U.S. We'll have to also look about how do we develop further on Navitor. 
So I think that we've got about a 5% share in Europe. That's not my aspiration for the TAVI space. To your point, there's 2 pretty well entrenched competitors in the market. And -- but we have a higher aspiration than just kind of a 5% share, which is what we have in Europe. So I think the combination here of investment in the team, investment in the pipeline, in the clinical data, you're right, our kind of low-risk -- intermediate low-risk trial kind of reads out a little bit later on. But it's there. We're investing in it because we see this as a big opportunity for us to be a real player in this market. So I'm excited about it, and I know the team is to be able to kind of be a real -- a go-to full-service player in the field of structural heart. 
Regarding CardioMems, listen, I think we -- the data, I think, was pretty compelling. I mean this is the second -- and you know this, Larry, this is the second RCT trial that we've done. And I'm a big believer in RCT trials and the need for them to be able to generate the clinical evidence. We filed for the label expansion end of June. I think the data was very compelling. And part of it is expansion to Class II and Class IV and then also to be able to expand indication to patients with elevated BNP, which is, today, just for patients that have been previously hospitalized. 
So I think the combination here of the data, the fact that it is already the second RCT that we've done, a very large one also on top of CHAMPIONs -- the CHAMPIONs trial. I think there's a great opportunity here for us to develop this market. One of the things that we did in the quarter here also is we now have a more dedicated business unit for Heart Failure, where both the LVAD and CardioMEMS team are going to be combined under 1 GM, very similar to what we've done with our other businesses because we believe in the benefit of that focus and that attention to the business. 
So I think the combination of what we've submitted, our focus, this is a great opportunity for us in 2022 and beyond. I'm not going to comment on when -- all I can tell you is we filed it at the end of Q2. And I think the data is very strong, and we'll just leave it like that. And I'm highly hopeful that we'll be seeing that next year for sure."

Well, I would say, this is probably out of our device businesses, the business that's had a little bit of a harder time in terms of recovering post COVID. It's probably more elective like you said, Cecilia. So it has been lagging a bit. It's been pretty flat, I would say, in terms of kind of its trajectory if we look at our trials and our implants. So -- but that's really something that we can't control in terms of kind of how that is going to bounce back. 
We have visibility to the pipeline of patients. We work closely with the surgery centers, and we've got visibility to that. We're not expecting a big bolus to come into Q4 and then we'll have to kind of see how Q1 and Q2 of next year looks like to be able to kind of give a better sense there. But what we can control, and that's what I focus -- we focus the team on is on our pipeline. 
And I think the team here has done a really good job. I'd highlight a couple of things here that we've done. NeuroSphere, which is this novel remote care platform, we've launched it. It's the first kind of system that was approved by the FDA. We did a full market release at the end of June. And I really like the numbers we're seeing. We've done over 5,000 remote programming sessions. And not only is it a remote program, but it also allows us to get visibility of the patients in the funnel. So using the adoption of that tool is great because I think it will have a real big change on the sales and service kind of business model that exists in this business. 
So that's going very well, and I think that will help get better visibility. Another key thing here is entrance into the rechargeable segment, which is about half of the market. We really don't have a competitive system in there, and the team has developed a rechargeable system that is best-in-class, significant advantages versus the market leaders in this segment. So we're looking forward to bringing that product to market next year. 
And then we've also made investments in trials. I think probably the most notable one is DISTINCT, which is an indication for nonsurgical lower back. We've completed enrollment in that study. So I think the combination of these factors here are important for us to be able to kind of take share. And then if we see the bolus of patients come back in Q1 and Q2, that will be an additional tailwind for us."

We know the customers. We have the call point. And we've got the capacity here to be able to leverage our manufacturing expertise here to be able to kind of scale up manufacturing. 
So this made perfect sense for us to be able to add it to the portfolio. And that integration is going pretty well. I don't expect any significant contributions in Q4. But as we go into next year, I think it will have an impact on our vascular business. And yes, I mean we're -- like I said, there are plenty of segments in the endo space, I would say, that we continue to study, we continue to look at, areas that we're interested in. And if we find the right moment for us to be able to add those opportunities, we will. 
Regarding your question on the PE indication, yes. Absolutely. We know that is very important in the peripheral space. So we're investing. That's one of the key aspects in the integration is to invest to be able to get that indication established. So yes, we are working on that."

We'll be in full ramp-up mode. So we can do more than the $1.4 billion. I think the factor here that we're looking at is, as I said in the opening comments here in the first question, I continue to see the surveillance in the screening market to continue to increase. And that's with kind of Binax and ID NOW also. 
So we've got those businesses, everything we can make, we're rolling in here. I'd say the only question we've got here a little bit is on the symptomatic. And that's what you see maybe in this step-down here is assuming as cases decline in the U.S. that we're going to see a little bit of a decline in symptomatic testing. So that's a little -- that's one part of the factor. 
The other factor in the $1 billion to $1.4 billion is just pricing. We've got a market leadership position in rapid testing, especially in OTC. If you look at Nielsen data, you'll be able to see that we were at about 90% share. Before the month of September, we dropped to about 60 just because of supply. And now we're back up to 75% share, and we're seeing a little bit of price pressure. So in that number, I've baked in some price pressure to ensure that we maintain that market leadership position as we see more market entrants come in. But if we don't need that price, then that will obviously drive another beat to that number, too. But -- so that's -- those are the drivers and the thinking there, Vijay, a little bit of pricing pressure and what are we going to see on the symptomatic testing."

But the contract actually has a minimum amount, which is significantly lower than that, less than $100 million. So it's really going to depend here on the DoD and the federal government in terms of their purchasing. We factored in a little bit of that minimum piece in Q4. And as I talk about going into next year, that will be a portion of the part that we will feel comfortable with adding on. So -- but it's a pretty big range, Vijay, in terms of what the maximum is and what the minimum is."

If you look at the investment we've made, Vijay, this year, we've added about $1 billion between R&D and SG&A to the business so that we can continue to drive the top line and, at the same time, drive the long-term sustainability of the business with the R&D investments. 
I talked about how we could pulsate that spend, not only this year, but as we go into next year, a portion of that spend is a little bit more discretionary on the SG&A side, and we'll be looking at that. But -- so the comment there was more about ensuring that there wasn't a distortion. We at least understood the distortion of COVID in terms of our profiles."

So maybe just a follow-up on some of the things you were just talking about sort of this concept of reinvesting the proceeds of this very strong COVID business. So there's a perception out there, I think, because COVID testing is maybe not permanent and hard to predict that it's somehow less important or harder to value than the rest of your businesses. But the last few months, obviously, in this quarter, $1.5 billion of upside in Q3 is, by our estimates, more than $0.5 billion in operating cash. And that goes up against your $2 billion or $2.5 billion operating cash run rate. 
So the question is, in addition to kind of being part of the solution as you've talked about to the pandemic, maybe drill down a little bit into some of the things you were just describing, opportunities to invest behind, which ones of your growth programs do you see an opportunity to sort of dial things up? And how, if at all, does this change maybe the way you think about M&A and your activity on that front?"
247483,1682768170,2408116,"Abbott Laboratories, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2021",2021-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Abbott Laboratories","Executives","Sure. I think you've captured pretty well all the elements there of how we look at COVID.

I think you've captured pretty well all the elements there of how we look at COVID. As I said in the beginning, when we started this, there's definitely an opportunity to accelerate the strategy of decentralized testing because of COVID, and that strategy has been in place, and that's an area that we are investing to ensure that we do have an ability to -- so we see more testing in pharmacy, more testing in urgent care centers and testing that goes beyond COVID that even goes beyond flu and RSV and respiratory viruses by developing assays that will be used on that rapid testing platform. 
So that's one investment, for sure. You can see the impact on the investment on some of the business. You see it in Nutrition. So we have been putting more disciplinary advertising and direct-to-consumer promotion in that business, and you could see the step-up in the growth rate there. We've obviously put investment into Libre, both on the SG&A side. You see -- we've rolled out a new TV commercial and funded that to a level that we feel is competitive, is leading in terms of messaging. Increased our sales force in the U.S. and other key markets for Libre so that we can call on more physicians, and you see the impact there on Libre. I mean we did almost $1 billion of sales of Libre this quarter. And in the U.S., it's about 65%. 
We're making great progress in penetrating the type 2 population, whether it's non-insulin users or non-intensive insulin users. We've got about a 90% market share of that segment at least. So that growth is also being supported. And we've got all these new product launches that I've been talking about on the cardiovascular side that require feet on the street, whether it's sales force, clinical specialists. And we're funding that also. So I think that, that's very clearly where we're putting our investments. We've talked about R&D investments and making sure that we've got pipeline beyond '22 and '23, and that's predominantly been in the Diagnostics and Device areas also. 
So it's been pretty broad based. That $1 billion increase has kind of gone well across all the businesses. And if I ask my general managers and my presidents of my businesses, do they have a next tranche of where they would go, they would have that list ready to go, too. So there's no shortage of opportunity. 
And then the other topic you talked about or touched on was the cash flow generation and -- as a result of the COVID business. And yes, it has generated a lot of cash. We have invested some of that cash in the organic opportunities we have, whether it's manufacturing sites here in the U.S. for COVID, for MitraClip, for Libre. So we've made those internal investments, but we've also looked at where we could provide the best return to our shareholders. And you saw that in the form of our dividend increase at the beginning of this year. We increased our dividend by 25%. You saw that we also -- probably saw that we bought back shares in Q2. And we've stepped that up even further in Q3, and we've got capacity to do more of that in Q4, if that makes sense for our shareholders. 
So we find a way to kind of deploy that capital. And on the M&A side, I mean, I've talked about this. If we think there's a strategic fit for us, one that is financially justified for us, that we can do better with it, that we can make it better and that there's value for our shareholders, we'll do that also. Right now, I'd say, I think the med tech and diagnostic valuations out there, especially the ones that we would be interested in, in high-quality, high-growth assets is a little bit frothy. So we're in the mode of studying and paying attention. 
I think the good news here is that we don't really need M&A to be able to support what I think is pretty top-tier performance here. So that's pretty comprehensive in terms of how we're looking at COVID. And it both funds our internal organic growth and allows us to either provide some more value to shareholders through buybacks, dividends. And if there's a growth vehicle out there that I think will make sense, we'll -- we won't be shy for that also. 
So I'll just close here a little bit and just say our results, we're achieving very strong growth across all of our businesses. I'm very excited and proud about the pipeline that all the businesses have been focused on. We've historically really focused on our organic pipelines, and that continues to be highly productive. We are entering to very new and attractive growth segments across our portfolio, and there's more products along the way there. 
So we're investing in our key platforms, as I've said. COVID testing is going to be an important companion to vaccines and therapeutics. At what level, I can't say right now for next year. I've given a range on what I think it's going to look like in Q4, and there could be opportunities there for us to do better than that. But I think the rapid test here is really the value proposition that's going to make sense going into next year, and we're a leader in that segment. We've built scale. We've built manufacturing, and we know how to operate in this environment, whether it's retail pharmacies or direct consumers. So our focus right now is we're going to finish strong 2021, enter into 2022 with a lot of momentum. And I think we're well-placed strategically here as we go into next year. So with that, I'll thank you all for joining us today."
