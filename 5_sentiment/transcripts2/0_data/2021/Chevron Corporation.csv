Thanks, Wayne. 2020 was an unprecedented year, the global pandemic resulting in a devastating loss of life and historic collapse in the global economy in extremely volatile oil markets. We began the year in a strong position, and we took swift action to adapt to the new realities as they emerged. 
During last year's first quarter call, we shared our plan to manage through the crisis, grounded in our values, and keeping our strategic and financial priorities intact. Looking back, I'm pleased to say that we delivered on each of these 5 commitments, which I'll cover on the next slides. 
First and foremost, we focus on the safety of our employees and our operations. Despite the difficult personal challenges faced by everyone in our workforce and the additional health safeguards at our operating facilities, 2020 was our second safest year ever in terms of fatalities and our best ever on serious injuries, motor vehicle crashes and loss of containment. And it was also the year with the greatest and most rapid change in market conditions. 
Our upstream team had to quickly and safely demobilize dozens of rigs and reduce other production activities. Our refining personnel had to figure out how to make as little jet fuel as possible even though just weeks before, jet was the fastest-growing refined product. 
Despite all this, our upstream delivered more than 3 million barrels per day for only the second time in the company's history. And our refineries maintained world-class availability to deliver the energy required for essential workers and a recovering economy. I'm so proud of our employees, how they carried out the responsibilities with excellence and helped each other and during this extraordinary year, rose to overcome the unprecedented challenges. 
Turning to capital and cost management. During last year's Investor Day, we told you our capital program was flexible. In just weeks after we said that, we proved it. 2020 capital was down 35% from 2019. Inorganic capital, excluding incremental C&E from Noble in the fourth quarter, was under $13 billion, well below our revised guidance of $14 billion. 
We also exceeded our guidance for operating cost savings. Excluding special items, OpEx was down by over $1 billion this year with decreases due to reduced activity levels and lower transportation, fuel and incentive compensation costs. This demonstrates our ongoing cost and capital discipline, something you can count on and a key to winning in this industry. 
Moving to the next slide. We entered and exited the 2020 crisis with an industry-leading balance sheet while also completing a major acquisition. Early in 2020, we increased our dividend over 8%. We also bought back shares. 
When the crisis hit and cash from operations decreased, we took action to halt the buyback and protect our balance sheet. We completed asset sales, received good value and finished our 3-year high grading program in the middle of our guidance range. 
Being prepared with a strong balance sheet, consistent with an ongoing asset sales program and adaptive on share repurchases enabled us to increase our annual dividend payout for the 33rd consecutive year. And the actions we took to preserve long-term value, which I'll cover on the next slide, should give our shareholders confidence that we intend to sustain and grow the dividend in the future. 
Turning to Slide 7. While we reduced short-cycle capital that would bring on near-term production, we maintained capital for projects that we expect to deliver production and attractive cash flow for years like our expansion project in Kazakhstan. And in the Permian Basin and other short-cycle basins, we preserved the capability to build investment backup when the conditions are right. 
In addition, we were the first to announce and complete a major acquisition, showing the way with a low premium equity deal at an opportune time. And as a result, our total investment over 2020 and 2021 will likely be in line with our pre-crisis guidance, but we'll get there in a much different way with much lower organic capital that would have added more barrels to already oversupplied markets, offset by an acquisition for low-cost barrels already producing. That also translated to reserve replacement, with additions from the Noble acquisition mitigating reserved on motions from reduced capital investment and price effects as disclosed in last year's 10-Qs. 
Committed employees, capital and cost discipline, decisive actions that balance the short and long term, that was our playbook to manage through this crisis. And while we're not out of it yet, we look to the future with optimism. We believe we're better positioned than others, confident in our ability to succeed in any environment. 
Turning to Slide 8. I'm also proud that we maintained our commitment to ESG, a commitment we've long held and one that doesn't ebb and flow with market cycles. We increased actions to advance a lower carbon future, abating emissions in our operations, starting up our first renewable natural gas plant and investing in low-carbon technologies like our recent announcement with carbon utilization start-up Blue Planet. 
We completed our largest company restructuring in 20 years and integration of Noble employees in a transparent and equitable manner. We maintained positive relationships with our suppliers and supportive relationships with communities where we operate. Lastly, we continued strong governance, which starts with our exceptional Board of Directors, during an unprecedented year to meet the interest of all our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre."

A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of this presentation. 
Excluding working capital changes, cash flow from operations was almost $4 billion for the quarter. Our Brent oil cash breakeven price, excluding working capital, was under $50 for the second quarter in a row. T&E was $3.2 billion, including about $200 million for legacy Noble assets. 
Full year financial results were significantly lower due to weak market conditions as reflected by an adjusted ROCE near 0. We remain committed to improving returns on capital, and we'll share more about our plans to do so at our Investor Day in March. 
Total shareholder distributions, including first quarter buybacks, were $11.4 billion. And we ended the year with a net debt ratio in the low 20s after the assumption of Noble debt and its step up to market value. 
Turning to Slide 10. Adjusted fourth quarter earnings were down about $200 million compared to third quarter. Adjusted upstream earnings increased primarily due to higher volumes from Noble Energy and higher commodity prices. 
Adjusted downstream earnings decreased due to negative timing effects, including an end-of-the-year inventory valuation adjustment of more than $100 million, higher operating expenses primarily due to turnarounds and higher RIN credit prices. The other segment decreased primarily due to higher pension charges related to lump-sum elections. 
Turning to our full year earnings. Adjusted earnings decreased by over $12 billion compared to the prior year. Adjusted upstream earnings decreased primarily on lower prices. An underlift and the mix effect of higher U.S. and lower international liftings also lowered earnings. 
Adjusted downstream earnings decreased primarily due to lower volumes and margins, unfavorable timing effects and higher RIN and other credit prices. The other segment loss increased primarily due to higher pension expense. 
Slide 12 shows our production outlook for 2021, assuming a $50 Brent price. We expect production to be up to 3% higher than last year, excluding the impact of any asset sales that may close in 2021. 
Our projected growth is driven by a full year of production from the Noble Energy assets and lower expected curtailments, partially offset by higher base declines, in part due to lower capital last year, price effects and accounting change in Venezuela, 2020 asset sales and upcoming contract expirations. Note that our Rokan concession in Indonesia expires in August of this year. And while our contract in Thailand does not expire until March of next year, production is decreasing due to the short time to earn a return on new investments. 
Now looking ahead, in the first quarter, we expect turnarounds and downtime to reduce production by 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, primarily in Australia. Gorgon Train 1 repairs are nearing completion, and we expect the facility to be back online in March. After Train 1 is back online, Train 3 will be taken out of service for the propane vessel inspections, any repairs and the planned turnaround. 
At Wheatstone, production is modestly below capacity while we repair an inlet separator. We do not expect production impacts in the second quarter. The impact from ongoing OPEC+ curtailments is estimated to be 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, primarily in Kazakhstan. 
At TCO, our project workforce reached 20,000 by year-end before we paused due to a virus resurgence. Next month, we expect to resume remobilization for the spring campaign and are targeting a project workforce of 26,000 by the end of the first quarter. 
In Indonesia, we expect cost recovery barrels to decrease 75,000 barrels per day from last quarter. Onetime prefunding for drilling and ARO commitments in the fourth quarter contributed to the working capital build. We expect these receivables to reverse by the third quarter. 
In downstream, turnaround activity in the first quarter is expected to have an estimated after-tax earnings impact of $100 million to $200 million. Other financial guidance items are shown on the slide. 
With that, back to Mike for his closing comments."

And you put the release out back in December, cutting the capital budget over the next several years to $14 billion to $16 billion. And as part of that, noted that as Tengiz spending, Kazakhstan rolls off, you would increase spending in the Permian and Gulf of Mexico. And I was wondering if you could comment on the role of those U.S. assets in your portfolio in light of the current policy and regulatory backdrop, particularly the Gulf of Mexico? How you're thinking about the U.S. concentrated investment strategy in light of current policies?"
98506,700124599,2186129,"Chevron Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2021",2021-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Chevron Corporation","Executives","Yes. Thanks. Thanks, Devin.

Look, there's a couple of things that I think are important to recognize. Number one, not only have we transitioned over the last few years into what I would describe as a structurally lower ongoing capital program. But number two, it contains a much greater degree of flexibility. And we mentioned we pulled spending down 35% really over just 9 months last year because we could flex that downward. And so we have a great degree of flexibility. We've got a high degree of capital efficiency in our portfolio. And even at these further reduced levels of spending, as Pierre mentioned, production will be somewhere between flat and up 3%. 
So we've got a capital program that we like. And as the TCO project comes down, we've got room to make choices. When we issued the press release, certainly, the Permian and the Gulf of Mexico would have been some of the first places to draw that capital back. 
As we look at some of the announcements of this week and developments that seem to be unfolding here in the U.S., it's early days to understand exactly how these will play out. The executive order was sweeping and broad, but it also lack some specificity. And I think, certainly, as you listen to some of the members of the new administration comment, as they introduce this and answered some questions, I think they're looking to flesh out the details here in the coming weeks and months. And we certainly hope to be engaged in those conversations. 
Onshore in the Permian, we're weighted towards Texas more so than New Mexico. We're weighted toward private land more so than federal land. So we've got a fair degree of flexibility there, and that remains a highly attractive place for us to step capital up as we have the capacity to do so. And the market conditions support it. 
So I think the Permian equation looks pretty similar to what it did at the time we made those statements. Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, I think we just have to see how this unfolds. And certainly, we like the projects that we're advancing here. And there's been, I think, general signaling that existing leases are secure. And we would presume the permitting that would go with those leases is also likely to proceed, but there are questions about this that I think we're just going to have to work our way through. 
So the risks are probably greater in the Gulf of Mexico. That was probably the lower part of the capital step-up that we might have envisioned at any rate. So I think we'll be able to manage our way through it, but stay tuned. We'll keep talking to you about this as we go forward. 
And of course, we've got options outside of the U.S. as well. And I think that's important to just bear in mind. If conditions in the U.S. become so onerous that it really disincentivizes investment, we've got other places where we can take those dollars."

So quickly, I'll reiterate that last year, we completed all module fabrication and all the transportation to get the modules through the Russian inland waterway systems through the Caspian unloaded and to [ Psych ]. That's a really important milestone because those were risks that could have extended things had we not accomplished that. 
Progress overall in the project is about 81%. At this point, construction is about 60% complete. And as Pierre said, we've remobilized 20,000 workers to the project. We've plateaued at that number now because Tengiz is experiencing some of the same winter time uptick in coronavirus cases as you're seeing around the world. And so we're holding at 20,000 right now. We've had to quarantine certain portions of the workforce there for certain periods of time. 
We plan to restart further mobilization in February and as Pierre said, targeting 26,000 by the end of the first quarter. We'll need to get some progress under our belt here to really see data on productivity. There's a lot of work that hasn't been done over the last -- going on a year now as this has been impacting us. 
And so we're working on optimizing schedules and work plans and understanding what the full impact of that is. It's hard to quantify that until we really are back at work. And certainly, in the wintertime, things tend to slow down. Summer time, they'll pick up. And so we need to see our ability to sustain the workforce there to get work done productively and begin to chew into this backlog that has built up. 
And we'll keep you advised as to what that looks like. Jay will be with us at the Investor Day in 6 weeks, and he'll give you more detail at that point in time. I don't believe, by that point in time, we will have enough activity that we've seen where we'll be able to give you a highly reliable, specific update on cost and schedule. But we will be working on that, and we will get it to you when we've got enough data to give you something that we think is really useful."

And we're running the company to deliver financial results, and we let the production be what it is. 
Pierre gave you a guide for first quarter on Gorgon and Wheatstone. Wheatstone for the rest of the year should be back up to full capacity until a turnaround that begins late third quarter and runs into fourth, which we'd already planned and announced. 
And then, of course, at Gorgon, as Pierre mentioned, Train 3 will have inspection of these propane exchangers and a planned turnaround here in the second quarter of this year. So we will be lighter on Australia production than where everything up and running for a full year, but a big part of that is planned turnaround activity. And then there's an increment related to these repairs. 
In the Permian, there's 2 pieces to think about. Overall, Permian production will be up because we've added production from Noble. I think we've previously guided to kind of a 6% to 7% decline on the Chevron legacy production. That actually today looks like it will be a little less steep, maybe more like a 5% decline on Chevron legacy production in 2021 versus 2020. And that's with flat activity levels, running 5 rigs and 1 or 2 completion crews over the course of the year. 
And a little bit of this will be dependent upon what NOJV partners do. We ended the year last year with about 1.4 net rigs in the Permian on the NOJV, 7 gross. Our share, about 1.4. In January, it's up a little bit to about 2.5 net rigs, 10 gross. So there's a little bit of perhaps upside depending upon what nonoperated JV partners do. But those are the key pieces there on both Australia and the Permian for production."

Australia year-on-year is not a big variance. It's flat to modestly down. Again, we operated a big portion of 2020 with the train down at Gorgon. So that's not a big driver of the year-on-year change."

Pierre, you said your dividend coverage is below 50 Brent, I think, for a second straight quarter. And that's despite downstream still being soft.

But just any thoughts you could share around cap allocation if oil does indeed stay here in the 50s?"

Thanks for recognizing we are still in the middle of a pandemic. Demand is still off in total. The global economy is functioning at below its capacity, and I think there's uncertainty out there. 
And certainly, oil prices today are supported in part by a unilateral move by Saudi Arabia to take 1 million barrels a day off the market. And so while we see inventories coming down and things trending back towards balance, that process is still underway. And so we want to be mindful of the uncertainties in the commodity price environment, and there could be some downside risk. 
So all that said, maybe 2 other points. One, well, for the last 3 years, we announced a dividend increase in the first quarter. If you go further back over the last decade, it was never a first quarter increase. It actually was in other quarters. And so we don't necessarily have a pattern or a kind of a preference for when the dividend increase would occur. It's really based on our assessment of both short-term and long-term conditions, affordability, et cetera. And it's a Board decision, and the Board reviews that every quarter. 
So I hope our words, but more our actions over recent years have demonstrated to you and to our shareholders that the dividend is our #1 priority. We have not changed that. Others have. Others have made moves and reshuffled priorities and reset dividends and all the rest. We have not, and we were guided through this by those financial priorities. And we're very mindful of what our investors look for, why they hold our stock. And that's certainly something that will be part of our discussions as we go forward. 
Last comment to your hypothesis, if we stay in a $55 Brent world for all of this year, we're in a very strong position from a cash flow standpoint. Our breakeven is in the 40s. And so we'd be free cash flow positive, and that certainly is supportive of a dividend increase."

If -- and as I just mentioned to Phil, we can hold production flat to grow it at these capital levels. And so we're in a position to consider dividend increases and share buybacks if we see an economic recovery and commodity price environment that supports that. 
The fundamental premise that we outlined at $60 continues to be our premise, which is disciplined capital spending, a commitment to the dividend and a return of surplus capital above and beyond that to shareholders premised upon a strong balance sheet and the other things that we always talked about within our priorities. So we'll lay out a little more detail on this in March for you so that you can understand what this would look like under different price scenarios and how we might allocate capital or the flexibility we'd have for capital distributions under different price scenarios. So stay tuned for more discussion in March."

I'll stay tuned for that. My second question is on the energy transition. I guess how does the current extremely low cost of capital for energy transition projects, energy transition companies, how does that impact your view on the speed of the transition and the potential to create lots of capacity that's potentially uneconomic but nonetheless, it still erodes oil and gas demand? So I guess, your views on that? And how can Chevron compete in that type of environment?"

So certainly, this is a space that's getting a lot of love from investors right now. And you see it in EV start-ups. You see it in solar start-ups. You see it in a lot of different technologies.

You see it in solar start-ups. You see it in a lot of different technologies. 
And look, we're supportive of all of the above. We want to see advancements and growth in renewables. We expect a lower carbon energy system in the future. 
I think you put your finger on one thing that needs to be watched is things that are supported by low interest rates, lots of investor enthusiasm and government policy may work in the short term. The question is when the tide starts flowing in other direction and when a day comes that interest rates are up, maybe investor perceptions shift a little bit. And maybe government policy shifts a little bit. Have we invested in things that can sustain in that environment? And I think that's -- we hope that they can. And we want to see the diversification of the energy mix to meet growing demand around the world and lower carbon. 
The last thing I say is I'm not sure this necessarily erodes energy demand as fast as some might believe -- oil and gas demand as fast as some might believe. A lot of it is going into power that displaces coal. It, in some cases, creates capacity that is intermittent and can't be used all the time. It actually requires natural gas to create grid stability and supply reliability. And so there's not necessarily a one-for-one displacement on all of these investments, and that requires a thoughtful study of the whole energy system to really understand how it's evolving and how this capacity plays against all the other different sources of energy."

Let me kick it off here on downstream. When we think about our model, upstream did okay. Downstream was a clear miss relative to our projections.

It's off differentially across different parts of the product barrel, which continues to stress the refining system. And then it's -- the amount that it's off varies quite a bit regionally, right? 
So in China, things are back to normal. By and large, other parts of Asia are pretty darn close. Europe, North America, not so much. So it's a gradually healing system, but it's different in different parts of the world. And refining markets are regional, and they're interconnected globally, but fundamentally, they start out regionally. 
So we're looking for improvement over the course of this year, but I wouldn't call it a full recovery. I think it's -- again, it's a gradual process. And we're certainly heavy on the West Coast and heavy in Asia. And so in Asia, things are, as I said, a little bit better. But on the West Coast, they're still recovering. 
So I think downstream in 2021 I would expect to be better than it was in '20. But we're not anticipating prepandemic downstream earnings and performance this year."

So during the course of the year, you're costing inventory at average cost of the commodities. At year-end, you see if you built or drove relative to prior year layers. And so the good news is we drew. We took our inventory levels down. So good management of working capital, but we drew into prior year layers that were higher costed. 
And so that's only something we do at year-end in the fourth quarter. You're not doing it during the year because you don't know if you're going to go into prior year layers in the intervening quarters. So you don't want to be always doing this calculation. But our practice is at year-end, we revalue that. So you have -- think of it as inventory that had been valued at 42 during the course of the year. When we go into prior year there, we're picking it up at 60 or 70. There's no cash impact, but there is a onetime kind of P&L effect.

We may have passed the bottom. Hopefully, we have from the standpoint of commodity and other cycles here. And we're alert to opportunities. It may be that as companies come back in terms of their equity valuation, there's still a lot of people that are carrying a fair amount of debt and have indicated a desire to sell assets in order to repair their own balance sheets. So we could see a market where there are more asset sellers than there are buyers, which could offer some opportunities at an asset level. And so we'll be aware and alert to those things.

In terms of the Gulf of Mexico, I think it's well-known that permits tend to -- you don't -- you have a lower inventory of permits. So if we have a bigger inventory of permits in the Permian Basin, we and other operators do, that's not the case in the Gulf of Mexico. So those permits tend to be a lower inventory.

And we should have the toolkit to take what is technically feasible today but not economically practical and look for ways to drive cost down and scale up hydrogen over time. And so I can't promise you we're going to get that to a point where it's fully competitive with the alternatives today, but that's an area that a few companies have the capability to do all the things required.

It's the capital and cost discipline. It is the ability to meet the needs of today's markets while investing for tomorrow's markets. And with the diversified portfolio we have across business lines and across geographies, we can mitigate market and regulatory risk that may emerge in one country because we've got a footprint that allows us to shift resources and capital allocation to other parts of our portfolio. 
So for 140-plus years, this is what we've been doing. You're right. Things are evolving now, but they've been evolving for quite some time. And I think the capabilities we have in our organization, the honest dialogue we try to have with everybody about how do you meet the growing demand for energy and the desire to see the mix change, and how do we continue to invest where we have advantages in both the existing core business and the emerging new businesses is what you will see us continue to do. 
At the core, I think the financial priorities stay the same. We are committed to the dividend. We're committed to organic reinvestment in order to support that dividend, and that can be a reinvestment across the entire spectrum of energy technologies. Maintaining a strong balance sheet, we've seen this last year how important that is. And then when we've got surplus cash after those first 3 needs to distribute that back to shareholders.

And both of those things matter to the investors that we speak to. And we're working hard on both fronts, and we've got to improve return on capital and demonstrate that we're going to do that. 
And at the same time, we also have to prepare for a lower carbon energy system in the future. And we're reducing the intensity of the energy we deliver today and making really good progress on that. And we'll continue to set new targets in that area because the world -- stepping on the hose of supply through one way or another doesn't really change demand. And so somehow demand will need to be met. And we think it should be met by those that can do it in a way that has the lowest carbon impact. 
We're increasing the production of renewable and lower carbon products for our customers, so they can reduce their energy intensity and carbon intensity. And then likewise, looking at these breakthrough technologies, and I mentioned a couple of them earlier. 
So every company in the industry, Doug, is searching for the right mix. There's not an empirically observable correct answer to this. And I think we're all working with our various stakeholders, right? Our Boards, our employees, our customers, the countries where we operate and the policy that we operate under, to manage both of these things. 
And look, energy is the lifeblood of the global economy. And reliable, affordable energy will be fundamental to the recovery from the pandemic in the short term. And in the longer term, it will be fundamental to lifting people out of poverty around the world, and we have to remember that. 
And today's energy system is not the enemy. Lower emissions are what we should be focused on. And that's what we, as a company, are focused on. And that's what we talk to our stakeholders about, and that's what we're committed to doing."

And then I had a follow-up just on the decline rates. You've said that you've got higher decline rates on lower spending in '21. Having said that, the number is only 70,000 barrels a day or about a 2% decline. Can you just help me understand why that number is so low?"

And if there's one thing I do hear back from people, it is support for not going into things where we wouldn't have competitive differentiation, and we may pursue lower return investments just for the sake of saying we're doing it when there's others out there that can do it just as well. So beyond that, I'm not hearing a lot of strategy push from shareholders. I'll let Pierre take the question on declines."

I mean, this is a sector that is trying to regain favor with investors. It hasn't earned its cost of capital. And the way out of that isn't by investing more capital.

It hasn't earned its cost of capital. And the way out of that isn't by investing more capital. So being disciplined in our conventional business with capital, being disciplined in M&A and being disciplined with the energy transition, as Jeanine asked, renewable energy products operate in commodity markets that have cycles up and down just like conventional products do. 
In terms of our decline, yes, Paul, I'm not sure. What I meant to say is that you'll see declines this year resulting from our capital last year because we did take capital down. But as you rightly point out, the decline, and we tried to put that on the best apples-to-apples basis, so again, we've got curtailment adjusted and then asset sales or contract expirations adjusted, which is a good view of our base and our shale and tight. And so it's a little more than a 2% decline. 
It is a big change because that would have been growth previously because you would have had Permian growing. That's how -- that was part of the reallocation. Mike showed a chart that said we are likely to invest $40 billion over the last year and this year, but $13 billion of it was Noble. So no doubt, our organic portfolio is not growing like it would have been previously because we've taken some capital out. 
But as you point out, it's a modest decline. It's because we're facility constrained in a lot of places. We have long-lived assets like in Australia LNG and Tengiz and offshore and even the declines in what's considered high decline areas like the Permian, we were able to mitigate. And Mike said earlier that our Permian production is beating our guidance range, and we'll actually be up because of the Noble barrels that we added 2021 versus 2020 full year and adjust for curtailment. So it's a good story that we're able to be so efficient and mitigate declines. And I'm happy you picked up on that number."

And not many have to your -- the foundation of your question. 
Look, our RNG is very good from a carbon standpoint because you mitigate otherwise unmitigated methane emissions, and that's why it gets the very attractive CI factor. The CI factor has to be worth something. And because RNG, from a first cost basis, is more expensive than fossil natural gas. 
And so in markets where there's a policy framework that creates that financial connection to the low CI, it's attractive and economic. And that's where we're playing today. I would expect over time that those policy frameworks could expand for the reasons that underlie your question. And we are working with customers as well to help incentivize the adoption of CNG vehicles. 
We've got an initiative in California, where we'll subsidize truck owners to convert or buy new heavy-duty CNG engines in return for a supply agreement. And then we're working with a number of different distribution points to enable that to happen. 
So we think this is a good part of the mix. It's not the answer everywhere, but it is certainly a part of the mix that we think deserves to grow. And that's why we've been investing into it. And it ties to the earlier comments about doing things where we've got unique and competitive advantages."

So you build it with the expectation of adding satellites longer term or you build a bigger host, et cetera? That's the first question. 
The second, which is slightly tied to that, it seems to me also and you've demonstrated it, but low gearing, a low level of indebtedness has served you very well to those 2 cycles. So when you think about the sort of 3 shock absorbers that you have, so short-cycle investments, balance sheet and buybacks, is in the near term the priority getting debt down?"

I think the answer to your first question is yes, and no. No, we're not changing how we look at investments. We don't have to go to ancient history books to know that the top line in our business is volatile. We've had not just '14, '15, you go '08, '09, you can go late '90s. And so to have companies in our industry that don't have balance sheets that are built for something that we know occurs with some frequency is a capital structure that doesn't make a lot of sense and transfers too much risk to equity holders. And that's partly reflected why the energy sector has underperformed other sectors for a while. So in that sense, I don't think we think of it differently. 
But to the second part of your first question, can we do developments differently? Absolutely. Can we size them to keep them full longer offshore? I mean, I think Mike has talked about the capital efficiency of our shale and tight, the flexibility of it. So undoubtedly, our capital efficiency is better than it ever has been. I mean our ability to generate positive free cash flow from a dollar capital invested. We've talked about being very disciplined with our capital, which reinforces it. 
But the basic premise of operating in a set of commodity businesses that are volatile, that hasn't changed in the last several years. That's been the case for the 30 years I've been with the company. 
And as you said, I think your second part of the question, how we operate with our 4 financial priorities is it reflects that reality. And so we understand what business we're in and then what kind of capital structure we should have that's in the interest of our shareholders."

And so we're always going to maintain a strong balance sheet. I gave kind of a range that we think is a good place to be over the cycle. And again, we can be below it, heading towards it or above it. 
So the balance sheet is, it's right in the middle of the range I've been talking about since I've been CFO. So there's no primary need on balance sheet. I mean, what's more -- the bigger driver is we're not at a full economic recovery here. And so getting control of the pandemic, getting the world's economy is growing again on a sustained path, that will be good for our business. 
Our breakeven is under 50. You can do the math. If oil prices are above $50 and if downstream margins improve because that's a breakeven under 50, including pretty weak downstream margins, we'll have excess cash. And we'll look at our priorities and make decisions like we have in the past. 
Just as a reminder, we bought back shares 13 of the last 17 years. We bought back shares on average during that time period basically equivalent to the daily average. So we're pretty consistent returner of cash to shareholders in the form of sustaining growing dividends and share buybacks when we had excess cash."

The global pandemic resulting in a devastating loss of life and historic collapse in the global economy and extremely volatile oil markets. We began the year in a strong position, and we took swift action to adapt to the new realities as they emerged.  
During last year's first quarter call, we shared our plan to manage through the crisis, grounded in our values, and keeping our strategic and financial priorities intact. Looking back, I'm pleased to say that we delivered on each of these 5 commitments, which I'll cover on the next slides.  
First and foremost, we focus on the safety of our employees and our operations. Despite the difficult personal challenges faced by everyone in our workforce and the additional health safeguards at our operating facilities, 2020 was our second safest year ever in terms of fatalities and our best ever on serious injuries, motor vehicle crashes and loss of containment. And it was also the year with the greatest and most rapid change in market conditions.  Our upstream team had to quickly and safely demobilize dozens of rigs and reduce other production activities. Our refining personnel had to figure out how to make as little jet fuel as possible even though just weeks before, jet was the fastest-growing refined product.  Despite all this, our upstream delivered more than 3 million barrels per day for only the second time in the company's history. And our refineries maintained world-class availability to deliver the energy required for essential workers and a recovering economy. I'm so proud of our employees, how they carried out the responsibilities with excellence and helped each other, and during this extraordinary year, rose to overcome the unprecedented challenges.  
Turning to capital and cost management. During last year's Investor Day, we told you our capital program was flexible. In just weeks after we said that, we proved it. 2020 capital was down 35% from 2019. Inorganic capital, excluding incremental C&E from Noble in the fourth quarter, was under $13 billion, well below our revised guidance of $14 billion.  
We also exceeded our guidance for operating cost savings. Excluding special items, OpEx was down by over $1 billion this year with decreases due to reduced activity levels and lower transportation, fuel and incentive compensation costs. This demonstrates our ongoing cost and capital discipline, something you can count on and a key to winning in this industry.  
Moving to the next slide. We entered and exited the 2020 crisis with an industry-leading balance sheet while also completing a major acquisition. Early in 2020, we increased our dividend over 8%. We also bought back shares.  When the crisis hit and cash from operations decreased, we took action to halt the buyback and protect our balance sheet. We completed asset sales, received good value and finished our 3-year high-grading program in the middle of our guidance range.  
Being prepared with a strong balance sheet, consistent with an ongoing asset sales program and adaptive on share repurchases enabled us to increase our annual dividend payout for the 33rd consecutive year. And the actions we took to preserve long-term value, which I'll cover on the next slide, should give our shareholders confidence that we intend to sustain and grow the dividend in the future.  
Turning to Slide 7. While we reduced short-cycle capital that would bring on near-term production, we maintained capital for projects that we expect to deliver production and attractive cash flow for years like our expansion project in Kazakhstan. And in the Permian Basin and other short-cycle basins, we preserved the capability to build investment backup when the conditions are right.  
In addition, we were the first to announce and complete a major acquisition, showing the way with a low premium equity deal at an opportune time. And as a result, our total investment over 2020 and 2021 will likely be in line with our pre-crisis guidance, but we'll get there in a much different way with much lower organic capital that would have added more barrels to already oversupplied markets, offset by an acquisition for low-cost barrels already producing. That also translated to reserve replacement, with additions from the Noble acquisition mitigating reserve demotions from reduced capital investment and price effects as disclosed in last year's 10-Qs.  
Committed employees, capital and cost discipline, decisive actions that balance the short and long term, that was our playbook to manage through this crisis. And while we're not out of it yet, we look to the future with optimism. We believe we're better positioned than others, confident in our ability to succeed in any environment.
Turning to Slide 8. I'm also proud that we maintained our commitment to ESG, a commitment we've long held and one that doesn't ebb and flow with market cycles. We increased actions to advance a lower carbon future, abating emissions in our operations, starting up our first renewable natural gas plant and investing in low-carbon technologies like our recent announcement with carbon utilization start-up, Blue Planet.  We completed our largest company restructuring in 20 years and integration of Noble employees in a transparent and equitable manner. And we maintained positive relationships with our suppliers and supportive relationships with communities where we operate. Lastly, we continued strong governance, which starts with our exceptional Board of Directors during an unprecedented year to meet the interest of all our shareholders.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre."

A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of this presentation.  
Excluding working capital changes, cash flow from operations was almost $4 billion for the quarter. Our Brent oil cash breakeven price, excluding working capital, was under $50 for the second quarter in a row. T&E was $3.2 billion, including about $200 million for legacy Noble assets.  Full year financial results were significantly lower due to weak market conditions as reflected by an adjusted ROCE near 0. We remain committed to improving returns on capital, and we'll share more about our plans to do so at our Investor Day in March.  
Total shareholder distributions, including first quarter buybacks, were $11.4 billion. And we ended the year with a net debt ratio in the low-20s after the assumption of Noble debt and its step up to market value.  
Turning to Slide 10. Adjusted fourth quarter earnings were down about $200 million compared to third quarter. Adjusted upstream earnings increased, primarily due to higher volumes from Noble Energy and higher commodity prices.  Adjusted downstream earnings decreased due to negative timing effects, including an end-of-the-year inventory valuation adjustment of more than $100 million, higher operating expenses, primarily due to turnarounds, and higher RIN credit prices. The other segment decreased primarily due to higher pension charges related to lump-sum elections.  
Turning to our full year earnings. Adjusted earnings decreased by over $12 billion compared to the prior year. Adjusted upstream earnings decreased primarily on lower prices. An underlift and the mix effect of higher U.S. and lower international liftings also lowered earnings.
Adjusted downstream earnings decreased primarily due to lower volumes and margins, unfavorable timing effects and higher RIN and other credit prices. The other segment loss increased primarily due to higher pension expense.  
Slide 12 shows our production outlook for 2021, assuming a $50 Brent price. We expect production to be up to 3% higher than last year, excluding the impact of any asset sales that may close in 2021.  Our projected growth is driven by a full year of production from the Noble Energy assets and lower expected curtailments, partially offset by higher base declines, in part, due to lower capital last year, price effects; an accounting change in Venezuela; 2020 asset sales; and upcoming contract expirations. Note that our Rokan concession in Indonesia expires in August of this year. And while our contract in Thailand does not expire until March of next year, production is decreasing due to the short time to earn a return on new investments.  
Now looking ahead, in the first quarter, we expect turnarounds and downtime to reduce production by 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, primarily in Australia. Gorgon Train 1 repairs are nearing completion, and we expect the facility to be back online in March. After Train 1 is back online, Train 3 will be taken out of service for the propane vessel inspections, any repairs and the planned turnaround.
At Wheatstone, production is modestly below capacity while we repair an inlet separator. We do not expect production impacts in the second quarter. 
The impact from ongoing OPEC+ curtailments is estimated to be 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, primarily in Kazakhstan.  
At TCO, our project workforce reached 20,000 by year-end before we paused due to a virus resurgence. Next month, we expect to resume remobilization for the spring campaign and are targeting a project workforce of 26,000 by the end of the first quarter.  
In Indonesia, we expect cost recovery barrels to decrease 75,000 barrels per day from last quarter. Onetime prefunding for drilling and ARO commitments in the fourth quarter contributed to the working capital build. We expect these receivables to reverse by the third quarter.  
And downstream turnaround activity in the first quarter is expected to have an estimated after-tax earnings impact of $100 million to $200 million. Other financial guidance items are shown on the slide.  
With that, back to Mike for his closing comments."

And you put the release out back in December, cutting the capital budget over the next several years to $14 billion to $16 billion. And as part of that, noted that as Tengiz spending in Kazakhstan rolls off, you would increase spending in the Permian and Gulf of Mexico. 
And I was wondering if you could comment on the role of those U.S. assets in your portfolio in light of the current policy and regulatory backdrop, particularly the Gulf of Mexico? How you're thinking about the U.S. concentrated investment strategy in light of current policies?"
98506,700124599,2186410,"Chevron Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2021",2021-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Chevron Corporation","Executives","Yes. Thanks. Thanks, Devin. Look, there's a couple of things that I think are important to recognize. Number one, not only have we transitioned over the last few years into what I would describe as a structurally lower ongoing capital program. But number",511,"Yes. Thanks. Thanks, Devin. Look, there's a couple of things that I think are important to recognize. Number one, not only have we transitioned over the last few years into what I would describe as a structurally lower ongoing capital program. But number two, it contains a much greater degree of flexibility. And we mentioned we pulled spending down 35% really over just 9 months last year because we could flex that downward. 
And so we have a great degree of flexibility. We've got a high degree of capital efficiency in our portfolio. And even at these further reduced levels of spending, as Pierre mentioned, production will be somewhere between flat and up 3%.  
So we've got a capital program that we like. And as the TCO project comes down, we've got room to make choices. When we issued the press release, certainly, the Permian and the Gulf of Mexico would have been some of the first places to draw that capital back.  
As we look at some of the announcements of this week and developments that seem to be unfolding here in the U.S., it's early days to understand exactly how these will play out. The executive order was sweeping and broad, but it also lack some specificity. And I think, certainly, as you listen to some of the members of the new administration comment, as they introduce this and answered some questions, I think they're looking to flesh out the details here in the coming weeks and months. And we certainly hope to be engaged in those conversations.  
Onshore in the Permian, we're weighted towards Texas more so than New Mexico. We're weighted toward private land more so than federal land. So we've got a fair degree of flexibility there, and that remains a highly attractive place for us to step capital up as we have the capacity to do so and the market conditions support it.  
So I think the Permian equation looks pretty similar to what it did at the time we made those statements. Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, I think we just have to see how this unfolds. And certainly, we like the projects that we're advancing here. And there's been, I think, general signaling that existing leases are secure. And we would presume the permitting that would go with those leases is also likely to proceed, but there are questions about this that I think we're just going to have to work our way through.  
So the risks are probably greater in the Gulf of Mexico. That was probably the lower part of the capital step-up that we might have envisioned at any rate. So I think we'll be able to manage our way through it. But stay tuned. We'll keep talking to you about this as we go forward.  
And of course, we've got options outside of the U.S. as well. And I think that's important to just bear in mind. If conditions in the U.S. become so onerous that it really disincentivizes investment, we've got other places where we can take those dollars."

So quickly, I'll reiterate that last year, we completed all module fabrication and all the transportation to get the modules through the Russian inland waterway systems through the Caspian unloaded into site. That's a really important milestone because those were risks that could have extended things had we not accomplished that.  
Progress overall in the project is about 81%. At this point, construction is about 60% complete. And as Pierre said, we've remobilized 20,000 workers to the project. We've plateaued at that number now because Tengiz is experiencing some of the same winter time uptick in coronavirus cases as you're seeing around the world. And so we're holding at 20,000 right now. We've had to quarantine certain portions of the workforce there for certain periods of time.  We plan to restart further mobilization in February, and as Pierre said, targeting 26,000 by the end of the first quarter. 
We'll need to get some progress under our belt here to really see data on productivity. There's a lot of work that hasn't been done over the last -- going on a year now this has been impacting us.  And so we're working on optimizing schedules and work plans, and understanding what the full impact of that is.  It's hard to quantify that until we really are back at work. And certainly, in the winter time, things tend to slow down. Summer time, they'll pick up. And so we need to see our ability to sustain the workforce there to get work done productively and begin to chew into this backlog that has built up.  And we'll keep you advised as to what that looks like. 
Jay will be with us at the Investor Day in 6 weeks, and he'll give you more detail at that point in time. I don't believe, by that point in time, we will have enough activity that we've seen where we'll be able to give you a highly reliable, specific update on cost and schedule. But we will be working on that, and we will get it to you when we've got enough data to give you something that we think is really useful."

I mean, first thing I'll say, Phil, and I know everybody looks at production, but it's an outcome. And we're running the company to deliver financial results, and we let the production be what it is.  
Pierre gave you a guide for first quarter on Gorgon and Wheatstone. Wheatstone, for the rest of the year, should be back up to full capacity until a turnaround that begins late third quarter and runs into fourth, which we'd already planned and announced.  And then, of course, at Gorgon, as Pierre mentioned, Train 3 will have inspection of these propane exchangers and a planned turnaround here in the second quarter of this year. 
So we will be lighter on Australia production than we're everything up and running for a full year, but a big part of that is planned turnaround activity and then there's an increment related to these repairs.  
In the Permian, there's 2 pieces to think about. Overall, Permian production will be up because we've added production from Noble. I think we've previously guided to kind of a 6% to 7% decline on the Chevron legacy production. That actually, today, looks like it will be a little less steep, maybe more like a 5% decline on Chevron legacy production in 2021 versus 2020. And that's with flat activity levels, running 5 rigs and 1 or 2 completion crews over the course of the year. And a little bit of this will be dependent upon what NOJV partners do. We ended the year last year with about 1.4 net rigs in the Permian on the NOJV, 7 gross. Our share, about 1.4. In January, it's up a little bit to about 2.5 net rigs, 10 gross. So there's a little bit of perhaps upside depending upon what non-operated JV partners do. But those are the key pieces there on both Australia and the Permian for production."

But just any thoughts you could share around cap allocation if oil does indeed stay here in the 50s?"

Thanks for recognizing we are still in the middle of a pandemic. Demand is still off in total. The global economy is functioning at below its capacity, and I think there's uncertainty out there.  And certainly, oil prices today are supported in part by a unilateral move by Saudi Arabia to take 1 million barrels a day off the market. 
And so while we see inventories coming down and things trending back towards balance, that process is still underway. And so we want to be mindful of the uncertainties in the commodity price environment, and there could be some downside risk.  
So all that said, maybe 2 other points. One, while for the last 3 years, we announced a dividend increase in the first quarter. If you go further back over the last decade, it was never a first quarter increase; it actually was in other quarters. And so we don't necessarily have a pattern or a kind of a preference for when the dividend increase would occur. It's really based on our assessment of both short-term and long-term conditions, affordability, et cetera. And it's a Board decision, and the Board reviews that every quarter.  
So I hope our words, but more, our actions, over recent years have demonstrated to you and to our shareholders that the dividend is our #1 priority. We have not changed that. Others have. Others have made moves and reshuffled priorities and reset dividends and all the rest. We have not, and we were guided through this by those financial priorities. And we're very mindful of what our investors look for, why they hold our stock. And that's certainly something that will be part of our discussions as we go forward.  
Last comment to your hypothesis. If we stay in a $55 Brent world for all of this year, we're in a very strong position from a cash flow standpoint. Our breakeven is in the 40s. And so we'd be free cash flow positive, and that certainly is supportive of a dividend increase."

So we've outlined that budget premised on a lower price than $60 because we've been through this pandemic, and we expect only a gradual recovery in the global economy, which would support gradual recovery in commodity prices. So we've prepared ourselves for a difficult set of market conditions, which is certainly what we saw last year.  If -- and as I just mentioned to Phil, we can hold production flat to grow it at these capital levels. And so we're in a position to consider dividend increases and share buybacks if we see an economic recovery and commodity price environment that supports that.  
The fundamental premise that we outlined at $60                                    continues to be our premise, which is disciplined capital spending, a commitment to the dividend and a return of surplus capital above and beyond that to shareholders premised upon a strong balance sheet and the other things that we always talked about within our priorities.

We expect a lower carbon energy system in the future.  
I think you put your finger on one thing that needs to be watched is things that are supported by low interest rates, lots of investor enthusiasm and government policy may work in the short term. The question is when the tide starts flowing in other direction and when a day comes that interest rates are up, maybe investor perceptions shift a little bit and maybe government policy shifts a little bit, have we invested in things that can sustain in that environment? And I think that's -- we hope that they can. And we want to see the diversification of the energy mix to meet growing demand around the world and lower carbon.  
The last thing I'll say, I'm not sure this necessarily erodes energy demand as fast as some might believe -- or oil and gas demand as fast as some might believe. A lot of it is going into power that displaces coal. It, in some cases, creates capacity that is intermittent and can't be used all the time. It actually requires natural gas to create grid stability and supply reliability. And so there's not necessarily a one-for-one displacement on all of these investments, and that requires a thoughtful study of the whole energy system to really understand how it's evolving and how this capacity plays against all the other different sources of energy."

It's off differentially across different parts of the product barrel, which continues to stress the refining system. And then it's -- the amount that it's off varies quite a bit regionally, right?  
So in China, things are back to normal. By and large, other parts of Asia are pretty darn close. Europe, North America, not so much. So it's a gradually healing system, but it's different in different parts of the world. And refining markets are regional, and they're interconnected globally, but fundamentally, they start out regionally.  
So we're looking for improvement over the course of this year, but I wouldn't call it a full recovery. I think it's -- again, it's a gradual process. And we're certainly heavy on the West Coast and heavy in Asia. And so in Asia, things are, as I said, a little bit better. But on the West Coast, they're still recovering.  
So I think downstream in 2021, I would expect it to be better than it was in '20. But we're not anticipating pre-pandemic downstream earnings and performance this year."

I made a reference to this year-end inventory adjustment. I'll just explain that. It was more than $100 million.  
So during the course of the year, you're costing inventory at average cost of the commodities. At year-end, you see if you built or drove relative to prior year layers. And so the good news is we drew. We took our inventory levels down. So good management of working capital. But we drew into prior year layers that were higher costed.  
And so that's only something we do at year-end in the fourth quarter. You're not doing it during the year because you don't know if you're going to go into prior year layers in the intervening quarters. So you don't want to be always doing this calculation. But our practice is at year-end, we revalue that. So you have -- think of it as inventory that had been valued at 42 during the course of the year. When we go into prior year there, is we're picking it up at 60 or 70. There's no cash impact, but there is a onetime kind of P&L effect.  
We don't call it a special item because it happens every year. It just happened this year. Through good inventory management, we actually drew down into prior year layers, which were higher costed."

And you would say that in general, I would say both companies and the asset valuations are down from where they've historically been. So there's opportunity in circumstances like that, and we've got the capacity to consider doing things.  
We may have passed the bottom. Hopefully, we have from the standpoint of commodity and other cycles here. And we're alert to opportunities. It may be that as companies come back in terms of their equity valuation, there's still a lot of people that are carrying a fair amount of debt and have indicated a desire to sell assets in order to repair their own balance sheets. So we could see a market where there are more asset sellers than there are buyers, which could offer some opportunities at an asset level. And so we'll be aware and alert to those things.  
The nice thing is we're not in a position where we have to do anything. We strengthened ourselves significantly with a very good deal last year. We've got plenty of inventory to work on for many, many years to come. And anything we would do would have to, A, fit strategically into a strong portfolio; and B, it would have to compete for capital in a strong portfolio. And so we'll continue to hold the bar very high and only consider things that would really make a lot of sense."

I understand that federal leases may be only about 10%, 15% of your overall Permian land position. But want to see that from a activity level, how that looks like.  
And also that how many permits that you already in hand in Permian? And whether you have the -- all the needed permit for your program in Gulf of Mexico this year. Also that if you can just give us the production number in the fourth quarter in Permian, DJ and Dover?

In terms of the Gulf of Mexico, I think it's well-known that permits tend to -- you don't -- you have a lower inventory of permits. So if we have a bigger inventory of permits in the Permian Basin, we and other operators do, that's not the case in the Gulf of Mexico. So those permits tend to be a lower inventory.

And then, of course, hydrogen should be in our wheelhouse. We manufacture hydrogen today. We've sold hydrogen before at retail. And we should have the toolkit to take what is technically feasible today, but not economically practical and look for ways to drive cost down and scale up hydrogen over time. And so I can't promise you we're going to get that to a point where it's fully competitive with the alternatives today, but that's an area that a few companies have the capability to do all the things required. And we're one of the types of companies that should be able to work on that. So those would be 2 areas you can expect to see us active in."

It's the capital and cost discipline. It is the ability to meet the needs of today's markets while investing for tomorrow's markets. And with the diversified portfolio we have across business lines and across geographies, we can mitigate market and regulatory risk that may emerge in one country because we've got a footprint that allows us to shift resources and capital allocation to other parts of our portfolio.
So for 140-plus years, this is what we've been doing. You're right. Things are evolving now, but they've been evolving for quite some time. And I think the capabilities we have in our organization, the honest dialogue we try to have with everybody about how do you meet the growing demand for energy and the desire to see the mix change and how do we continue to invest where we have advantages in both the existing core business and the emerging new businesses is what you will see us continue to do.  
At the core, I think the financial priorities stay the same. We are committed to the dividend. We're committed to organic reinvestment in order to support that dividend, and that can be a reinvestment across the entire spectrum of energy technologies. Maintaining a strong balance sheet. We've seen this last year how important that is. And then when we've got surplus cash after those first 3 needs to distribute that back to shareholders.

So it's not a hard and fast target, but we're in a really good place with a leading balance sheet, low breakeven, as Mike talked about, and very well positioned. We also have asset sales that we provided some guidance on here on the call.  
In terms of the S&P, look, we work with them. It was an industry-wide call.

Noble's assets in Israel have the big part of their capital spend behind them. Right now, there's capacity to grow production there with little or no incremental capital right now. And the nice thing is we bring some capabilities to bear here that might not have been in Noble's wheelhouse.  
So there's ways to take this gas further into regional markets. There's ways to take it into LNG, be it facilities that have [indiscernible] today that you go into or Noble had been looking at an FLNG concept. There are ways to take it to power markets and to power generation and then regional power distribution across borders.

So we have the financial strength and capacity to underwrite things larger than perhaps Noble could have. And some technical capability and relationship depth in some of these markets that should be an advantage. And so we'll look to use those to support the growth of the position in Israel.

And at the same time, we also have to prepare for a lower carbon energy system in the future. And we're reducing the intensity of the energy we deliver today and making really good progress on that. And we'll continue to set new targets in that area because the world -- stepping on the hose of supply, through one way or another, doesn't really change demand. And so somehow demand will need to be met. And we think it should be met by those that can do it in a way that has the lowest carbon impact. 
We're increasing the production of renewable and lower carbon products for our customers, so they can reduce their energy intensity and carbon intensity. And then likewise, looking at these breakthrough technologies, and I mentioned a couple of them earlier. 
So every company in the industry, Doug, is searching for the right mix. There's not an empirically observable correct answer to this.

But as you rightly point out, the decline, and we tried to put that on the best apples-to-apples basis, so again, we've got curtailment adjusted and then asset sales or contract expirations adjusted, which is a good view of our base and our shale and tight. And so it's a little more than a 2% decline. 
It is a big change because that would have been growth previously because you would have had Permian growing. That's how -- that was part of the reallocation. Mike showed a chart that said we are likely to invest $40 billion over the last year and this year, but $13 billion of it was Noble. So no doubt, our organic portfolio is not growing like it would have been previously because we've taken some capital out. 
But as you point out, it's a modest decline. It's because we're facility constrained in a lot of places. We have long-lived assets like in Australia LNG and Tengiz and offshore and even the declines in what's considered high-decline areas like the Permian, we were able to mitigate. And Mike said earlier that our Permian production is beating our guidance range, and we'll actually be up because of the Noble barrels that we added 2021 versus 2020 full year and if you adjust for curtailment. So it's a good story that we're able to be so efficient and mitigate declines. And I'm happy you picked up on that number."

And not many have to your -- the foundation of your question. 
Look, our RNG is very good from a carbon standpoint because you mitigate otherwise unmitigated methane emissions, and that's why it gets the very attractive CI factor. 
The CI factor has to be worth something. And because RNG, from a first cost basis, is more expensive than fossil natural gas.  And so in markets where there's a policy framework that creates that financial connection to the low CI, it's attractive and economic. And that's where we're playing today. I would expect over time that those policy frameworks could expand for the reasons that underlie your question. And we are working with customers as well to help incentivize the adoption of CNG vehicles. 
We've got an initiative in California, where we'll subsidize truck owners to convert or buy new heavy-duty CNG engines in return for a supply agreement. And then we're working with a number of different distribution points to enable that to happen. 
So we think this is a good part of the mix. It's not the answer everywhere, but it is certainly a part of the mix that we think deserves to grow. And that's why we've been investing into it. And it ties to the earlier comments about doing things where we've got unique and competitive advantages."

So you build it with the expectation of adding satellites longer term or you build a bigger host, et cetera? That's the first question. 
The second, which is slightly tied to that, it seems to me also and you've demonstrated it, but low gearing, a low level of indebtedness, has served you very well to those 2 cycles.

I think the answer to your first question is yes, and no. No, we're not changing how we look at investments. We don't have to go to ancient history books to know that the top line in our business is volatile. We've had not just '14, '15, you go '08, '09, you go late '90s. And so to have companies in our industry that don't have balance sheets that are built for something that we know occurs with some frequency is a capital structure that doesn't make a lot of sense. It transfers too much risk to equity holders, and that's partly reflected why the energy sector has underperformed other sectors for a while. So in that sense, I don't think we think of it differently. 
But to the second part of your first question, can we do developments differently? Absolutely. Can we size them to keep them full longer offshore? I mean, I think Mike has talked about the capital efficiency of our shale and tight, the flexibility of it. So undoubtedly, our capital efficiency is better than it ever has been. I mean, our ability to generate positive free cash flow from a dollar capital invested. We've talked about being very disciplined with our capital, which reinforces it. 
But the basic premise of operating in a set of commodity businesses that are volatile, that hasn't changed in the last several years. That's been the case for the 30 years I've been with the company. 
And as you said, I think your second part of the question, how we operate with our 4 financial priorities is it reflects that reality. And so we understand what business we're in and then what kind of capital structure we should have that's in the interest of our shareholders."

It's dividend; reinvestment, because we got to generate cash for the dividend; maintaining a strong balance sheet; and buybacks is fourth. And so we're always going to maintain a strong balance sheet. I gave kind of a range that we think is a good place to be over the cycle. And again, we can be below it, heading towards it or above it. 
So the balance sheet is, it's right in the middle of the range I've been talking about since I've been CFO. So there's no primary need on balance sheet. I mean, what's more -- the bigger driver is we're not at a full economic recovery here. And so getting control of the pandemic, getting the world's economies is growing again on a sustained path, that will be good for our business. 
Our breakeven is under 50. You can do the math. If oil prices are above 50 and if downstream margins improve, because that's a breakeven under 50, including pretty weak downstream margins, we'll have excess cash. And we'll look at our priorities and make decisions like we have in the past. 
Just as a reminder, we bought back shares 13 of the last 17 years. We bought back shares on average during that time period basically equivalent to the daily average. So we're pretty consistent returner of cash to shareholders in the form of sustaining growing dividends and share buybacks when we had excess cash."

The global pandemic resulting in a devastating loss of life and historic collapse in the global economy and extremely volatile oil markets. We began the year in a strong position, and we took swift action to adapt to the new realities as they emerged. 
During last year's first quarter call, we shared our plan to manage through the crisis, grounded in our values, and keeping our strategic and financial priorities intact. Looking back, I'm pleased to say that we delivered on each of these 5 commitments, which I'll cover on the next slides. 
First and foremost, we focus on the safety of our employees and our operations. Despite the difficult personal challenges faced by everyone in our workforce and the additional health safeguards at our operating facilities, 2020 was our second safest year ever in terms of fatalities and our best ever on serious injuries, motor vehicle crashes and loss of containment. And it was also the year with the greatest and most rapid change in market conditions. Our upstream team had to quickly and safely demobilize dozens of rigs and reduce other production activities. Our refining personnel had to figure out how to make as little jet fuel as possible even though just weeks before, jet was the fastest-growing refined product. Despite all this, our upstream delivered more than 3 million barrels per day for only the second time in the company's history. And our refineries maintained world-class availability to deliver the energy required for essential workers and a recovering economy. I'm so proud of our employees, how they carried out the responsibilities with excellence and helped each other, and during this extraordinary year, rose to overcome the unprecedented challenges. 
Turning to capital and cost management. During last year's Investor Day, we told you our capital program was flexible. In just weeks after we said that, we proved it. 2020 capital was down 35% from 2019. Inorganic capital, excluding incremental C&E from Noble in the fourth quarter, was under $13 billion, well below our revised guidance of $14 billion. 
We also exceeded our guidance for operating cost savings. Excluding special items, OpEx was down by over $1 billion this year with decreases due to reduced activity levels and lower transportation, fuel and incentive compensation costs. This demonstrates our ongoing cost and capital discipline, something you can count on and a key to winning in this industry. 
Moving to the next slide. We entered and exited the 2020 crisis with an industry-leading balance sheet while also completing a major acquisition. Early in 2020, we increased our dividend over 8%. We also bought back shares. When the crisis hit and cash from operations decreased, we took action to halt the buyback and protect our balance sheet. We completed asset sales, received good value and finished our 3-year high-grading program in the middle of our guidance range. 
Being prepared with a strong balance sheet, consistent with an ongoing asset sales program and adaptive on share repurchases enabled us to increase our annual dividend payout for the 33rd consecutive year. And the actions we took to preserve long-term value, which I'll cover on the next slide, should give our shareholders confidence that we intend to sustain and grow the dividend in the future. 
Turning to Slide 7. While we reduced short-cycle capital that would bring on near-term production, we maintained capital for projects that we expect to deliver production and attractive cash flow for years like our expansion project in Kazakhstan. And in the Permian Basin and other short-cycle basins, we preserved the capability to build investment backup when the conditions are right. 
In addition, we were the first to announce and complete a major acquisition, showing the way with a low premium equity deal at an opportune time. And as a result, our total investment over 2020 and 2021 will likely be in line with our pre-crisis guidance, but we'll get there in a much different way with much lower organic capital that would have added more barrels to already oversupplied markets, offset by an acquisition for low-cost barrels already producing. That also translated to reserve replacement, with additions from the Noble acquisition mitigating reserve demotions from reduced capital investment and price effects as disclosed in last year's 10-Qs. 
Committed employees, capital and cost discipline, decisive actions that balance the short and long term, that was our playbook to manage through this crisis. And while we're not out of it yet, we look to the future with optimism. We believe we're better positioned than others, confident in our ability to succeed in any environment.
Turning to Slide 8. I'm also proud that we maintained our commitment to ESG, a commitment we've long held and one that doesn't ebb and flow with market cycles. We increased actions to advance a lower carbon future, abating emissions in our operations, starting up our first renewable natural gas plant and investing in low-carbon technologies like our recent announcement with carbon utilization start-up, Blue Planet. We completed our largest company restructuring in 20 years and integration of Noble employees in a transparent and equitable manner. And we maintained positive relationships with our suppliers and supportive relationships with communities where we operate. Lastly, we continued strong governance, which starts with our exceptional Board of Directors during an unprecedented year to meet the interest of all our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre."

A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of this presentation. 
Excluding working capital changes, cash flow from operations was almost $4 billion for the quarter. Our Brent oil cash breakeven price, excluding working capital, was under $50 for the second quarter in a row. T&E was $3.2 billion, including about $200 million for legacy Noble assets. Full year financial results were significantly lower due to weak market conditions as reflected by an adjusted ROCE near 0. We remain committed to improving returns on capital, and we'll share more about our plans to do so at our Investor Day in March. 
Total shareholder distributions, including first quarter buybacks, were $11.4 billion. And we ended the year with a net debt ratio in the low-20s after the assumption of Noble debt and its step up to market value. 
Turning to Slide 10. Adjusted fourth quarter earnings were down about $200 million compared to third quarter. Adjusted upstream earnings increased, primarily due to higher volumes from Noble Energy and higher commodity prices. Adjusted downstream earnings decreased due to negative timing effects, including an end-of-the-year inventory valuation adjustment of more than $100 million, higher operating expenses, primarily due to turnarounds, and higher RIN credit prices. The other segment decreased primarily due to higher pension charges related to lump-sum elections. 
Turning to our full year earnings. Adjusted earnings decreased by over $12 billion compared to the prior year. Adjusted upstream earnings decreased primarily on lower prices. An underlift and the mix effect of higher U.S. and lower international liftings also lowered earnings.
Adjusted downstream earnings decreased primarily due to lower volumes and margins, unfavorable timing effects and higher RIN and other credit prices. The other segment loss increased primarily due to higher pension expense. 
Slide 12 shows our production outlook for 2021, assuming a $50 Brent price. We expect production to be up to 3% higher than last year, excluding the impact of any asset sales that may close in 2021. Our projected growth is driven by a full year of production from the Noble Energy assets and lower expected curtailments, partially offset by higher base declines, in part, due to lower capital last year, price effects; an accounting change in Venezuela; 2020 asset sales; and upcoming contract expirations. Note that our Rokan concession in Indonesia expires in August of this year. And while our contract in Thailand does not expire until March of next year, production is decreasing due to the short time to earn a return on new investments. 
Now looking ahead, in the first quarter, we expect turnarounds and downtime to reduce production by 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, primarily in Australia. Gorgon Train 1 repairs are nearing completion, and we expect the facility to be back online in March. After Train 1 is back online, Train 3 will be taken out of service for the propane vessel inspections, any repairs and the planned turnaround.
At Wheatstone, production is modestly below capacity while we repair an inlet separator. We do not expect production impacts in the second quarter. 
The impact from ongoing OPEC+ curtailments is estimated to be 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, primarily in Kazakhstan. 
At TCO, our project workforce reached 20,000 by year-end before we paused due to a virus resurgence. Next month, we expect to resume remobilization for the spring campaign and are targeting a project workforce of 26,000 by the end of the first quarter. 
In Indonesia, we expect cost recovery barrels to decrease 75,000 barrels per day from last quarter. Onetime prefunding for drilling and ARO commitments in the fourth quarter contributed to the working capital build. We expect these receivables to reverse by the third quarter.

And you put the release out back in December, cutting the capital budget over the next several years to $14 billion to $16 billion. And as part of that, noted that as Tengiz spending in Kazakhstan rolls off, you would increase spending in the Permian and Gulf of Mexico. 
And I was wondering if you could comment on the role of those U.S. assets in your portfolio in light of the current policy and regulatory backdrop, particularly the Gulf of Mexico? How you're thinking about the U.S. concentrated investment strategy in light of current policies?"

Look, there's a couple of things that I think are important to recognize. Number one, not only have we transitioned over the last few years into what I would describe as a structurally lower ongoing capital program. But number",511,"Yes. Thanks. Thanks, Devin. Look, there's a couple of things that I think are important to recognize. Number one, not only have we transitioned over the last few years into what I would describe as a structurally lower ongoing capital program. But number two, it contains a much greater degree of flexibility. And we mentioned we pulled spending down 35% really over just 9 months last year because we could flex that downward. 
And so we have a great degree of flexibility. We've got a high degree of capital efficiency in our portfolio. And even at these further reduced levels of spending, as Pierre mentioned, production will be somewhere between flat and up 3%. 
So we've got a capital program that we like. And as the TCO project comes down, we've got room to make choices. When we issued the press release, certainly, the Permian and the Gulf of Mexico would have been some of the first places to draw that capital back. 
As we look at some of the announcements of this week and developments that seem to be unfolding here in the U.S., it's early days to understand exactly how these will play out. The executive order was sweeping and broad, but it also lack some specificity. And I think, certainly, as you listen to some of the members of the new administration comment, as they introduce this and answered some questions, I think they're looking to flesh out the details here in the coming weeks and months. And we certainly hope to be engaged in those conversations. 
Onshore in the Permian, we're weighted towards Texas more so than New Mexico. We're weighted toward private land more so than federal land. So we've got a fair degree of flexibility there, and that remains a highly attractive place for us to step capital up as we have the capacity to do so and the market conditions support it. 
So I think the Permian equation looks pretty similar to what it did at the time we made those statements. Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, I think we just have to see how this unfolds. And certainly, we like the projects that we're advancing here. And there's been, I think, general signaling that existing leases are secure. And we would presume the permitting that would go with those leases is also likely to proceed, but there are questions about this that I think we're just going to have to work our way through. 
So the risks are probably greater in the Gulf of Mexico. That was probably the lower part of the capital step-up that we might have envisioned at any rate. So I think we'll be able to manage our way through it. But stay tuned. We'll keep talking to you about this as we go forward. 
And of course, we've got options outside of the U.S. as well. And I think that's important to just bear in mind. If conditions in the U.S. become so onerous that it really disincentivizes investment, we've got other places where we can take those dollars."

So quickly, I'll reiterate that last year, we completed all module fabrication and all the transportation to get the modules through the Russian inland waterway systems through the Caspian unloaded into site. That's a really important milestone because those were risks that could have extended things had we not accomplished that. 
Progress overall in the project is about 81%. At this point, construction is about 60% complete. And as Pierre said, we've remobilized 20,000 workers to the project. We've plateaued at that number now because Tengiz is experiencing some of the same winter time uptick in coronavirus cases as you're seeing around the world. And so we're holding at 20,000 right now. We've had to quarantine certain portions of the workforce there for certain periods of time. We plan to restart further mobilization in February, and as Pierre said, targeting 26,000 by the end of the first quarter. 
We'll need to get some progress under our belt here to really see data on productivity. There's a lot of work that hasn't been done over the last -- going on a year now this has been impacting us. And so we're working on optimizing schedules and work plans, and understanding what the full impact of that is. It's hard to quantify that until we really are back at work. And certainly, in the winter time, things tend to slow down. Summer time, they'll pick up. And so we need to see our ability to sustain the workforce there to get work done productively and begin to chew into this backlog that has built up. And we'll keep you advised as to what that looks like. 
Jay will be with us at the Investor Day in 6 weeks, and he'll give you more detail at that point in time. I don't believe, by that point in time, we will have enough activity that we've seen where we'll be able to give you a highly reliable, specific update on cost and schedule. But we will be working on that, and we will get it to you when we've got enough data to give you something that we think is really useful."

And we're running the company to deliver financial results, and we let the production be what it is. 
Pierre gave you a guide for first quarter on Gorgon and Wheatstone. Wheatstone, for the rest of the year, should be back up to full capacity until a turnaround that begins late third quarter and runs into fourth, which we'd already planned and announced. And then, of course, at Gorgon, as Pierre mentioned, Train 3 will have inspection of these propane exchangers and a planned turnaround here in the second quarter of this year. 
So we will be lighter on Australia production than we're everything up and running for a full year, but a big part of that is planned turnaround activity and then there's an increment related to these repairs. 
In the Permian, there's 2 pieces to think about. Overall, Permian production will be up because we've added production from Noble. I think we've previously guided to kind of a 6% to 7% decline on the Chevron legacy production. That actually, today, looks like it will be a little less steep, maybe more like a 5% decline on Chevron legacy production in 2021 versus 2020. And that's with flat activity levels, running 5 rigs and 1 or 2 completion crews over the course of the year. And a little bit of this will be dependent upon what NOJV partners do. We ended the year last year with about 1.4 net rigs in the Permian on the NOJV, 7 gross. Our share, about 1.4. In January, it's up a little bit to about 2.5 net rigs, 10 gross. So there's a little bit of perhaps upside depending upon what non-operated JV partners do. But those are the key pieces there on both Australia and the Permian for production."

But just any thoughts you could share around cap allocation if oil does indeed stay here in the 50s?"

Thanks for recognizing we are still in the middle of a pandemic. Demand is still off in total. The global economy is functioning at below its capacity, and I think there's uncertainty out there. And certainly, oil prices today are supported in part by a unilateral move by Saudi Arabia to take 1 million barrels a day off the market. 
And so while we see inventories coming down and things trending back towards balance, that process is still underway. And so we want to be mindful of the uncertainties in the commodity price environment, and there could be some downside risk. 
So all that said, maybe 2 other points. One, while for the last 3 years, we announced a dividend increase in the first quarter. If you go further back over the last decade, it was never a first quarter increase; it actually was in other quarters. And so we don't necessarily have a pattern or a kind of a preference for when the dividend increase would occur. It's really based on our assessment of both short-term and long-term conditions, affordability, et cetera. And it's a Board decision, and the Board reviews that every quarter. 
So I hope our words, but more, our actions, over recent years have demonstrated to you and to our shareholders that the dividend is our #1 priority. We have not changed that. Others have. Others have made moves and reshuffled priorities and reset dividends and all the rest. We have not, and we were guided through this by those financial priorities. And we're very mindful of what our investors look for, why they hold our stock. And that's certainly something that will be part of our discussions as we go forward. 
Last comment to your hypothesis. If we stay in a $55 Brent world for all of this year, we're in a very strong position from a cash flow standpoint. Our breakeven is in the 40s. And so we'd be free cash flow positive, and that certainly is supportive of a dividend increase."

So we've outlined that budget premised on a lower price than $60 because we've been through this pandemic, and we expect only a gradual recovery in the global economy, which would support gradual recovery in commodity prices. So we've prepared ourselves for a difficult set of market conditions, which is certainly what we saw last year. If -- and as I just mentioned to Phil, we can hold production flat to grow it at these capital levels. And so we're in a position to consider dividend increases and share buybacks if we see an economic recovery and commodity price environment that supports that. 
The fundamental premise that we outlined at $60 continues to be our premise, which is disciplined capital spending, a commitment to the dividend and a return of surplus capital above and beyond that to shareholders premised upon a strong balance sheet and the other things that we always talked about within our priorities.

We expect a lower carbon energy system in the future. 
I think you put your finger on one thing that needs to be watched is things that are supported by low interest rates, lots of investor enthusiasm and government policy may work in the short term. The question is when the tide starts flowing in other direction and when a day comes that interest rates are up, maybe investor perceptions shift a little bit and maybe government policy shifts a little bit, have we invested in things that can sustain in that environment? And I think that's -- we hope that they can. And we want to see the diversification of the energy mix to meet growing demand around the world and lower carbon. 
The last thing I'll say, I'm not sure this necessarily erodes energy demand as fast as some might believe -- or oil and gas demand as fast as some might believe. A lot of it is going into power that displaces coal. It, in some cases, creates capacity that is intermittent and can't be used all the time. It actually requires natural gas to create grid stability and supply reliability. And so there's not necessarily a one-for-one displacement on all of these investments, and that requires a thoughtful study of the whole energy system to really understand how it's evolving and how this capacity plays against all the other different sources of energy."

It's off differentially across different parts of the product barrel, which continues to stress the refining system. And then it's -- the amount that it's off varies quite a bit regionally, right? 
So in China, things are back to normal. By and large, other parts of Asia are pretty darn close. Europe, North America, not so much. So it's a gradually healing system, but it's different in different parts of the world. And refining markets are regional, and they're interconnected globally, but fundamentally, they start out regionally. 
So we're looking for improvement over the course of this year, but I wouldn't call it a full recovery. I think it's -- again, it's a gradual process. And we're certainly heavy on the West Coast and heavy in Asia. And so in Asia, things are, as I said, a little bit better. But on the West Coast, they're still recovering. 
So I think downstream in 2021, I would expect it to be better than it was in '20. But we're not anticipating pre-pandemic downstream earnings and performance this year."

Two question, Mike and Pierre. One, I want to go back into the federal leases exposure. Can you share with us in the Permian over the 2019 and 2020, what percent of your activity is actually in the federal leases? I understand that federal leases may be only about 10%, 15% of your overall Permian land position. But want to see that from a activity level, how that looks like. 
And also that how many permits that you already in hand in Permian? And whether you have the -- all the needed permit for your program in Gulf of Mexico this year. Also that if you can just give us the production number in the fourth quarter in Permian, DJ and Dover? 
The second question is on the ESG and the carbon product or service. We understand you are not interested going into the renewable power like solar and wind. But is there any other new product or service related to ESG and carbon you think you have the technology that you can build it into a new business? I'm not sure if that's the process, but it's a new business."

Our federal acreage, as you said, in the Permian, is less than 10%. It went down a little bit through the Noble acquisition. We're not going to disclose the activity for the last year and how much was the mix. I think you can find it's publicly available data, and you can chase that down. 
In terms of the Gulf of Mexico, I think it's well-known that permits tend to -- you don't -- you have a lower inventory of permits. So if we have a bigger inventory of permits in the Permian Basin, we and other operators do, that's not the case in the Gulf of Mexico. So those permits tend to be a lower inventory.
I will just point out that we have one floating rig on a long-term contract in the Gulf of Mexico that expires at the end of the year. So we'll, again, take your rather detailed questions off-line. And then, Mike, do you want to answer the energy transition?"

And then, of course, hydrogen should be in our wheelhouse. We manufacture hydrogen today. We've sold hydrogen before at retail. And we should have the toolkit to take what is technically feasible today, but not economically practical and look for ways to drive cost down and scale up hydrogen over time. And so I can't promise you we're going to get that to a point where it's fully competitive with the alternatives today, but that's an area that a few companies have the capability to do all the things required.

Simultaneously, the pace of change in the industry seems to be quickening, not only as it relates to policy, which we talked about a minute ago, and likely future energy mix, but that which is expected from investments in the sector. So my question is a couple of fold. 
Number one, how do you guys think about how to navigate this evolving environment, which is somewhat different. Two, are tactical and strategic dexterity likely to be needed maybe more than in the past? And then finally, what might be the implications for financial strategy in this new environment?

I know this is the last lap round the track for you this year as well. So congratulations, and best wishes in the future.
On your question, I think a lot of the fundamentals that we've been exhibiting in our strategy will continue to serve shareholders well as we go forward. It's the capital and cost discipline. It is the ability to meet the needs of today's markets while investing for tomorrow's markets. And with the diversified portfolio we have across business lines and across geographies, we can mitigate market and regulatory risk that may emerge in one country because we've got a footprint that allows us to shift resources and capital allocation to other parts of our portfolio.
So for 140-plus years, this is what we've been doing. You're right. Things are evolving now, but they've been evolving for quite some time. And I think the capabilities we have in our organization, the honest dialogue we try to have with everybody about how do you meet the growing demand for energy and the desire to see the mix change and how do we continue to invest where we have advantages in both the existing core business and the emerging new businesses is what you will see us continue to do. 
At the core, I think the financial priorities stay the same. We are committed to the dividend. We're committed to organic reinvestment in order to support that dividend, and that can be a reinvestment across the entire spectrum of energy technologies. Maintaining a strong balance sheet. We've seen this last year how important that is. And then when we've got surplus cash after those first 3 needs to distribute that back to shareholders. That framework is intact and I don't see that changing."

So I've talked about -- we don't have a target net debt ratio range, but I've talked about a range between 20% and 25% is a good place to be over the cycle. We can be below that at times. We'd be heading up towards this range. If we're above it for some reason, I'd want to have confidence that we're heading down that range. So it's not a hard and fast target, but we're in a really good place with a leading balance sheet, low breakeven, as Mike talked about, and very well positioned. We also have asset sales that we provided some guidance on here on the call. 
In terms of the S&P, look, we work with them. It was an industry-wide call. I think our track record speaks for itself in terms of being disciplined with capital, protecting the balance sheet and being very progressive about the future of energy and our approach of higher returns, lower carbon.

But fundamentally, we intend to continue to be very disciplined in the allocation of capital. 
Noble's assets in Israel have the big part of their capital spend behind them. Right now, there's capacity to grow production there with little or no incremental capital right now. And the nice thing is we bring some capabilities to bear here that might not have been in Noble's wheelhouse. 
So there's ways to take this gas further into regional markets. There's ways to take it into LNG, be it facilities that have [indiscernible] today that you go into or Noble had been looking at an FLNG concept. There are ways to take it to power markets and to power generation and then regional power distribution across borders. And there are opportunities to look at things like hydrogen and new energy technologies as well. 
So we have the financial strength and capacity to underwrite things larger than perhaps Noble could have. And some technical capability and relationship depth in some of these markets that should be an advantage. And so we'll look to use those to support the growth of the position in Israel. 
And then the broad capital allocation question, U.S. versus other countries, we're always thinking about that, always looking at that and drawn by returns and risk. And we'll continue to evaluate those things."

And both of those things matter to the investors that we speak to. And we're working hard on both fronts, and we've got to improve return on capital and demonstrate that we're going to do that. 
And at the same time, we also have to prepare for a lower carbon energy system in the future. And we're reducing the intensity of the energy we deliver today and making really good progress on that. And we'll continue to set new targets in that area because the world -- stepping on the hose of supply, through one way or another, doesn't really change demand. And so somehow demand will need to be met. And we think it should be met by those that can do it in a way that has the lowest carbon impact. 
We're increasing the production of renewable and lower carbon products for our customers, so they can reduce their energy intensity and carbon intensity. And then likewise, looking at these breakthrough technologies, and I mentioned a couple of them earlier. 
So every company in the industry, Doug, is searching for the right mix. There's not an empirically observable correct answer to this. And I think we're all working with our various stakeholders, right? Our Boards, our employees, our customers, the countries where we operate and the policy that we operate under, to manage both of these things.

As Jeanine asked, renewable energy products operate in commodity markets that have cycles up and down just like conventional products do. 
In terms of our decline, yes, Paul, I'm not sure. What I meant to say is that you'll see declines this year resulting from our capital last year because we did take capital down. But as you rightly point out, the decline, and we tried to put that on the best apples-to-apples basis, so again, we've got curtailment adjusted and then asset sales or contract expirations adjusted, which is a good view of our base and our shale and tight. And so it's a little more than a 2% decline. 
It is a big change because that would have been growth previously because you would have had Permian growing. That's how -- that was part of the reallocation. Mike showed a chart that said we are likely to invest $40 billion over the last year and this year, but $13 billion of it was Noble. So no doubt, our organic portfolio is not growing like it would have been previously because we've taken some capital out. 
But as you point out, it's a modest decline. It's because we're facility constrained in a lot of places. We have long-lived assets like in Australia LNG and Tengiz and offshore and even the declines in what's considered high-decline areas like the Permian, we were able to mitigate. And Mike said earlier that our Permian production is beating our guidance range, and we'll actually be up because of the Noble barrels that we added 2021 versus 2020 full year and if you adjust for curtailment. So it's a good story that we're able to be so efficient and mitigate declines. And I'm happy you picked up on that number."

And we are working with customers as well to help incentivize the adoption of CNG vehicles. 
We've got an initiative in California, where we'll subsidize truck owners to convert or buy new heavy-duty CNG engines in return for a supply agreement. And then we're working with a number of different distribution points to enable that to happen. 
So we think this is a good part of the mix. It's not the answer everywhere, but it is certainly a part of the mix that we think deserves to grow. And that's why we've been investing into it. And it ties to the earlier comments about doing things where we've got unique and competitive advantages."

One is on when you think about the portfolio and also what you've seen in the market through the sort of '15 -- '14, '15 volatility, the volatility you've seen now, are you starting to change the way you look at the investments that you're making going forward? So are you looking at hurdle rates, payback periods, et cetera, and changing them to sort of tailor a different environment going forward? And also, I mean, if you are, are you able to do that through the portfolio? Or can you also do that through the way you approach the development of an asset? So you build it with the expectation of adding satellites longer term or you build a bigger host, et cetera? That's the first question. 
The second, which is slightly tied to that, it seems to me also and you've demonstrated it, but low gearing, a low level of indebtedness, has served you very well to those 2 cycles. So when you think about the sort of 3 shock absorbers that you have, so short-cycle investments, balance sheet and buybacks, is, in the near term, the priority getting debt down?"

I think the answer to your first question is yes, and no. No, we're not changing how we look at investments. We don't have to go to ancient history books to know that the top line in our business is volatile. We've had not just '14, '15, you go '08, '09, you go late '90s. And so to have companies in our industry that don't have balance sheets that are built for something that we know occurs with some frequency is a capital structure that doesn't make a lot of sense. It transfers too much risk to equity holders, and that's partly reflected why the energy sector has underperformed other sectors for a while. So in that sense, I don't think we think of it differently. 
But to the second part of your first question, can we do developments differently? Absolutely. Can we size them to keep them full longer offshore? I mean, I think Mike has talked about the capital efficiency of our shale and tight, the flexibility of it. So undoubtedly, our capital efficiency is better than it ever has been. I mean, our ability to generate positive free cash flow from a dollar capital invested. We've talked about being very disciplined with our capital, which reinforces it. 
But the basic premise of operating in a set of commodity businesses that are volatile, that hasn't changed in the last several years. That's been the case for the 30 years I've been with the company. 
And as you said, I think your second part of the question, how we operate with our 4 financial priorities is it reflects that reality. And so we understand what business we're in and then what kind of capital structure we should have that's in the interest of our shareholders."

It's dividend; reinvestment, because we got to generate cash for the dividend; maintaining a strong balance sheet; and buybacks is fourth. And so we're always going to maintain a strong balance sheet. I gave kind of a range that we think is a good place to be over the cycle. And again, we can be below it, heading towards it or above it. 
So the balance sheet is, it's right in the middle of the range I've been talking about since I've been CFO. So there's no primary need on balance sheet. I mean, what's more -- the bigger driver is we're not at a full economic recovery here. And so getting control of the pandemic, getting the world's economies is growing again on a sustained path, that will be good for our business. 
Our breakeven is under 50. You can do the math. If oil prices are above 50 and if downstream margins improve, because that's a breakeven under 50, including pretty weak downstream margins, we'll have excess cash. And we'll look at our priorities and make decisions like we have in the past. 
Just as a reminder, we bought back shares 13 of the last 17 years. We bought back shares on average during that time period basically equivalent to the daily average. So we're pretty consistent returner of cash to shareholders in the form of sustaining growing dividends and share buybacks when we had excess cash."

The global pandemic resulting in a devastating loss of life and historic collapse in the global economy and extremely volatile oil markets. We began the year in a strong position, and we took swift action to adapt to the new realities as they emerged. 
During last year's first quarter call, we shared our plan to manage through the crisis, grounded in our values, and keeping our strategic and financial priorities intact. Looking back, I'm pleased to say that we delivered on each of these 5 commitments, which I'll cover on the next slides. 
First and foremost, we focus on the safety of our employees and our operations. Despite the difficult personal challenges faced by everyone in our workforce and the additional health safeguards at our operating facilities, 2020 was our second safest year ever in terms of fatalities and our best ever on serious injuries, motor vehicle crashes and loss of containment. And it was also the year with the greatest and most rapid change in market conditions. Our upstream team had to quickly and safely demobilize dozens of rigs and reduce other production activities. Our refining personnel had to figure out how to make as little jet fuel as possible even though just weeks before, jet was the fastest-growing refined product. Despite all this, our upstream delivered more than 3 million barrels per day for only the second time in the company's history. And our refineries maintained world-class availability to deliver the energy required for essential workers and a recovering economy. I'm so proud of our employees, how they carried out the responsibilities with excellence and helped each other, and during this extraordinary year, rose to overcome the unprecedented challenges. 
Turning to capital and cost management. During last year's Investor Day, we told you our capital program was flexible. In just weeks after we said that, we proved it. 2020 capital was down 35% from 2019. Inorganic capital, excluding incremental C&E from Noble in the fourth quarter, was under $13 billion, well below our revised guidance of $14 billion. 
We also exceeded our guidance for operating cost savings. Excluding special items, OpEx was down by over $1 billion this year with decreases due to reduced activity levels and lower transportation, fuel and incentive compensation costs. This demonstrates our ongoing cost and capital discipline, something you can count on and a key to winning in this industry. 
Moving to the next slide. We entered and exited the 2020 crisis with an industry-leading balance sheet while also completing a major acquisition. Early in 2020, we increased our dividend over 8%. We also bought back shares. When the crisis hit and cash from operations decreased, we took action to halt the buyback and protect our balance sheet. We completed asset sales, received good value and finished our 3-year high-grading program in the middle of our guidance range. 
Being prepared with a strong balance sheet, consistent with an ongoing asset sales program and adaptive on share repurchases enabled us to increase our annual dividend payout for the 33rd consecutive year. And the actions we took to preserve long-term value, which I'll cover on the next slide, should give our shareholders confidence that we intend to sustain and grow the dividend in the future. 
Turning to Slide 7. While we reduced short-cycle capital that would bring on near-term production, we maintained capital for projects that we expect to deliver production and attractive cash flow for years like our expansion project in Kazakhstan. And in the Permian Basin and other short-cycle basins, we preserved the capability to build investment backup when the conditions are right. 
In addition, we were the first to announce and complete a major acquisition, showing the way with a low premium equity deal at an opportune time. And as a result, our total investment over 2020 and 2021 will likely be in line with our pre-crisis guidance, but we'll get there in a much different way with much lower organic capital that would have added more barrels to already oversupplied markets, offset by an acquisition for low-cost barrels already producing. That also translated to reserve replacement, with additions from the Noble acquisition mitigating reserve demotions from reduced capital investment and price effects as disclosed in last year's 10-Qs. 
Committed employees, capital and cost discipline, decisive actions that balance the short and long term, that was our playbook to manage through this crisis. And while we're not out of it yet, we look to the future with optimism. We believe we're better positioned than others, confident in our ability to succeed in any environment.
Turning to Slide 8. I'm also proud that we maintained our commitment to ESG, a commitment we've long held and one that doesn't ebb and flow with market cycles. We increased actions to advance a lower carbon future, abating emissions in our operations, starting up our first renewable natural gas plant and investing in low-carbon technologies like our recent announcement with carbon utilization start-up, Blue Planet. We completed our largest company restructuring in 20 years and integration of Noble employees in a transparent and equitable manner. And we maintained positive relationships with our suppliers and supportive relationships with communities where we operate. Lastly, we continued strong governance, which starts with our exceptional Board of Directors during an unprecedented year to meet the interest of all our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre."

A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of this presentation. 
Excluding working capital changes, cash flow from operations was almost $4 billion for the quarter. Our Brent oil cash breakeven price, excluding working capital, was under $50 for the second quarter in a row. T&E was $3.2 billion, including about $200 million for legacy Noble assets. Full year financial results were significantly lower due to weak market conditions as reflected by an adjusted ROCE near 0. We remain committed to improving returns on capital, and we'll share more about our plans to do so at our Investor Day in March. 
Total shareholder distributions, including first quarter buybacks, were $11.4 billion. And we ended the year with a net debt ratio in the low-20s after the assumption of Noble debt and its step up to market value. 
Turning to Slide 10. Adjusted fourth quarter earnings were down about $200 million compared to third quarter. Adjusted upstream earnings increased, primarily due to higher volumes from Noble Energy and higher commodity prices. Adjusted downstream earnings decreased due to negative timing effects, including an end-of-the-year inventory valuation adjustment of more than $100 million, higher operating expenses, primarily due to turnarounds, and higher RIN credit prices. The other segment decreased primarily due to higher pension charges related to lump-sum elections. 
Turning to our full year earnings. Adjusted earnings decreased by over $12 billion compared to the prior year. Adjusted upstream earnings decreased primarily on lower prices. An underlift and the mix effect of higher U.S. and lower international liftings also lowered earnings.
Adjusted downstream earnings decreased primarily due to lower volumes and margins, unfavorable timing effects and higher RIN and other credit prices. The other segment loss increased primarily due to higher pension expense. 
Slide 12 shows our production outlook for 2021, assuming a $50 Brent price. We expect production to be up to 3% higher than last year, excluding the impact of any asset sales that may close in 2021. Our projected growth is driven by a full year of production from the Noble Energy assets and lower expected curtailments, partially offset by higher base declines, in part, due to lower capital last year, price effects; an accounting change in Venezuela; 2020 asset sales; and upcoming contract expirations. Note that our Rokan concession in Indonesia expires in August of this year. And while our contract in Thailand does not expire until March of next year, production is decreasing due to the short time to earn a return on new investments. 
Now looking ahead, in the first quarter, we expect turnarounds and downtime to reduce production by 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, primarily in Australia. Gorgon Train 1 repairs are nearing completion, and we expect the facility to be back online in March. After Train 1 is back online, Train 3 will be taken out of service for the propane vessel inspections, any repairs and the planned turnaround.
At Wheatstone, production is modestly below capacity while we repair an inlet separator. We do not expect production impacts in the second quarter. 
The impact from ongoing OPEC+ curtailments is estimated to be 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, primarily in Kazakhstan. 
At TCO, our project workforce reached 20,000 by year-end before we paused due to a virus resurgence. Next month, we expect to resume remobilization for the spring campaign and are targeting a project workforce of 26,000 by the end of the first quarter. 
In Indonesia, we expect cost recovery barrels to decrease 75,000 barrels per day from last quarter. Onetime prefunding for drilling and ARO commitments in the fourth quarter contributed to the working capital build. We expect these receivables to reverse by the third quarter. 
And downstream turnaround activity in the first quarter is expected to have an estimated after-tax earnings impact of $100 million to $200 million. Other financial guidance items are shown on the slide. 
With that, back to Mike for his closing comments."

And you put the release out back in December, cutting the capital budget over the next several years to $14 billion to $16 billion. And as part of that, noted that as Tengiz spending in Kazakhstan rolls off, you would increase spending in the Permian and Gulf of Mexico. 
And I was wondering if you could comment on the role of those U.S. assets in your portfolio in light of the current policy and regulatory backdrop, particularly the Gulf of Mexico? How you're thinking about the U.S. concentrated investment strategy in light of current policies?"
98506,700124599,2253400,"Chevron Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2021",2021-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Chevron Corporation","Executives","Yes. Thanks. Thanks, Devin.

Look, there's a couple of things that I think are important to recognize. Number one, not only have we transitioned over the last few years into what I would describe as a structurally lower ongoing capital program. But number two, it contains a much greater degree of flexibility. And we mentioned we pulled spending down 35% really over just 9 months last year because we could flex that downward. 
And so we have a great degree of flexibility. We've got a high degree of capital efficiency in our portfolio. And even at these further reduced levels of spending, as Pierre mentioned, production will be somewhere between flat and up 3%. 
So we've got a capital program that we like. And as the TCO project comes down, we've got room to make choices. When we issued the press release, certainly, the Permian and the Gulf of Mexico would have been some of the first places to draw that capital back. 
As we look at some of the announcements of this week and developments that seem to be unfolding here in the U.S., it's early days to understand exactly how these will play out. The executive order was sweeping and broad, but it also lack some specificity. And I think, certainly, as you listen to some of the members of the new administration comment, as they introduce this and answered some questions, I think they're looking to flesh out the details here in the coming weeks and months. And we certainly hope to be engaged in those conversations. 
Onshore in the Permian, we're weighted towards Texas more so than New Mexico. We're weighted toward private land more so than federal land. So we've got a fair degree of flexibility there, and that remains a highly attractive place for us to step capital up as we have the capacity to do so and the market conditions support it. 
So I think the Permian equation looks pretty similar to what it did at the time we made those statements. Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, I think we just have to see how this unfolds. And certainly, we like the projects that we're advancing here. And there's been, I think, general signaling that existing leases are secure. And we would presume the permitting that would go with those leases is also likely to proceed, but there are questions about this that I think we're just going to have to work our way through. 
So the risks are probably greater in the Gulf of Mexico. That was probably the lower part of the capital step-up that we might have envisioned at any rate. So I think we'll be able to manage our way through it. But stay tuned. We'll keep talking to you about this as we go forward. 
And of course, we've got options outside of the U.S. as well. And I think that's important to just bear in mind. If conditions in the U.S. become so onerous that it really disincentivizes investment, we've got other places where we can take those dollars."

So quickly, I'll reiterate that last year, we completed all module fabrication and all the transportation to get the modules through the Russian inland waterway systems through the Caspian unloaded into site. That's a really important milestone because those were risks that could have extended things had we not accomplished that. 
Progress overall in the project is about 81%. At this point, construction is about 60% complete. And as Pierre said, we've remobilized 20,000 workers to the project. We've plateaued at that number now because Tengiz is experiencing some of the same winter time uptick in coronavirus cases as you're seeing around the world. And so we're holding at 20,000 right now. We've had to quarantine certain portions of the workforce there for certain periods of time. We plan to restart further mobilization in February, and as Pierre said, targeting 26,000 by the end of the first quarter. 
We'll need to get some progress under our belt here to really see data on productivity. There's a lot of work that hasn't been done over the last -- going on a year now this has been impacting us. And so we're working on optimizing schedules and work plans, and understanding what the full impact of that is. It's hard to quantify that until we really are back at work. And certainly, in the winter time, things tend to slow down. Summer time, they'll pick up. And so we need to see our ability to sustain the workforce there to get work done productively and begin to chew into this backlog that has built up. And we'll keep you advised as to what that looks like. 
Jay will be with us at the Investor Day in 6 weeks, and he'll give you more detail at that point in time. I don't believe, by that point in time, we will have enough activity that we've seen where we'll be able to give you a highly reliable, specific update on cost and schedule. But we will be working on that, and we will get it to you when we've got enough data to give you something that we think is really useful."

And we're running the company to deliver financial results, and we let the production be what it is. 
Pierre gave you a guide for first quarter on Gorgon and Wheatstone. Wheatstone, for the rest of the year, should be back up to full capacity until a turnaround that begins late third quarter and runs into fourth, which we'd already planned and announced. And then, of course, at Gorgon, as Pierre mentioned, Train 3 will have inspection of these propane exchangers and a planned turnaround here in the second quarter of this year. 
So we will be lighter on Australia production than we're everything up and running for a full year, but a big part of that is planned turnaround activity and then there's an increment related to these repairs. 
In the Permian, there's 2 pieces to think about. Overall, Permian production will be up because we've added production from Noble. I think we've previously guided to kind of a 6% to 7% decline on the Chevron legacy production. That actually, today, looks like it will be a little less steep, maybe more like a 5% decline on Chevron legacy production in 2021 versus 2020. And that's with flat activity levels, running 5 rigs and 1 or 2 completion crews over the course of the year. And a little bit of this will be dependent upon what NOJV partners do. We ended the year last year with about 1.4 net rigs in the Permian on the NOJV, 7 gross. Our share, about 1.4. In January, it's up a little bit to about 2.5 net rigs, 10 gross. So there's a little bit of perhaps upside depending upon what non-operated JV partners do. But those are the key pieces there on both Australia and the Permian for production."

Thanks for recognizing we are still in the middle of a pandemic. Demand is still off in total. The global economy is functioning at below its capacity, and I think there's uncertainty out there. And certainly, oil prices today are supported in part by a unilateral move by Saudi Arabia to take 1 million barrels a day off the market. 
And so while we see inventories coming down and things trending back towards balance, that process is still underway. And so we want to be mindful of the uncertainties in the commodity price environment, and there could be some downside risk. 
So all that said, maybe 2 other points. One, while for the last 3 years, we announced a dividend increase in the first quarter. If you go further back over the last decade, it was never a first quarter increase; it actually was in other quarters. And so we don't necessarily have a pattern or a kind of a preference for when the dividend increase would occur. It's really based on our assessment of both short-term and long-term conditions, affordability, et cetera. And it's a Board decision, and the Board reviews that every quarter. 
So I hope our words, but more, our actions, over recent years have demonstrated to you and to our shareholders that the dividend is our #1 priority. We have not changed that. Others have. Others have made moves and reshuffled priorities and reset dividends and all the rest. We have not, and we were guided through this by those financial priorities. And we're very mindful of what our investors look for, why they hold our stock. And that's certainly something that will be part of our discussions as we go forward. 
Last comment to your hypothesis. If we stay in a $55 Brent world for all of this year, we're in a very strong position from a cash flow standpoint. Our breakeven is in the 40s. And so we'd be free cash flow positive, and that certainly is supportive of a dividend increase."

So we've prepared ourselves for a difficult set of market conditions, which is certainly what we saw last year. If -- and as I just mentioned to Phil, we can hold production flat to grow it at these capital levels. And so we're in a position to consider dividend increases and share buybacks if we see an economic recovery and commodity price environment that supports that. 
The fundamental premise that we outlined at $60 continues to be our premise, which is disciplined capital spending, a commitment to the dividend and a return of surplus capital above and beyond that to shareholders premised upon a strong balance sheet and the other things that we always talked about within our priorities.

We expect a lower carbon energy system in the future. 
I think you put your finger on one thing that needs to be watched is things that are supported by low interest rates, lots of investor enthusiasm and government policy may work in the short term. The question is when the tide starts flowing in other direction and when a day comes that interest rates are up, maybe investor perceptions shift a little bit and maybe government policy shifts a little bit, have we invested in things that can sustain in that environment? And I think that's -- we hope that they can. And we want to see the diversification of the energy mix to meet growing demand around the world and lower carbon. 
The last thing I'll say, I'm not sure this necessarily erodes energy demand as fast as some might believe -- or oil and gas demand as fast as some might believe. A lot of it is going into power that displaces coal. It, in some cases, creates capacity that is intermittent and can't be used all the time. It actually requires natural gas to create grid stability and supply reliability. And so there's not necessarily a one-for-one displacement on all of these investments, and that requires a thoughtful study of the whole energy system to really understand how it's evolving and how this capacity plays against all the other different sources of energy."

It's off differentially across different parts of the product barrel, which continues to stress the refining system. And then it's -- the amount that it's off varies quite a bit regionally, right? 
So in China, things are back to normal. By and large, other parts of Asia are pretty darn close. Europe, North America, not so much. So it's a gradually healing system, but it's different in different parts of the world. And refining markets are regional, and they're interconnected globally, but fundamentally, they start out regionally. 
So we're looking for improvement over the course of this year, but I wouldn't call it a full recovery. I think it's -- again, it's a gradual process. And we're certainly heavy on the West Coast and heavy in Asia. And so in Asia, things are, as I said, a little bit better. But on the West Coast, they're still recovering. 
So I think downstream in 2021, I would expect it to be better than it was in '20. But we're not anticipating pre-pandemic downstream earnings and performance this year."

And so that's only something we do at year-end in the fourth quarter. You're not doing it during the year because you don't know if you're going to go into prior year layers in the intervening quarters. So you don't want to be always doing this calculation. But our practice is at year-end, we revalue that. So you have -- think of it as inventory that had been valued at 42 during the course of the year.

And with the diversified portfolio we have across business lines and across geographies, we can mitigate market and regulatory risk that may emerge in one country because we've got a footprint that allows us to shift resources and capital allocation to other parts of our portfolio.
So for 140-plus years, this is what we've been doing. You're right. Things are evolving now, but they've been evolving for quite some time. And I think the capabilities we have in our organization, the honest dialogue we try to have with everybody about how do you meet the growing demand for energy and the desire to see the mix change and how do we continue to invest where we have advantages in both the existing core business and the emerging new businesses is what you will see us continue to do. 
At the core, I think the financial priorities stay the same. We are committed to the dividend. We're committed to organic reinvestment in order to support that dividend, and that can be a reinvestment across the entire spectrum of energy technologies. Maintaining a strong balance sheet. We've seen this last year how important that is. And then when we've got surplus cash after those first 3 needs to distribute that back to shareholders. That framework is intact and I don't see that changing."

So I've talked about -- we don't have a target net debt ratio range, but I've talked about a range between 20% and 25% is a good place to be over the cycle. We can be below that at times. We'd be heading up towards this range. If we're above it for some reason, I'd want to have confidence that we're heading down that range. So it's not a hard and fast target, but we're in a really good place with a leading balance sheet, low breakeven, as Mike talked about, and very well positioned. We also have asset sales that we provided some guidance on here on the call. 
In terms of the S&P, look, we work with them. It was an industry-wide call. I think our track record speaks for itself in terms of being disciplined with capital, protecting the balance sheet and being very progressive about the future of energy and our approach of higher returns, lower carbon. So I think that lines up with the rating agencies, but that's not something we control. That will be up to them. We're managing the company for long-term value, and we think we're doing a good job."

But fundamentally, we intend to continue to be very disciplined in the allocation of capital. 
Noble's assets in Israel have the big part of their capital spend behind them. Right now, there's capacity to grow production there with little or no incremental capital right now. And the nice thing is we bring some capabilities to bear here that might not have been in Noble's wheelhouse. 
So there's ways to take this gas further into regional markets. There's ways to take it into LNG, be it facilities that have [indiscernible] today that you go into or Noble had been looking at an FLNG concept. There are ways to take it to power markets and to power generation and then regional power distribution across borders. And there are opportunities to look at things like hydrogen and new energy technologies as well. 
So we have the financial strength and capacity to underwrite things larger than perhaps Noble could have. And some technical capability and relationship depth in some of these markets that should be an advantage. And so we'll look to use those to support the growth of the position in Israel. 
And then the broad capital allocation question, U.S. versus other countries, we're always thinking about that, always looking at that and drawn by returns and risk. And we'll continue to evaluate those things."

And both of those things matter to the investors that we speak to. And we're working hard on both fronts, and we've got to improve return on capital and demonstrate that we're going to do that. 
And at the same time, we also have to prepare for a lower carbon energy system in the future. And we're reducing the intensity of the energy we deliver today and making really good progress on that. And we'll continue to set new targets in that area because the world -- stepping on the hose of supply, through one way or another, doesn't really change demand. And so somehow demand will need to be met. And we think it should be met by those that can do it in a way that has the lowest carbon impact. 
We're increasing the production of renewable and lower carbon products for our customers, so they can reduce their energy intensity and carbon intensity. And then likewise, looking at these breakthrough technologies, and I mentioned a couple of them earlier. 
So every company in the industry, Doug, is searching for the right mix. There's not an empirically observable correct answer to this. And I think we're all working with our various stakeholders, right? Our Boards, our employees, our customers, the countries where we operate and the policy that we operate under, to manage both of these things. 
And look, energy is the lifeblood of the global economy. And reliable, affordable energy will be fundamental to the recovery from the pandemic in the short term. And in the longer term, it will be fundamental to lifting people out of poverty around the world, and we have to remember that.

And it hasn't earned its cost of capital. And the way out of that isn't by investing more capital. So being disciplined in our conventional business with capital, being disciplined in M&A, and being disciplined with the energy transition. As Jeanine asked, renewable energy products operate in commodity markets that have cycles up and down just like conventional products do. 
In terms of our decline, yes, Paul, I'm not sure. What I meant to say is that you'll see declines this year resulting from our capital last year because we did take capital down. But as you rightly point out, the decline, and we tried to put that on the best apples-to-apples basis, so again, we've got curtailment adjusted and then asset sales or contract expirations adjusted, which is a good view of our base and our shale and tight. And so it's a little more than a 2% decline. 
It is a big change because that would have been growth previously because you would have had Permian growing. That's how -- that was part of the reallocation. Mike showed a chart that said we are likely to invest $40 billion over the last year and this year, but $13 billion of it was Noble. So no doubt, our organic portfolio is not growing like it would have been previously because we've taken some capital out. 
But as you point out, it's a modest decline. It's because we're facility constrained in a lot of places. We have long-lived assets like in Australia LNG and Tengiz and offshore and even the declines in what's considered high-decline areas like the Permian, we were able to mitigate. And Mike said earlier that our Permian production is beating our guidance range, and we'll actually be up because of the Noble barrels that we added 2021 versus 2020 full year and if you adjust for curtailment. So it's a good story that we're able to be so efficient and mitigate declines. And I'm happy you picked up on that number."

Look, our RNG is very good from a carbon standpoint because you mitigate otherwise unmitigated methane emissions, and that's why it gets the very attractive CI factor. 
The CI factor has to be worth something. And because RNG, from a first cost basis, is more expensive than fossil natural gas. And so in markets where there's a policy framework that creates that financial connection to the low CI, it's attractive and economic. And that's where we're playing today. I would expect over time that those policy frameworks could expand for the reasons that underlie your question. And we are working with customers as well to help incentivize the adoption of CNG vehicles. 
We've got an initiative in California, where we'll subsidize truck owners to convert or buy new heavy-duty CNG engines in return for a supply agreement. And then we're working with a number of different distribution points to enable that to happen.

We don't have to go to ancient history books to know that the top line in our business is volatile. We've had not just '14, '15, you go '08, '09, you go late '90s. And so to have companies in our industry that don't have balance sheets that are built for something that we know occurs with some frequency is a capital structure that doesn't make a lot of sense. It transfers too much risk to equity holders, and that's partly reflected why the energy sector has underperformed other sectors for a while. So in that sense, I don't think we think of it differently. 
But to the second part of your first question, can we do developments differently? Absolutely. Can we size them to keep them full longer offshore? I mean, I think Mike has talked about the capital efficiency of our shale and tight, the flexibility of it. So undoubtedly, our capital efficiency is better than it ever has been. I mean, our ability to generate positive free cash flow from a dollar capital invested. We've talked about being very disciplined with our capital, which reinforces it. 
But the basic premise of operating in a set of commodity businesses that are volatile, that hasn't changed in the last several years. That's been the case for the 30 years I've been with the company.

And so we're always going to maintain a strong balance sheet. I gave kind of a range that we think is a good place to be over the cycle. And again, we can be below it, heading towards it or above it. 
So the balance sheet is, it's right in the middle of the range I've been talking about since I've been CFO. So there's no primary need on balance sheet. I mean, what's more -- the bigger driver is we're not at a full economic recovery here. And so getting control of the pandemic, getting the world's economies is growing again on a sustained path, that will be good for our business. 
Our breakeven is under 50. You can do the math. If oil prices are above 50 and if downstream margins improve, because that's a breakeven under 50, including pretty weak downstream margins, we'll have excess cash. And we'll look at our priorities and make decisions like we have in the past. 
Just as a reminder, we bought back shares 13 of the last 17 years. We bought back shares on average during that time period basically equivalent to the daily average. So we're pretty consistent returner of cash to shareholders in the form of sustaining growing dividends and share buybacks when we had excess cash."

This quarter, we had our best financial performance over the last year as the global economy recovers. Reported earnings were $1.4 billion and adjusted earnings were $1.7 billion or $0.90 per share. Included in the quarter were pension",885,"Thanks, Roderick. 
This quarter, we had our best financial performance over the last year as the global economy recovers. Reported earnings were $1.4 billion and adjusted earnings were $1.7 billion or $0.90 per share. Included in the quarter were pension settlement costs and legal reserves totaling $351 million. Pension settlement and curtailment costs will be a special item going forward. For comparability purposes, 2020 adjusted earnings were recast to exclude these costs. Also found in the appendix of this presentation is a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures. 
CapEx was down over 40% from a year ago, and we ended the quarter with a net debt ratio of 22.5%. For the first time since the pandemic, cash flow from operations, excluding working capital, exceeded our cash CapEx and dividend spending. Cash balances ended the quarter slightly higher due to timing considerations. We expect cash balances to come back down later in the year. 
Free cash flow, excluding working capital, was $3.4 billion, up significantly from last year and higher than the 2019 quarterly average. With oil prices back up to around 2019 levels and downstream earnings still recovering, higher free cash flow this quarter is driven by the change in cash CapEx, less than half of the 2019 quarterly average. 
Maintaining and growing our dividend remains our top financial priority. Earlier this week, Chevron's Board of Directors approved a $0.05 per share dividend increase, about 4%, that positions Chevron to extend our streak to 34 consecutive years of higher annual dividend per share payouts. Since 2005, Chevron's dividend per share has grown over 7% per year, beating the S&P 500 and more than 4x our peer average. 
When our first 3 financial priorities have been met, we also have a track record of repurchasing shares, 13 out of the past 17 years. As we look forward, we expect to begin the repurchase of shares when we're confident that we can sustain a buyback program for multiple years through the oil price cycle. When making this decision, we'll consider the likelihood of future sustained excess cash generation and the strength of the balance sheet. 
Adjusted first quarter earnings decreased about $700 million versus the same quarter last year. Upstream earnings increased on higher prices and downstream earnings declined on a swing in timing effects and lower margins and volumes resulting from the pandemic. Both segments had negative impacts from winter storm Uri. Other was down primarily due to employee benefit costs. Compared with last quarter, adjusted upstream earnings were up more than $1.4 billion due to higher prices. Downstream earnings increased primarily due to margins and timing effects, including the absence of last quarter's year-end inventory valuation adjustment of more than $100 million. Other was down in part due to employee benefit costs. 
Upstream production was down 3.5% from a year ago. The increase in production due to the Noble acquisition was more than offset by a number of factors, including declines, asset sales, winter storm Uri and OPEC+ curtailments. Winter storm Uri impacted both our upstream and downstream businesses, with earnings impact of about $300 million after-tax in the quarter. All upstream production has been restored and major downstream and chemical units have restarted. 
We also achieved first gas flow from the successful execution of the oil and gas modernization project in Equatorial Guinea. This project allows gas from the Allen field to be processed through existing onshore facilities. Finally, the company announced an agreement to acquire all of the publicly held common units in NBLX. This stock transaction is expected to close in mid-May. 
We continue to take action to advance a lower-carbon future. Last week, we announced an MoU with Toyota to work together to develop commercially viable, large-scale businesses in hydrogen. Also, we continue to invest in emerging low-carbon technologies, including announcing 5 venture investments this year in geothermal power, offshore wind and green ammonia. In addition, we're in the early stages of developing a bioenergy project with carbon capture and sequestration in Mendota, California. This plan is expected to convert agricultural waste biomass such as almond trees into a gas to generate electricity and sequester emissions of 300,000 tons of CO2 annually. 
Looking ahead, in the second quarter, we expect turnarounds and downtime to reduce production by 90,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, primarily in Australia at Gorgon Train 3, where the planned turnaround and repairs of propane vessels are underway. The impact from OPEC curtailments is estimated to be 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, primarily in Kazakhstan. In Kazakhstan, the FGP project recently placed the final module on its foundation. Remobilization of the construction workforce achieved about 95% of the end of first quarter objective. Further workforce additions are expected this quarter. 
In summary, it was a good quarter with our strongest financial performance in the year, continued progress towards advancing a lower-carbon future and a dividend increase while maintaining an industry-leading balance sheet. During last month's Investor Day, we shared our goal of higher returns, lower carbon. This quarter was another step in that direction. As we look forward to the next few quarters and the world gets better control of this virus, I'm confident that we'll continue to deliver stronger financial performance and help advance a lower carbon future. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Roderick."

It was a little higher this quarter. There was nothing operational except a winter storm Uri. It's really primarily due to some nonoperational items like accruals for legal reserves and taxes. Those are noncash in the quarter. But when we look at cash flow, excluding working capital, of course, we're taking out that working capital effect. So those kinds of accruals, which are charges result in a lower cash flow ex working capital. 
Point out, though, that our free cash flow in the first quarter of 2021 was higher than free cash flow in 2019, even though 2019 had much stronger downstream margins and similar oil prices, and that's primarily because of the cash CapEx. So I think you're doing the calculation right, the tricky thing about these cash flow breakevens is you don't hold everything else constant, all the other margins and indicators and then some of these timing effects on accruals."

So on our projections, we see pretty strong near-term free cash flow and the trajectory, it really meaningfully steps up in 2024, 2025, with Tengiz and some of your long-cycle gum projects starting up in the Permian. So I think to us, this suggests that for the buyback it makes a lot of sense to leg into a program, kind of similar to what you did in '18 and '19 versus a consistent amount per year, which I think was the last commentary before the pandemic, which I know changed a ton of things.

As I said on the prepared remarks, when we start a program, if and when we started a program, we'll want to sustain it for multiple years because we want to get it through the commodity price cycle. Shareholders feel differently about buybacks. There's a concern that we only buy back when our share price is high. That's a perception. That's not the reality because I just shared with you the actual numbers, but that's a perception that we have to deal with. So at the common ground we find is when we start a program, have confidence that we can sustain it for multiple years. And we're going to look to those 2 factors, the likelihood of future excess cash generation and the strength of the balance sheet to weather a down cycle in oil prices that we know is going to happen. So we're not yet on a sustained global economic recovery. We feel very good about where we are here in the United States and several other countries, but there are a number of countries where we're still working to get control of the virus. And so we think it's appropriate to increase the dividend, which is consistent with our financial priorities. We don't need -- we're not going to increase the capital this year, and we have tight guidance out 5 years. We have the balance sheet in a very good place. So yes, in the short term, any excess cash is going to go to the balance sheet. But over time, excess cash will be returned to shareholders in the form of fire dividends, like you saw us announced a couple of days ago, and in the form of buybacks over time."

We showed during our Investor Day that we're very capital-efficient and on our $14 billion to $16 billion, we, in fact, we're going to go production around 3%. We're not -- that's not an ambition of us to have production growth. It's an outcome of what's a very capital-efficient program. Jeanine mentioned we're investing to increase production at Tengiz. We don't have that production now, and that's $2.5 billion in the budget at Tengiz. So we have our eye on long-term value through this whole crisis. If you really step back to when this started about a year ago, we did hit short-term capital pretty hard. We kept our eye on long-term value. We didn't see the virtue in investing capital to add short-term production in a world that was going to be oversupply for some time period and arguably still is with OPEC+ barrels constrained. And again, we're not back to a full sustained economic recovery. But we preserve the options on long-term value. 
I'm very cognizant that we have a dividend obligation. We're one of the few companies that didn't cut the dividend. We're the only company that's increased the dividend. And really a dividend increase that averages 6% per year during a very difficult time, and we showed during our Investor Day that we have the capability to grow free cash flow or 10% per year over 5 years, and that's coming from Tengiz, which we'll see in a couple of years, and growth in the Permian when the world needs the barrel. So we're not going to chase short-term production. We don't see value in that. Our production guidance for this year is unchanged. It's 0% to 3%. You saw our reserve replacement numbers. The Noble acquisition undoubtedly has helped. Remember, we showed and Mike showed at the last quarter call that we've invested, actually the same amount that we expected post COVID as pre COVID. Pre COVID, we would have said $20 billion a year for last year and this year, about $40 billion. Organically, we're only going to do about 13 or 14 each year, that when you add in the 12 or 13 from Noble, it was exactly where we were pre COVID. So we are not under investing. We have to sustain and grow the enterprise, but we're doing it in a very capital-efficient way."

I think you're inferring that the guidance, particularly for Tengiz, will get better. We gave a co-lending guidance of $1 billion to $2 billion right now, we'd be at the low end of the range. And frankly, we could be at 0 depending on if prices stay where there are right now. So you should expect us to update that guidance at mid-year when we see a little more time with commodity prices. But clearly, at Tengiz, when we have prices over $60, that reduces the need for co-lending and might not require any. And again, you could see a dividend out of Tengiz. That's a decision for the TCO shareholders to make, but we have not had a dividend now for, I think, 2 or 3 years. And so that would also be positive. 
In terms of affiliates, I mean that cash flow line again is the difference between earnings from affiliates and the dividends. The dividends were about flat between fourth quarter and this quarter. So that's not a variance on the cash flow. But you're right that there's some timing in that, some of the winter storm Uri effects kind of factor into CPChem.

And when I cited also a big milestone was getting the last of 86 modules onto foundation. So we're still making very good progress. We are managing through a pandemic. We have all the safeguards in place. They're working. We have a very low rate of positive cases right now. We've also started a vaccination program at Tengiz. It includes both the project and the producing operations staff. So it's not just for the project, also for the base operations. We've been allocated about 10,000 doses and administered already 7,000. Future vaccinations, though, will depend on more allocations from the Republic of Kazakhstan. This is not a company program. We're doing it with the government and are allocated by the government in Kazakhstan. 
So to answer your question, at this time, there's more pressure on schedule than costs. We have a backlog of work because of the demobilization last year and having to isolate work teams at times when we do have a positive case. It's possible but hard to fully make up the schedule. We also have incurred higher costs as a result of COVID, but we've had some cost efficiencies and some foreign exchange benefits that may be able to offset the higher cost. So as we've said in the past, we need to demonstrate that we can mobilize, fully remobilize, stay at full numbers, meet productivity targets and achieve our milestones while managing through a pandemic, and the spring and summer work campaigns are very important to give us the data that will help us get a reliable update on cost and schedule."

And I think one of the things that stood out in your recent Investor Day was the fact that even at a much lower capital spending level, you were still able to achieve a similar level of growth in the Permian over the next 2 years, deferred slightly versus pre-COVID plans, but still attractive growth there. As you think about the resumption of activity to facilitate that growth here over the next few years, can you talk a little bit about the cadence and timing or from a market standpoint, what signals in terms of oil prices or otherwise that you need to see to begin increasing activity there to resume that planned production ramp?"

The first is the global economy on a sustained path to recovery. Not quite there yet. Clearly optimistic here in the United States with high vaccination rates on the stimulus package, a few other countries, but again, a number of countries don't have control over virus. So we need to get on a sustained path of economic recovery. The second is we need to see OPEC+ barrels, get back into the market. We're starting to see that. We need to have clarity on what actions they're going to take, but there's still a lot of production that is being curtailed. And then the third, and I think the third condition has been largely met. Its inventory are back to near normal. And so the inventory surplus for the most part, has been worked off. So I'd say one of the 3 conditions. 
Now that's for us to increase CapEx, not this year, our budget is fixed this year, $14 billion, but within the $14 billion to $16 billion 5-year guidance that we talked about. So we're still talking about a modest a modest increase. In terms of the Permian, everything is going very well there. The first quarter production was clearly impacted by winter storm Uri. That's about 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day for the quarter. But if you take that out, production, I think, looks good. Our declines we shared last second quarter, Jay shared that production could decline 6% to 7% if we stayed at low activity levels. It's probably a little bit better than that. It might be closer to 5%. But undoubtedly, we're at the low investment levels that we're doing right now. We'll see some declines. That is okay. That is the correct response to an oversupplied market. In particular, again, when we're keeping our eye on long-term value. 
So what you could see later this year is we could bring -- right now, operated, we have 5 rigs, 2 completion crews. Our net non-op is a similar rig count. Certainly, we could bring back a completion crew later this year and that would help us reduce some of our drilled and uncompleted wells. But in terms of getting on the trajectory, that we showed at our Investor Day, there's still time. I mean, that outlook kind of factored in that we would still be in this kind of not full recovery at this point in time. And then it ramps up over next year and the year after that. So can we do it faster? We absolutely can. Can we hold it where we're at here longer if necessary? We can. It's very flexible. It's the appropriate response. But the long-term value and the point, I think, of your question is there, right, the 1 million barrels a day that we showed in 2025, but more importantly, highly accretive to returns, strong free cash flow, right, free cash flow positive last year, growing free cash flow. So it's a fantastic position we have. We're advantaged because of the royalty. We intend to invest in there, but we're going to do it at the right time."

Can you talk a little bit more about Chevron's strategy for transitioning some of the investments and opportunities you've been able to capture so far into new growth ventures over time, including and a monetization strategy or scaling strategy for some of the venture investments that you've talked about here in your prepared remarks?"

The first is to make the oil and gas that we produce as low carbon as we can. We put out 2028 targets that have a 35% reduction. We think we're top quartile, we'll stay top quartile. And we showed a slide that say, we go beyond that and get the carbon intensity down into the mid-teens in terms of kilograms per barrels of oil equivalent. So that's the first. That's really done in the segments. That's really where the work gets done. 
The second is to increase renewable energy alongside our conventional products. So renewable natural gas sold along with conventional natural gas, renewable diesel sold alongside our conventional diesel. We've seen -- we're going to coke process at our LA refinery later this year, biofeed along with conventional feed and make renewable products have renewable diesel biodiesel at more than half of our service stations in the United States. So good progress there. 
And then the third is to grow low-carbon businesses. And that's exactly that's hydrogen carbon capture. The venture investments are important, and they are really making sure we're staying connected to all the latest technology. But we intend to do exactly what you say is grow these businesses. So let me talk about project Mendota in California. It's in partnership with Schlumberger and Microsoft. It's going to capture the emissions from agricultural waste. So they burn almond trees after a certain number of productive seasons. Normally, those emissions just go to the atmosphere. This project would capture those emissions, converted into a synthetic gas that can then generate power and use that power to compress the CO2 and inject it in the ground and then sell excess power into the grid. And that's a project that's in now front-end engineering and design. We're looking at another carbon capture pilot with Savante in Bakersfield. So the venture investment is an enabler to growing hydrogen and carbon capture business. That's exactly what we intend to do over time. These are nascent businesses require lots of partnerships, but we're going to be a player in it."

Good -- very happy with the talent from the Noble employees that have come across, DJ Basin, Eastern Med. So again, what was a very good deal looks even better now. 
Now look, it's a challenge to obviously replicate that. We'll always be looking. We have a very high bar. Noble got over the bar with the quality assets and the value that we saw, we don't need to do an acquisition. To Doug's earlier question, we are sustaining and growing this enterprise. I'm very cognizant of that. Again, we need to do that to sustain and grow the dividend. At the same time, there's times inorganic can enhance the company. And so if we see something that will make that Investor Day story we told even better, then we'll pursue it. I do think industry consolidation will continue. Undoubtedly, the valuations have moved from back where we were in July. It's a long game. We're very patient. And again, we don't need to do a transaction."

The second question that if we look at some of the smaller persons, in the last E&P, in the last 12 months, I think one of the movement is into the variable dividend, which is never, I think, for the major oil companies, such as you guys, you guys always use share buyback. So just curious that internally that have the Board and management even consider the variable dividend versus buyback to see which is a better way to return cash to the shareholders?"

I'll answer your second question first. Of course, we pay close attention to what everybody does. We have not been convinced that there's a better cash return story than what we do, which is a steadily growing dividend, again, with a 4% increase announced, 34th consecutive year of growing dividends, 7% compounded rate for the last 15 years and a ratable buyback program, 13 out of 17 years, very close to the actual ratable price during that whole time. So we talk to our shareholders all the time. I think our shareholders support our framework. But of course, we'll keep an open mind, but we don't see the value in it. 
Look, I think those approaches are gaining favor in part because dividends have been cut by other companies and other actions that have not been as consistent, as predictable and as reliable as what we've done over that track record of 34 years on the dividend and 17 years on the buyback. If you go to California policy, there's -- I'm not sure exactly which one you're referring to. There's an internal combustion I don't know if it's a ban or a rule-making proposal to reduce that by, I think, 2035. There's also a -- the governor requested the rule-makers to look at rules on hydraulic fracturing. What I can say is that, certainly, on hydraulic fracturing has been done safely in California under comprehensive regulations for a long time. It's been done safely elsewhere in the United States and safely all around the world. And I think when policies restrict supply, it just moves energy production to jurisdictions that likely have less regulation. And it also moves the jobs and the government revenues and increases the trade debt. And I'll say the jobs in oil and gas are good paying jobs you can raise a family on. So in terms of our operations, if some sort of hydraulic fracturing ban was implemented through the rule-making process, it would not be material to Chevron's upstream operations in California. It impacts future drilling at a field that represents less than 10% of our production. Of course, we'll work with Governor Newsom though to make those rules as advance the environmental objectives while continuing to support the jobs and the economic benefits of our industry. 
In terms of any kind of internal combustion engine band, what I'd say is we support the Paris agreement. We support a price on carbon. Light passenger vehicles represent less than 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions. So let's make sure we also focus on the other 90%. But if you want to look at to EVs and transportation, put a price on carbon and let the technologies compete in the marketplace."

In terms of PZ, that ramp up continues very well. It's that 60,000 barrels a day, our share, pre, the shut-in was about 80,000.

That's the fourth largest source of greenhouse gas emissions globally, right?

So agriculture and land use is an important source of greenhouse gas emissions. You've seen our work in renewable natural gas, which again captures the methane from dairy cows. And so that's a worthwhile area for us to look into. So the agricultural waste is just that, that's what happens is it gets burned, and those emissions go to the atmosphere. And so partnering with Schlumberger and Microsoft that's a worthwhile project to capture an emission that otherwise we ended the atmosphere or not or be burned, emitted to the atmosphere and converting it and sequestering essentially in generating some excess power. 
So it's early days. You're right, it's all policy-enabled, including federal policy in California state policy. We're doing the front engineering, a lot of work to do, but I think you're getting the right idea is that we're looking for projects that are higher return, lower carbon.

So I'm not going to give you a hard target. This is -- we're going to use judgment. Because there's judgment on future excess cash generation. This is our first quarter actually with current excess cash generation. We expect the next couple of quarters to be potentially even better because you've got oil prices above 60, refining and chemicals margins much stronger. So it could be even better. 
At the same time, we don't have a sustained global economic recovery. So it's reasonable for us to be cautious. We want to be confident that when we start the program, we're going to continue it for multiple years and we can sustain it through an oil price cycle. So I know that folks want a formula or a trigger. I know some of our competitors have those numbers. We're going to use judgment. And we're going to consider what we see in front of us in terms of the likelihood of future excess cash generation. We're going to want the balance sheet in a strong enough position that if oil prices cycle down, we can continue the buyback program, relying on the balance sheet. Our balance sheet is very strong right now. But yes, in the short term, excess cash is going to go to the balance sheet. That's kind of by definition, but it also serves the dual-purpose of lowering our net debt ratio and putting us in a better position for when we start if and when we start a buyback program."

I was leading the business at that point in time because we'd only had one refinery",338,"Yes. So again, I won't comment specifically on that report. The refinery in the Gulf Coast is a very small acquisition that we made was something that I had foreshadowed. I was leading the business at that point in time because we'd only had one refinery in the Gulf Coast region. We were, I think, the only company really, major company with that setup. We did not -- we were on the eastern side of the Gulf Coast in Mississippi. And so our retail in Texas was supplied by third-party barrels. So we had talked about that. We didn't have to do that, but when the opportunity came, and that transaction is kind of working as we envision. 
So on the West Coast, we're at a much different place. We have a 2-refinery system. We have a leading brand. Really strong infrastructure. We are -- we're growing a little bit in Mexico, some of our retail volumes there. So I'd just say we're in a strong position on the West Coast. And in the Gulf Coast, we were also strong, but we felt we could make us even better by getting something on the eastern side and the Texas side, and we did that. So I wouldn't read too much into it. We did a small Australia retail fuels, which again was enabled our value chain out of Asia. So there's been some very targeted modest acquisitions in the refining business and retail business. But for the most part, you know that we're -- we have a focused geographic footprint, very competitive business. As we look forward, look, it's going to get better. Winter storm Uri, as difficult as that event was for everybody in the region, one of the outcomes was it tightened inventories for fuels and especially for chemicals. So those margins have recovered a little more quickly than they otherwise would have. And we think the next couple of quarters are going to be good, and we're well positioned in our downstream and chemicals business."

Can you just comment on specifically your markets? You're focused on California and kind of the Asia Pacific region, and it seems like vaccine deployment and return to normalcy is kind of lagging there. So when you look across your portfolio, do you see kind of different pace of margin improvement and return to normal? And do you expect your refining results to reflect that throughout the year? And then secondly, on the Toyota MoU you announced, there was a comment in the press release mentioning that the MoU and the pursuit of hydrogen will leverage existing market positions and assets that Chevron has. Can you maybe elaborate on that comment a bit, what market positions or assets or at least the types of market positions and assets that the MoU will leverage?"

It's to work together to grow the hydrogen business in passenger vehicles and heavy duty. You'd expect that the focus would be around California, which makes sense. And the reference to assets is like hydrogen fuel dispensing at some of our service stations. So that's the comment. More to come. We're very excited to partner with a great company like Toyota on the fuel cell technology, and you'll hear more over time. 
In terms of the regional differences, you're absolutely right, there are regional differences. If I contrast first, West Coast and Gulf Coast, Gulf Coast is a little bit stronger. I mean, Florida looks really pretty much back to normal. West Coast, on track with gasoline and diesel really, has come on strong now. The Southern California resurgence earlier this winter has worked its way through. The rates are very low and you're seeing that come back. Domestic travel, strong, again, in the Gulf Coast region, seeing it come back in California. What's a little bit weaker we're seeing on the West Coast is because the big airports in San Francisco and LA are such -- are so heavy for international travel. That clearly is lagging. Now hopefully, it's coming soon after domestic travel. We saw the announcement in Europe that fully vaccinated Americans could go to Europe this summer. So we'll just see that's hopefully not too far behind. 
We saw in China and Australia, the domestic travel fully recovered once those countries got their arms around the virus. So I'm confident domestic travel will come back very quickly here in this country. But again, international travel will lag a little bit, and we'll just see. Asia, Asia is a big -- it varies. Some countries have much better control of virus than others. And then the excess -- some of the new refining capacity in China becomes relevant there. So the U.S. has strengthened, for sure, as I said earlier with winter storm, Yuri, and you're seeing that in petrochemicals to it. So I do think second quarter, third quarter are going to look better. It is a global market. So these markets do stay connected. Asia has also recovered somewhat, and we'll see where the results are over the next few quarters."

So as you know, you feed a lot of questions about your organic maintenance capital. And then anything inorganic is supposed to be accretive to some metric, whatever people choose. But I think is it fair to say that with Noble, what we're seeing is a flexible strategy to reserve and production management? If you're generating surplus cash, you're building capacity for inorganic adds to manage sustainability, and we should think about it as kind of a multifaceted approach instead of this siloed point of view that people seem to be shoehorning you into?

And I think you saw that in a lot of the reserve replacements and other numbers and you saw that in our Investor Day, our ability to basically get pretty close to the same production guidance, 5 years out this year versus where we were last year, is a reflection of greater capital efficiency, but also the Noble transaction. Now so that, I agree with you. 
Whether we do that again or not, that's a separate question. Again, we don't have to do that. We can sustain and grow the enterprise. Our sustaining CapEx on the upstream side, excluding exploration, how we've defined it is about $9 billion. So we are above that. Of course, we are investing in Tengiz, which we know is going to result in higher production and much stronger higher cash flow. So again, we showed a free cash flow growing 10% per year. So I do understand all the questions. I think you are hitting it. It's a little bit focusing on half of the story. We got to look at the whole story. Of course, we're managing the whole company and again, keeping an eye on long-term value."

This quarter, we had our best financial performance over last year as the global economy recovers. Reported earnings were $1.4 billion and adjusted earnings were $1.7 billion or $0.90 per share. Included in the quarter were pension settl",884,"Thanks, Roderick. This quarter, we had our best financial performance over last year as the global economy recovers. Reported earnings were $1.4 billion and adjusted earnings were $1.7 billion or $0.90 per share. Included in the quarter were pension settlement costs and legal reserves totaling $351 million. Pension settlement and curtailment costs will be a special item going forward. For comparability purposes, 2020 adjusted earnings were recast to exclude these costs. Also found in the appendix of this presentation is a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures.
CapEx was down over 40% from a year ago, and we ended the quarter with a net debt ratio of 22.5%. For the first time since the pandemic, cash flow from operations, excluding working capital, exceeded our cash CapEx and dividend spending. Cash balances ended the quarter slightly higher due to timing considerations. We expect cash balances to come back down later in the year.
Free cash flow, excluding working capital, was $3.4 billion, up significantly from last year and higher than the 2019 quarterly average. With oil prices back up to around 2019 levels and downstream earnings still recovering, higher free cash flow this quarter is driven by the change in cash CapEx, less than half of the 2019 quarterly average.
Maintaining and growing our dividend remains our top financial priority. Earlier this week, Chevron's Board of Directors approved a $0.05 per share dividend increase, about 4%, that positions Chevron to extend our streak to 34 consecutive years of higher annual dividend per share payouts. Since 2005, Chevron's dividend per share has grown over 7% per year, beating the S&P 500 and more than 4x our peer average.
When our first 3 financial priorities have been met, we also have a track record of repurchasing shares, 13 out of the past 17 years. As we look forward, we expect to begin the repurchase of shares when we're confident that we can sustain a buyback program for multiple years through the oil price cycle. When making this decision, we'll consider the likelihood of future sustained excess cash generation and the strength of the balance sheet.
Adjusted first quarter earnings decreased about $700 million versus the same quarter last year. Upstream earnings increased on higher prices and downstream earnings declined on a swing in timing effects and lower margins and volumes resulting from the pandemic. Both segments had negative impacts from winter storm Uri. Other was down primarily due to employee benefit costs. Compared with last quarter, adjusted upstream earnings were up more than $1.4 billion due to higher prices. Downstream earnings increased primarily due to margins and timing effects, including the absence of last quarter's year-end inventory valuation adjustment of more than $100 million. Other was down in part due to employee benefit costs.
Upstream production was down 3.5% from a year ago. The increase in production due to the Noble acquisition was more than offset by a number of factors, including declines, asset sales, winter storm Uri and OPEC+ curtailments. Winter storm Uri impacted both our upstream and downstream businesses, with earnings impact of about $300 million after-tax in the quarter. All upstream production has been restored and major downstream and chemical units have restarted.
We also achieved first gas flow from the successful execution of the oil and gas modernization project in Equatorial Guinea. This project allows gas from the Alen field to be processed through existing onshore facilities. Finally, the company announced an agreement to acquire all of the publicly held common units in NBLX. This stock transaction is expected to close in mid-May.
We continue to take action to advance a lower-carbon future. Last week, we announced an MoU with Toyota to work together to develop commercially viable, large-scale businesses in hydrogen. Also, we continue to invest in emerging low-carbon technologies, including announcing 5 venture investments this year in geothermal power, offshore wind and green ammonia. In addition, we're in the early stages of developing a bioenergy project with carbon capture and sequestration in Mendota, California. This plan is expected to convert agricultural waste biomass such as almond trees into a gas to generate electricity and sequester emissions of 300,000 tons of CO2 annually.
Looking ahead, in the second quarter, we expect turnarounds and downtime to reduce production by 90,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, primarily in Australia at Gorgon Train 3, where the planned turnaround and repairs of propane vessels are underway. The impact from OPEC curtailments is estimated to be 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, primarily in Kazakhstan. In Kazakhstan, the FGP project recently placed the final module on its foundation. Remobilization of the construction workforce achieved about 95% of the end of first quarter objective. Further workforce additions are expected this quarter.
In summary, it was a good quarter with our strongest financial performance in the year, continued progress towards advancing a lower-carbon future and a dividend increase while maintaining an industry-leading balance sheet. During last month's Investor Day, we shared our goal of higher returns, lower carbon. This quarter was another step in that direction. As we look forward to the next few quarters and the world gets better control of this virus, I'm confident that we'll continue to deliver stronger financial performance and help advance a lower carbon future.
With that, I'll turn it over to Roderick."

It was a little higher this quarter. There was nothing operational except a winter storm Uri. It's really primarily due to some nonoperational items like accruals for legal reserves and taxes. Those are noncash in the quarter. But when we look at cash flow, excluding working capital, of course, we're taking out that working capital effect. So those kinds of accruals, which are charges result in a lower cash flow ex working capital.
Point out, though, that our free cash flow in the first quarter of 2021 was higher than free cash flow in 2019, even though 2019 had much stronger downstream margins and similar oil prices, and that's primarily because of the cash CapEx. So I think you're doing the calculation right, the tricky thing about these cash flow breakevens is you don't hold everything else constant, all the other margins and indicators and then some of these timing effects on accruals."

So on our projections, we see pretty strong near term free cash flow and the trajectory, it really meaningfully steps up in 2024, 2025, with Tengiz and some of your long-cycle ground projects starting up in the Permian. So I think to us, this suggests that for the buyback it makes a lot of sense to leg into a program, kind of similar to what you did in '18 and '19 versus a consistent amount per year, which I think was the last commentary before the pandemic, which I know changed a ton of things. So can you provide any thoughts on how you envision the buyback getting reinstated?"

As I said on the prepared remarks, when we start a program, if and when we start a program, we'll want to sustain it for multiple years because we want to get it through the commodity price cycle. Shareholders feel differently about buybacks. There's a concern that we only buy back when our share price is high. That's a perception. That's not the reality because I just shared with you the actual numbers, but that's a perception that we have to deal with.
So at the common ground we find is when we start a program, have confidence that we can sustain it for multiple years. And we're going to look to those 2 factors, the likelihood of future excess cash generation and the strength of the balance sheet to weather a down cycle in oil prices that we know is going to happen. So we're not yet on a sustained global economic recovery. We feel very good about where we are here in the United States and several other countries, but there are a number of countries where we're still working to get control of the virus. And so we think it's appropriate to increase the dividend, which is consistent with our financial priorities.
We don't need -- we're not going to increase the capital this year, and we have tight guidance out 5 years. We have the balance sheet in a very good place. So yes, in the short term, any excess cash is going to go to the balance sheet. But over time, excess cash will be returned to shareholders in the form of fire dividends, like you saw us announced a couple of days ago, and in the form of buybacks over time."

We showed during our Investor Day that we're very capital-efficient and on our $14 billion to $16 billion, we, in fact, are going to go production around 3%. We're not -- that's not an ambition of us to have production growth. It's an outcome of what's a very capital-efficient program. Jeanine mentioned we're investing to increase production at Tengiz. We don't have that production now, and that's $2.5 billion in the budget at Tengiz.
So we have our eye on long-term value through this whole crisis. If you really step back to when this started about a year ago, we did hit short-term capital pretty hard. We kept our eye on long-term value. We didn't see the virtue in investing capital to add short-term production in a world that was going to be oversupply for some time period and arguably still is with OPEC+ barrels constrained. And again, we're not back to a full sustained economic recovery. But we preserve the options on long-term value.
I'm very cognizant that we have a dividend obligation. We're one of the few companies that didn't cut the dividend. We're the only company that's increased the dividend. And really a dividend increase that averages 6% per year during a very difficult time, and we showed during our Investor Day that we have the capability to grow free cash flow 10% per year over 5 years, and that's coming from Tengiz, which we'll see in a couple of years, and growth in the Permian when the world needs the barrel. So we're not going to chase short-term production. We don't see value in that.
Our production guidance for this year is unchanged. It's 0% to 3%. You saw our reserve replacement numbers. The Noble acquisition undoubtedly has helped. Remember, we showed and Mike showed at the last quarter call that we've invested, actually the same amount that we expected post COVID as pre COVID. Pre COVID, we would have said $20 billion a year for last year and this year, about $40 billion. Organically, we're only going to do about $13 billion or $14 billion each year, that when you add in the $12 billion or $13 billion from Noble, it was exactly where we were pre COVID. So we are not under investing. We have to sustain and grow the enterprise, but we're doing it in a very capital-efficient way."

You saw a small inorganic acquisition in the first quarter number, so that can be different going forward. But from an organic perspective, we're going to stick with the budget.

I think you're inferring that the guidance, particularly for Tengiz, will get better. We gave a co-lending guidance of $1 billion to $2 billion. Right now, we'd be at the low end of the range. And frankly, we could be at 0 depending on if prices stay where there are right now. So you should expect us to update that guidance at mid-year when we see a little more time with commodity prices. But clearly, at Tengiz, when we have prices over $60, that reduces the need for co-lending and might not require any. And again, you could see a dividend out of Tengiz. That's a decision for the TCO shareholders to make, but we have not had a dividend now for, I think, 2 or 3 years. And so that would also be positive.
In terms of affiliates, I mean that cash flow line again is the difference between earnings from affiliates and the dividends. The dividends were about flat between fourth quarter and this quarter. So that's not a variance on the cash flow. But you're right that there's some timing in that, some of the winter storm Uri effects kind of factor into CPChem. Again, we'll update that guidance when we get to midyear."

We remobilized to 25,000, just short of our 26,000 first quarter objective than you saw where we plan to go in the second quarter. And when I cited also a big milestone was getting the last of 86 modules on to foundation. So we're still making very good progress. We are managing through a pandemic. We have all the safeguards in place. They're working. We have a very low rate of positive cases right now. We've also started a vaccination program at Tengiz. It includes both the project and the producing operations staff. So it's not just for the project, also for the base operations. We've been allocated about 10,000 doses and administered already 7,000. Future vaccinations, though, will depend on more allocations from the Republic of Kazakhstan. This is not a company program. We're doing it with the government and are allocated by the government in Kazakhstan.
So to answer your question, at this time, there's more pressure on schedule than costs. We have a backlog of work because of the demobilization last year and having to isolate work teams at times when we do have a positive case. It's possible but hard to fully make up the schedule. We also have incurred higher costs as a result of COVID, but we've had some cost efficiencies and some foreign exchange benefits that may be able to offset the higher cost.
So as we've said in the past, we need to demonstrate that we can remobilize, fully remobilize, stay at full numbers, meet productivity targets and achieve our milestones while managing through a pandemic, and the spring and summer work campaigns are very important to give us the data that will help us get a reliable update on cost and schedule."

As you think about the resumption of activity to facilitate that growth here over the next few years, can you talk a little bit about the cadence and timing or from a market standpoint, what signals in terms of oil prices or otherwise that you need to see to begin increasing activity there to resume that planned production ramp?"

We're focused on the fundamentals. We've been looking into 3 indicators. The first is the global economy on a sustained path to recovery. Not quite there yet. Clearly optimistic here in the United States with high vaccination rates on the stimulus package, a few other countries, but again, a number of countries don't have control over virus. So we need to get on a sustained path of economic recovery.
The second is we need to see OPEC+ barrels, get back into the market. We're starting to see that. We need to have clarity on what actions they're going to take, but there's still a lot of production that is being curtailed. And then the third -- and I think the third condition has been largely met. Its inventory are back to near normal. And so the inventory surplus for the most part has been worked off. So I'd say one of the 3 conditions.
Now that's for us to increase CapEx, not this year, our budget is fixed this year, $14 billion, but within the $14 billion to $16 billion 5-year guidance that we talked about. So we're still talking about a modest increase. In terms of the Permian, everything is going very well there. The first quarter production was clearly impacted by winter storm Uri. That's about 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day for the quarter. But if you take that out, production, I think, looks good.
Our declines we shared last second quarter, Jay shared that production could decline 6% to 7% if we stayed at low activity levels. It's probably a little bit better than that. It might be closer to 5%. But undoubtedly, we're at the low investment levels that we're doing right now. We'll see some declines. That is okay. That is the correct response to an oversupplied market. In particular, again, when we're keeping our eye on long-term value.
So what you could see later this year is we could bring -- right now, operated, we have 5 rigs, 2 completion crews. Our net non-op is a similar rig count. Certainly, we could bring back a completion crew later this year and that would help us reduce some of our drilled and uncompleted wells. But in terms of getting on the trajectory, that we showed at our Investor Day, there's still time. I mean, that outlook kind of factored in that we would still be in this kind of not full recovery at this point in time. And then it ramps up over next year and the year after that.
So can we do it faster? We absolutely can. Can we hold it where we're at here longer if necessary? We can. It's very flexible. It's the appropriate response. But the long-term value and the point, I think, of your question is there, right, the 1 million barrels a day that we showed in 2025, but more importantly, highly accretive to returns, strong free cash flow, right, free cash flow positive last year, growing free cash flow. So it's a fantastic position we have. We're advantaged because of the royalty. We intend to invest in there, but we're going to do it at the right time."

Can you talk a little bit more about Chevron's strategy for transitioning some of the investments and opportunities you've been able to capture so far into new growth ventures over time, including and a monetization strategy or scaling strategy for some of the venture investments that you've talked about here in your prepared remarks?"

The first is to make the oil and gas that we produce as low carbon as we can. We put out 2028 targets that have a 35% reduction. We think we're top quartile, we'll stay top quartile. And we showed a slide that say, we go beyond that and get the carbon intensity down into the mid-teens in terms of kilograms per barrels of oil equivalent. So that's the first. That's really done in the segments. That's really where the work gets done.
The second is to increase renewable energy alongside our conventional products. So renewable natural gas sold along with conventional natural gas, renewable diesel sold alongside our conventional diesel. We've seen -- we're going to coke process at our LA refinery later this year, biofeed along with conventional feed and make renewable products, have renewable diesel biodiesel at more than half of our service stations in the United States. So good progress there.
And then the third is to grow low-carbon businesses. And that's exactly that's hydrogen carbon capture. The venture investments are important, and they are really making sure we're staying connected to all the latest technology. But we intend to do exactly what you say is grow these businesses.
So let me talk about project Mendota in California. It's in partnership with Schlumberger and Microsoft. It's going to capture the emissions from agricultural waste. So they burn almond trees after a certain number of productive seasons. Normally, those emissions just go to the atmosphere. This project would capture those emissions, converted into a synthetic gas that can then generate power and use that power to compress the CO2 and inject it in the ground and then sell excess power into the grid. And that's a project that's in now front-end engineering and design.
We're looking at another carbon capture pilot with Savante in Bakersfield. So the venture investment is an enabler to growing hydrogen and carbon capture business. That's exactly what we intend to do over time. These are nascent businesses require lots of partnerships, but we're going to be a player in it."

Good -- very happy with the talent from the Noble employees that have come across, DJ Basin, Eastern Med. So again, what was a very good deal looks even better now.
Now look, it's a challenge to obviously replicate that. We'll always be looking. We have a very high bar. Noble got over the bar with the quality assets and the value that we saw, we don't need to do an acquisition. To Doug's earlier question, we are sustaining and growing this enterprise. I'm very cognizant of that. Again, we need to do that to sustain and grow the dividend. At the same time, there's times inorganic can enhance the company. And so if we see something that will make that Investor Day story we told even better, then we'll pursue it. I do think industry consolidation will continue. Undoubtedly, the valuations have moved from back where we were in July. It's a long game. We're very patient. And again, we don't need to do a transaction."

The second question that if we look at some of the smaller persons, in the last E&P, in the last 12 months, I think one of the movement is into the variable dividend, which is never, I think, for the major oil companies, such as you guys, you guys always use share buyback. So just curious that internally that have the Board and management even consider the variable dividend versus buyback to see which is a better way to return cash to the shareholders?"

I'll answer your second question first. Of course, we pay close attention to what everybody does. We have not been convinced that there's a better cash return story than what we do, which is a steadily growing dividend, again, with a 4% increase announced, 34th consecutive year of growing dividends, 7% compounded rate for the last 15 years and a ratable buyback program, 13 out of 17 years, very close to the actual ratable price during that whole time. So we talk to our shareholders all the time. I think our shareholders support our framework. But of course, we'll keep an open mind, but we don't see the value in it.
Look, I think those approaches are gaining favor in part because dividends have been cut by other companies and other actions that have not been as consistent, as predictable and as reliable as what we've done over that track record of 34 years on the dividend and 17 years on the buyback.
If you go to California policy, there's -- I'm not sure exactly which one you're referring to. There's an internal combustion. I don't know if it's a ban or a rule-making proposal to reduce that by, I think, 2035. There's also a -- the governor requested the rule-makers to look at rules on hydraulic fracturing. What I can say is that, certainly, on hydraulic fracturing has been done safely in California under comprehensive regulations for a long time. It's been done safely elsewhere in the United States and safely all around the world. And I think when policies restrict supply, it just moves energy production to jurisdictions that likely have less regulation. And it also moves the jobs and the government revenues and increases the trade debt. And I'll say the jobs in oil and gas are good paying jobs you can raise a family on.
So in terms of our operations, if some sort of hydraulic fracturing ban was implemented through the rule-making process, it would not be material to Chevron's upstream operations in California. It impacts future drilling at a field that represents less than 10% of our production. Of course, we'll work with Governor Newsom though to make those rules as advance the environmental objectives while continuing to support the jobs and the economic benefits of our industry.
In terms of any kind of internal combustion engine, there what I'd say is we support the Paris agreement. We support a price on carbon. Light passenger vehicles represent less than 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions. So let's make sure we also focus on the other 90%. But if you want to look at to EVs and transportation, put a price on carbon and let the technologies compete in the marketplace."

Gorgon in the first quarter, we had some fairly significant gas prices. You're typically more contracted than the spot market. I was just wondering how that performed at a time where you were -- probably weren't able to participate much in the spot market. I was just curious how you covered the contracted side and how you think about that a little bit going forward?
And then the other question I had hasn't gotten much play recently, but as part of the curtailments within OPEC+, how the neutral zone restart is going, what the impacts are there for you?"

So on Australia, we've said that with 1 train down at Gorgon, which has been largely the case since midyear last year, if you think of our Australia system is having 5 trains, and so 4 out of 5 trains have been operating.

So on Australia, we've said that with 1 train down at Gorgon, which has been largely the case since midyear last year, if you think of our Australia system is having 5 trains, and so 4 out of 5 trains have been operating. That lines up pretty close with our contracts. So it's not an exact match because some of the Wheatstone contracts and Gorgon contracts are a little bit different. But fundamentally, we're balanced. So yes, the real opportunity cost from the Gorgon downtime was not participating in the spot market. So we didn't get the benefit of it, but we're relatively balanced. There were some trading puts and takes, I would say, in the LNG spot market, but nothing worth pointing out.
In terms of PZ, that ramp up continues very well. It's that 60,000 barrels a day, our share, pre the shut-in was about 80,000. So we expect to get there here during the course of the year and then, of course, any OPEC+ curtailments. At this point in time, it's not being curtailed, but that's really subject to the local governments."

That's the fourth largest source of greenhouse gas emissions globally, right? The first is manufacturing; second, power generation; third is agriculture and land use; and then fourth is transportation. So agriculture and land use is an important source of greenhouse gas emissions. You've seen our work in renewable natural gas, which again captures the methane from dairy cows. And so that's a worthwhile area for us to look into.
So the agricultural waste is just that, that's what happens is it gets burned, and those emissions go to the atmosphere. And so partnering with Schlumberger and Microsoft that's a worthwhile project to capture an emission that otherwise will enter the atmosphere or not or be burnt, emitted to the atmosphere and converting it and sequestering essentially in generating some excess power.
So it's early days. You're right, it's all policy-enabled, including federal policy and California state policy. We're doing the front engineering, a lot of work to do, but I think you're getting -- the right idea is that we're looking for projects that are higher return, lower carbon. And so this is a project that we can generate a return with the policy support and reduces carbon."

I mean you walked through 2 of the things that you needed to see, which is sustainable excess cash flow generation and a strong balance sheet. You mentioned the near term cash goes on to the balance sheet. Is that because it's just the place to hold the cash while the sustainability gets to a level of confidence that you're okay with?

If you have excess cash and you don't change your capital program, the dividend, we just increased, so that's not going to change. So just by definition, it goes to the balance sheet. And so -- but it also, I think you can infer in my comments that, again, we're looking to future excess cash generation and the strength of the balance sheet to weather the commodity price cycle. So I'm not going to give you a hard target. This is -- we're going to use judgment. Because there's judgment on future excess cash generation. This is our first quarter actually with current excess cash generation. We expect the next couple of quarters to be potentially even better because you've got oil prices above $60, refining and chemicals margins much stronger. So it could be even better.
At the same time, we don't have a sustained global economic recovery. So it's reasonable for us to be cautious. We want to be confident that when we start the program, we're going to continue it for multiple years and we can sustain it through an oil price cycle. So I know that folks want a formula or a trigger. I know some of our competitors have those numbers. We're going to use judgment. And we're going to consider what we see in front of us in terms of the likelihood of future excess cash generation.
We're going to want the balance sheet in a strong enough position that if oil prices cycle down, we can continue the buyback program, relying on the balance sheet. Our balance sheet is very strong right now. But yes, in the short term, excess cash is going to go to the balance sheet. That's kind of by definition, but it also serves the dual purpose of lowering our net debt ratio and putting us in a better position for when we start if and when we start a buyback program."

The refinery in the Gulf Coast is a very small acquisition that we made was something that I had foreshadowed. I was leading the business at that point in time because we'd only had 1 refinery in the Gulf Coast region. We were, I think, the only company really, major company with that setup. We did not -- we were on the eastern side of the Gulf Coast in Mississippi. And so our retail in Texas was supplied by third-party barrels. So we had talked about that. We didn't have to do that, but when the opportunity came, and that transaction is kind of working as we envision.
So on the West Coast, we're at a much different place. We have a 2 refinery system. We have a leading brand. Really strong infrastructure. We are -- we're growing a little bit in Mexico, some of our retail volume is there. So I'd just say we're in a strong position on the West Coast. And in the Gulf Coast, we were also strong, but we felt we could make us even better by getting something on the eastern side and the Texas side, and we did that. So I wouldn't read too much into it.
We did a small Australia retail fuels, which again was enabled our value chain out of Asia. So there's been some very targeted modest acquisitions in the refining business and retail business. But for the most part, you know that we're -- we have a focused geographic footprint, very competitive business.
As we look forward, look, it's going to get better. Winter storm Uri as difficult as that event was for everybody in the region, one of the outcomes was it tightened inventories for fuels and especially for chemicals. So those margins have recovered a little more quickly than they otherwise would have. And we think the next couple of quarters are going to be good, and we're well positioned in our downstream and chemicals business."

So when you look across your portfolio, do you see kind of different pace of margin improvement and return to normal? And do you expect your refining results to reflect that throughout the year?
And then secondly, on the Toyota MoU you announced, there was a comment in the press release mentioning that the MoU and the pursuit of hydrogen will leverage existing market positions and assets that Chevron has.

And the reference to assets is like hydrogen fuel dispensing at some of our service stations. So that's the comment. More to come. We're very excited to partner with a great company like Toyota on the fuel cell technology, and you'll hear more over time.
In terms of the regional differences, you're absolutely right, there are regional differences. If I contrast first, West Coast and Gulf Coast, Gulf Coast is a little bit stronger. I mean, Florida looks really pretty much back to normal. West Coast, on track with gasoline and diesel, really has come on strong now. The Southern California resurgence earlier this winter has worked its way through. The rates are very low and you're seeing that come back. Domestic travel, strong, again, in the Gulf Coast region, seeing it come back in California.
What's a little bit weaker we're seeing on the West Coast is because of the big airports in San Francisco and LA are such -- are so heavy for international travel. That clearly is lagging. Now hopefully, it's coming soon after domestic travel. We saw the announcement in Europe that fully vaccinated Americans could go to Europe this summer. So we'll just see that's hopefully not too far behind.
We saw in China and Australia, the domestic travel fully recovered once those countries got their arms around the virus. So I'm confident domestic travel will come back very quickly here in this country. But again, international travel will lag a little bit, and we'll just see.
Asia, Asia is a big -- it varies. Some countries have much better control of virus than others. And then the excess -- some of the new refining capacity in China becomes relevant there. So the U.S. has strengthened, for sure, as I said earlier with winter storm Uri and you're seeing that in petrochemicals too. So I do think second quarter, third quarter are going to look better. It is a global market. So these markets do stay connected. Asia has also recovered somewhat, and we'll see where the results are over the next few quarters."

And I think you saw that in a lot of the reserve replacements and other numbers and you saw that in our Investor Day, our ability to basically get pretty close to the same production guidance, 5 years out, this year versus where we were last year, is a reflection of greater capital efficiency, but also the Noble transaction. Now so that, I agree with you.
Whether we do that again or not, that's a separate question. Again, we don't have to do that. We can sustain and grow the enterprise. Our sustaining CapEx on the upstream side, excluding exploration, how we've defined it is about $9 billion. So we are above that. Of course, we are investing in Tengiz, which we know is going to result in higher production and much stronger higher cash flow. So again, we showed a free cash flow growing 10% per year.

We delivered strong financial results in the second quarter with the highest reported earnings in over a year. Adjusted earnings were $3.3 billion or $1.71 per share. The quarter's results included special items totaling $235 million, including a remediation charge in the Gulf of Mexico and pension settlement costs. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of this presentation. Adjusted return on capital was near 8%, and we lowered our net debt ratio to 21%. 
Strong operating cash flow enabled us to meet Chevron's top financial priorities. Our dividend was up 4%. We continue to execute our efficient capital program, and we paid down $2.5 billion of debt. Despite lower year-to-date prices and margins, first half 2021 quarterly average free cash flow is near 2018 levels, primarily due to lower capital and operating costs and contributions from legacy Noble assets. 
We're maintaining strong capital and cost discipline. C&E is down 32% from a year ago, and we're lowering our full year organic C&E guidance to around $13 billion, primarily due to lower spending at TCO and greater capital efficiency across the portfolio. Operating costs are on track with our March 2021 Investor Day guidance of a 10% reduction from 2019. 
Adjusted second quarter earnings were up $6.2 billion versus the same quarter last year. Adjusted upstream earnings increased primarily on higher prices and liftings. Adjusted downstream earnings increased on higher chemicals results as well as higher refining margins and volumes. All other was roughly unchanged between periods. 
Compared with last quarter, adjusted second quarter earnings were up about $1.5 billion. Adjusted upstream earnings increased primarily on higher commodity prices and higher production in the U.S. Adjusted downstream earnings increased primarily from strong chemicals results as well as increased refining margins and volumes. All other charges were roughly flat between quarters and are running ahead of ratable guidance, primarily due to tax charges and valuation of stock-based compensation. The All Other segment results can vary between quarters, and our full year guidance is unchanged.

Turning to the Permian. We continue to incorporate greater efficiency into our activities. Even with our reduced activity levels, production is expected to be comparable to last year. Consistent with the guidance we shared in March, we're adding rigs and completion crews in the second half of this year, delivering an expected production rate of over 600,000 barrels a day by year-end. For 2021, we expect free cash flow, excluding working capital, to exceed $3 billion, assuming an average Brent price of $65 a barrel. 
We're committed to lowering the carbon intensity of our Permian operations. One recent example is our shift from diesel fuel to electricity and natural gas to power drilling rigs and completion spreads. This reduces emissions, reduces well costs and take trucks off the roads, which results in higher returns and lower carbon. 
At FGP-WPMP, overall progress is at 84%, with field construction 69% complete. We've recently reviewed our cost and schedule targets. At this point, the net schedule extension from the pandemic is expected to be roughly 1/4 for WPMP and 2 quarters for FGP. Our cost target remains $45.2 billion, as cost reduction efforts and favorable exchange rates offset an estimated $1.9 billion of incremental cost associated with COVID. The COVID costs include mitigation efforts demob and remobilization costs as well as the expected schedule extension I just mentioned. 
Although the total project cost target is unchanged, we have increased the project contingency to $1.9 billion to recognize the scheduled uncertainty associated with the virus and its variance. The project is currently at peak workforce, and our primary focus is to mitigate the impact of the virus with vaccinations, testing and isolation protocols to enable our workforce to achieve its productivity. 
In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Valley More project is being developed as a subsea tieback to our existing line face facility. The project facility entered front-end engineering and design and remains on track for a final investment decision next year. Earlier this month, we sanctioned the Whale project, which has the potential for future expansion. Fabrication of the anchor project remains on track, with assembly of the production facility hall underway. 
In Australia, we've sanctioned the Jans IO compression project, which will support the flow of natural gas to Barrow Island. Repairs to the gorgon propane heat exchangers are complete, and we now have all 5 operated LNG trains online in Australia. 
In Colorado, our newest generation of production facilities have eliminated the tanks and flare system to deliver a carbon intensity of only 6 kilograms of CO2 per BOE. The new facilities also have a 60% smaller footprint, higher reliability and 15% to 20% lower life cycle cost than a traditional facility design, another great example of higher returns and lower carbon. 
Back to you, Pierre."

With this transaction complete, we have fully integrated Noble and have achieved greater than $600 million in synergies, 3 months earlier than previously guided. We also started up a mixed feed cracker at GS Caltex and plan to be at 100% of design capacity in the third quarter. The project was completed under budget and 5 months ahead of schedule. 
In the third quarter, we're resuming our share repurchase program at a targeted annual rate of $2 billion to $3 billion. This is a rate that we believe is sustainable through the cycle while continuing to pay down debt. 
The restart of our program is consistent with our financial priorities and builds on our track record. We have a history of buying back shares consistently in meaningful quantities and at a price close to the daily ratable average over the entire 17-year period. 
We're continuing to grow lower carbon businesses. This quarter, we started coprocessing bio feedstock at our El Segundo refinery, growing renewable diesel production in a capital-efficient manner by leveraging existing infrastructure. We recently announced an MOU with Cummins to develop commercially viable businesses in hydrogen. Also, we've completed front-end engineering on a carbon capture project for emissions from the gas turbines in 1 of our California cogeneration facilities. This project leverages 2 innovative technologies, CO2 concentration and carbon capture and has the potential to scale across our full fleet of turbines. 
Finally, yesterday, we announced the creation of Chevron New Energies, a new organization reporting directly to the CEO. This is an important step to build fast-growing, profitable new energy businesses to further advance a lower carbon future. 
Now looking ahead, in the third quarter, we expect major turnarounds to reduce upstream production by 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, primarily at TCO, which also reduces our expected curtailments to about 5,000 barrels per day. We expect to make an incremental pension contribution in the third quarter of $500 million. This is a onetime payment in addition to our regular quarterly contributions. 
With higher operating cash flows, TCO expects to pay back part of its loans this year versus our prior guidance of increasing its debt. There's no change in TCO's expected dividend this year. We've adjusted the guidance on the affiliate income line to reflect higher expected TCO earnings. Also, we expect higher dividends from CPChem, in line with our share of higher earnings. 
On September 14, we'll be hosting our energy transition spotlight to provide more details on how we plan to lower carbon intensity in our operations and grow lower carbon businesses. We invite you all to join us for this video webcast. 
Our objective is unchanged: higher returns, lower carbon. During this quarter, we continue to make progress towards this goal, delivering stronger financial results and achieving important lower carbon milestones. And with oil prices well above our dividend breakeven and an industry-leading balance sheet, we will resume share buybacks, sharing part of the cash upside with our investors. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Roderick."

But again, with prices well above that, we should head below the bottom of that range. 
In terms of the breakeven, I mean, this is our fourth priority from a financial perspective. And so it is -- we feel it's sustainable. We intend to sustain it over the cycle, but I don't necessarily view it as a commitment like we would say our dividend is and bake it into the breakeven calculation. But the last thing I'll say is our Investor Day, we showed that at $60 flat Brent nominal over 5 years, we can generate more than $25 billion of excess cash. That's cash in excess of our capital and our dividend. And so you see us starting this buyback program at $2 billion to $3 billion a year.

In the oil industry, you never say never. But look, we've talked before that as we move forward with the asset and the portfolio that we have, the preponderance of our capital, 60% and more, is going to be going into shorter cycle high-return projects, which are very quick to bring new production on. We have low preproductive capital. They tend to be very efficient, and we can adjust based on market conditions and react quite rapidly. 
But that doesn't mean all of our investment will always be in just short cycle. The deepwater continues to be an important part of our portfolio. It has a very low carbon footprint, and it tends to have high returns. And so we've seen projects like Anchor and Whale and Ballymore in the queue. And we'll continue to see those roll in, but we're going to do that in a very disciplined way. We talked at the Investor Day about how we are taking action to make these capital projects more efficient, more effective, going to the minimum facility objectives and really building only what's necessary to deliver the returns that we're looking for.

And so you certainly consume that both of those criteria have been met. In terms of the level, it is to continue to pay down debt while we're having these prices. So it's nothing really more than that. 
Again, as I said earlier to Phil's question, with prices above 70%, our net debt ratio should be below 20%. And so this is a range that allows us to continue to do that. It also gives us a range to deal with uncertainty. We feel good about the macro, but undoubtedly, there's variance out there that can impact demand, and you have OPEC us still having curtailed volumes. So that flexibility is inherent in the range. It also gives us flexibility to buy more or less depending on the strength of Chevron's stock price, which we've heard from shareholders who have said they want us to try to beat the daily average. 
I showed a chart that says, we don't buy high. We buy very close to daily average. But if we can do a bit better and use some discretion, we've heard from our shareholders that they prefer that. So that's the thinking that goes behind the level, the range and the timing."

If we find something that ends up really big and justifies a greenfield development, we can go the route of a whale project, where we continue to focus on the minimum functional objectives, building facilities that are replicative in nature so that we are building on the learnings of the past. 
We've developed a deepwater asset class, so we're taking learnings from the Gulf of Mexico, from West Africa, from deepwater Australia, sharing those rapidly between these different asset groups to make sure that we're staying on the forefront of efficiency.

At TCO, the team has just done an extraordinary job of responding to the impact of the virus. And as we said, we've been able to capture cost savings, which have largely offset along with some of our foreign exchange gains, offset the incremental cost due to COVID. So at this point in time, we've reached our peak workforce on FGP. 
And so we are maintaining that workforce. It is something we have to continue to stay focused on mitigations, particularly with the rise in the Delta variant and other variants that we are exposed to. The vaccination program continues to go well. We have 42,000 members of our workforce that have gotten their initial dose and about 30,000 that are fully vaccinated now. And we continue to try and work with the Khazak government to increase those numbers. 
Because we were so successful in completing the fabrication, and that fabrication was done with such high quality and it's been proven to be now dimensionally accurate, we've had our modules showing up at site within 1 to 3 millimeters of accuracy on where pipes land and the connections between modules. It's really helped us move forward from that standpoint. All of the modules going through the shipping program to arrive at Tengiz, they've all been successfully moved to site, restacked and set on their foundations. So we have that entire program behind us now. 
All the heavy equipment for the project has been set on foundation throughout the project, so our heavy lift program is complete and being demobilized. And now we're just focused on the interconnections and the hookup and preparing for the turnover to completions and startup. 
So normally, at this point, we would be decreasing our contingency because we have eliminated so many of the traditional risks. But in this case, we've actually increased it to $1.9 billion, and that's primarily due to our uncertainty around future impacts from COVID. This pandemic is far from over around the world. And so while we're doing well and we've been very successful at mitigating any potential impact to this, as you said, critically important summer, we need to stay that way. 
We're monitoring our productivity. We are very focused on being capitally efficient here. Our focus is on delivering this project at $45.2 billion. We've allowed to schedule to slip a little bit because it's just too hard to try and catch up. We didn't feel that was a good use of resource.

So we are seeing our activity levels start to increase in the second half. As we see markets not in balance, but starting to move in the right direction towards approaching equilibrium, we'll continue to monitor where we are in terms of the overall market signals that come to us, but we're going to continue to be very disciplined and focused. Our returns remain the #1 objective. We are going to stay disciplined around those returns, but we are moving back into more and more efficient factory drilling again as opposed to having to be focused on lease retention as we were over the last 18 months or so. 
So I think the Permian is going to continue to be a critical asset in our portfolio. what we've generated and demonstrated is that we can generate free cash flow while we continue to grow, and that's because we maintain that disciplined focus on the balance as we look forward."

And -- but you're right, policy does vary, but there's enough policy to advance these businesses. 
Now there are 2 main parts to our lower carbon activities. The first is to lower the carbon intensity of our operations. And that largely does not inherent on policy or at least certainly the first steps. We put out a 2028 target that has a 35% reduction to 24 kilograms per barrel. And that's something we're taking action on. 
And then we're also advancing lower carbon businesses. The announcement yesterday was really focused on hydrogen carbon capture. Our downstream team is advancing renewable fuels. We've talked about renewable natural gas and renewable diesel previously. 
What we're trying to do around lower carbon really is connected to our assets, capabilities and customers. So 1 thing we're not doing in lower carbon is large-scale wind and solar. And we're certainly having renewable power supplier operations, again, part of lowering the carbon intensity, but not pursuing it as a stand-alone business. That's a decision that we're making because we don't feel like we have the competitive advantage. But when we get to renewable fuels, like renewable natural gas, renewable diesel, sustainable jet, hydrogen carbon capture, these are areas that are adjacent to our business where, again, we have capability, we have customers and we have assets that we can leverage. 
We sell to United Airlines. United Airlines is going to buy a sustainable jet. Sustainable jet is going to be a percentage of Jet for some time period, 2%, 5%, 10% mix with conventional. We're the natural player in that space. So again, we'll share more on September 14, but that's a little taste of what you should expect from us."

It's a pretty broad question, so I'm going to start broad, but then I'll focus in on the Gulf of Mexico. In the upstream portfolio, as we take stock of where we are as Chevron, our entire upstream portfolio, as best we can determine, sits at roughly half of the industry average for carbon intensity worldwide. So we're starting from a good position. 
We've been very focused on starting to bring our carbon down for some time now. And so we set our initial goals back in 2016 for carbon intensity reduction for the upstream. Since 2016, we've actually reduced our flaring by 60% and our methane emissions by 50%, and we've done that largely through what we call the marginal investment cost curves. And just as we do in exploration, we don't have every business unit out there making their own independent decisions, but rather they bring their ideas for carbon reduction investments to the center. 
And then we look across the entire enterprise, not just upstream, but upstream and downstream, midstream, and we invest into those opportunities that give us the greatest carbon reduction for the least amount of capital. And that's in keeping with our focus on being a higher return company. 
What we've been able to find so far is that the projects have been relatively low-hanging fruit. And so we've seen these big reductions in carbon that's occurred since 2016. And in fact, we reached our 2013 target -- sorry, 2023 targets in 2020, 3 years ahead of schedule. And so we've already set new targets, which we talked to you about at the Investor Day in March, for 2028, and that's the path that we're working towards now. And that's to get down to an average of 24 kilograms of CO2 per barrel equivalent across the entire portfolio. 
Places like the DJ Basin, where some of the Noble teams have done a great job of designing out the parts of the process that have the highest emissions have resulted in those huge gains. And so as we said, not only are we seeing a 15% to 20% lower life cycle cost, we're seeing high reliability, 60% footprint reduction and they're down in the 6-kilogram per CO2 per barrel equivalent range, which is tremendous. To put that into comparison, the entire Gulf of Mexico, our operations last year in 2020, were at 7 kilograms per CO2. And that's why we think it's so important. There's good information for policymakers to understand that places like the Gulf of Mexico allow us to produce a very critical supply of energy to the United States and to the world, but also do that in a very carbon-efficient manner. 
So in terms of our decision making, these are all elements that we have to balance as we make investment decisions, but we are bringing these factors and these criteria into the equation as we evaluate where we're going to allocate capital and how we're going to move forward."

We haven't given asset-level free cash flow guidance for TCO. You're absolutely right that you will see increased dividends from Tengiz from our ownership interest in TCO, both as capital rolls off and as the project starts up. It's a big part of the company's guidance of 10% annual free cash flow growth between now and 2025. A lot of that comes from the Permian, a lot of it comes from Tengiz. 
And as you also know, we'll get the loans repaid back. That shows up in a different part of the cash flow statement, but it's still cash. So there's nothing asset specific that we've shared, but it's included in our overall free cash flow guidance that I'll refer you to our Investor Day. And perhaps as we get closer to the start-up, we can share that in a more specific way for you all.

It is an uncertainty, but we have enough confidence in all the investments and assets that Jay has been talking about.

We are, as we talked about earlier, getting to the -- near the end or a couple of years away from Tengiz being completed. The vast majority of our capital program is much more flexible, so that gives us this higher range. So I'd like to get comfortably below it.

We did it this way in part very capital efficient. We are leveraging existing kit. It's literally just a tank and some pipes, and so we can do this in a very capital-efficient way. There is undoubtedly growth in renewable diesel on the demand side, but there's also growth on the supply side. Renewable markets work in commodity markets just like the conventional products do.

We delivered strong financial results in the second quarter with the highest reported earnings in over a year. Adjusted earnings were $3.3 billion or $1.71 per share. The quarter's results included special items totaling $235 million, including a remediation charge in the Gulf of Mexico and pension settlement costs. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of this presentation. 
Adjusted return on capital was near 8%, and we lowered our net debt ratio to 21%. 
Strong operating cash flow enabled us to meet Chevron's top financial priorities. Our dividend was up 4%. We continue to execute our efficient capital program, and we paid down $2.5 billion of debt. Despite lower year-to-date prices and margins, first half 2021 quarterly average free cash flow is near 2018 levels, primarily due to lower capital and operating costs and contributions from legacy Noble assets. 
We're maintaining strong capital and cost discipline. C&E is down 32% from a year ago, and we're lowering our full year organic C&E guidance to around $13 billion, primarily due to lower spending at TCO and greater capital efficiency across the portfolio. Operating costs are on track with our March 2021 Investor Day guidance of a 10% reduction from 2019. 
Adjusted second quarter earnings were up $6.2 billion versus the same quarter last year. Adjusted upstream earnings increased primarily on higher prices and liftings. Adjusted downstream earnings increased on higher chemicals results as well as higher refining margins and volumes. All other was roughly unchanged between periods. 
Compared with last quarter, adjusted second quarter earnings were up about $1.5 billion. Adjusted upstream earnings increased primarily on higher commodity prices and higher production in the U.S. Adjusted downstream earnings increased primarily from strong chemicals results as well as increased refining margins and volumes. All other charges were roughly flat between quarters and are running ahead of ratable guidance, primarily due to tax charges and valuation of stock-based compensation. The All Other segment results can vary between quarters, and our full year guidance is unchanged.

Second quarter oil equivalent production increased 5% compared to a year ago. The increase in production was driven by Noble acquisition and lower curtailments, partially offset by normal field declines, price-related entitlement effects and asset sales. 
Turning to the Permian. We continue to incorporate greater efficiency into our activities. Even with our reduced activity levels, production is expected to be comparable to last year. Consistent with the guidance we shared in March, we're adding rigs and completion crews in the second half of this year, delivering an expected production rate of over 600,000 barrels a day by year-end. For 2021, we expect free cash flow, excluding working capital, to exceed $3 billion, assuming an average Brent price of $65 a barrel. 
We're committed to lowering the carbon intensity of our Permian operations. One recent example is our shift from diesel fuel to electricity and natural gas to power drilling rigs and completion spreads. This reduces emissions, reduces well costs and takes trucks off the roads, which results in higher returns and lower carbon. 
At FGP-WPMP, overall progress is at 84%, with field construction 69% complete. We've recently reviewed our cost and schedule targets. At this point, the net schedule extension from the pandemic is expected to be roughly 1/4 for WPMP and 2 quarters for FGP. Our cost target remains $45.2 billion, as cost reduction efforts and favorable exchange rates offset an estimated $1.9 billion of incremental cost associated with COVID. The COVID costs include mitigation efforts, demob and remobilization costs as well as the expected schedule extension I just mentioned. Although the total project cost target is unchanged, we have increased the project contingency to $1.9 billion to recognize the schedule uncertainty associated with the virus and its variance. The project is currently at peak workforce, and our primary focus is to mitigate the impact of the virus with vaccinations, testing and isolation protocols to enable our workforce to achieve its productivity. 
In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Ballymore project is being developed as a subsea tieback to our existing line face facility. The project facility entered front-end engineering and design and remains on track for a final investment decision next year. Earlier this month, we sanctioned the Whale project, which has the potential for future expansion. Fabrication of the Anchor project remains on track, with assembly of the production facility hall underway. In Australia, we've sanctioned the Jansz-Io compression project, which will support the flow of natural gas to Barrow Island. Repairs to the Gorgon propane heat exchangers are complete, and we now have all 5 operated LNG trains online in Australia. 
In Colorado, our newest generation of production facilities have eliminated the tanks and flare system to deliver a carbon intensity of only 6 kilograms of CO2 per BOE. The new facilities also have a 60% smaller footprint, higher reliability, and 15% to 20% lower life cycle cost than a traditional facility design, another great example of higher returns and lower carbon. 
Back to you, Pierre."

With this transaction complete, we have fully integrated Noble and have achieved greater than $600 million in synergies 3 months earlier than previously guided. We also started up a mixed feed cracker at GS Caltex and plan to be at 100% of design capacity in the third quarter. The project was completed under budget and 5 months ahead of schedule. 
In the third quarter, we're resuming our share repurchase program at a targeted annual rate of $2 billion to $3 billion. This is a rate that we believe is sustainable through the cycle while continuing to pay down debt. 
The restart of our program is consistent with our financial priorities and builds on our track record. We have a history of buying back shares consistently in meaningful quantities and at a price close to the daily ratable average over the entire 17-year period. 
We're continuing to grow lower carbon businesses. This quarter, we started coprocessing bio feedstock at our El Segundo refinery, growing renewable diesel production in a capital-efficient manner by leveraging existing infrastructure. We recently announced an MOU with Cummins to develop commercially viable businesses in hydrogen. Also, we've completed front-end engineering on a carbon capture project for emissions from the gas turbines in 1 of our California cogeneration facilities. This project leverages 2 innovative technologies, CO2 concentration and carbon capture, and has the potential to scale across our full fleet of turbines. 
Finally, yesterday, we announced the creation of Chevron New Energies,  a new organization reporting directly to the CEO. This is an important step to build fast-growing, profitable new energy businesses to further advance a lower carbon future. 
Now looking ahead, in the third quarter, we expect major turnarounds to reduce upstream production by 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, primarily at TCO, which also reduces our expected curtailments to about 5,000 barrels per day. We expect to make an incremental pension contribution in the third quarter of $500 million. This is a onetime payment in addition to our regular quarterly contributions. 
With higher operating cash flows, TCO expects to pay back part of its loans this year versus our prior guidance of increasing its debt. There's no change in TCO's expected dividend this year. We've adjusted the guidance on the affiliate income line to reflect higher expected TCO earnings. Also, we expect higher dividends from CPChem, in line with our share of higher earnings. 
On September 14, we'll be hosting our energy transition spotlight to provide more details on how we plan to lower carbon intensity in our operations and grow lower carbon businesses. We invite you all to join us for this video webcast. 
Our objective is unchanged: higher returns, lower carbon. During this quarter, we continue to make progress towards this goal, delivering stronger financial results and achieving important lower carbon milestones. And with oil prices well above our dividend breakeven and an industry-leading balance sheet, we will resume share buybacks, sharing part of the cash upside with our investors. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Roderick."

By resuming the program, we'll now be 14 of the last 18 years that we have repurchased shares. So that's more than 3 out of every 4 years.

That 20% to 25% net debt ratio range is really, over the cycle, kind of implies prices between $40 and $60, like we talked about during our Investor Day. But again, with prices well above that, we should head below the bottom of that range. 
In terms of the breakeven, I mean, this is our fourth priority from a financial perspective. And so it is -- we feel it's sustainable. We intend to sustain it over the cycle. But I don't necessarily view it as a commitment, like we would say our dividend is, and bake it into the breakeven calculation. 
But the last thing I'll say is on our Investor Day, we showed that at $60 flat Brent nominal over 5 years, we can generate more than $25 billion of excess cash. That's cash in excess of our capital and our dividend. And so you see us starting this buyback program at $2 billion to $3 billion a year.

We -- I've said in the past, Paul, as you know, that we would start a program when we were confident we could sustain it over the cycle through multiple years, based on our confidence in excess cash flow and the strength of the balance sheet. And so you certainly can assume that both of those criteria have been met. 
In terms of the level, it is to continue to pay down debt while we're having these prices. So it's nothing really more than that. Again, as I said earlier to Phil's question, with prices above 70%, our net debt ratio should be below 20%. And so this is a range that allows us to continue to do that. This also gives us a range to deal with uncertainty. We feel good about the macro, but undoubtedly, there's variance out there that can impact demand, and you have OPEC+ still having curtailed volumes. So that flexibility is inherent in the range. 
It also gives us flexibility to buy more or less depending on the strength of Chevron's stock price, which we've heard from shareholders who have said they want us to try to beat the daily average. I showed a chart that says, we don't buy high. We buy very close to daily average. But if we can do a bit better and use some discretion, we've heard from our shareholders that they'd prefer that. So that's the thinking that goes behind the level, the range and the timing."

We're one of the largest leaseholders in the Gulf of Mexico. But importantly, what we've been doing is focusing our new lease acquisitions to primarily concentrate in those areas where we already have infrastructure. And as we've talked before, with our focus on returns, we're looking for those opportunities where we can do exploration. And if we find something that's normal, it can be tied back into our existing infrastructure, much like a Ballymore. If we find something that ends up really big and justifies a greenfield development, we can go the route of a Whale project, where we continue to focus on the minimum functional objective, building facilities that are replicative in nature so that we are building on the learnings of the past. 
We've developed a deepwater asset class, so we're taking learnings from the Gulf of Mexico, from West Africa, from deepwater Australia, sharing those rapidly between these different asset groups to make sure that we're staying on the forefront of efficiency. 
So we have an exploration program that's laid out. We keep that at a pretty low level these days so that it can be very efficient, very focused. We have a good resource base across the portfolio, but we're always looking for that next high-return, low-carbon barrel. And the Gulf of Mexico represents a good hunting ground for that."

As we just said, we've sort of declared the integration complete. More than double the initial synergies, completed NBLX. We were the first to announce, first to close quality assets low premium and done at a good time from an exchange ratio perspective. 
As you know, we're always looking. We have a very high bar. And we certainly don't need to do a transaction. We just talked about our portfolio and how we can sustain and grow it in a very capital efficient way. 
Just the last thing I would say is, and we've shown this, that we don't really view cash as being something that's required to do M&A in our business. With oil prices volatility doing it on a stock basis, as we did with Noble, makes a lot of sense. It kind of keeps you hedged in case prices go up or down between a buyer and seller. So I wouldn't connect any kind of balance sheet actions as being an indicator one way or the other on M&A. We're going to be disciplined with our capital. It's all capital, whether it's organic or inorganic. And of course, we'll only take action if we see it in the interest of our shareholders."

At TCO, the team has just done an extraordinary job of responding to the impact of the virus. And as we've said, we've been able to capture cost savings, which have largely offset -- along with some of our foreign exchange gains, offset the incremental cost due to COVID. So at this point in time, we've reached our peak workforce on FGP. And so we are maintaining that workforce. It is something where we have to continue to stay focused on mitigations, particularly with the rise in the Delta variant and other variants that we are exposed to. 
The vaccination program continues to go well. We have 42,000 members of our workforce that have gotten their initial dose and about 30,000 that are fully vaccinated now. And we continue to try and work with the Khazak government to increase those numbers. 
Because we were so successful in completing the fabrication, and that fabrication was done with such high quality and it's been proven to be now dimensionally accurate, we've had our modules showing up at site within 1 to 3 millimeters of accuracy on where pipes land and the connections between modules. It's really helped us move forward from that standpoint. All of the modules going through the shipping program to arrive at Tengiz, they've all been successfully moved to site, restacked and set on their foundations. So we have that entire program behind us now. 
All the heavy equipment for the project has been set on foundation throughout the project, so our heavy lift program is complete and being demobilized. And now we're just focused on the interconnections and the hookup and preparing for the turnover to completions and startup. 
So normally, at this point, we would be decreasing our contingency because we have eliminated so many of the traditional risks. But in this case, we've actually increased it to $1.9 billion, and that's primarily due to our uncertainty around future impacts from COVID. This pandemic is far from over around the world. And so while we're doing well and we've been very successful at mitigating any potential impact to this, as you said, critically important summer, we need to stay that way. 
We're monitoring our productivity. We are very focused on being capitally efficient here. Our focus is on delivering this project at $45.2 billion. We've allowed the schedule to slip a little bit because it's just too hard to try and catch up. We didn't feel that was a good use of resource. So our predominant focus is on the cost, and we're managing the schedule within that cost parameter."

But at the same time, even with a constant level of activity, because the efficiency is getting better, we're actually getting more output from those reduced levels. We did add an additional completion crew in July, and we expect to add another one before year-end. We currently have 5 drilling rigs out there, and we expect to add at least 1 or 2 more in late third quarter and fourth quarter. So we are seeing our activity levels start to increase in the second half. 
As we see markets not  in balance, but starting to move in the right direction towards approaching equilibrium, we'll continue to monitor where we are in terms of the overall market signals that come to us. But we're going to continue to be very disciplined and focused. Our returns remain the #1 objective. We are going to stay disciplined around those returns. But we are moving back into more and more efficient factory drilling again as opposed to having to be focused on lease retention as we were over the last 18 months or so. 
So I think the Permian is going to continue to be a critical asset in our portfolio. What we've generated and demonstrated is that we can generate free cash flow while we continue to grow, and that's because we maintain that disciplined focus on the balance as we look forward."

And we have -- we're the leading downstream player here with a leading brand and have a large upstream business. And -- but you're right, policy does vary, but there's enough policy to advance these businesses. 
Now there are 2 main parts to our lower carbon activities. The first is to lower the carbon intensity of our operations. And that largely is not inherent on policy, or at least certainly the first steps. We put out a 2028 target that has a 35% reduction to 24 kilograms per barrel, and that's something we're taking action on. 
And then we're also advancing lower carbon businesses. The announcement yesterday was really focused on hydrogen carbon capture. Our downstream team is advancing renewable fuels. We've talked about renewable natural gas and renewable diesel previously. 
What we're trying to do around lower carbon really is connected to our assets, capabilities and customers. So one thing we're not doing in lower carbon is large-scale wind and solar. And we're certainly having renewable power supplier operations, again, part of lowering the carbon intensity, but not pursuing it as a stand-alone business. That's a decision that we're making because we don't feel like we have the competitive advantage. But when we get to renewable fuels, like renewable natural gas, renewable diesel, sustainable jet, hydrogen carbon capture, these are areas that are adjacent to our business where, again, we have capability, we have customers, and we have assets that we can leverage. 
We sell to United Airlines. United Airlines is going to buy a sustainable jet. Sustainable jet is going to be a percentage of jet for some time period, 2%, 5%, 10% mixed with conventional. We're the natural player in that space. So again, we'll share more on September 14, but that's a little taste of what you should expect from us."

So a few things. One is, can you talk about how you feature carbon emission profiles into your FID process alongside sort of traditional NPVs, IRRs, payback periods, et cetera? 
And secondly, whether as you look at your portfolio as it stands right now, which obviously been built up over years and decades, whether there's work that can be done around it that both sold for lower carbon emissions and actually is, I think, Pierre referenced, if you're adding renewables as a sort of power source, whether you can actually also make an economic return as well in conjunction with that?"

It's a pretty broad questions, so I'm going to start broad, but then I'll focus in on the Gulf of Mexico. 
In the upstream portfolio, as we take stock of where we are as Chevron, our entire upstream portfolio, as best we can determine, sits at roughly half of the industry average for carbon intensity worldwide. So we're starting from a good position. We've been very focused on starting to bring our carbon down for some time now. And so we set our initial goals back in 2016 for carbon intensity reduction for the upstream. Since 2016, we've actually reduced our flaring by 60% and our methane emissions by 50%, and we've done that largely through what we call the marginal abatement cost curves. And just as we do in exploration, we don't have every business unit out there making their own independent decisions, but rather they bring their ideas for carbon reduction investments to the center. And then we look across the entire enterprise, not just upstream, but upstream and downstream, midstream, and we invest into those opportunities that give us the greatest carbon reduction for the least amount of capital. And that's in keeping with our focus on being a higher return company. 
What we've been able to find so far is that the projects have been relatively low-hanging fruit. And so we've seen these big reductions in carbon that's occurred since 2016. And in fact, we reached our 2013 targets -- sorry, 2023 targets in 2020, 3 years ahead of schedule. And so we've already set new targets, which we talked to you about at the Investor Day in March, for 2028, and that's the path that we're working towards now. And that's to get down to an average of 24 kilograms of CO2 per barrel equivalent across the entire portfolio. 
Places like the DJ Basin, where some of the Noble teams have done a great job of designing out the parts of the process that have the highest emissions, have resulted in those huge gains. And so as we said, not only are we seeing a 15% to 20% lower life cycle cost, we're seeing high reliability, 60% footprint reduction, and they're down in the 6-kilogram per CO2 per barrel equivalent range, which is tremendous. To put that into comparison, the entire Gulf of Mexico, our operations last year in 2020, were at 7 kilograms per CO2. And that's why we think it's so important there's good information for policymakers to understand that places like the Gulf of Mexico allow us to produce a very critical supply of energy to the United States and to the world, but also do that in a very carbon-efficient manner. 
So in terms of our decision-making, these are all elements that we have to balance as we make investment decisions, but we are bringing these factors and these criteria into the equation as we evaluate where we're going to allocate capital and how we're going to move forward."

We haven't given asset-level free cash flow guidance for TCO. You're absolutely right that you will see increased dividends from Tengiz, from our ownership interest in TCO, both as capital rolls off and as the project starts up. It's a big part of the company's guidance of 10% annual free cash flow growth between now and 2025. A lot of that comes from the Permian, a lot of it comes from Tengiz. 
And as you also know, we'll get the loans repaid back. That shows up in a different part of the cash flow statement, but it's still cash. So there's nothing asset-specific that we've shared, but it's included in our overall free cash flow guidance that I'll refer you to our Investor Day. And perhaps as we get closer to the start-up, we can share that in a more specific way for you all. 
In terms of the share buyback, again, we look at those criteria. Are we comfortable we can sustain it? Confident we can sustain it over the cycle? There are uncertainties I cited. The Delta variant as an uncertainty and OPEC+. OPEC+ are going to take the actions that are in their interest. We don't have any greater insight into that. It is an uncertainty. But we have enough confidence in all the investments and assets that Jay has been talking about. The strong downstream and chemicals performance that we've seen, the economic recovery that we've seen, the discipline on the supply side that we've seen from companies in this country and really around the world, that we feel good that we can keep this program in place for multiple years and also pay down debt while we're doing it."

We are, as we talked about earlier, getting to the -- near the end or a couple of years away from Tengiz being completed. The vast majority of our capital program is much more flexible, so that gives us this higher range. So I'd like to get comfortably below it.

A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation. Adjusted ROCE was greater than 13%, and we lowered our net debt ratio to below 19%. 
Strong operating cash flow enabled us to deliver on our financial priorities, including the resumption of share repurchases. Compared to before COVID, operating costs are down, upstream production is up and we're much more capital efficient. Cost efficiency and capital efficiency are essential to navigate commodity price cycles, providing resilience through the low periods and leveraging upside when markets are strong. This has been evident over the past several quarters, and especially so in the most recent one, as we generated company-record free cash flow, higher than the strongest quarters in 2008 and '11 when oil prices were well over $100 a barrel.
Adjusted earnings -- adjusted third quarter earnings were up more than $5 billion versus last year, primarily on higher prices, margins and volumes. Compared with last quarter, adjusted third quarter earnings were up almost $2.5 billion. Adjusted upstream earnings increased on higher realizations and positive timing effects primarily related to managing LNG portfolio pricing exposure.
Adjusted downstream earnings increased primarily on higher refining and marketing margins. The all other variance was positive due to lower corporate charges and the use of deferred tax assets, which previously had a valuation allowance.
Third quarter oil equivalent production increased 7% year-over-year due to the Noble acquisition and lower curtailments, partly offset by price-related entitlement effects and asset sales.

In Downstream and Chemicals, we delivered our best adjusted earnings in more than 4 years. Demand for our product is strong, with recovery of jet fuel sales expected as international travel gradually returns. And while the improving market environment helps, we're focused on what we can control: safe and reliable operations, capital and cost efficiency and value chain optimization to drive higher returns.
Some examples of our self-help actions include using digital tools to improve planning, scheduling and prioritization of maintenance activity, leveraging data analytics and asset flexibility to increase margins and adopting new technologies like robotic inspections and maintenance procedures.
During our Investor Day in March, I highlighted that self-help is expected to drive higher returns for Downstream and Chemicals. We're on track to meet that guidance with benefits already flowing to the bottom line. 
Chemicals performance is also strong as CPChem responds to current market conditions while continuing to keep a focus on longer-term unit cost reduction. GS Caltex reached 100% design capacity of its mixed-feed cracker ahead of schedule and under budget. The CPChem U.S. Gulf Coast II project continues to advance towards a final investment decision in a disciplined way that positions the project to earn attractive returns through the cycle. And the Ras Laffan Project is in FEED, and we continue to evaluate this project.
We believe in the long-term fundamentals of chemicals. Our investment focus continues to be on the low end of the supply cost curve, advantaged feedstock, competitive capital and cost structure and strong project execution.
Since our Energy Transition Spotlight, we closed the acquisition of an equity interest in American Natural Gas and its network of 60 CNG retail sites with our partner, Mercuria, enabling us to meet customers' needs beyond California. We're also delivering first gas through our Brightmark partnership, and all CalBioGas farms are now online. We sold the first sustainable aviation fuel produced from our El Segundo refinery to Delta Airlines at LAX.
And earlier this month, we announced an agreement to acquire Neste's Group III base oils business and its NEXBASE brand. Pending regulatory approval, we anticipate closing in the first quarter of 2022. The acquisition is expected to provide a capital-efficient approach to expand our base oil offerings. And coupled with Novvi's renewable products, position Chevron to be the supplier of choice to meet customers' needs now and into the future.

We recently released an updated Climate Change Resilience Report, which includes: a stress test of our portfolio under IEA's Net Zero 2050 scenario, a new target called portfolio carbon intensity that includes Scope 1 and 2 and Scope 3 emissions from the use of our products, and Chevron's net zero 2050 aspiration for upstream Scope 1 and 2 emissions. I encourage everyone to read our latest report available on our website.
Now looking ahead. In the fourth quarter, we expect lower production due to a planned turnaround in Wheatstone, which was completed last week and repairs at the Alba gas plant in Equatorial Guinea. In addition, our participation in the Rokan PSC in Indonesia ended in August. Production from Rokan averaged 84,000 barrels of oil equivalent year-to-date.
We expect earnings from JKM-related spot sales out of Australia to increase around $50 million from 3 quarter -- from third quarter due to fewer spot cargoes as our long-term customers increase deliveries heading into winter. We're also expecting 3 discrete cash items: a return of capital from Angola LNG, TCO's first dividend in several years and a federal income tax cash refund. There are no P&L impacts from these items.
During 4Q, we expect to buy back shares at the high end of our guidance range. Finally, we're lowering our full year C&E guidance to $12 billion to $13 billion, primarily due to COVID-related project spend deferrals into next year, lower non-op CapEx in the Permian and continued capital efficiencies.
To wrap up the quarter, we continue to make progress toward our objective of higher returns, lower carbon. We're more capital and cost efficient, generated record free cash flow and are taking actions to lower the carbon intensity of our operations and grow lower-carbon businesses. We're executing a straightforward strategy that's expected to deliver value now and well into the future.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Roderick."

That's from our budget of $14 billion and from our revised guidance that we had in the second quarter of $13 billion. So in the last quarter, what's changed -- While we continue to see non-op spend in the Permian below our expectations, we did have some deferred major capital project spending tied to Hurricane Ida and the Delta variant wave. And then we've seen -- continue to see continued capital efficiency across -- in the Permian and across the portfolio. 
It does not change our CapEx guidance. Our CapEx guidance for next year and through of 2025 is $15 billion to $17 billion. We do expect higher CapEx in the fourth quarter and next year. The low end of that range is about a 20% increase from the midpoint of our revised guidance.
So these deferrals are very manageable. And again, I would think from the original $14 billion budget, about half you can think of deferrals -- and half, I would say, is capital efficiency and cost savings where we're getting the same results for less capital."

We've seen demand very resilient through COVID on natural gas, in particular. And supply has been impacted in part by lower associated gas, just a slowdown in some supply activity.
So seeing demand and supply a little bit out of sync is something that we've seen in the past, and we expect that markets will work. We're seeing in commodity pricing right now, and we expect markets to rebalance over time.
We have a very strong natural gas business. We have a nice position in North America, Australia, Eastern Med through Noble Energy and in Africa. And so we're well positioned there. There's not much in the short term that we can really do to increase supply. We have a position in the Haynesville and we could increase activity there. But that will have a modest impact on a company of our size. 
I think over the medium to longer term, we're working expansion opportunities, particularly in the Eastern Med. And I think this is positive for signing up customers and enabling kind of the next phase of expansion there. So it's something that we're certainly well positioned for, and we're looking to expand supply into it.
In terms of the quarter, a couple of things. Yes, we did have a trading timing effect that was related to LNG. And that's really tied to how we manage our overall portfolio pricing. So we have customer contracts that are oil-linked and JKM linked, and then we have various supplies and we try to match up the pricing. And in order to do that, we essentially went along some JKM paper, which clearly was mark-to-market positive in the quarter. Now that's going to be matched against some physical deliveries in future quarters. So we call that timing because we expect to see that unwind when those physical cargoes are delivered.
And then the last piece of guidance we had was really on fourth quarter earnings effects. We guided towards $50 million of increased earnings in 4Q versus 3Q from Australia LNG spot cargoes. And that's just to make the point that we are going to have spot cargoes. We have all 5 trains operating. The Wheatstone planned turnaround is complete.
And we'll have actually more cargoes delivered in fourth quarter when you think of contract and spot. But because it's heading into winter and most of our -- many of our customers in the Northern Hemisphere, their nominations seasonally pick up heading into the winter. And so they will have higher takes under the long-term contracts, which are oil linked, and that means we'll have fewer cargoes getting the higher JKM prices.
So higher prices clearly in JKM 4Q versus 3Q, fewer cargoes, that's a net benefit of about $50 million. We also have some exposure out of our both Angola LNG and Equatorial Guinea. And so you can think about another $50 million or so from spot cargoes from those operations. So a long answer to cover the full breadth of natural gas this quarter."

For example, when we showed our stress test, the only company in the industry to show a stress test last year at $30 Brent for 2 years to give confidence to our investors that we could maintain the dividend, our net debt ratio did go above 25%. So that's appropriate.
We do not need to be anywhere close to where we were before with no net debt. But when prices are above mid-cycle, we should be below the low end of the range. And we are. We got to less than 19% now, and we're fast approaching range where we could increase our buyback guidance.
So it's very close to where we're at. All the excess cash that we'll be generating under these conditions. And we showed that at $60, even prices well below where we're at, now that we can generate $25 billion of excess cash over 5 years. This is cash in excess of our capital and our dividend. All that cash will be returned to shareholders over time in the form of a rising dividend.

So if you look at this quarter's result, I think you'd see our breakeven would be a little bit lower. But in terms of mid-cycle assumptions for refining margins, chemical margins, natural gas prices, and then an oil breakeven about 50 is certainly where we're at. 
Now that, of course, that changes as our dividend goes up and other things over time because it's a dividend breakeven, it's covering our capital and our dividend. But that math is still intact. We are a better company than we were a few years ago. We showed that chart where our costs are lower. Our production is higher, and we're much more capital efficient. We can sustain and grow this enterprise with less capital, and that helps us deliver higher returns and lower carbon."

So this is things like air travel, industrial emissions, heavy-duty transport. The $10 billion of capital is connected to some pretty ambitious targets that go up to 2030. So 150,000 tons per annum of hydrogen, 25 million tons per year of carbon capture and storage. That's all consistent with that capital guidance.

You think about our El Segundo refinery in our diesel hydrotreater conversion. We've said a few things are really important to us when it comes to renewable diesel 
we've said that the ability to sell it at the appropriate margin, the ability to have the right kind of feedstocks and the ability to be capital efficient is critical for us to be successful. Southern California and the El Segundo refinery are an example of all of that. 
We've already increased our sales -- we're getting close to 40%, but let's say over 30% of renewable and biodiesel in Southern California. We have our Bunge joint venture, where we're working towards definitive agreements as we speak, and yet they're already supplying us at the El Segundo refinery. And finally, perhaps most importantly, capital efficiency. We indicated in our energy transition spotlight that we expect to be a leader in the capital conversion of particular hydroprocessing units in our system.
And we believe we can do that for less than $1 per gallon of annual capacity, and that includes any pretreatment requirements. That gives us the ability to produce both renewable diesel and conventional diesel just with the catalyst change, if that's necessary. So when you step back and you think about that work that's been done initially at El Segundo, where we did our coprocessing investment for very, very little money, we were able to test tanking and piping and metallurgy needs.
And now we're working towards a full conversion of that diesel hydrotreater here by the end of next year. That won't be easy, but the team is working really hard on it making very good progress. And that would be 100% renewable diesel capacity in over 10,000 barrels a day. Thanks for the question, Ryan."

It was really tied to the very low interest rates from a year ago. It sounds like a long time ago. 
But under the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation rules, the funding requirement is fixed by -- on the year-end interest rates. And so we were a little bit underfunded, and therefore, would have paid a little higher, let's call it variable interest rate essentially higher than our cost of borrowing. And so that's why we supplemented it. 
Obviously, we're in a much different place in terms of interest rates now and you'd expect our pension contributions to be -- as they have been, and we provide guidance pension in our 10-Q filing. So I would not expect anything on that end. 
So again, if you go to our financial priorities, Paul, you know them well. Sustain and grow the dividend. It's up 12% since pre-COVID, the biggest increase in the sector. Our capital guidance is going to be up, but it's no change from the guidance range, and it's in a very tight guidance range and very capital efficient and lower where it was pre-COVID.
We're going to pay down a little more debt. As I said, we're fast approaching a level where we can increase our buyback range. And so then the balance is excess cash.

We've -- and used margin as the proxy for capacity being utilized. We've said demand has to recover for 5 value products. Inventory, it has to fall in the traditional ranges. And then we need some degree of refinery rationalization, either closures or conversions throughout the system.
If you're in the U.S. today, I think you're seeing much of that demand recovery with Jet still to come. And that's even with offices not completely open and still some restrictions in place. Inventory tending to find itself in traditional boundaries and starting to see some closures and/or conversions in some of our markets, especially the U.S. West Coast, which means the market could be -- could actually be tight on things like motor gasoline, even Jet 5 or 6 years from now. So you see that in the United States. 
If I shift to Asia, I would say that demand recovery on Jet is a little bit behind that of the U.S., especially given our exposure to Southeast Asia. Inventory reduction falling into those ranges is starting to happen. Some of that with China stopping some of its exports for the moment. But demand catching up with refinery capacity in Asia still needs to happen. And that means that we both need some -- perhaps some rationalization as well as demand just to catch up with the capacity that's there.
And so my high level comment would be that in the United States, we're seeing the actions to bring refinery margins into balance over time getting closer to historic ranges and just a half phase behind that maybe in Asia. And then for the pet chem side of the equation, chem margins have had a strong run this year on the back of good demand and considerable supply disruptions.
We would expect to see margins come off as we get to the fourth quarter, normal seasonal type of drop off. But we're actually preparing for -- with capacity growth over the next few years. We expect that to outpace demand. So we're at that part of the cycle. And even in 2025, we're presuming we'll be on the lower portion of the margin cycle. So that means that there will be a period of catch-up there in regard to demand catching capacity. I hope I got to your

And I encourage others to check it out. Let me just talk about TCO because as we look back, we had a very successful spring and summer campaign there. We hit our productivity targets, and we achieved a lot of our milestones when we had a full workforce. So we had Delta variant wave, which caused some higher levels of isolation in the middle of the third quarter, but we ended the quarter with positive rates very, very low, and we're back to our full workforce.
And as I mentioned earlier, we intend to maintain a peak manpower workforce level through the winter months. We have a vaccination rate over 85% for that workforce. So we're well positioned to make a lot of progress this winter. Now we have to be thoughtful about it because it can get cold there. So we're sequencing the work in a way that we're saving a work that can be done indoors or in sheltered locations during the coldest months of the winter.
So no change clearly in the guidance that we provided on second quarter in terms of budget and schedule. But I wanted to give an update. Things are going very well in Tengiz, and we're looking forward to a very productive winter season there.
In terms of the dividend, you're right, it's the first dividend in 3 years, so that's nice to see. We did have a modest loan repay back that occurred last quarter. And look, we'll give guidance on 2022, just like with Paul's question, when we look forward. 
It will depend clearly also on oil prices, but that's something that we'll give guidance on our 4Q call. In terms of asset sales, yes, we acquired Noble when -- or announced the acquisition when Brent was in the low 40s. And now Brent is in the low 80s. And so it's a commodity business. It has cycles, ups and downs. And when you buy or sell assets, timing makes a difference, where you are in the cycle. And of course, strategic fit and all the elements. We're very, very pleased with the Noble transaction.
We talked about timing of it, the first to do it. The synergies that were doubled and the tax benefits that we saw this quarter and interest cost savings. So we did tender a number of bond offerings earlier this month. A lot of those bonds are renewable bonds. Again, that was not included in our synergies because we weren't quite sure we could achieve that, and we'll save over $100 million in interest cost savings.
So Noble just keeps contributing to the company. And that's part of the reason why we're a better company now than we were several years ago. But it's a different market. So yes, I view it more as a seller's market than a buyer's market right now. And so you're seeing us modestly increase some assets that don't compete for capital as well in our portfolio. In fact, one of them is our position in the Eagle Ford. So that was a Noble legacy position. 
Chevron legacy was not in it. So we don't have quite the scale that we would like. But again, essentially buying that position at $40 and now we have it on the market, that's in the public domain. And obviously, we expect to get much higher value than for what was implied in the purchase price. We have some other U.S. onshore assets that are on the market, again, that we feel are very attractive to a lot of industry players, but just won't compete for capital as well in our portfolio."

So I wanted to see with the substantial amount of the refining capacity being shut, does it change the way that how you're looking at that business or that you think you already have sufficient of the capacity and supplementary and you really don't need to add. 
And also in the retail marketing, some of your peers that have been aggressively building that up and including in the U.S. and you guys have out of that business for more than 10 years. I mean is there any plan to going back so that on the energy transition, including in the EV charger and all that? 
The second question is for Pierre. You talked about, say, the TCO dividend. How about the Angola LNG? Can you give us some idea that if the current commodity price hold, should we assume every year that both Angola LNG and the TCO is going to pay the dividend? And any kind of sensitivity you can provide that if the change in the oil price, how does that impact on that dividend payout going to look like?"

I think your second question was really about retail marketing. And as you know, we have 3 world-class brands. And we've taken a capital-light approach to selling our branded fuels. 
In fact, one of the metrics that we often look at is the OPUS brand power rating, and we continue to be well at the top of that list. And what that means is the majority of our retail sites around the world that you would see are owned by retailers who have specifically chosen our brand. And so we have our brand, our fuel and generally not our capital.
We also happen to have one of the strongest retail convenience franchising offerings out there -- extra miles that you've probably seen. In fact, I think we hit our 1,000th site this year with very, very little attrition. And so we believe that our limited capital approach provides us the majority of the margin and sustainably delivers high returns and still allows us to stay connected with customers and as part of that offering to customers. 
Today, we have EV charging stations in 7 countries around the world, and we're partnering with our retailers to continue to expand that offering as customers actually need it. Your second question was, I think, about the refinery portfolio in general and maybe Pasadena specifically, we're very pleased with our refining portfolio today. And it's really because of that hydro processing capacity that we have across our system. It gives us flexibility to deal with the fuels of the future in renewable fuels, in particular, in a very, very capital-efficient way.
Specific to Pasadena, again, we have an opportunity there. The premise of the acquisition continues to hold for us in processing our equity crude being able to supply our own service stations in the Texas, Louisiana area. And then, of course, having the intermediates back and forth between Pascagoula and Pasadena. That's all working as we would expect. 
And we've shared that we think there's an opportunity there to have very efficient expansion of light oil processing capacity, and we've hinted that, that's going to be a hydroskimming focus. We're working on that real hard and look forward to talking more about that next year."

And in terms of guidance going forward, let's just say Angola LNG does sell into the spot market essentially both on oil-linked strips and into Europe, TTF or international JKM markets. So it does have exposure to international natural gas pricing. $300 million will be a nice return of capital here in the fourth quarter. And again, just like with Paul Sankey's question, we'll provide guidance for our full LNG portfolio on the fourth quarter call for 2022. That will include Australia, Angola LNG, and our interest in Equatorial Guinea, which again is another asset that was acquired through Noble Energy."

Historically, we thought the mid-cycle would be more like $0.25. Obviously, right now, we are more like 65. And even though you did say the margins will decline, some of the bigger chemical ethylene players are out there saying, ""We will settle for the next 2, 3 years above the mid-cycle level."" So while the mid-cycle could be $0.25,  you could still see $0.35 to $0.40. So that's the first question. 
And the second question is you're seeing you get into the CNG distribution for the first time. And I'm wondering if this is associated with your strategy of developing RNG and basically controlling the entire value chain, so you can distribute your that you're going to produce through your distribution network?"

So first on Chemical margins, we indicated as we look to the longest of terms, we expect pet chem demand to continue to grow in line with the long-term GDP growth. We believe in kind of the next 4 to 5 years, we do see capacity growth in the next couple of years going past demand, which brings us towards the bottom portion of the margin cycle.
And so I think we shared in our Investor Day discussions last year that we brought our view down and it's again airing on the side of conservatism perhaps, but that it was going to be $0.20 per pound in regard to where we could expect those margins over time. And anything above that, of course, we will take. And it drives us in our CPChem joint venture to make sure that we continue to work on our unit cost reductions, which they have done a very good job on, and we'll continue do going forward.
And so we see that as our number looking forward. And then when I get to your comment on the RNG portfolio, you read it exactly correctly. Our close on the 60 American natural gas sites is really about us leveraging our strength. When we talk about renewable natural gas, we say a couple of things. We say it leverages our strengths and biofeedstocks are really important. The strengths in particular, our value chain, activation and partnerships. And the 2 areas where you can see this at play, actually in the formal presentation, would be in the gas that's now coming from CalBio from all of the farms that we have there and then our Brightmark activity experiencing their first delivered gas. 
On the 60 C&G sites that American Natural Gas sites with Mercuria, that allows us to follow the request of our customers, if you will, who were trying to get CNG to those customers throughout the -- our portfolio, and that's a first step in doing it and a platform for us to grow."

Yes, I should have mentioned, no TCO is paying a dividend, and it was in the plan, but it could be higher than what was planned, which is why we've guided to a range. Primarily because 2 things. One, clearly, the macro environment is stronger. So it is -- it produces a light oil that attracts trades to a tight discount to Brent and with the physical terms and the rest of it, it's generating excess cash. 
And also we've seen at the project, some real cost savings. Again, we've seen some deferrals, but that would be factored into retaining cash in TCO, but we've seen some underlying greater efficiencies, and we've seen some foreign exchange benefits there. So it's a function of things going well, both from a market environment and from an execution of the project. 
Again, in terms of 2022, we will provide guidance. On the fourth quarter call, like we have in prior years, we've guided historically to that cash flow line, which is the difference between dividends and affiliate earnings. I think we also might just give separately a range on expected dividends from Tengiz and other major affiliates. 
And then in terms of costs, we're not really seeing any cost increases. Rigs, U.S. onshore rigs are maybe creeping up, but they're still well below where they were pre-COVID. And in general, the industry is operating below capacity. So although there are pockets of goods and services that we use that are tied to the general economy like steel and clearly, steel is up. But the majority of our costs are tied to industry-specific major equipment, and that's still operating below capacity. So it could increase in the future. I know there's a lot of talk about it, but what we're seeing up to date is costs are well under control."

We reported third quarter earnings of $6.1 billion, or $3.19 per share, the highest reported earnings in more than 8 years. Adjusted earnings were $5.7 billion, or $2.96 per share. The quarter's results included 2 special items, asset sale gains of $200 million and pension settlement costs of $81 million. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation. Adjusted ROCE was greater than 13%, and we lowered our net debt ratio to below 19%.
Strong operating cash flow enabled us to deliver on our financial priorities, including the resumption of share repurchases. Compared to before COVID, operating costs are down, upstream production is up and we're much more capital efficient.
Cost efficiency and capital efficiency are essential to navigate commodity price cycles, providing resilience through the low periods and leveraging upside when markets are strong. This has been evident over the past several quarters, and especially so in the most recent one, as we generated company-record free cash flow, higher than the strongest quarters in 2008 and '11 when oil prices were well over $100 a barrel.
Adjusted earnings -- adjusted third quarter earnings were up more than $5 billion versus last year, primarily on higher prices, margins and volumes. Compared with last quarter, adjusted third quarter earnings were up almost $2.5 billion.
Adjusted upstream earnings increased on higher realizations and positive timing effects, primarily related to managing LNG portfolio pricing exposure. Adjusted downstream earnings increased primarily on higher refining and marketing margins.
The All Other variance was positive due to lower corporate charges and the use of deferred tax assets, which previously had a valuation allowance. Third quarter oil equivalent production increased 7% year-over-year due to the Noble acquisition and lower curtailments, partly offset by price-related entitlement effects and asset sales.

In Downstream & Chemicals, we delivered our best adjusted earnings in more than 4 years. Demand for our product is strong, with recovery of jet fuel sales expected as international travel gradually returns. And while the improving market environment helps, we're focused on what we can control: safe and reliable operations, capital and cost efficiency and value chain optimization to drive higher returns.
Some examples of our self-help actions include using digital tools to improve planning, scheduling and prioritization of maintenance activity, leveraging data analytics and asset flexibility to increase margins and adopting new technologies like robotic inspections and maintenance procedures.
During our Investor Day in March, I highlighted that self-help is expected to drive higher returns for Downstream & Chemicals. We're on track to meet that guidance with benefits already flowing to the bottom line.
Chemicals performance is also strong as CPChem responds to current market conditions while continuing to keep a focus on longer-term unit cost reduction. GS Caltex reached 100% design capacity of its mixed-feed cracker, ahead of schedule and under budget.
The CPChem U.S. Gulf Coast II project continues to advance towards a final investment decision in a disciplined way that positions the project to earn attractive returns through the cycle. And the Ras Laffan Project is in FEED, and we continue to evaluate this project.
We believe in the long-term fundamentals of chemicals. Our investment focus continues to be on the low end of the supply cost curve, advantaged feedstock, competitive capital and cost structure and strong project execution.
Since our Energy Transition Spotlight, we closed the acquisition of an equity interest in American Natural Gas and its network of 60 CNG retail sites with our partner, Mercuria, enabling us to meet customers' needs beyond California. We're also delivering first gas through our Brightmark partnership, and all CalBio gas farms are now online.
We sold the first sustainable aviation fuel produced from our El Segundo refinery to Delta Airlines at LAX. And earlier this month, we announced an agreement to acquire Neste's Group III base oils business and its NEXBASE brand. Pending regulatory approval, we anticipate closing in the first quarter of 2022.
The acquisition is expected to provide a capital-efficient approach to expand our base oil offerings. And coupled with Novvi's renewable products, position Chevron to be the supplier of choice to meet customers' needs now and into the future.

I encourage everyone to read our latest report available on our website.
Now looking ahead. In the fourth quarter, we expect lower production due to a planned turnaround in Wheatstone, which was completed last week, and repairs at the Alba gas plant in Equatorial Guinea. In addition, our participation in the Rokan PSC in Indonesia ended in August. Production from Rokan averaged 84,000 barrels of oil equivalent year-to-date.
We expect earnings from JKM-related spot sales out of Australia to increase around $50 million from 3 quarter -- from third quarter due to fewer spot cargoes, as our long-term customers increase deliveries heading into winter. We're also expecting 3 discrete cash items: a return of capital from Angola LNG, TCO's first dividend in several years and a federal income tax cash refund. There are no P&L impacts from these items.
During 4Q, we expect to buy back shares at the high end of our guidance range. Finally, we're lowering our full year C&E guidance to $12 billion to $13 billion, primarily due to COVID-related project spend deferrals into next year, lower non-op CapEx in the Permian and continued capital efficiencies.
To wrap up the quarter, we continued to make progress toward our objective of higher returns, lower carbon. We're more capital and cost efficient, generated record free cash flow and are taking actions to lower the carbon intensity of our operations and grow lower-carbon businesses. We're executing a straightforward strategy that's expected to deliver value now and well into the future.

And then we've seen -- continued to see continued capital efficiency across -- in the Permian and across the portfolio.
It does not change our CapEx guidance. Our CapEx guidance for next year and through 2025 is $15 billion to $17 billion. We do expect higher CapEx in the fourth quarter and next year. The low end of that range is about a 20% increase from the midpoint of our revised guidance.
So these deferrals are very manageable. And again, I would think from the original $14 billion budget, about half you can think of deferrals and half, I would say, is capital efficiency and cost savings where we're getting the same results at -- for less capital."

We've seen demand very resilient through COVID on natural gas, in particular. And supply has been impacted in part by lower associated gas, just a slowdown in some supply activity.
So seeing demand and supply a little bit out of sync is something that we've seen in the past, and we expect that markets will work. We're seeing in commodity pricing right now, and we expect markets to rebalance over time.
We have a very strong natural gas business. We have a nice position in North America, Australia, Eastern Med through Noble Energy and in Africa. And so we're well positioned there. There's not much in the short term that we can really do to increase supply. We have a position in the Haynesville and we could increase activity there. But that will have a modest impact on a company of our size.
I think over the medium to longer term, we're working expansion opportunities, particularly in the Eastern Med. And I think this is positive for signing up customers and enabling kind of the next phase of expansion there. So it's something that we're certainly well positioned for, and we're looking to expand supply into it.
In terms of the quarter, a couple of things. Yes, we did have a trading timing effect that was related to LNG. And that's really tied to how we manage our overall portfolio pricing. So we have customer contracts that are oil-linked and JKM-linked, and then we have various supplies and we try to match up the pricing. And in order to do that, we essentially went along some JKM paper, which clearly was mark-to-market positive in the quarter.
Now that's going to be matched against some physical deliveries in future quarters. So we call that timing because we expect to see that unwind when those physical cargoes are delivered.
And then the last piece of guidance we had was really on fourth quarter earnings effects. We guided towards $50 million of increased earnings in 4Q versus 3Q from Australia LNG spot cargoes. And that's just to make the point that we are going to have spot cargoes. We have all 5 trains operating. The Wheatstone planned turnaround is complete.
And we'll have actually more cargoes delivered in fourth quarter when you think of contract and spot. But because it's heading into winter and most of our -- many of our customers are in the Northern Hemisphere, their nominations seasonally pick up heading into the winter. And so they will have higher takes under the long-term contracts, which are oil-linked, and that means we'll have fewer cargoes getting the higher JKM prices.
So higher prices clearly in JKM 4Q versus 3Q, fewer cargoes, that's a net benefit of about $50 million. We also have some exposure out of our both Angola LNG and Equatorial Guinea. And so you can think about another $50 million or so from spot cargoes from those operations.
So -- sorry, it's a long answer to cover the full breadth of natural gas this quarter."

Our financial performance is so much stronger that we actually were able to use them in the third quarter. So that reduces our taxes, both on an earnings and on a cash basis.

For example, when we showed our stress test, the only company in the industry to show a stress test last year at $30 Brent for 2 years to give confidence to our investors that we could maintain the dividend, our net debt ratio did go above 25%. So that's appropriate.
We do not need to be anywhere close to where we were before with no net debt. But when prices are above mid-cycle, we should be below the low end of the range, and we are. We got to less than 19% now, and we're fast approaching a range where we could increase our buyback guidance. So it's very close to where we're at.
All the excess cash that we'll be generating under these conditions. And we show that at $60, even prices well below where we're at now, that we can generate $25 billion of excess cash over 5 years. This is cash in excess of our capital and our dividend. All that cash will be returned to shareholders over time in the form of a rising dividend.
And again, our dividend is up 12% since pre-COVID, the biggest increase in the sector, and a buyback that's ratable and we maintained through the cycle. We bought back shares 14 in the last 18 years. And so when we set a buyback rate, we intend to maintain it through the cycle.

So no, our focus is on being ratable and maintain it through the cycle. Investors -- our investors, our shareholders have different views on buybacks.

Now that -- of course, that changes as our dividend goes up and other things over time because it's a dividend breakeven, it's covering our capital and our dividend. But that math is still intact.

So that gives us the ability to produce both renewable diesel and conventional diesel just with the catalyst change, if that's necessary. So when you step back and you think about that work that's been done initially at El Segundo, where we did our coprocessing investment for very, very little money, we were able to test tanking and piping and metallurgy needs.
And now we're working towards a full conversion of that diesel hydrotreater here by the end of next year. That won't be easy, but the team is working really hard on it, making very good progress. And that would be 100% renewable diesel capacity and over 10,000 barrels a day. Thanks for the question, Ryan."

What's really changed is that was in a geography that a year ago looked oversupplied for natural gas and now looks much tighter. And so as you know, the natural gas business internationally is really dependent on getting customers to sign up. And I think customers are more motivated now. And look, it's probably overdone. As I said earlier, we expect the markets to correct but it is a better time for us to be engaging.
So it's a great resource. And in many cases, is backing out coal. It has expansion opportunities. It's been free cash flow positive from the moment that we close Noble. So it's just a great asset and it's well positioned now to have opportunities to grow in the future."

It was really tied to the very low interest rates from a year ago. It sounds like a long time ago.
But under the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation rules, the funding requirement is fixed by -- on the year-end interest rates. And so we were a little bit underfunded, and therefore, would have paid a little higher, let's call it, variable interest rate, essentially, higher than our cost of borrowing. And so that's why we supplemented it.
Obviously, we're in a much different place in terms of interest rates now and you'd expect our pension contributions to be -- as they have been, and we provide guidance on pension in our 10-Q filing. So I would not expect anything on that end.
So again, if you go to our financial priorities, Paul, you know them well. Sustain and grow the dividend. It's up 12% since pre-COVID, the biggest increase in the sector. Our capital guidance is going to be up, but it's no change from the guidance range, and it's in a very tight guidance range and very capital efficient and lower where it was pre-COVID.
We're going to pay down a little more debt. As I said, we're fast approaching a level where we can increase our buyback range. And so then the balance is excess cash. And over time, it goes to shareholders. We're not going to sweep it out each quarter because investors are very clear that they want us to maintain a buyback through the cycle."

We've -- and use margin as the proxy for capacity being utilized. We've said demand has to recover for high-value products. Inventory, it has to fall in the traditional ranges. And then we need some degree of refinery rationalization, either closures or conversions throughout the system.
If you're in the U.S. today, I think you're seeing much of that demand recovery with Jet still to come. And that's even with offices not completely open and still some restrictions in place. Inventory tending to find itself in traditional boundaries and starting to see some closures and/or conversions in some of our markets, especially the U.S. West Coast, which means the market could be -- could actually be tight on things like motor gasoline, even Jet 5 or 6 years from now. So you see that in the United States.
If I shift to Asia, I would say that demand recovery on Jet is a little bit behind that of the U.S., especially given our exposure to Southeast Asia. Inventory reduction falling into those ranges is starting to happen. Some of that with China stopping some of its exports for the moment. But demand catching up with refinery capacity in Asia still needs to happen. And that means that we both need some -- perhaps some rationalization as well as demand just to catch up with the capacity that's there.
And so my high level comment would be that in the United States, we're seeing the actions to bring refinery margins into balance over time, getting closer to historic ranges and just a half phase behind that maybe in Asia. And then for the petchem side of the equation, petchem margins have had a strong run this year on the back of good demand and considerable supply disruptions.
We would expect to see margins come off as we get to the fourth quarter, normal seasonal type of drop off. But we're actually preparing for -- with capacity growth over the next few years, we expect that to outpace demand. So we're at that part of the cycle. And even in 2025, we're presuming we'll be on the lower portion of the margin cycle. So that means that there will be a period of catch-up there in regard to demand catching capacity.
I hope I got to your [indiscernible]."

So it's sort of a modestly growing part of the portfolio. If you think of the biggest growth that we have going forward, clearly is in the Permian, which I referred to earlier. Tengiz, a project that we're investing in and the project is going very well and the project will come on in a couple of years.

And so it's based on, again, transparent reporting data and comparability. And so thank you for taking advantage of that. And I encourage others to check it out.
Let me just talk about TCO because as we look back, we had a very successful spring and summer campaign there. We hit our productivity targets, and we achieved a lot of our milestones when we had a full workforce. So we had Delta variant wave, which caused some higher levels of isolation in the middle of the third quarter, but we ended the quarter with positive rates very, very low, and we're back to our full workforce.
And as I mentioned earlier, we intend to maintain a peak manpower workforce level through the winter months. We have a vaccination rate over 85% for that workforce. So we're well positioned to make a lot of progress this winter. Now we have to be thoughtful about it because it can get cold there. So we're sequencing the work in a way that we're saving a work that can be done indoors or in sheltered locations during the coldest months of the winter.
So no change clearly in the guidance that we provided on second quarter in terms of budget and schedule. But I wanted to give an update. Things are going very well in Tengiz, and we're looking forward to a very productive winter season there.
In terms of the dividend, you're right, it's the first dividend in 3 years, so that's nice to see. We did have a modest loan repay back that occurred last quarter. And look, we'll give guidance on 2022, just like with Paul's question, when we look forward. It will depend clearly also on oil prices, but that's something that we'll give guidance on, on our 4Q call.
In terms of asset sales, yes, we acquired Noble when -- or announced the acquisition when Brent was in the low $40s. And now Brent is in the low $80s. And so it's a commodity business. It has cycles, ups and downs. And when you buy or sell assets, timing makes a difference, where you are in the cycle. And of course, strategic fit and all the elements. We're very, very pleased with the Noble transaction.
We talked about timing of it, the first to do it. The synergies that were doubled and the tax benefits that we saw this quarter and interest cost savings. So we did tender a number of bond offerings earlier this month. A lot of those bonds are renewable bonds. Again, that was not included in our synergies because we weren't quite sure we could achieve that, and we'll save over $100 million in interest cost savings.
So Noble just keeps contributing to the company. And that's part of the reason why we're a better company now than we were several years ago. But it's a different market. So yes, I'd view it more as a seller's market than a buyer's market right now. And so you're seeing us modestly increase some assets that don't compete for capital as well in our portfolio. In fact, one of them is our position in the Eagle Ford. So that was a Noble legacy position.
Chevron legacy was not in it. So we don't have quite the scale that we would like. But again, essentially buying that position at $40 and now we have it on the market, that's in the public domain. And obviously, we expect to get much higher value than for what was implied in the purchase price. We have some other U.S. onshore assets that are on the market, again, that we feel are very attractive to a lot of industry players, but just won't compete for capital as well in our portfolio."

I think your second question was really about retail marketing. And as you know, we have 3 world-class brands. And we've taken a capital-light approach to selling our branded fuels.
In fact, one of the metrics that we often look at is the Opus brand power rating, and we continue to be well at the top of that list. And what that means is the majority of our retail sites around the world that you would see are owned by retailers who have specifically chosen our brand. And so we have our brand, our fuel and generally not our capital. We also happen to have one of the strongest retail convenience franchising offerings out there -- ExtraMiles that you've probably seen. In fact, I think we hit our 1,000th site this year with very, very little attrition.
And so we believe that our limited capital approach provides us the majority of the margin and sustainably delivers high returns and still allows us to stay connected with customers. And the best part of that offering to customers, today, we have EV charging stations in 7 countries around the world, and we're partnering with our retailers to continue to expand that offering as customers actually need it.
Your second question was, I think, about the refinery portfolio in general and maybe Pasadena specifically. We're very pleased with our refining portfolio today. And it's really because of that hydro processing capacity that we have across our system. It gives us flexibility to deal with the fuels of the future and renewable fuels, in particular, in a very, very capital-efficient way.
Specific to Pasadena, again, we have an opportunity there. The premise of the acquisition continues to hold for us in processing our equity crude, being able to supply our own service stations in the Texas, Louisiana area. And then, of course, having the intermediates back and forth between Pascagoula and Pasadena. That's all working as we would expect.
And we've shared that we think there's an opportunity there to have very efficient expansion of light-tight oil processing capacity, and we've hinted that, that's going to be a hydroskimming focus. We're working on that real hard and look forward to talking more about that next year.

And in terms of guidance going forward, let's just say Angola LNG does sell into the spot market essentially both on oil-linked strips and into Europe, TTF or international JKM markets. So it does have exposure to international natural gas pricing. $300 million will be a nice return of capital here in the fourth quarter.
And again, just like with Paul Sankey's question, we'll provide guidance for our full LNG portfolio on the fourth quarter call for 2022. That will include Australia, Angola LNG, and our interest in Equatorial Guinea, which again is another asset that was acquired through Noble Energy."

Historically, we thought the mid-cycle would be more like $0.25. Obviously, right now, we are more like $0.65. And even though you did say the margins will decline, some of the bigger chemical ethylene players are out there saying, ""We will settle for the next 2, 3 years above the mid-cycle level."" So while the mid-cycle could be $0.25, you could still see $0.35 to $0.40. So that's the first question.
And the second question is we're seeing you get into the CNG distribution for the first time. And I'm wondering if this is associated with your strategy of developing RNG and basically controlling the entire value chain, so you can distribute your RNG that you're going to produce through your distribution network."

So first on petrochemical margins, we indicated, as we look to the longest of terms, we expect petchem demand to continue to grow in line with the long-term GDP growth. We believe in kind of the next 4 to 5 years, we do see capacity growth in the next couple of years going past demand, which brings us towards the bottom portion of the margin cycle.
And so I think we shared in our Investor Day discussions last year that we brought our view down and it's again erring on the side of conservatism perhaps, but that it was going to be $0.20 per pound in regard to where we could expect those margins over time. And anything above that, of course, we will take. And it drives us in our CPChem joint venture to make sure that we continue to work on our unit cost reductions, which they have done a very good job on, and will continue do going forward.
And so we see that as our number looking forward. And then when I get to your comment on the RNG portfolio, you read it exactly correctly. Our close on the 60 American natural gas sites is really about us leveraging our strength. When we talk about renewable natural gas, we say a couple of things. We say it leverages our strengths and biofeedstocks are really important.
The strengths, in particular, are value chain, activation and partnerships. And the 2 areas where you can see this at play, actually in the formal presentation, would be in the gas that's now coming from CalBio from all of the farms that we have there and then our Brightmark activity experiencing their first delivered gas.
On the 60 CNG sites that -- American Natural Gas CNG sites with Mercuria, that allows us to follow the request of our customers, if you will, who were trying to get CNG to those customers throughout the -- our portfolio, and that's a first step in doing it and a platform for us to grow."

Yes, I should have mentioned, no TCO is paying a dividend, and it was in the plan, but it could be higher than was planned, which is why we've guided to a range. Primarily because 2 things. One, clearly, the macro environment is stronger. So it is -- it produces a light oil that attracts trades to a tight discount to Brent and with the fiscal terms and the rest of it, it's generating excess cash.
And also we've seen, at the project, some real cost savings. Again, we've seen some deferrals, but that would be factored into retaining cash in TCO, but we've seen some underlying greater efficiencies, and we've seen some foreign exchange benefits there. So it's a function of things going well, both from a market environment and from an execution of the project.
Again, in terms of 2022, we will provide guidance on the fourth quarter call, like we have in prior years. We've guided historically to that cash flow line, which is the difference between dividends and affiliate earnings. I think we also might just give separately a range on expected dividends from Tengiz and other major affiliates.
And then in terms of costs, we're not really seeing any cost increases. Rigs, U.S. onshore rigs are maybe creeping up, but they're still well below where they were pre-COVID. And in general, the industry is operating below capacity. So although there are pockets of goods and services that we use that are tied to the general economy like steel and, clearly, steel is up. But the majority of our costs are tied to industry-specific major equipment, and that's still operating below capacity. So it could increase in the future. I know there's a lot of talk about it, but what we're seeing up to date is costs are well under control."
