Our third quarter performance reflected strong underlying progress on our path to quality, sustainable long-term growth. Overall, revenues improved sequentially and were in line with our expectations. 
Stronger-than-expected recovery in Asia was offset by the impact of continued COVID-19 resurgences across Europe, while North America was roughly in line with our expectations, even with additional COVID pressures. Meanwhile, our focus on brand elevation, improved quality of sales and cost discipline drove better-than-expected gross and operating margin expansion in the quarter with double-digit AUR growth and digital profitability, exceeding our expectations. 
And while COVID is likely to remain a near-term headwind, there is reason to be hopeful as we start the new year and vaccines begin to roll out. Ralph and I are incredibly proud of the dedication, resilience and agility our teams have shown in not only managing through the pandemic, but also positioning the company to emerge stronger than we came into it. 
As part of this, we balanced reset activities with an acceleration of our core strategies, including strengthening our brand and bolstering our marketing and new customer acquisition, expanding key categories in international markets, scaling our connected retail offerings globally, continuing to prune non-elevating distribution and further realigning our cost structure. These actions are consistent with the 5 strategic priorities that we laid out as part of our long-term plan prior to COVID. 
These include: first, win over a new generation of consumers; second, energize core products and accelerate high potential underdeveloped categories; third, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels; fourth, lead with digital across all activities; and fifth, operate with discipline to fuel growth. I will touch on a few of these in a moment. 
But first, let me provide some updates specific to this quarter's performance. As we anticipated at the start of the holiday season, the global retail environment remained volatile due to the pandemic and other macro factors. Nevertheless, apart from the impact of COVID resurgences, we were encouraged by several bright spots in each of our regions this quarter, led notably by Asia and our digital channels globally. 
Asia, which we view in many ways as a blueprint for our progress in other markets, grew 14% to last year. This was driven by continued momentum in the Chinese mainland, with more than 40% reported growth. Japan returned to positive growth in the quarter, while Korea was up double digits. In North America, performance continued to improve sequentially and was in line with our expectations despite rising COVID cases in many of our key markets. 
Our strategy of elevating our brand across digital, department stores and off-price is well underway, and we're still on track to complete the significant portion of this work in fiscal '21. Europe was the most challenging segment this quarter, with the majority of our stores closed for a   4   months of the key holiday period. In addition to the government-mandated shutdowns, there were also significant operating and travel restrictions throughout the quarter, which have continued into our fourth quarter to date. 
In many ways, the second and third wave restrictions have been more disruptive than the first wave of shutdowns we experienced last spring as they vary greatly by market and by day. Third quarter traffic headwinds were partly mitigated by a strong acceleration across our own and wholesale digital channels in Europe. 
This was driven by our expanded connected retail programs, exclusive capsules with partners like MyTheresa and ASOS, holiday campaigns and influencer activations. We also leveraged this period of disruption to continue our long-term brand elevation in the region, acquiring new high-value consumers and driving increased AUR despite a highly promotional competitive environment. These actions should help position our brands for healthier recovery and ecosystem expansion once we emerge from COVID. 
By channel, digital continues to be a key driver of our performance, with digital sales accelerating in all 3 regions this quarter. We continue to scale up our connected retail offerings and emphasize gifting in key product categories for holiday. 
These included our iconic sweaters, Holiday Bear programs, home and loungewear that are resonating with consumers today. In our brick-and-mortar stores, as I mentioned, traffic was challenged due to COVID, particularly in Europe and North America. But we were strongly encouraged that our teams were able to deliver higher conversion in these channels with double-digit AUR growth and reduced discounting, while also starting to leverage our new connected retail offerings this holiday. 
We also continue to invest in targeted new store expansion in key growth markets with 23 new stores this quarter, primarily in Asia. Within our wholesale business, we were encouraged by continued sequential progress across regions, particularly on Wholesale Dot Com. We still expect pressure on our reported sell-in trends in the near-term as we deliberately exited department store doors early in the pandemic and prioritize inventory management in this environment. As a reminder, this near-term discipline is integral to building price harmonization across our ecosystem and to protecting the elevation in long-term equity of our brands. 
Turning to our efforts to win over a new generation. In the third quarter, we continued to ramp up our personalization initiatives, shift our brand-building efforts increasingly toward digital, and leverage the authentic values that have been central to our brand since Ralph started this company more than 50 years ago. Let me touch on some of the highlights from this quarter. 
First, we launched a fully integrated and diverse Family Is Who You Love holiday campaign across social media, our own stores and digital sites and wholesale environments. We also focused more than ever on creating innovative digital experiences that immerse the consumer in the world of Ralph Lauren. These included our groundbreaking virtual flagship store experiences in Beverly Hills, New York and Paris, where consumers around the world can experience our brands in the full breadth of our assortment in a way that was previously only possible by walking into one of our beautiful stores. Amplifying the reach of our flagships to a global audience, digital traffic in these virtual stores was 8x greater than the foot traffic in these physical stores over the same period. 
We were also the first apparel brand to launch Snapchat's logo scan this holiday. This allows consumers to scan our iconic Polo Pony Logo from any surface, including holding items, ads, shopping bags and more. To trigger an augmented reality experience, that brings them into the world of Ralph Lauren and ultimately transact on our own site. And in Asia, we were excited to launch our livestream selling event with 360-degree activation for Singles Day, delivering more than 120 million impressions. 
We're investing in these new forms of selling, including social commerce, which we expect to become a greater part of the digital shopping experience long term. Looking ahead, we will continue to partner with celebrities and influencers who embody our core values along with being a part of key moments around the world. More recently, Ralph and I were particularly proud of our brand's participation in the U.S. Presidential inauguration. Overall, we are encouraged by the momentum we are seeing in consumer engagement across generations. 
Notably, our brand awareness and purchase intent have accelerated since the start of the pandemic and we are seeing particularly strong growth from consumers under 35 in women. We added more than 1 million new consumers through our direct-to-consumer platforms alone in Q3. And our total social media followers reached $45 million in the quarter. This was led by continued momentum across key platforms like Instagram, TikTok, YouTube and Snapchat, where our Ralph Lauren Bitmoji collection is connecting strongly with Gen Z consumers. 
Since the launch last August, over 20 million users has addressed their Bitmoji and Ralph Lauren and tried on the collection over 550 million times. This takes me to our long-term priority of leading with digital. Fiscal '21 can [Audio Gap] and how we work as a company. On the consumer-facing side, the continued acceleration of connected retail is essential to creating the best possible experience for our consumers and to our long-term growth. Building on our accelerated connected retail launches in the first half of the year, in the third quarter, we added mobile point of sales across our North American retail fleet, appointment scheduling and curated personal collections online, all while continuing to expand our digital clienteling programs globally. We also launched our Hong Kong digital flagship in time for holiday, which is an important part of our broader ecosystem strategy as consumers shop and travel in new ways. 
In addition to strengthening our digital commerce capabilities, we continue to build our social commerce presence and expand our partnerships with influential digital retailers around the world. Our teams executed a successful global launch campaign this holiday with FARFETCH. We delivered lifestyle content tailored to next-generation consumers, reaching over 15 million impressions global, including the first ever editorial experience within the FARFETCH app. 
We were encouraged by engagement rates that were 3x higher than our competitive benchmark on this platform. And as we continue to digitize how we work as a company, we launched our integrated vendor management system in the third quarter with the majority of our suppliers. 
This new digitally centralized portal enables us to communicate seamlessly with our suppliers on everything from digital product creation to real-time tracking on our production status and factory capacity. It also enables us to track and support areas like gender diversity at the supplier level. This is all part of our broader goal of elevating our product, streamlining how we bring them to market and making it easier for our teams to stay connected and agile, all while driving our sustainability and citizenship initiatives across everything we do. 
Touching on our work to operate with discipline to fuel growth. Our ongoing focus on balancing growth with productivity continues to be an important element of our long-term plan. And this discipline is even more critical as we make hard choices to realign our cost structure so we can position the company to emerge from COVID stronger than we came into it and pivot back to growth. In the second quarter, we announced the first major actions related to our fiscal 2021 strategic realignment plan. 
These included: first, the simplification of our organization, enabling our teams to move with greater agility; and second, an assessment of our brand portfolio, resulting in the decision to move Chaps to a fully licensed business. Today, we announced the next stage of our plan, which is focused on realigning and driving increased efficiencies across our global real estate footprint. While Jane will discuss these actions in more detail in a moment, I am pleased that we are making good progress on this multi-pronged plan. 
This gives us increased confidence in our ability to start fiscal '22 strong and with the right foundations in place. Importantly, I also want to take a moment to touch on our ongoing work to integrate citizenship and sustainability into everything we do. In the third quarter, we were proud to score 100% on the human rights campaign foundation's Corporate Equality Index and earn the designation as a Best Place To Work for LGBTQ equality. On the supply chain and sustainability front, we have leveraged this period of change to continue diversifying across geographies and strengthening our relationships with suppliers. 
From improved capacity planning to implementing diversity and inclusion training and driving best practices in sustainability. In the third quarter, we reaffirmed our commitment to achieving our science-based greenhouse gas emissions targets and joined hundreds of other organizations in calling on the U.S. Federal government to reenter the Paris Climate agreement, which the new administration recommitted to just a few weeks ago. 
We look forward to sharing further progress, including our greenhouse gas reduction road map in our 2021 report update this June. In closing, Ralph and I are optimistic about the future of our business and encouraged by the work our teams are doing to emerge from COVID stronger than we came into it. We are spending this time doing the important work of elevating our brand, investing in key strategic areas, streamlining our business and realigning our cost structure. We have made meaningful progress in delivering digital experiences for all of our consumers around the world and driving our direct-to-consumer channels, all while pursuing our goal of becoming a more equitable, diverse and sustainable company. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions."

Our third quarter results demonstrate solid execution of our strategy through this holiday season in the midst of a still challenging operating environment. We continue to focus on what we can control in this dynamic context and on positioning the company to accelerate value creation as we emerge from the pandemic. This includes investing in our powerful lifestyle brands, our digital transformation and maintaining a strong balance sheet. While also realigning and streamlining our operational and expense structures. As Patrice mentioned, today, we announced the second round of actions related to our fiscal '21 strategic realignment plan. 
This stage focuses on realigning our real estate footprint to our future strategic priorities. This includes: first, reducing our North America corporate office footprint up to 30%, along with selected reductions in Europe and Asia. As our teams embrace new ways of working and we pivot resources to our key strategic priorities; second, closing up to 10 retail locations globally. Pending ongoing landlord negotiations. Combined with the successful lease renegotiations completed year-to-date, we expect these savings to drive improved profitability in our existing fleet, while we continue to expand our brand elevating ecosystems; and third, completing the consolidation of our North American distribution center operations to drive greater efficiencies, improve sustainability and deliver a better consumer experience, with faster average delivery times and an increased focus on connected retail. Combined, these actions are expected to result in gross annualized pretax expense savings of approximately $200 million to $240 million, inclusive of our previously announced organization savings. 
While we still expect the majority of the original $180 million to $200 million in organizational savings to flow through to the bottom line, we expect to reinvest the majority of our savings related to today's actions in our future growth. We will provide any additional updates to the plan as the actions are finalized. 
Moving on to the third quarter performance. Third quarter revenues declined 18% following a 30% decline in the second quarter. Asia and North America both improved sequentially, while Europe was more significantly impacted by COVID and mandated closures and restrictions in the quarter. Global wholesale revenue declined 19%, and direct-to-consumer revenues were down 16%. Our digital business outperformed with sales up more than 20% to last year, including double-digit growth in all regions. And even more importantly, our digital operating margins continued to expand. With Q3 digital margins up 900 basis points to last year and accretive to our total company rate through a combination of higher quality of sales and operating expense leverage. 
Driving profitability in this business remains key, not only to our long-term margin accretion and shift to DTC, but also to our strategy of repositioning Ralphlauren.com as our digital flagship or the best expression of our brand online. Total company adjusted gross margin was 65.4% in the third quarter, up 320 basis points to last year. 
Gross margin expansion was primarily driven by strong AUR growth, along with favorable geographic and channel mix shifts. Around 60 basis points of this quarter's gross margin expansion was driven by unusual mix shifts due to COVID. With the remainder driven primarily by our continued global improvements in pricing and promotions. Third quarter AUR growth of 19% was above our expectations, with North America and Europe up double digits and Asia up high single digits. We continue to elevate our brands across every touch point, significantly reduced promotions and take targeted pricing increases. Our confidence in this strategy is reinforced by our continued improvement in full price penetration, larger baskets, and better-than-expected conversion, even as AUR growth has exceeded our expectations. 
Operating expenses declined 11% to last year, driven by reductions in compensation, rent and other expenses as we continue to work in new ways. Adjusted operating margin for the third quarter was 13.3%, down 70 basis points to last year. Marketing in the third quarter decreased 3%. We shifted some investments into the fourth quarter of the year as store closures and in-store shopping restrictions increased due to rising COVID cases. 
However, we accelerated select strategic marketing investments this holiday, focusing on higher-margin, new customer acquisition in North American digital and reactivation of in-person events in Asia. We expect fourth quarter marketing to increase about 50% to support our long-term brand-building activities and key events like Lunar New Year and the Australian Open. This elevated growth rate reflects both the timing shift from Q3 and lapping of last year's depressed marketing spend as COVID hit Asia, followed by Europe and North America. Moving on to segment performance. Starting with North America. 
Revenue decreased 21% to last year. Retail comps declined 21%, driven by a 30% decline in bricks-and-mortar comps. While our own digital comps improved sequentially to 9%. Brick-and-mortar comps continue to be impacted by COVID-related traffic declines with third quarter traffic down 45% and foreign tourist sales down about 85%. However, we continue to drive our strategy of improving quality of sales, with our third quarter discount rate down nearly 400 basis points. AUR up mid-teens and conversion up more than 200 basis points in our brick-and-mortar channel. Our digital commerce comps were up 9%, with total digital sales up 10% in the quarter. Underlying sales to domestic consumers grew high teens, while sales [Audio Gap] driving AUR up 22% and gross margins up more than 800 basis points to last year in the channel. 
While these deliberate reductions in promotional activity are a headwind to our digital comps in fiscal '21, we continue to invest more aggressively on new consumer acquisition during this transition period. Our accelerated investment in digital marketing generated a 27% increase in new customers during this competitive holiday quarter, exceeding our expectations. 
Year-to-date, these new consumers are transacting at higher gross margin rates and larger basket sizes and represent a higher penetration of consumers under 35. Looking ahead, we are focused on retaining these new consumers and are encouraged thus far by repeat purchase rates. Stronger sales to domestic consumers this quarter were driven by our ongoing investments in connected retailing, like Buy Online-Pickup in store, new functionality like online exchanges and   klarna   payment installments and expanded personalization and targeted marketing efforts. 
All of these initiatives helped deliver a significant increase in our full-price sales this quarter, which grew more than 130% to last year. In North America wholesale, third quarter revenue declined 22% as we continue to manage our shipments carefully and realigned inventories to demand. Full price sales declined at a more moderate rate, driven by stronger trends in core replenishment, Polo Men's, Kids and Home, while Lauren Women's remain challenged, consistent with the broader category. 
Our inventories in the marketplace were clean and well positioned at the end of the third quarter, declining more than 30% at North America wholesale. Our sales to off-price were down meaningfully as planned as we continue to significantly reduce our penetration in this channel. Moving on to Europe. 
Third quarter revenue declined 28% on a reported basis and 32% in constant currency. Europe retail comps were down 38%, with a 51% decline in our bricks-and-mortar store comps, partly offset by an acceleration in our own digital commerce, up 68%. Across Europe, our bricks-and-mortar businesses were significantly impacted by traffic headwinds, with some form of store closures or restrictions across 16 of our 17 markets in the region, ranging from curfews and weekend closures to full lockdown. Despite these pressures, our conversion improved and AUR increased 12% to last year, driven by our ongoing strategy to elevate our factory channel. Strong momentum in our own digital commerce comp was driven by our new consumer acquisition, up 112%, along with expanded connected retailing initiatives gifting programs and improve digital content. 
Europe wholesale revenues declined 22% in constant currency as we continued to limit shipments to reset our inventories to demand. COVID-related challenges at bricks-and-mortar wholesale were partially offset by stronger performance at our wholesale digital accounts, where sell-in and sell-out rates were both positive for the quarter. 
Turning to Asia. Revenue increased 14% on a reported basis and 9% in constant currency. Our Asian retail comps increased 3% with bricks-and-mortar stores up 1% and digital comps up 54%. We are encouraged that growth in the Chinese mainland is not only back to pre-COVID levels of more than 40% on a reported basis, but growing versus   Ali  . Japan also returned to positive growth in the third quarter, with sales increasing high single digits on a reported basis following a second COVID wave in Q2. However, we continue to watch Japan closely as key areas like Tokyo and Osaka entered a state of emergency in January. Overall momentum in our Asian digital businesses continued through the quarter, driven by strong performance across all key markets and channels, including our own sites and digital pure plays, where we added 4 new partners in the quarter. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with $2.8 billion in cash and investments and $1.6 billion in total debt, which compares to $1.9 billion in cash and investments and $694 million in total debt at the end of last year's third quarter. 
While we have managed our balance sheet carefully since the start of the pandemic to preserve liquidity, we are monitoring COVID conditions closely. And based on our current outlook, we are planning to reinstate our dividend in the first half of fiscal '22. Net inventory declined 4% to last year, including a 2% decline in North America, 15% decline in Europe and a 7% increase in Asia to support growth. While we have taken a highly cautious approach to managing inventory through the pandemic, overall, we are encouraged by our team's ability to both move inventories across regions and to merchandise around our core and iconic styles, as well as key COVID categories like home, loungewear and casualties.
Our increased agility is also enabling us to drive core product replenishment and shift back into pre-COVID categories as consumers start returning to more normalized trends. Looking ahead, our outlook is based on our best assessment of current coved lockdowns and trends and is subject to change given the dynamic nature of COVID developments around the world. 
We currently expect fourth quarter revenues to decline approximately mid- to high single digits, representing a meaningful sequential improvement from the first 3 quarters of the year. This includes the impact of third wave COVID lockdowns in the U.K. and Germany from the start of the quarter through approximately mid-February as well as partial closures in France, Spain and Italy. Third wave lockdowns in Japan through early March and a slow recovery in North America, where we have also seen increased cases and COVID-related traffic headwinds.. If government-mandated lockdowns or restrictions are extended from these periods or more severe restrictions are applied, this could negatively impact our current outlook. 
These COVID-related headwinds should be partially mitigated by continued momentum in China and our global digital businesses. We expect gross margins to continue expanding, albeit at a more moderate rate than the first 3 quarters of the year as we strategically repurpose full priced product from last year's coved shutdowns to our factory channels. 
Improved pricing and promotions, including targeted consumer messaging should continue to be the most durable driver followed by geographic and channel mix. We expect operating expenses to increase low single digits as we reaccelerate our brand-building investments to support growth coming out of the pandemic, largely offset by our ongoing expense discipline. 
Excluding marketing, operating expenses are expected to decline low single digits. We expect inventories to increase in the fourth quarter as we start building back into demand and lap last year's double-digit decline in response to COVID. In closing, we are encouraged by the progress our teams have made over the first 3 quarters of the year. 
As we close out this fiscal year, we are focused on offense as we leverage all of the critical work our teams have done prior to and through the pandemic to position the company for quality, long-term growth. Led by Ralph enduring vision to guide us through a still highly dynamic global environment, we are accelerating our core strategies, including first and foremost, elevating our brands, driving our company-wide digital transformation and targeting expansion in key geographies. All while adopting new ways of working and executing with discipline around our cost structures. With that, let's open up the call for your questions."

You're into the pandemic now and you've clearly and digital capabilities, you've taken meaningful steps to reset distribution cost structure. But if we look at your most important asset, the Ralph Lauren brand, can you talk to what gives you confidence in your brand health now? And is this where you want it to be in order to support strong growth coming out of the pandemic? 
And then my second question, relatedly is on how confident you are that we should see AUR growth in F '22 off the higher AUR base in a backdrop that may well be a little more promotional than during the pandemic?"

So elevating our brand and attracting high-quality of new consumers across all 3 regions, particularly in the U.S. Our top priorities and listen, will",483,"Well, thank you for your question. I'll take the first part, and then Jane will cover your AUR question. So elevating our brand and attracting high-quality of new consumers across all 3 regions, particularly in the U.S. Our top priorities and listen, will continue to be top priorities as we come out of COVID. 
The general message is we're making strong progress. A few points to kind of support that. First, our data shows that our brand has strengthened through the pandemic. Specifically, if you look at brand awareness and purchase intent, they're both up versus a year ago and continuing to progress quarter-on-quarter, with particularly encouraging progress among next-gen consumers and women. 
The second point is that we are acquiring more customers on our digital sites. We've seen 38% growth in North America, 79% growth in Europe and more than tenfold growth in Asia in terms of new customers on our sites year-to-date. This is clearly on the back of the deliberate targeted marketing plans that we've put in place across the regions. And it's also worth noting that we're not just driving higher traffic to our digital businesses, but we're also seeing -- and I think you heard it in Jane's remarks, an increase in our full-price sales. So we're bringing in new consumers that are higher ticket and higher margin. And I think that bodes well for the future for us. 
The third point is really around our social media presence, which continues to deepen and grow around the world, our followers reached a record high $45 million this quarter, and we're especially encouraged by our progress on key platforms like Instagram and TikTok, YouTube, Kakao On-Line in Asia, where, as you've likely seen, we've developed some pretty unique partnership, including our recent Bitmoji Snapchat partnership. We're also driving brand heat through product as you may have seen our recent streetwork collaboration with Clot, which is a brand founded by Edison Chen and Kevin Poon, based out of Hong Kong. 
There's a lot of excitement around these products. They virtually vaporized as we put them up for access to consumers within a few seconds, they were sold out. And now you can add them at multiples of the retail price on types like StockX. So we've been happy with the response we've seen and the contribution to overall brand heat, all this, importantly, is enabled by our strong balance sheet. Jane just touched on that, which has allowed us to continue driving our strategic priorities, like brand elevation, like investing in marketing, and also reinstate our dividend in the coming quarters. 
So together, if you put all these elements together, this gives us confidence that we're investing in the right places to elevate our brand and drive interest and heat particularly with the next-generation that we're specifically focused on. And then on your AUR question, I'll let Jane answer that."
362220,700436424,2191732,"Ralph Lauren Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Ralph Lauren Corporation","Executives","Sure. So Alex, just we are confident in our AUR growth. Certainly, because it's led by brand elevation and that brand elevation is something that we focus on this year. And are committed to continuing. And just as I look in the near term, even into Q4, we",427,"Sure. So Alex, just we are confident in our AUR growth. Certainly, because it's led by brand elevation and that brand elevation is something that we focus on this year. And are committed to continuing. And just as I look in the near term, even into Q4, we're expecting AUR growth about comparable to what you saw in Q3. But even as we come out of the pandemic and looking forward into fiscal '22, while we're not not guiding, we do expect to comp the underlying AUR growth. Now we know that there have been unusual mix benefits during COVID. 
With many of our stores and outlet doors closed during the cove period that lifted AUR. We've tried to be clear about calling that out and the impacts of COVID to our best estimates were that in Q1, underlying AUR growth was about high single digits. And in Q2 and Q3, it was in the low to mid-teens. So that is what -- that's the basis on which we expect to comp. And what we really feel good about is the long-term guidance for AUR as we move forward, which is in the low to mid single-digit range. Because our long-term drivers are still intact. 
As I said, elevating our product, our marketing and shopping experiences, which we've been talking about this year, all focused on elevating our brand. That we have the capabilities and an increasing number of tools that have proved out as we drive personalization in terms of managing promotional levels, better promotional levels, more personalization, more targeted promotions that have been very favorable in terms of driving AUR, strategic price increases. It's a muscle that I think we started in F-- in over a year ago, starting in our factory channel, and you can see that carries through today where we've seen sort of a mid-teens price increases in our outlet channels. 
As we elevate that product, put more quality in, and that's been -- we feel that we have more to go on that journey. And then, of course, there will be post-COVID continued mix benefit. As structurally, our international businesses grow faster as we move to be a more DTC oriented company that will also drive overall AUR. And certainly, the work that we've done in digital on AUR will continue to pay dividends into the future. So we feel really good about our trajectory. Understanding there will be some optics coming out of COVID. But I think we've been clear on the base and where we go in the future."

Jane, could you clarify, you mentioned shifting to offense and starting to build inventory a little to be preparing to fill demand as stores start to refill here but you did comment on continuing to elevate the brands in your AUR commentary reflects as well. You mentioned focusing on starting '22 strong. And since that's just a few weeks away for you. Can you speak to where we'll see the most important inflections in the recent P&L trends as you transition through into the early part of 2022. And then we're starting to hear some commentary around the sector from management team's thoughts on when they think they can approach pre-pandemic metrics. 
And as we look at consensus for your company, the general assumption is that the combination of all the work you've done on quality of sales to boost margins, well over $2 of net EPS, you've added from the SG&A work you've done. Consensus still has that combination landing at earnings below 2019 levels in the second half of this calendar year, so September and December quarters. I'd; love to hear your thoughts on that if you have visibility. So just help us a little bit because of the the fiscal year-end that you have here in March?"

As we do look at while we're very clear that there is some near term disruption, which likely could last into our fiscal '22 from COVID. Our long-term optimism and especially in the second half of our fiscal year is high. And so as I think about what we're going to be overlapping, we expect that store comps will be meaningfully better as we move through the year. 
And certainly, as we move through the fiscal year into the second half. And that's really contingent on on the vaccine and some of the abatement in the virus, which we believe in. And so we do believe that store comp will continue to be a positive factor as we move through fiscal '22. Certainly, our wholesale businesses have not been immune to the factors of COVID. And I think that as we emerge from the crisis, you'll also see we've been very tight on our sell-in. And sell-in has been under sell-out. 
And so there are good inventory replenishment needs. In the wholesale channel, especially as like our own channels, they come out of COVID. We feel our inventories were down 30% in North American wholesale. They have been sequentially down in Europe. So we feel good about our position. They're ready for fresh product, which we feel will be able to to fulfill and expect momentum coming out of there. 
And of course, the investments that we're making in digital, as we look across our total digital business, we expect acceleration global with our total digital business in Q4. And certainly, as we finish the cleanup in North America, and you can see that domestic consumer up high teens this quarter, will be done with a lot of the did cleanup, and you'll start to see that acceleration coming into fiscal '22. Those are the key drivers that give us optimism in '22. We do feel comfortable about our savings estimate of 100 -- the majority of $180 million to $200 million that we announced in the first realignment plan flowing through to be an EPS driver. 
And with that, our additional savings that we announced today will be used to accelerate and restart all those drivers that I talked about on sales to make sure that we have the investment funds to continue our digital expansion, elevate our brand, focus on marketing, which you've seen us approach with optimism in the fourth quarter, the marketing be up   15%  . Those are the drivers. The question is timing, but we do feel confident about, certainly in the back half of '22."

And then on the second stream, I'll be honest with you, I don't think the game ever ends on brand elevation in North America. I think we want to continuously elevate our product, elevate how we show up in marketing, elevate how we're distributed. And I think that's been part of the success of this brand historically, and that's something we will continue to drive.

So Paul, you -- what we have seen -- let me start with the second part of your question, and then I will go to flexibility and inflection in FY '22. So what we have seen in our Europe business specifically is that when the stores close, we do see an inflection in our digital business. Although it's not a one-for-one offset. So you can just see by this quarter with the shutdowns in our store in Europe in November and then into December, that suppress the total -- the total Europe growth, but we did see an acceleration in digital and high-quality digital growth. So we were very pleased with our reduction of discount rate in Europe and the very strong growth that we reported in digital in Europe. 
As I think about the volatility as we move into fiscal '22, I think you're right, it's predicated on COVID and the rollout of the vaccine. And I think what you've seen us in the past is moving with agility. And as we look at our expense structure, we've been able to reinvest in the business as we are in the fourth quarter. Elevate marketing, but do so on a timed basis and investing into high ROIC categories. And I think that, that gives us protection on the downside and protects our our profitability as we are very focused on the return of that marketing. 
We will also have more pricing flexibility as we move forward, should there be volatility in the top line. And those are the primary factors that we'll look at as we move forward and understand the variability and volatility. Also, just a shout out to our supply chain who, given the high variability of demand and inventory planning has been able to replenish and shift by category across our broad range of categories, and that's given us the capability to meet demand even though it's been highly variable based on COVID. So that gives us a lot of confidence as well."

So good foundation, clean foundation. And moving from there, we know and we see we have share opportunities in the doors we are in. And so continued momentum from share. Even this quarter, we saw share gains in Men's, in Kids and Home in the wholesale channel. 
So with that reset base, there's no reason that we -- and we are focused on comp growth in North America wholesale. And the Wholesale Dot Com is an area of wholesale that we're very optimistic about. And so we expect to grow wholesale in their digital -- in the digital business. And then we've been clear that off-price, and especially this quarter, off-price was down meaningfully. Our full-price wholesale on a sell-in basis and sell-out basis were -- so in a selling basis was much better than what we reported in aggregate for North America wholesale. I expect the off-price cleanout as we exit Q4, to be about done, and it will be repositioned to what it should be, which is a channel that we can liquidate excess in. And so that pressure that you're seeing from off-price will abate in fiscal '22. 
So we feel good about the foundation of where we'll be in wholesale. It will be a smaller channel. As you know, we announced the change of Chaps to licensing. Chaps is almost a completely wholesale business in North America. And so you'll see that part shrink the wholesale base. But we feel confident about the value creation of that change. And we feel good about the positions that we're in and how we move forward and focus on growing share in that channel and maximizing pure plays in digital."

Our third quarter performance reflected strong underlying progress on our path to quality, sustainable long-term growth. Overall, revenues improved sequentially and were in line with our expectations.  
Stronger-than-expected recovery in Asia was offset by the impact of continued COVID-19 resurgences across Europe, while North America was roughly in line with our expectations, even with additional COVID pressures. Meanwhile, our focus on brand elevation, improved quality of sales and cost discipline drove better-than-expected gross and operating margin expansion in the quarter with double-digit AUR growth and digital profitability, exceeding our expectations.  
And while COVID is likely to remain a near-term headwind, there is reason to be hopeful as we start the new year and vaccines begin to roll out. Ralph and I are incredibly proud of the dedication, resilience and agility our teams have shown in not only managing through the pandemic, but also positioning the company to emerge stronger than we came into it. 
As part of this, we balanced reset activities with an acceleration of our core strategies, including strengthening our brand and bolstering our marketing and new customer acquisition, expanding key categories in international markets, scaling our connected retail offerings globally, continuing to prune non-elevating distribution and further realigning our cost structure. These actions are consistent with the 5 strategic priorities that we laid out as part of our long-term plan prior to COVID.  
These include: first, win over a new generation of consumers; second, energize core products and accelerate high potential underdeveloped categories; third, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels; fourth, lead with digital across all activities; and fifth, operate with discipline to fuel growth. I will touch on a few of these in a moment.  
But first, let me provide some updates specific to this quarter's performance. As we anticipated at the start of the holiday season, the global retail environment remained volatile due to the pandemic and other macro factors. Nevertheless, apart from the impact of COVID resurgences, we were encouraged by several bright spots in each of our regions this quarter, led notably by Asia and our digital channels globally.  
Asia, which we view in many ways as a blueprint for our progress in other markets, grew 14% to last year. This was driven by continued momentum in the Chinese mainland, with more than 40% reported growth. Japan returned to positive growth in the quarter, while Korea was up double digits. In North America, performance continued to improve sequentially and was in line with our expectations despite rising COVID cases in many of our key markets.  
Our strategy of elevating our brand across digital, department stores and off-price is well underway, and we're still on track to complete the significant portion of this work in fiscal '21. Europe was the most challenging segment this quarter, with the majority of our stores closed for a full month of the key holiday period. In addition to the government-mandated shutdowns, there were also significant operating and travel restrictions throughout the quarter, which have continued into our fourth quarter to date.  
In many ways, the second and third wave restrictions have been more disruptive than the first wave of shutdowns we experienced last spring as they vary greatly by market and by day. Third quarter traffic headwinds were partly mitigated by a strong acceleration across our own and wholesale digital channels in Europe.  
This was driven by our expanded connected retail programs, exclusive capsules with partners like MyTheresa and ASOS, holiday campaigns and influencer activations. We also leveraged this period of disruption to continue our long-term brand elevation in the region, acquiring new high-value consumers and driving increased AUR despite a highly promotional competitive environment. These actions should help position our brands for healthier recovery and ecosystem expansion once we emerge from COVID.  
By channel, digital continues to be a key driver of our performance, with digital sales accelerating in all 3 regions this quarter. We continue to scale up our connected retail offerings and emphasize gifting in key product categories for holiday. These included our iconic sweaters, Holiday Bear programs, home and loungewear that are resonating with consumers today. 
In our brick-and-mortar stores, as I mentioned, traffic was challenged due to COVID, particularly in Europe and North America. But we were strongly encouraged that our teams were able to deliver higher conversion in these channels with double-digit AUR growth and reduced discounting, while also starting to leverage our new connected retail offerings this holiday.  
We also continue to invest in targeted new store expansion in key growth markets with 23 new stores this quarter, primarily in Asia. Within our wholesale business, we were encouraged by continued sequential progress across regions, particularly on Wholesale Dot Com. We still expect pressure on our reported sell-in trends in the near-term as we deliberately exited department store doors early in the pandemic and prioritized inventory management in this environment. As a reminder, this near-term discipline is integral to building price harmonization across our ecosystem and to protecting the elevation in long-term equity of our brands.  
Turning to our efforts to win over a new generation. In the third quarter, we continued to ramp up our personalization initiatives, shift our brand-building efforts increasingly toward digital, and leverage the authentic values that have been central to our brand since Ralph started this company more than 50 years ago. Let me touch on some of the highlights from this quarter.
First, we launched a fully integrated and diverse Family Is Who You Love holiday campaign across social media, our own stores and digital sites and wholesale environments. We also focused more than ever on creating innovative digital experiences that immerse the consumer in the world of Ralph Lauren. These included our groundbreaking virtual flagship store experiences in Beverly Hills, New York and Paris, where consumers around the world can experience our brands in the full breadth of our assortment in a way that was previously only possible by walking into one of our beautiful stores. Amplifying the reach of our flagships to a global audience, digital traffic in these virtual stores was 8x greater than the foot traffic in these physical stores over the same period.  
We were also the first apparel brand to launch Snapchat's logo scan this holiday. This allows consumers to scan our iconic Polo Pony logo from any surface, including holding items, ads, shopping bags and more. To trigger an augmented reality experience, that brings them into the world of Ralph Lauren and ultimately transact on our own site. And in Asia, we were excited to launch our livestream selling event with 360-degree activation for Singles' Day, delivering more than 120 million impressions.  
We're investing in these new forms of selling, including social commerce, which we expect to become a greater part of the digital shopping experience long term. 
Looking ahead, we will continue to partner with celebrities and influencers who embody our core values along with being a part of key moments around the world. More recently, Ralph and I were particularly proud of our brand's participation in the U.S. Presidential inauguration. 
Overall, we are encouraged by the momentum we are seeing in consumer engagement across generations.  Notably, our brand awareness and purchase intent have accelerated since the start of the pandemic and we are seeing particularly strong growth from consumers under 35 in women. We added more than 1 million new consumers through our direct-to-consumer platforms alone in Q3. And our total social media followers reached 45 million in the quarter. This was led by continued momentum across key platforms like Instagram, TikTok, YouTube and Snapchat, where our Ralph Lauren Bitmoji Collection is connecting strongly with Gen Z consumers.  
Since the launch last August, over 20 million users has addressed their Bitmoji and Ralph Lauren and tried on the collection over 550 million times. This takes me to our long-term priority of leading with digital. 
Fiscal '21 continues to be a transformational year as we digitize our consumer platform and experiences and how we work as a company. On the consumer-facing side, the continued acceleration of connected retail is essential to creating the best possible experience for our consumers and to our long-term growth. Building on our accelerated connected retail launches in the first half of the year, in the third quarter, we added mobile point of sales across our North American retail fleet, appointment scheduling and curated personal collections online, all while continuing to expand our digital clienteling programs globally. We also launched our Hong Kong digital flagship in time for holiday, which is an important part of our broader ecosystem strategy as consumers shop and travel in new ways.  
In addition to strengthening our digital commerce capabilities, we continue to build our social commerce presence and expand our partnerships with influential digital retailers around the world. Our teams executed a successful global launch campaign this holiday with FARFETCH. We delivered lifestyle content tailored to next-generation consumers, reaching over 15 million impressions globally, including the first ever editorial experience within the FARFETCH app.  
We were encouraged by engagement rates that were 3x higher than our competitive benchmark on this platform. And as we continue to digitize how we work as a company, we launched our integrated vendor management system in the third quarter with the majority of our suppliers.  
This new digitally centralized portal enables us to communicate seamlessly with our suppliers on everything from digital product creation to real-time tracking on our production status and factory capacity. It also enables us to track and support areas like gender diversity at the supplier level. This is all part of our broader goal of elevating our product, streamlining how we bring them to market and making it easier for our teams to stay connected and agile, all while driving our sustainability and citizenship initiatives across everything we do.  
Touching on our work to operate with discipline to fuel growth. Our ongoing focus on balancing growth with productivity continues to be an important element of our long-term plan. And this discipline is even more critical as we make hard choices to realign our cost structure so we can position the company to emerge from COVID stronger than we came into it and pivot back to growth. In the second quarter, we announced the first major actions related to our fiscal 2021 strategic realignment plan.  
These included: first, the simplification of our organization, enabling our teams to move with greater agility; and second, an assessment of our brand portfolio, resulting in the decision to move Chaps to a fully licensed business. Today, we announce the next stage of our plan, which is focused on realigning and driving increased efficiencies across our global real estate footprint. While Jane will discuss these actions in more detail in a moment, I am pleased that we are making good progress on this multi-pronged plan.  
This gives us increased confidence in our ability to start fiscal '22 strong and with the right foundations in place. Importantly, I also want to take a moment to touch on our ongoing work to integrate citizenship and sustainability into everything we do. In the third quarter, we were proud to score 100% on the human rights campaign foundation's Corporate Equality Index and earn the designation as a best place to work for LGBTQ equality. On the supply chain and sustainability front, we have leveraged this period of change to continue diversifying across geographies and strengthening our relationships with suppliers.  
From improved capacity planning to implementing diversity and inclusion training and driving best practices in sustainability. In the third quarter, we reaffirmed our commitment to achieving our science-based greenhouse gas emissions targets and joined hundreds of other organizations in calling on the U.S. Federal government to reenter the Paris Climate Agreement, which the new administration recommitted to just a few weeks ago.  
We look forward to sharing further progress, including our greenhouse gas reduction road map in our 2021 report update this June. 
In closing, Ralph and I are optimistic about the future of our business and encouraged by the work our teams are doing to emerge from COVID stronger than we came into it. We are spending this time doing the important work of elevating our brand, investing in key strategic areas, streamlining our business and realigning our cost structure. We have made meaningful progress in delivering digital experiences for all of our consumers around the world and driving our direct-to-consumer channels, all while pursuing our goal of becoming a more equitable, diverse and sustainable company.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions."

Our third quarter results demonstrate solid execution of our strategy through this holiday season in the midst of a still challenging operating environment. We continue to focus on what we can control in this dynamic context and on positioning the company to accelerate value creation as we emerge from the pandemic. This includes investing in our powerful lifestyle brands, our digital transformation and maintaining a strong balance sheet. While also realigning and streamlining our operational and expense structures. 
As Patrice mentioned, today, we announced the second round of actions related to our fiscal '21 strategic realignment plan.  This stage focuses on realigning our real estate footprint to our future strategic priorities. This includes: first, reducing our North America corporate office footprint up to 30%, along with selected reductions in Europe and Asia, as our teams embrace new ways of working and we pivot resources to our key strategic priorities; second, closing up to 10 retail locations globally. Pending ongoing landlord negotiations. Combined with the successful lease renegotiations completed year-to-date, we expect these savings to drive improved profitability in our existing fleet, while we continue to expand our brand elevating ecosystems; and third, completing the consolidation of our North American distribution center operations to drive greater efficiencies, improve sustainability and deliver a better consumer experience. with faster average delivery times and an increased focus on connected retail. 
Combined, these actions are expected to result in gross annualized pretax expense savings of approximately $200 million to $240 million, inclusive of our previously announced organization savings.  
While we still expect the majority of the original $180 million to $200 million in organizational savings to flow through to the bottom line, we expect to reinvest the majority of our savings related to today's actions in our future growth. We will provide any additional updates to the plan as the actions are finalized.  
Moving on to the third quarter performance. Third quarter revenues declined 18% following a 30% decline in the second quarter. Asia and North America both improved sequentially, while Europe was more significantly impacted by COVID and mandated closures and restrictions in the quarter. Global wholesale revenue declined 19%, and direct-to-consumer revenues were down 16%. Our digital business outperformed with sales up more than 20% to last year, including double-digit growth in all regions. And even more importantly, our digital operating margins continued to expand. With Q3 digital margins up 900 basis points to last year and accretive to our total company rate through a combination of higher quality of sales and operating expense leverage.  
Driving profitability in this business remains key, not only to our long-term margin accretion and shift to DTC, but also to our strategy of repositioning ralphlauren.com as our digital flagship or the best expression of our brand online. Total company adjusted gross margin was 65.4% in the third quarter, up 320 basis points to last year.  
Gross margin expansion was primarily driven by strong AUR growth, along with favorable geographic and channel mix shifts. Around 60 basis points of this quarter's gross margin expansion was driven by unusual mix shifts due to COVID. With the remainder driven primarily by our continued global improvements in pricing and promotions. Third quarter AUR growth of 19% was above our expectations, with North America and Europe up double digits and Asia up high single digits. We continue to elevate our brands across every touch point, significantly reduced promotions and take targeted pricing increases. Our confidence in this strategy is reinforced by our continued improvement in full price penetration, larger baskets, and better-than-expected conversion, even as AUR growth has exceeded our expectations.  
Operating expenses declined 11% to last year, driven by reductions in compensation, rent and other expenses as we continue to work in new ways. Adjusted operating margin for the third quarter was 13.3%, down 70 basis points to last year. Marketing in the third quarter decreased 3%. We shifted some investments into the fourth quarter of the year as store closures and in-store shopping restrictions increased due to rising COVID cases.  
However, we accelerated select strategic marketing investments this holiday, focusing on higher-margin, new customer acquisition in North American digital and reactivation of in-person events in Asia. We expect fourth quarter marketing to increase about 50% to support our long-term brand-building activities and key events like Lunar New Year and the Australian Open. This elevated growth rate reflects both the timing shift from Q3 and lapping of last year's depressed marketing spend as COVID hit Asia, followed by Europe and North America. 
Moving on to segment performance. Starting with North America.  Revenue decreased 21% to last year. Retail comps declined 21%, driven by a 30% decline in bricks-and-mortar comps. While our own digital comps improved sequentially to 9%. Brick-and-mortar comps continue to be impacted by COVID-related traffic declines with third quarter traffic down 45% and foreign tourist sales down about 85%. However, we continue to drive our strategy of improving quality of sales, with our third quarter discount rate down nearly 400 basis points. AUR up mid-teens and conversion up more than 200 basis points in our brick-and-mortar channel. 
Our digital commerce comps were up 9%, with total digital sales up 10% in the quarter. Underlying sales to domestic consumers grew high teens, while sales to international daigou consumers declined double digits to last year as planned. We reduced our site wide promotions by 52 days compared to the prior year, as we continue to elevate our digital experience, driving AUR up 22% and gross margins up more than 800 basis points to last year in the channel.  
While these deliberate reductions in promotional activity are a headwind to our digital comps in fiscal '21, we continue to invest more aggressively on new consumer acquisition during this transition period. Our accelerated investment in digital marketing generated a 27% increase in new customers during this competitive holiday quarter, exceeding our expectations.  
Year-to-date, these new consumers are transacting at higher gross margin rates and larger basket sizes and represent a higher penetration of consumers under 35. Looking ahead, we are focused on retaining these new consumers and are encouraged thus far by repeat purchase rates. Stronger sales to domestic consumers this quarter were driven by our ongoing investments in connected retailing, like Buy Online-Pickup in store, new functionality like online exchanges and  Klarna payment installments and expanded personalization and targeted marketing efforts. All of these initiatives helped deliver a significant increase in our full-price sales this quarter, which grew more than 130% to last year. 
In North America wholesale, third quarter revenue declined 22% as we continue to manage our shipments carefully and realigned inventories to demand. Full price sales declined at a more moderate rate, driven by stronger trends in core replenishment, Polo men's, kids and home, while Lauren Women's remain challenged, consistent with the broader category.  
Our inventories in the marketplace were clean and well positioned at the end of the third quarter, declining more than 30% at North America wholesale. Our sales to off-price were down meaningfully as planned as we continue to significantly reduce our penetration in this channel. 
Moving on to Europe.  Third quarter revenue declined 28% on a reported basis and 32% in constant currency. Europe retail comps were down 38%, with a 51% decline in our bricks-and-mortar store comps, partly offset by an acceleration in our own digital commerce, up 68%. 
Across Europe, our bricks-and-mortar businesses were significantly impacted by traffic headwinds, with some form of store closures or restrictions across 16 of our 17 markets in the region, ranging from curfews and weekend closures to full lockdown. Despite these pressures, our conversion improved and AUR increased 12% to last year, driven by our ongoing strategy to elevate our factory channel. 
Strong momentum in our own digital commerce comp was driven by our new consumer acquisition, up 112%, along with expanded connected retailing initiatives gifting programs and improve digital content.  
Europe wholesale revenues declined 22% in constant currency as we continued to limit shipments to reset our inventories to demand. COVID-related challenges at bricks-and-mortar wholesale were partially offset by stronger performance at our wholesale digital accounts, where sell-in and sell-out rates were both positive for the quarter.  
Turning to Asia. Revenue increased 14% on a reported basis and 9% in constant currency. Our Asian retail comps increased 3% with bricks-and-mortar stores up 1% and digital comps up 54%. We are encouraged that growth in the Chinese mainland is not only back to pre-COVID levels of more than 40% on a reported basis, but growing versus [LLY]. 
Japan also returned to positive growth in the third quarter, with sales increasing high single digits on a reported basis following a second COVID wave in Q2. However, we continue to watch Japan closely as key areas like Tokyo and Osaka entered a state of emergency in January. 
Overall momentum in our Asian digital businesses continued through the quarter, driven by strong performance across all key markets and channels, including our own sites and digital pure plays, where we added 4 new partners in the quarter.  
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with $2.8 billion in cash and investments and $1.6 billion in total debt, which compares to $1.9 billion in cash and investments and $694 million in total debt at the end of last year's third quarter.  
While we have managed our balance sheet carefully since the start of the pandemic to preserve liquidity, we are monitoring COVID conditions closely. And based on our current outlook, we are planning to reinstate our dividend in the first half of fiscal '22. 
Net inventory declined 4% to last year, including a 2% decline in North America, 15% decline in Europe and a 7% increase in Asia to support growth. While we have taken a highly cautious approach to managing inventory through the pandemic, overall, we are encouraged by our team's ability to both move inventories across regions and to merchandise around our core and iconic styles, as well as key COVID categories like home, loungewear and casual tees.
Our increased agility is also enabling us to drive core product replenishment and shift back into pre-COVID categories as consumers start returning to more normalized trends. 
Looking ahead, our outlook is based on our best assessment of current coved lockdowns and trends and is subject to change given the dynamic nature of COVID developments around the world.  
We currently expect fourth quarter revenues to decline approximately mid- to high single digits, representing a meaningful sequential improvement from the first 3 quarters of the year. This includes the impact of third wave COVID lockdowns in the U.K. and Germany from the start of the quarter through approximately mid-February as well as partial closures in France, Spain and Italy. Third wave lockdowns in Japan through early March and a slow recovery in North America, where we have also seen increased cases and COVID-related traffic headwinds. If government-mandated lockdowns or restrictions are extended from these periods or more severe restrictions are applied, this could negatively impact our current outlook.  
These COVID-related headwinds should be partially mitigated by continued momentum in China and our global digital businesses. 
We expect gross margins to continue expanding, albeit at a more moderate rate than the first 3 quarters of the year as we strategically repurpose full price product from last year's COVID shutdowns to our factory channels.  
Improved pricing and promotions, including targeted consumer messaging should continue to be the most durable driver followed by geographic and channel mix. We expect operating expenses to increase low single digits as we reaccelerate our brand-building investments to support growth coming out of the pandemic, largely offset by our ongoing expense discipline.  
Excluding marketing, operating expenses are expected to decline low single digits. We expect inventories to increase in the fourth quarter as we start building back into demand and lap last year's double-digit decline in response to COVID. 
In closing, we are encouraged by the progress our teams have made over the first 3 quarters of the year.  
As we close out this fiscal year, we are focused on offense as we leverage all of the critical work our teams have done prior to and through the pandemic to position the company for quality, long-term growth. Led by Ralph's enduring vision to guide us through a still highly dynamic global environment, we are accelerating our core strategies, including first and foremost, elevating our brands, driving our company-wide digital transformation and targeting expansion in key geographies. All while adopting new ways of working and executing with discipline around our cost structures. With that, let's open up the call for your questions."

We're year into the pandemic now and you've clearly expanded digital capabilities, you've taken meaningful steps to reset distribution cost structure. But if we look at your most important asset, the Ralph Lauren brand, can you talk to what gives you confidence in your brand health now? And is this where you want it to be in order to support strong growth coming out of the pandemic? 
And then my second question, relatedly is on how confident you are that we should see AUR growth in F '22 off the higher AUR base in a backdrop that may well be a little more promotional than during the pandemic?"

I'll take the first part, and then Jane will cover your AUR question. So elevating our brand and attracting high-quality new consumers across all 3 regions, particularly in the U.S. Our top priorities, and listen, will continue to be top priorities as we come out of COVID. 
The general message is we're making strong progress. A few points to kind of support that. First, our data shows that our brand has strengthened through the pandemic. Specifically, if you look at brand awareness and purchase intent, they're both up versus a year ago and continuing to progress quarter-on-quarter, with particularly encouraging progress among next-gen consumers and women. 
The second point is that we are acquiring more customers on our digital sites. We've seen 38% growth in North America, 79% growth in Europe and more than tenfold growth in Asia in terms of new customers on our sites year-to-date. This is clearly on the back of the deliberate targeted marketing plans that we've put in place across the regions. And it's also worth noting that we're not just driving higher traffic to our digital businesses, but we're also seeing -- and I think you heard it in Jane's remarks, an increase in our full-price sales. So we're bringing in new consumers that are higher ticket and higher margin. And I think that bodes well for the future for us. 
The third point is really around our social media presence, which continues to deepen and grow around the world, our followers reached a record high 45 million this quarter, and we're especially encouraged by our progress on key platforms like Instagram and TikTok, YouTube, Kakao On-Line in Asia, where, as you've likely seen, we've developed some pretty unique partnership, including our recent Bitmoji Snapchat partnership. We're also driving brand heat through product as you may have seen our recent street work collaboration with Clot, which is a brand founded by Edison Chen and Kevin Poon, based out of Hong Kong. 
There's a lot of excitement around these products. They virtually vaporized as we put them up for access to consumers within a few seconds, they were sold out. And now you can add them at multiples of the retail price on types like StockX. So we've been happy with the response we've seen and the contribution to overall brand heat. All this, importantly, is enabled by our strong balance sheet. Jane just touched on that, which has allowed us to continue driving our strategic priorities, like brand elevation, like investing in marketing, and also reinstate our dividend in the coming quarters. 
So together, if you put all these elements together, this gives us confidence that we're investing in the right places to elevate our brand and drive interest and heat particularly with the next-generation that we're specifically focused on. And then on your AUR question, I'll let Jane answer that."

Certainly, because it's led by brand elevation and that brand elevation is something that we focused on this year. And are committed to continuing. And just as I look in the near term, even into Q4, we're expecting AUR growth about comparable to what you saw in Q3. But even as we come out of the pandemic and looking forward into fiscal '22, while we're not guiding, we do expect to comp the underlying AUR growth. Now we know that there have been unusual mix benefits during COVID. 
With many of our stores and outlet doors closed during the cove period that lifted AUR. We've tried to be clear about calling that out and the impacts of COVID to our best estimates were that in Q1, underlying AUR growth was about high single digits. And in Q2 and Q3, it was in the low to mid-teens. So that is what -- that's the basis on which we expect to comp. And what we really feel good about is the long-term guidance for AUR as we move forward, which is in the low to mid-single-digit range. Because our long-term drivers are still intact. 
As I said, elevating our product, our marketing and shopping experiences, which we've been talking about this year, all focused on elevating our brand. That we have the capabilities and an increasing number of tools that have proved out as we drive personalization in terms of managing promotional levels, better promotional levels, more personalization, more targeted promotions that have been very favorable in terms of driving AUR. Strategic price increases. It's a muscle that I think we started in F-- in over a year ago, starting in our factory channel, and you can see that carries through today where we've seen sort of a mid-teens price increases in our outlet channels. 
As we elevate that product, put more quality in, and that's been -- we feel that we have more to go on that journey. And then, of course, there will be post-COVID continued mix benefits. As structurally, our international businesses grow faster as we move to be a more DTC oriented company that will also drive overall AUR. And certainly, the work that we've done in digital on AUR will continue to pay dividends into the future. So we feel really good about our trajectory. Understanding there will be some optics coming out of COVID. But I think we've been clear on the base and where we go in the future."

And as we look at consensus for your company, the general assumption is that the combination of all the work you've done on quality of sales to boost margins, well over $2 of net EPS, you've added from the SG&A work you've done. Consensus still has that combination landing at earnings below 2019 levels in the second half of this calendar year, so September and December quarters. I'd love to hear your thoughts on that if you have visibility. So just help us a little bit because of the fiscal year-end that you have here in March?"

As we do look at while we're very clear that there is some near term disruption, which likely could last into our fiscal '22 from COVID. Our long-term optimism and especially in the second half of our fiscal year is high. And so as I think about what we're going to be overlapping, we expect that store comps will be meaningfully better as we move through the year. 
And certainly, as we move through the fiscal year into the second half. And that's really contingent on the vaccine and some of the abatement in the virus, which we believe in. And so we do believe that store comp will continue to be a positive factor as we move through fiscal '22. Certainly, our wholesale businesses have not been immune to the factors of COVID. And I think that as we emerge from the crisis, you'll also see we've been very tight on our sell-in. And sell-in has been under sell-out. 
And so there are good inventory replenishment needs. In the wholesale channel, especially as like our own channels, they come out of COVID. We feel -- our inventories were down 30% in North American wholesale. They have been sequentially down in Europe. So we feel good about our position. They're ready for fresh product, which we feel will be able to fulfill and expect momentum coming out of there. 
And of course, the investments that we're making in digital, as we look across our total digital business, we expect acceleration global with our total digital business in Q4. And certainly, as we finish the cleanup in North America, and you can see that domestic consumer up high teens this quarter, will be done with a lot of the daigou cleanup, and you'll start to see that acceleration coming into fiscal '22. Those are the key drivers that give us optimism in '22. We do feel comfortable about our savings estimate of 100 -- the majority of $180 million to $200 million that we announced in the first realignment plan flowing through to be an EPS driver. 
And with that, our additional savings that we announced today will be used to accelerate and restart all those drivers that I talked about on sales to make sure that we have the investment funds to continue our digital expansion, elevate our brand, focus on marketing, which you've seen us approach with optimism in the fourth quarter, the marketing be up 50%. Those are the drivers. The question is timing, but we do feel confident about, certainly in the back half of '22."

So listen, I think there are 2 streams to think about when we look at North America. The first stream of work is the hard resets that we are doing on off-price penetration, shutting down over 230 wholesale doors and the daigou customer on ralphlauren.com North America that Jane referred to. On that one, assuming the game ends in 9 innings and doesn't go over time, we're likely at inning #7 on those. 
So we expect -- we probably need a quarter -- one more quarter, Q4, maybe a bit of Q1 to have that completed across these 3 areas. And then on the second stream, I'll be honest with you, I don't think the game ever ends on brand elevation in North America. I think we want to continuously elevate our product, elevate how we show up in marketing, elevate how we're distributed. And I think that's been part of the success of this brand historically, and that's something we will continue to drive. 
So I probably have us on the first inning with a never-ending game for that work stream."

Certainly, investment in China, where this year alone, we've opened 85 stores. We intend to grow stores -- new stores. 
We intend to continue that journey as we move forward. We believe we have distribution opportunities in Asia and also more targeted distribution opportunities in Europe and North America, and we will use the savings for that as well as increased marketing. We know that our brand and the elevation of the brand is so much of what is pulling the whole ecosystem up. So continuation of increased marketing across our brand."

So Paul, you -- what we have seen -- let me start with the second part of your question, and then I will go to flexibility and inflection in FY '22. So what we have seen in our Europe business specifically is that when the stores close, we do see an inflection in our digital business. Although it's not a one-for-one offset. So you can just see by this quarter with the shutdowns in our store in Europe in November and then into December, that suppress the total -- the total Europe growth, but we did see an acceleration in digital and high-quality digital growth. So we were very pleased with our reduction of discount rate in Europe and the very strong growth that we reported in digital in Europe. 
As I think about the volatility as we move into fiscal '22, I think you're right, it's predicated on COVID and the rollout of the vaccine. And I think what you've seen us in the past is moving with agility. And as we look at our expense structure, we've been able to reinvest in the business as we are in the fourth quarter. Elevate marketing, but do so on a timed basis and investing into high ROIC categories. And I think that, that gives us protection on the downside and protects our profitability as we are very focused on the return of that marketing. 
We will also have more pricing flexibility as we move forward, should there be volatility in the top line. And those are the primary factors that we'll look at as we move forward and understand the variability and volatility. Also, just a shout out to our supply chain who, given the high variability of demand and inventory planning has been able to replenish and shift by category across our broad range of categories, and that's given us the capability to meet demand even though it's been highly variable based on COVID. So that gives us a lot of confidence as well."

I think pretty soon, we won't be talking about digital and brick-and-mortar separately because they're now so intertwined. But as you look at these new ways of selling in the context of connected retail, we're expecting that to be an accelerator for our digital performance. 
And so a lot of that's been pioneered in Europe. A lot of that is what you see in these very strong numbers this quarter, where we're up 60 -- I believe 68% digital commerce in Europe. And I think that is a sustainable set of capabilities that will help us continue to accelerate progress on that front."

You've got initiatives in place to shrink the door count and does it rationalize some of the lower margin revenue streams you had there? 
I guess when all is said and done, and we're on the other side of this, how much of a smaller wholesale business do you expect to be managing, if at all? 
And then how does that kind of translate into operating margins? Are you planning a smaller, more profitable channel? Are you kind of trying to get back to where you were? Just kind of curious at a high level how you think about it?"

So just Ike, as we step back, I really believe that we should look at wholesale in 3 buckets. Obviously, this year, we announced a significant cleanup in North America wholesale, where we exited about 230 doors in North America, wholesale, will be through that. So good foundation, clean foundation. And moving from there, we know and we see we have share opportunities in the doors we are in. And so continued momentum from share. Even this quarter, we saw share gains in Men's, in Kids and Home in the wholesale channel. 
So with that reset base, there's no reason that we -- and we are focused on comp growth in North America wholesale. And the Wholesale Dot Com is an area of wholesale that we're very optimistic about. And so we expect to grow wholesale in their digital -- in the digital business. And then we've been clear that off-price, and especially this quarter, off-price was down meaningfully. Our full-price wholesale on a sell-in basis and sell-out basis were -- in a sell-in basis was much better than what we reported in aggregate for North America wholesale. I expect the off-price cleanout as we exit Q4, to be about done, and it will be repositioned to what it should be, which is a channel that we can liquidate excess in. And so that pressure that you're seeing from off-price will abate in fiscal '22. 
So we feel good about the foundation of where we'll be in wholesale. It will be a smaller channel. As you know, we announced the change of Chaps to licensing. Chaps is almost a completely wholesale business in North America. And so you'll see that part shrink the wholesale base. But we feel confident about the value creation of that change. And we feel good about the positions that we're in and how we move forward and focus on growing share in that channel and maximizing pure plays in digital."

And is ready to be leveraged from a growth standpoint. So we feel good about, it has multiple drivers across all the vectors. And the most work has been on the North America site.

Our third quarter performance reflected strong underlying progress on our path to quality, sustainable long-term growth. Overall, revenues improved sequentially and were in line with our expectations.  
Stronger-than-expected recovery in Asia was offset by the impact of continued COVID-19 resurgences across Europe, while North America was roughly in line with our expectations, even with additional COVID pressures. Meanwhile, our focus on brand elevation, improved quality of sales and cost discipline drove better-than-expected gross and operating margin expansion in the quarter with double-digit AUR growth and digital profitability, exceeding our expectations.  
And while COVID is likely to remain a near-term headwind, there is reason to be hopeful as we start the new year and vaccines begin to roll out. Ralph and I are incredibly proud of the dedication, resilience and agility our teams have shown in not only managing through the pandemic, but also positioning the company to emerge stronger than we came into it. 
As part of this, we balanced reset activities with an acceleration of our core strategies, including strengthening our brand and bolstering our marketing and new customer acquisition, expanding key categories in international markets, scaling our connected retail offerings globally, continuing to prune non-elevating distribution and further realigning our cost structure. These actions are consistent with the 5 strategic priorities that we laid out as part of our long-term plan prior to COVID.  
These include: first, win over a new generation of consumers; second, energize core products and accelerate high potential underdeveloped categories; third, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels; fourth, lead with digital across all activities; and fifth, operate with discipline to fuel growth. I will touch on a few of these in a moment.  
But first, let me provide some updates specific to this quarter's performance. As we anticipated at the start of the holiday season, the global retail environment remained volatile due to the pandemic and other macro factors. Nevertheless, apart from the impact of COVID resurgences, we were encouraged by several bright spots in each of our regions this quarter, led notably by Asia and our digital channels globally.  
Asia, which we view in many ways as a blueprint for our progress in other markets, grew 14% to last year. This was driven by continued momentum in the Chinese mainland, with more than 40% reported growth. Japan returned to positive growth in the quarter, while Korea was up double digits. In North America, performance continued to improve sequentially and was in line with our expectations despite rising COVID cases in many of our key markets.  
Our strategy of elevating our brand across digital, department stores and off-price is well underway, and we're still on track to complete the significant portion of this work in fiscal '21. Europe was the most challenging segment this quarter, with the majority of our stores closed for a full month of the key holiday period. In addition to the government-mandated shutdowns, there were also significant operating and travel restrictions throughout the quarter, which have continued into our fourth quarter to date.  
In many ways, the second and third wave restrictions have been more disruptive than the first wave of shutdowns we experienced last spring as they vary greatly by market and by day. Third quarter traffic headwinds were partly mitigated by a strong acceleration across our own and wholesale digital channels in Europe.  
This was driven by our expanded connected retail programs, exclusive capsules with partners like MyTheresa and ASOS, holiday campaigns and influencer activations. We also leveraged this period of disruption to continue our long-term brand elevation in the region, acquiring new high-value consumers and driving increased AUR despite a highly promotional competitive environment. These actions should help position our brands for healthier recovery and ecosystem expansion once we emerge from COVID.  
By channel, digital continues to be a key driver of our performance, with digital sales accelerating in all 3 regions this quarter. We continue to scale up our connected retail offerings and emphasize gifting in key product categories for holiday. These included our iconic sweaters, Holiday Bear programs, home and loungewear that are resonating with consumers today. 
In our brick-and-mortar stores, as I mentioned, traffic was challenged due to COVID, particularly in Europe and North America. But we were strongly encouraged that our teams were able to deliver higher conversion in these channels with double-digit AUR growth and reduced discounting, while also starting to leverage our new connected retail offerings this holiday.  
We also continue to invest in targeted new store expansion in key growth markets with 23 new stores this quarter, primarily in Asia. Within our wholesale business, we were encouraged by continued sequential progress across regions, particularly on Wholesale Dot Com. We still expect pressure on our reported sell-in trends in the near-term as we deliberately exited department store doors early in the pandemic and prioritized inventory management in this environment. As a reminder, this near-term discipline is integral to building price harmonization across our ecosystem and to protecting the elevation in long-term equity of our brands.  
Turning to our efforts to win over a new generation. In the third quarter, we continued to ramp up our personalization initiatives, shift our brand-building efforts increasingly toward digital, and leverage the authentic values that have been central to our brand since Ralph started this company more than 50 years ago. Let me touch on some of the highlights from this quarter.
First, we launched a fully integrated and diverse Family Is Who You Love holiday campaign across social media, our own stores and digital sites and wholesale environments. We also focused more than ever on creating innovative digital experiences that immerse the consumer in the world of Ralph Lauren. These included our groundbreaking virtual flagship store experiences in Beverly Hills, New York and Paris, where consumers around the world can experience our brands in the full breadth of our assortment in a way that was previously only possible by walking into one of our beautiful stores. Amplifying the reach of our flagships to a global audience, digital traffic in these virtual stores was 8x greater than the foot traffic in these physical stores over the same period.  
We were also the first apparel brand to launch Snapchat's logo scan this holiday. This allows consumers to scan our iconic Polo Pony logo from any surface, including holding items, ads, shopping bags and more. To trigger an augmented reality experience, that brings them into the world of Ralph Lauren and ultimately transact on our own site. And in Asia, we were excited to launch our livestream selling event with 360-degree activation for Singles' Day, delivering more than 120 million impressions.  
We're investing in these new forms of selling, including social commerce, which we expect to become a greater part of the digital shopping experience long term. 
Looking ahead, we will continue to partner with celebrities and influencers who embody our core values along with being a part of key moments around the world. More recently, Ralph and I were particularly proud of our brand's participation in the U.S. Presidential inauguration. 
Overall, we are encouraged by the momentum we are seeing in consumer engagement across generations.  Notably, our brand awareness and purchase intent have accelerated since the start of the pandemic and we are seeing particularly strong growth from consumers under 35 in women. We added more than 1 million new consumers through our direct-to-consumer platforms alone in Q3. And our total social media followers reached 45 million in the quarter. This was led by continued momentum across key platforms like Instagram, TikTok, YouTube and Snapchat, where our Ralph Lauren Bitmoji Collection is connecting strongly with Gen Z consumers.  
Since the launch last August, over 20 million users has addressed their Bitmoji and Ralph Lauren and tried on the collection over 550 million times. This takes me to our long-term priority of leading with digital. 
Fiscal '21 continues to be a transformational year as we digitize our consumer platform and experiences and how we work as a company. On the consumer-facing side, the continued acceleration of connected retail is essential to creating the best possible experience for our consumers and to our long-term growth. Building on our accelerated connected retail launches in the first half of the year, in the third quarter, we added mobile point of sales across our North American retail fleet, appointment scheduling and curated personal collections online, all while continuing to expand our digital clienteling programs globally. We also launched our Hong Kong digital flagship in time for holiday, which is an important part of our broader ecosystem strategy as consumers shop and travel in new ways.  
In addition to strengthening our digital commerce capabilities, we continue to build our social commerce presence and expand our partnerships with influential digital retailers around the world. Our teams executed a successful global launch campaign this holiday with FARFETCH. We delivered lifestyle content tailored to next-generation consumers, reaching over 15 million impressions globally, including the first ever editorial experience within the FARFETCH app.  
We were encouraged by engagement rates that were 3x higher than our competitive benchmark on this platform. And as we continue to digitize how we work as a company, we launched our integrated vendor management system in the third quarter with the majority of our suppliers.  
This new digitally centralized portal enables us to communicate seamlessly with our suppliers on everything from digital product creation to real-time tracking on our production status and factory capacity. It also enables us to track and support areas like gender diversity at the supplier level. This is all part of our broader goal of elevating our product, streamlining how we bring them to market and making it easier for our teams to stay connected and agile, all while driving our sustainability and citizenship initiatives across everything we do.  
Touching on our work to operate with discipline to fuel growth. Our ongoing focus on balancing growth with productivity continues to be an important element of our long-term plan. And this discipline is even more critical as we make hard choices to realign our cost structure so we can position the company to emerge from COVID stronger than we came into it and pivot back to growth. In the second quarter, we announced the first major actions related to our fiscal 2021 strategic realignment plan.  
These included: first, the simplification of our organization, enabling our teams to move with greater agility; and second, an assessment of our brand portfolio, resulting in the decision to move Chaps to a fully licensed business. Today, we announce the next stage of our plan, which is focused on realigning and driving increased efficiencies across our global real estate footprint. While Jane will discuss these actions in more detail in a moment, I am pleased that we are making good progress on this multi-pronged plan.  
This gives us increased confidence in our ability to start fiscal '22 strong and with the right foundations in place. Importantly, I also want to take a moment to touch on our ongoing work to integrate citizenship and sustainability into everything we do. In the third quarter, we were proud to score 100% on the human rights campaign foundation's Corporate Equality Index and earn the designation as a best place to work for LGBTQ equality. On the supply chain and sustainability front, we have leveraged this period of change to continue diversifying across geographies and strengthening our relationships with suppliers.  
From improved capacity planning to implementing diversity and inclusion training and driving best practices in sustainability. In the third quarter, we reaffirmed our commitment to achieving our science-based greenhouse gas emissions targets and joined hundreds of other organizations in calling on the U.S. Federal government to reenter the Paris Climate Agreement, which the new administration recommitted to just a few weeks ago.  
We look forward to sharing further progress, including our greenhouse gas reduction road map in our 2021 report update this June. 
In closing, Ralph and I are optimistic about the future of our business and encouraged by the work our teams are doing to emerge from COVID stronger than we came into it. We are spending this time doing the important work of elevating our brand, investing in key strategic areas, streamlining our business and realigning our cost structure. We have made meaningful progress in delivering digital experiences for all of our consumers around the world and driving our direct-to-consumer channels, all while pursuing our goal of becoming a more equitable, diverse and sustainable company.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions."

Our third quarter results demonstrate solid execution of our strategy through this holiday season in the midst of a still challenging operating environment. We continue to focus on what we can control in this dynamic context and on positioning the company to accelerate value creation as we emerge from the pandemic. This includes investing in our powerful lifestyle brands, our digital transformation and maintaining a strong balance sheet. While also realigning and streamlining our operational and expense structures. 
As Patrice mentioned, today, we announced the second round of actions related to our fiscal '21 strategic realignment plan.  This stage focuses on realigning our real estate footprint to our future strategic priorities. This includes: first, reducing our North America corporate office footprint up to 30%, along with selected reductions in Europe and Asia, as our teams embrace new ways of working and we pivot resources to our key strategic priorities; second, closing up to 10 retail locations globally. Pending ongoing landlord negotiations. Combined with the successful lease renegotiations completed year-to-date, we expect these savings to drive improved profitability in our existing fleet, while we continue to expand our brand elevating ecosystems; and third, completing the consolidation of our North American distribution center operations to drive greater efficiencies, improve sustainability and deliver a better consumer experience. with faster average delivery times and an increased focus on connected retail. 
Combined, these actions are expected to result in gross annualized pretax expense savings of approximately $200 million to $240 million, inclusive of our previously announced organization savings.  
While we still expect the majority of the original $180 million to $200 million in organizational savings to flow through to the bottom line, we expect to reinvest the majority of our savings related to today's actions in our future growth. We will provide any additional updates to the plan as the actions are finalized.  
Moving on to the third quarter performance. Third quarter revenues declined 18% following a 30% decline in the second quarter. Asia and North America both improved sequentially, while Europe was more significantly impacted by COVID and mandated closures and restrictions in the quarter. Global wholesale revenue declined 19%, and direct-to-consumer revenues were down 16%. Our digital business outperformed with sales up more than 20% to last year, including double-digit growth in all regions. And even more importantly, our digital operating margins continued to expand. With Q3 digital margins up 900 basis points to last year and accretive to our total company rate through a combination of higher quality of sales and operating expense leverage.  
Driving profitability in this business remains key, not only to our long-term margin accretion and shift to DTC, but also to our strategy of repositioning ralphlauren.com as our digital flagship or the best expression of our brand online. Total company adjusted gross margin was 65.4% in the third quarter, up 320 basis points to last year.  
Gross margin expansion was primarily driven by strong AUR growth, along with favorable geographic and channel mix shifts. Around 60 basis points of this quarter's gross margin expansion was driven by unusual mix shifts due to COVID. With the remainder driven primarily by our continued global improvements in pricing and promotions. Third quarter AUR growth of 19% was above our expectations, with North America and Europe up double digits and Asia up high single digits. We continue to elevate our brands across every touch point, significantly reduced promotions and take targeted pricing increases. Our confidence in this strategy is reinforced by our continued improvement in full price penetration, larger baskets, and better-than-expected conversion, even as AUR growth has exceeded our expectations.  
Operating expenses declined 11% to last year, driven by reductions in compensation, rent and other expenses as we continue to work in new ways. Adjusted operating margin for the third quarter was 13.3%, down 70 basis points to last year. Marketing in the third quarter decreased 3%. We shifted some investments into the fourth quarter of the year as store closures and in-store shopping restrictions increased due to rising COVID cases.  
However, we accelerated select strategic marketing investments this holiday, focusing on higher-margin, new customer acquisition in North American digital and reactivation of in-person events in Asia. We expect fourth quarter marketing to increase about 50% to support our long-term brand-building activities and key events like Lunar New Year and the Australian Open. This elevated growth rate reflects both the timing shift from Q3 and lapping of last year's depressed marketing spend as COVID hit Asia, followed by Europe and North America. 
Moving on to segment performance. Starting with North America.  Revenue decreased 21% to last year. Retail comps declined 21%, driven by a 30% decline in bricks-and-mortar comps. While our own digital comps improved sequentially to 9%. Brick-and-mortar comps continue to be impacted by COVID-related traffic declines with third quarter traffic down 45% and foreign tourist sales down about 85%. However, we continue to drive our strategy of improving quality of sales, with our third quarter discount rate down nearly 400 basis points. AUR up mid-teens and conversion up more than 200 basis points in our brick-and-mortar channel. 
Our digital commerce comps were up 9%, with total digital sales up 10% in the quarter. Underlying sales to domestic consumers grew high teens, while sales to international daigou consumers declined double digits to last year as planned. We reduced our site wide promotions by 52 days compared to the prior year, as we continue to elevate our digital experience, driving AUR up 22% and gross margins up more than 800 basis points to last year in the channel.  
While these deliberate reductions in promotional activity are a headwind to our digital comps in fiscal '21, we continue to invest more aggressively on new consumer acquisition during this transition period. Our accelerated investment in digital marketing generated a 27% increase in new customers during this competitive holiday quarter, exceeding our expectations.  
Year-to-date, these new consumers are transacting at higher gross margin rates and larger basket sizes and represent a higher penetration of consumers under 35. Looking ahead, we are focused on retaining these new consumers and are encouraged thus far by repeat purchase rates. Stronger sales to domestic consumers this quarter were driven by our ongoing investments in connected retailing, like Buy Online-Pickup in store, new functionality like online exchanges and  Klarna payment installments and expanded personalization and targeted marketing efforts. All of these initiatives helped deliver a significant increase in our full-price sales this quarter, which grew more than 130% to last year. 
In North America wholesale, third quarter revenue declined 22% as we continue to manage our shipments carefully and realigned inventories to demand. Full price sales declined at a more moderate rate, driven by stronger trends in core replenishment, Polo men's, kids and home, while Lauren Women's remain challenged, consistent with the broader category.  
Our inventories in the marketplace were clean and well positioned at the end of the third quarter, declining more than 30% at North America wholesale. Our sales to off-price were down meaningfully as planned as we continue to significantly reduce our penetration in this channel. 
Moving on to Europe.  Third quarter revenue declined 28% on a reported basis and 32% in constant currency. Europe retail comps were down 38%, with a 51% decline in our bricks-and-mortar store comps, partly offset by an acceleration in our own digital commerce, up 68%. 
Across Europe, our bricks-and-mortar businesses were significantly impacted by traffic headwinds, with some form of store closures or restrictions across 16 of our 17 markets in the region, ranging from curfews and weekend closures to full lockdown. Despite these pressures, our conversion improved and AUR increased 12% to last year, driven by our ongoing strategy to elevate our factory channel. 
Strong momentum in our own digital commerce comp was driven by our new consumer acquisition, up 112%, along with expanded connected retailing initiatives gifting programs and improve digital content.  
Europe wholesale revenues declined 22% in constant currency as we continued to limit shipments to reset our inventories to demand. COVID-related challenges at bricks-and-mortar wholesale were partially offset by stronger performance at our wholesale digital accounts, where sell-in and sell-out rates were both positive for the quarter.  
Turning to Asia. Revenue increased 14% on a reported basis and 9% in constant currency. Our Asian retail comps increased 3% with bricks-and-mortar stores up 1% and digital comps up 54%. We are encouraged that growth in the Chinese mainland is not only back to pre-COVID levels of more than 40% on a reported basis, but growing versus [ LLY ]. 
Japan also returned to positive growth in the third quarter, with sales increasing high single digits on a reported basis following a second COVID wave in Q2. However, we continue to watch Japan closely as key areas like Tokyo and Osaka entered a state of emergency in January. 
Overall momentum in our Asian digital businesses continued through the quarter, driven by strong performance across all key markets and channels, including our own sites and digital pure plays, where we added 4 new partners in the quarter.  
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with $2.8 billion in cash and investments and $1.6 billion in total debt, which compares to $1.9 billion in cash and investments and $694 million in total debt at the end of last year's third quarter.  
While we have managed our balance sheet carefully since the start of the pandemic to preserve liquidity, we are monitoring COVID conditions closely. And based on our current outlook, we are planning to reinstate our dividend in the first half of fiscal '22. 
Net inventory declined 4% to last year, including a 2% decline in North America, 15% decline in Europe and a 7% increase in Asia to support growth. While we have taken a highly cautious approach to managing inventory through the pandemic, overall, we are encouraged by our team's ability to both move inventories across regions and to merchandise around our core and iconic styles, as well as key COVID categories like home, loungewear and casual tees.
Our increased agility is also enabling us to drive core product replenishment and shift back into pre-COVID categories as consumers start returning to more normalized trends. 
Looking ahead, our outlook is based on our best assessment of current COVID lockdowns and trends and is subject to change given the dynamic nature of COVID developments around the world.  
We currently expect fourth quarter revenues to decline approximately mid- to high single digits, representing a meaningful sequential improvement from the first 3 quarters of the year. This includes the impact of third wave COVID lockdowns in the U.K. and Germany from the start of the quarter through approximately mid-February as well as partial closures in France, Spain and Italy. Third wave lockdowns in Japan through early March and a slow recovery in North America, where we have also seen increased cases and COVID-related traffic headwinds. If government-mandated lockdowns or restrictions are extended from these periods or more severe restrictions are applied, this could negatively impact our current outlook.  
These COVID-related headwinds should be partially mitigated by continued momentum in China and our global digital businesses. 
We expect gross margins to continue expanding, albeit at a more moderate rate than the first 3 quarters of the year as we strategically repurpose full price product from last year's COVID shutdowns to our factory channels.  
Improved pricing and promotions, including targeted consumer messaging should continue to be the most durable driver followed by geographic and channel mix. We expect operating expenses to increase low single digits as we reaccelerate our brand-building investments to support growth coming out of the pandemic, largely offset by our ongoing expense discipline.  
Excluding marketing, operating expenses are expected to decline low single digits. We expect inventories to increase in the fourth quarter as we start building back into demand and lap last year's double-digit decline in response to COVID. 
In closing, we are encouraged by the progress our teams have made over the first 3 quarters of the year.  
As we close out this fiscal year, we are focused on offense as we leverage all of the critical work our teams have done prior to and through the pandemic to position the company for quality, long-term growth. Led by Ralph's enduring vision to guide us through a still highly dynamic global environment, we are accelerating our core strategies, including first and foremost, elevating our brands, driving our company-wide digital transformation and targeting expansion in key geographies. All while adopting new ways of working and executing with discipline around our cost structures. With that, let's open up the call for your questions."

We're year into the pandemic now and you've clearly expanded digital capabilities, you've taken meaningful steps to reset distribution cost structure. But if we look at your most important asset, the Ralph Lauren brand, can you talk to what gives you confidence in your brand health now? And is this where you want it to be in order to support strong growth coming out of the pandemic? 
And then my second question, relatedly is on how confident you are that we should see AUR growth in F '22 off the higher AUR base in a backdrop that may well be a little more promotional than during the pandemic?"

I'll take the first part, and then Jane will cover your AUR question. So elevating our brand and attracting high-quality new consumers across all 3 regions, particularly in the U.S. Our top priorities, and listen, will continue to be top priorities as we come out of COVID. 
The general message is we're making strong progress. A few points to kind of support that. First, our data shows that our brand has strengthened through the pandemic. Specifically, if you look at brand awareness and purchase intent, they're both up versus a year ago and continuing to progress quarter-on-quarter, with particularly encouraging progress among next-gen consumers and women. 
The second point is that we are acquiring more customers on our digital sites. We've seen 38% growth in North America, 79% growth in Europe and more than tenfold growth in Asia in terms of new customers on our sites year-to-date. This is clearly on the back of the deliberate targeted marketing plans that we've put in place across the regions. And it's also worth noting that we're not just driving higher traffic to our digital businesses, but we're also seeing -- and I think you heard it in Jane's remarks, an increase in our full-price sales. So we're bringing in new consumers that are higher ticket and higher margin. And I think that bodes well for the future for us. 
The third point is really around our social media presence, which continues to deepen and grow around the world, our followers reached a record high 45 million this quarter, and we're especially encouraged by our progress on key platforms like Instagram and TikTok, YouTube, Kakao On-Line in Asia, where, as you've likely seen, we've developed some pretty unique partnership, including our recent Bitmoji Snapchat partnership. We're also driving brand heat through product as you may have seen our recent street work collaboration with Clot, which is a brand founded by Edison Chen and Kevin Poon, based out of Hong Kong. 
There's a lot of excitement around these products. They virtually vaporized as we put them up for access to consumers within a few seconds, they were sold out. And now you can add them at multiples of the retail price on types like StockX. So we've been happy with the response we've seen and the contribution to overall brand heat. All this, importantly, is enabled by our strong balance sheet. Jane just touched on that, which has allowed us to continue driving our strategic priorities, like brand elevation, like investing in marketing, and also reinstate our dividend in the coming quarters. 
So together, if you put all these elements together, this gives us confidence that we're investing in the right places to elevate our brand and drive interest and heat particularly with the next-generation that we're specifically focused on. And then on your AUR question, I'll let Jane answer that."

And just as I look in the near term, even into Q4,",425,"Sure. So Alex, just we are confident in our AUR growth. Certainly, because it's led by brand elevation and that brand elevation is something that we focused on this year. And are committed to continuing. And just as I look in the near term, even into Q4, we're expecting AUR growth about comparable to what you saw in Q3. But even as we come out of the pandemic and looking forward into fiscal '22, while we're not guiding, we do expect to comp the underlying AUR growth. Now we know that there have been unusual mix benefits during COVID. 
With many of our stores and outlet doors closed during the cove period that lifted AUR. We've tried to be clear about calling that out and the impacts of COVID to our best estimates were that in Q1, underlying AUR growth was about high single digits. And in Q2 and Q3, it was in the low to mid-teens. So that is what -- that's the basis on which we expect to comp. And what we really feel good about is the long-term guidance for AUR as we move forward, which is in the low to mid-single-digit range. Because our long-term drivers are still intact. 
As I said, elevating our product, our marketing and shopping experiences, which we've been talking about this year, all focused on elevating our brand. That we have the capabilities and an increasing number of tools that have proved out as we drive personalization in terms of managing promotional levels, better promotional levels, more personalization, more targeted promotions that have been very favorable in terms of driving AUR. Strategic price increases. It's a muscle that I think we started in F-- in over a year ago, starting in our factory channel, and you can see that carries through today where we've seen sort of a mid-teens price increases in our outlet channels. 
As we elevate that product, put more quality in, and that's been -- we feel that we have more to go on that journey. And then, of course, there will be post-COVID continued mix benefits. As structurally, our international businesses grow faster as we move to be a more DTC oriented company that will also drive overall AUR. And certainly, the work that we've done in digital on AUR will continue to pay dividends into the future. So we feel really good about our trajectory. Understanding there will be some optics coming out of COVID. But I think we've been clear on the base and where we go in the future."

Can you speak to where we'll see the most important inflections in the recent P&L trends, as you transition through into the early part of 2022?
And then we're starting to hear some commentary around the sector from management team's thoughts on when they think they can approach pre-pandemic metrics. 
And as we look at consensus for your company, the general assumption is that the combination of all the work you've done on quality of sales to boost margins, well over $2 of net EPS, you've added from the SG&A work you've done. Consensus still has that combination landing at earnings below 2019 levels in the second half of this calendar year, so September and December quarters. I'd love to hear your thoughts on that if you have visibility. So just help us a little bit because of the fiscal year-end that you have here in March?"

As we do look at while we're very clear that there is some near term disruption, which likely could last into our fiscal '22 from COVID. Our long-term optimism and especially in the second half of our fiscal year is high. And so as I think about what we're going to be overlapping, we expect that store comps will be meaningfully better as we move through the year. 
And certainly, as we move through the fiscal year into the second half. And that's really contingent on the vaccine and some of the abatement in the virus, which we believe in. And so we do believe that store comp will continue to be a positive factor as we move through fiscal '22. Certainly, our wholesale businesses have not been immune to the factors of COVID. And I think that as we emerge from the crisis, you'll also see we've been very tight on our sell-in. And sell-in has been under sell-out. 
And so there are good inventory replenishment needs. In the wholesale channel, especially as like our own channels, they come out of COVID. We feel -- our inventories were down 30% in North American wholesale. They have been sequentially down in Europe. So we feel good about our position. They're ready for fresh product, which we feel will be able to fulfill and expect momentum coming out of there. 
And of course, the investments that we're making in digital, as we look across our total digital business, we expect acceleration global with our total digital business in Q4. And certainly, as we finish the cleanup in North America, and you can see that domestic consumer up high teens this quarter, will be done with a lot of the daigou cleanup, and you'll start to see that acceleration coming into fiscal '22. Those are the key drivers that give us optimism in '22. We do feel comfortable about our savings estimate of 100 -- the majority of $180 million to $200 million that we announced in the first realignment plan flowing through to be an EPS driver. 
And with that, our additional savings that we announced today will be used to accelerate and restart all those drivers that I talked about on sales to make sure that we have the investment funds to continue our digital expansion, elevate our brand, focus on marketing, which you've seen us approach with optimism in the fourth quarter, the marketing be up 50%. Those are the drivers. The question is timing, but we do feel confident about, certainly in the back half of '22."

On that one, assuming the game ends in 9 innings and doesn't go over time, we're likely at inning #7 on those. 
So we expect -- we probably need a quarter -- one more quarter, Q4, maybe a bit of Q1 to have that completed across these 3 areas. And then on the second stream, I'll be honest with you, I don't think the game ever ends on brand elevation in North America. I think we want to continuously elevate our product, elevate how we show up in marketing, elevate how we're distributed. And I think that's been part of the success of this brand historically, and that's something we will continue to drive. 
So I probably have us on the first inning with a never-ending game for that work stream."

We intend to continue that journey as we move forward. We believe we have distribution opportunities in Asia and also more targeted distribution opportunities in Europe and North America, and we will use the savings for that as well as increased marketing.

So Paul, you -- what we have seen -- let me start with the second part of your question, and then I will go to flexibility and inflection in FY '22. So what we have seen in our Europe business specifically is that when the stores close, we do see an inflection in our digital business. Although it's not a one-for-one offset. So you can just see by this quarter with the shutdowns in our store in Europe in November and then into December, that suppress the total -- the total Europe growth, but we did see an acceleration in digital and high-quality digital growth. So we were very pleased with our reduction of discount rate in Europe and the very strong growth that we reported in digital in Europe. 
As I think about the volatility as we move into fiscal '22, I think you're right, it's predicated on COVID and the rollout of the vaccine. And I think what you've seen us in the past is moving with agility. And as we look at our expense structure, we've been able to reinvest in the business as we are in the fourth quarter. Elevate marketing, but do so on a timed basis and investing into high ROIC categories. And I think that, that gives us protection on the downside and protects our profitability as we are very focused on the return of that marketing. 
We will also have more pricing flexibility as we move forward, should there be volatility in the top line. And those are the primary factors that we'll look at as we move forward and understand the variability and volatility. Also, just a shout out to our supply chain who, given the high variability of demand and inventory planning has been able to replenish and shift by category across our broad range of categories, and that's given us the capability to meet demand even though it's been highly variable based on COVID. So that gives us a lot of confidence as well."

I think pretty soon, we won't be talking about digital and brick-and-mortar separately because they're now so intertwined. But as you look at these new ways of selling in the context of connected retail, we're expecting that to be an accelerator for our digital performance. 
And so a lot of that's been pioneered in Europe. A lot of that is what you see in these very strong numbers this quarter, where we're up 60 -- I believe 68% digital commerce in Europe. And I think that is a sustainable set of capabilities that will help us continue to accelerate progress on that front."

I guess I wanted to focus really on the U.S. wholesale channel. So I believe pre-COVID, you were kind of doing $1.5 billion of U.S. wholesale. You've got initiatives in place to shrink the door count and does it rationalize some of the lower margin revenue streams you had there? 
I guess when all is said and done, and we're on the other side of this, how much of a smaller wholesale business do you expect to be managing, if at all? 
And then how does that kind of translate into operating margins? Are you planning a smaller, more profitable channel? Are you kind of trying to get back to where you were? Just kind of curious at a high level how you think about it?"

So just Ike, as we step back, I really believe that we should look at wholesale in 3 buckets. Obviously, this year, we announced a significant cleanup in North America wholesale, where we exited about 230 doors in North America, wholesale, will be through that. So good foundation, clean foundation. And moving from there, we know and we see we have share opportunities in the doors we are in. And so continued momentum from share. Even this quarter, we saw share gains in Men's, in Kids and Home in the wholesale channel. 
So with that reset base, there's no reason that we -- and we are focused on comp growth in North America wholesale. And the Wholesale Dot Com is an area of wholesale that we're very optimistic about. And so we expect to grow wholesale in their digital -- in the digital business. And then we've been clear that off-price, and especially this quarter, off-price was down meaningfully. Our full-price wholesale on a sell-in basis and sell-out basis were -- in a sell-in basis was much better than what we reported in aggregate for North America wholesale. I expect the off-price cleanout as we exit Q4, to be about done, and it will be repositioned to what it should be, which is a channel that we can liquidate excess in. And so that pressure that you're seeing from off-price will abate in fiscal '22. 
So we feel good about the foundation of where we'll be in wholesale. It will be a smaller channel. As you know, we announced the change of Chaps to licensing. Chaps is almost a completely wholesale business in North America. And so you'll see that part shrink the wholesale base. But we feel confident about the value creation of that change. And we feel good about the positions that we're in and how we move forward and focus on growing share in that channel and maximizing pure plays in digital."

It's primarily coming from those resets, pricing, quality consumer recruitment. And we are getting some leverage on our fixed cost base, which is well built out. And is ready to be leveraged from a growth standpoint. So we feel good about, it has multiple drivers across all the vectors. And the most work has been on the North America site. That's where we've seen the biggest ladder up in this quarter in terms of digital margins, but tremendous progress in Europe over the past over the past 6 quarters. 
And Asia, with the reboot of Asia, started off with quite healthy margins and continues to grow those margins largely on scale."

Our third quarter performance reflected strong underlying progress on our path to quality, sustainable long-term growth. Overall, revenues improved sequentially and were in line with our expectations. 
Stronger-than-expected recovery in Asia was offset by the impact of continued COVID-19 resurgences across Europe, while North America was roughly in line with our expectations, even with additional COVID pressures. Meanwhile, our focus on brand elevation, improved quality of sales and cost discipline drove better-than-expected gross and operating margin expansion in the quarter, with double-digit AUR growth and digital profitability exceeding our expectations. 
And while COVID is likely to remain a near-term headwind, there is reason to be hopeful as we start the new year and vaccines begin to roll out. Ralph and I are incredibly proud of the dedication, resilience and agility our teams have shown in not only managing through the pandemic, but also positioning the company to emerge stronger than we came into it. 
As part of this, we balanced reset activities with an acceleration of our core strategies, including strengthening our brand and bolstering our marketing and new customer acquisition, expanding key categories in international markets, scaling our connected retail offerings globally, continuing to prune non-elevating distribution and further realigning our cost structure. These actions are consistent with the 5 strategic priorities that we laid out as part of our long-term plan prior to COVID. 
These include: first, win over a new generation of consumers; second, energize core products and accelerate high potential underdeveloped categories; third, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels; fourth, lead with digital across all activities; and fifth, operate with discipline to fuel growth. I will touch on a few of these in a moment. 
But first, let me provide some updates specific to this quarter's performance. As we anticipated at the start of the holiday season, the global retail environment remained volatile due to the pandemic and other macro factors. Nevertheless, apart from the impact of COVID resurgences, we were encouraged by several bright spots in each of our regions this quarter, led notably by Asia and our digital channels globally. 
Asia, which we view in many ways as a blueprint for our progress in other markets, grew 14% to last year. This was driven by continued momentum in the Chinese mainland, with more than 40% reported growth. Japan returned to positive growth in the quarter, while Korea was up double digits. In North America, performance continued to improve sequentially and was in line with our expectations despite rising COVID cases in many of our key markets. 
Our strategy of elevating our brand across digital, department stores and off-price is well underway, and we're still on track to complete the significant portion of this work in fiscal '21. Europe was the most challenging segment this quarter, with the majority of our stores closed for a full month of the key holiday period. In addition to the government-mandated shutdowns, there were also significant operating and travel restrictions throughout the quarter, which have continued into our fourth quarter to date. 
In many ways, the second and third wave restrictions have been more disruptive than the first wave of shutdowns we experienced last spring as they vary greatly by market and by day. Third quarter traffic headwinds were partly mitigated by a strong acceleration across our own and wholesale digital channels in Europe. 
This was driven by our expanded connected retail programs, exclusive capsules with partners like Mytheresa and ASOS, holiday campaigns and influencer activations. We also leveraged this period of disruption to continue our long-term brand elevation in the region, acquiring new high-value consumers and driving increased AUR despite a highly promotional competitive environment. These actions should help position our brands for healthier recovery and ecosystem expansion once we emerge from COVID. 
By channel, digital continues to be a key driver of our performance, with digital sales accelerating in all 3 regions this quarter. We continued to scale up our connected retail offerings and emphasize gifting in key product categories for holiday. These included our iconic sweaters, Holiday Bear programs, home and loungewear that are resonating with consumers today. 
In our brick-and-mortar stores, as I mentioned, traffic was challenged due to COVID, particularly in Europe and North America. But we were strongly encouraged that our teams were able to deliver higher conversion in these channels with double-digit AUR growth and reduced discounting, while also starting to leverage our new connected retail offerings this holiday. 
We also continue to invest in targeted new store expansion in key growth markets with 23 new stores this quarter, primarily in Asia. Within our wholesale business, we were encouraged by continued sequential progress across regions, particularly on wholesale dot com. We still expect pressure on our reported sell-in trends in the near-term as we deliberately exited department store doors early in the pandemic and prioritized inventory management in this environment. As a reminder, this near-term discipline is integral to building price harmonization across our ecosystem and to protecting the elevation in long-term equity of our brands. 
Turning to our efforts to win over a new generation. In the third quarter, we continued to ramp up our personalization initiatives, shift our brand-building efforts increasingly toward digital, and leverage the authentic values that have been central to our brand since Ralph started this company more than 50 years ago. Let me touch on some of the highlights from this quarter. 
First, we launched a fully integrated and diverse Family Is Who You Love holiday campaign across social media, our own stores and digital sites and wholesale environments. We also focused more than ever on creating innovative digital experiences that immerse the consumer in the world of Ralph Lauren. These included our groundbreaking virtual flagship store experiences in Beverly Hills, New York and Paris, where consumers around the world can experience our brands and the full breadth of our assortment in a way that was previously only possible by walking into one of our beautiful stores. Amplifying the reach of our flagships to a global audience, digital traffic in these virtual stores was 8x greater than the foot traffic in these physical stores over the same period. 
We were also the first apparel brand to launch Snapchat's logo scan this holiday. This allows consumers to scan our iconic Polo Pony logo from any surface, including holding items, ads, shopping bags and more to trigger an augmented reality experience that brings them into the world of Ralph Lauren and ultimately transact on our own site. And in Asia, we were excited to launch our livestream selling event with 360-degree activation for Singles' Day, delivering more than 120 million impressions. 
We're investing in these new forms of selling, including social commerce, which we expect to become a greater part of the digital shopping experience long term. 
Looking ahead, we will continue to partner with celebrities and influencers who embody our core values along with being a part of key moments around the world. More recently, Ralph and I were particularly proud of our brand's participation in the U.S. Presidential inauguration. 
Overall, we are encouraged by the momentum we are seeing in consumer engagement across generations. Notably, our brand awareness and purchase intent have accelerated since the start of the pandemic, and we are seeing particularly strong growth from consumers under 35 and women. We added more than 1 million new consumers through our direct-to-consumer platforms alone in Q3. And our total social media followers reached 45 million in the quarter. This was led by continued momentum across key platforms like Instagram, TikTok, YouTube and Snapchat, where our Ralph Lauren Bitmoji Collection is connecting strongly with Gen Z consumers. 
Since the launch last August, over 20 million users have dressed their Bitmoji in Ralph Lauren and tried on the collection over 550 million times. This takes me to our long-term priority of leading with digital. 
Fiscal '21 continues to be a transformational year as we digitize our consumer platform and experiences and how we work as a company. On the consumer-facing side, the continued acceleration of connected retail is essential to creating the best possible experience for our consumers and to our long-term growth. Building on our accelerated connected retail launches in the first half of the year, in the third quarter, we added mobile point of sales across our North American retail fleet, appointment scheduling and curated personal collections online, all while continuing to expand our digital clienteling programs globally. We also launched our Hong Kong digital flagship in time for holiday, which is an important part of our broader ecosystem strategy as consumers shop and travel in new ways. 
In addition to strengthening our digital commerce capabilities, we continue to build our social commerce presence and expand our partnerships with influential digital retailers around the world. Our teams executed a successful global launch campaign this holiday with FARFETCH. We delivered lifestyle content tailored to next-generation consumers, reaching over 15 million impressions globally, including the first ever editorial experience within the FARFETCH app. 
We were encouraged by engagement rates that were 3x higher than our competitive benchmark on this platform. And as we continue to digitize how we work as a company, we launched our integrated vendor management system in the third quarter with the majority of our suppliers. 
This new digitally centralized portal enables us to communicate seamlessly with our suppliers on everything from digital product creation to real-time tracking on our production status and factory capacity. It also enables us to track and support areas like gender diversity at the supplier level. This is all part of our broader goal of elevating our product, streamlining how we bring them to market and making it easier for our teams to stay connected and agile, all while driving our sustainability and citizenship initiatives across everything we do. 
Touching on our work to operate with discipline to fuel growth. Our ongoing focus on balancing growth with productivity continues to be an important element of our long-term plan. And this discipline is even more critical as we make hard choices to realign our cost structure so we can position the company to emerge from COVID stronger than we came into it and pivot back to growth. In the second quarter, we announced the first major actions related to our fiscal 2021 strategic realignment plan. 
These included: first, the simplification of our organization, enabling our teams to move with greater agility; and second, an assessment of our brand portfolio, resulting in the decision to move Chaps to a fully licensed business. Today, we announce the next stage of our plan, which is focused on realigning and driving increased efficiencies across our global real estate footprint. While Jane will discuss these actions in more detail in a moment, I am pleased that we are making good progress on this multi-pronged plan. 
This gives us increased confidence in our ability to start fiscal '22 strong and with the right foundations in place. Importantly, I also want to take a moment to touch on our ongoing work to integrate citizenship and sustainability into everything we do. In the third quarter, we were proud to score 100% on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Corporate Equality Index and earn the designation as a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ equality. On the supply chain and sustainability front, we have leveraged this period of change to continue diversifying across geographies and strengthening our relationships with suppliers, from improved capacity planning to implementing diversity and inclusion training and driving best practices in sustainability. 
In the third quarter, we reaffirmed our commitment to achieving our science-based greenhouse gas emissions targets and joined hundreds of other organizations in calling on the U.S. Federal government to reenter the Paris Climate Agreement, which the new administration recommitted to just a few weeks ago. We look forward to sharing further progress, including our greenhouse gas reduction road map, in our 2021 report update this June. 
In closing, Ralph and I are optimistic about the future of our business and encouraged by the work our teams are doing to emerge from COVID stronger than we came into it. We are spending this time doing the important work of elevating our brand, investing in key strategic areas, streamlining our business and realigning our cost structure. We have made meaningful progress in delivering digital experiences for all of our consumers around the world and driving our direct-to-consumer channels, all while pursuing our goal of becoming a more equitable, diverse and sustainable company. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions."

Our third quarter results demonstrate solid execution of our strategy through this holiday season in the midst of a still challenging operating environment. We continue to focus on what we can control in this dynamic context and on positioning the company to accelerate value creation as we emerge from the pandemic. This includes investing in our powerful lifestyle brands, our digital transformation and maintaining a strong balance sheet while also realigning and streamlining our operational and expense structures. 
As Patrice mentioned, today we announced the second round of actions related to our fiscal '21 strategic realignment plan. This stage focuses on realigning our real estate footprint to our future strategic priorities. This includes: first, reducing our North America corporate office footprint up to 30%, along with selected reductions in Europe and Asia, as our teams embrace new ways of working and we pivot resources to our key strategic priorities; second, closing up to 10 retail locations globally pending ongoing landlord negotiations. Combined with the successful lease renegotiations completed year-to-date, we expect these savings to drive improved profitability in our existing fleet while we continue to expand our brand elevating ecosystems. And third, completing the consolidation of our North American distribution center operations to drive greater efficiencies, improve sustainability and deliver a better consumer experience with faster average delivery times and an increased focus on connected retail. 
Combined, these actions are expected to result in gross annualized pretax expense savings of approximately $200 million to $240 million, inclusive of our previously announced organization savings. 
While we still expect the majority of the original $180 million to $200 million in organizational savings to flow through to the bottom line, we expect to reinvest the majority of our savings related to today's actions in our future growth. We will provide any additional updates to the plan as the actions are finalized. 
Moving on to the third quarter performance. Third quarter revenues declined 18% following a 30% decline in the second quarter. Asia and North America both improved sequentially, while Europe was more significantly impacted by COVID and mandated closures and restrictions in the quarter. Global wholesale revenue declined 19%, and direct-to-consumer revenues were down 16%. Our digital business outperformed with sales up more than 20% to last year, including double-digit growth in all regions. And even more importantly, our digital operating margins continued to expand, with Q3 digital margins up 900 basis points to last year and accretive to our total company rate through a combination of higher quality of sales and operating expense leverage. 
Driving profitability in this business remains key, not only to our long-term margin accretion and shift to DTC, but also to our strategy of repositioning ralphlauren.com as our digital flagship or the best expression of our brand online. Total company adjusted gross margin was 65.4% in the third quarter, up 320 basis points to last year. 
Gross margin expansion was primarily driven by strong AUR growth, along with favorable geographic and channel mix shifts. Around 60 basis points of this quarter's gross margin expansion was driven by unusual mix shifts due to COVID, with the remainder driven primarily by our continued global improvements in pricing and promotions. Third quarter AUR growth of 19% was above our expectations, with North America and Europe up double digits and Asia up high single digits. We continue to elevate our brands across every touch point, significantly reduce promotions, and take targeted pricing increases. Our confidence in this strategy is reinforced by our continued improvement in full price penetration, larger baskets, and better-than-expected conversion, even as AUR growth has exceeded our expectations. 
Operating expenses declined 11% to last year, driven by reductions in compensation, rent and other expenses as we continue to work in new ways. Adjusted operating margin for the third quarter was 13.3%, down 70 basis points to last year. Marketing in the third quarter decreased 3%. We shifted some investments into the fourth quarter of the year as store closures and in-store shopping restrictions increased due to rising COVID cases. 
However, we accelerated select strategic marketing investments this holiday, focusing on higher-margin, new customer acquisition in North American digital and reactivation of in-person events in Asia. We expect fourth quarter marketing to increase about 50% to support our long-term brand-building activities and key events like Lunar New Year and the Australian Open. This elevated growth rate reflects both the timing shift from Q3 and lapping of last year's depressed marketing spend as COVID hit Asia, followed by Europe and North America. 
Moving on to segment performance, starting with North America. Revenue decreased 21% to last year. Retail comps declined 21%, driven by a 30% decline in bricks-and-mortar comps, while our own digital comps improved sequentially to 9%. Brick-and-mortar comps continued to be impacted by COVID-related traffic declines with third quarter traffic down 45% and foreign tourist sales down about 85%. However, we continued to drive our strategy of improving quality of sales, with our third quarter discount rate down nearly 400 basis points, AUR up mid-teens, and conversion up more than 200 basis points in our brick-and-mortar channel. 
Our digital commerce comps were up 9%, with total digital sales up 10% in the quarter. Underlying sales to domestic consumers grew high teens, while sales to international daigou consumers declined double digits to last year as planned. We reduced our site-wide promotions by 52 days compared to the prior year, as we continued to elevate our digital experience, driving AUR up 22% and gross margins up more than 800 basis points to last year in the channel. 
While these deliberate reductions in promotional activity are a headwind to our digital comps in fiscal '21, we continue to invest more aggressively on new consumer acquisition during this transition period. Our accelerated investment in digital marketing generated a 27% increase in new customers during this competitive holiday quarter, exceeding our expectations. 
Year-to-date, these new consumers are transacting at higher gross margin rates and larger basket sizes and represent a higher penetration of consumers under 35. Looking ahead, we are focused on retaining these new consumers and are encouraged thus far by repeat purchase rates. Stronger sales to domestic consumers this quarter were driven by our ongoing investments in connected retailing, like Buy Online-Pick Up in Store; new functionality like online exchanges and Klarna payment installments; and expanded personalization and targeted marketing efforts. All of these initiatives helped deliver a significant increase in our full-price sales this quarter, which grew more than 130% to last year. 
In North America wholesale, third quarter revenue declined 22% as we continue to manage our shipments carefully and realigned inventories to demand. Full price sales declined at a more moderate rate, driven by stronger trends in core replenishment, Polo men's, kids and home, while Lauren Women's remained challenged, consistent with the broader category. 
Our inventories in the marketplace were clean and well positioned at the end of the third quarter, declining more than 30% at North America wholesale. Our sales to off-price were down meaningfully as planned as we continued to significantly reduce our penetration in this channel. 
Moving on to Europe. Third quarter revenue declined 28% on a reported basis and 32% in constant currency. Europe retail comps were down 38%, with a 51% decline in our bricks-and-mortar store comps, partly offset by an acceleration in our own digital commerce, up 68%. 
Across Europe, our bricks-and-mortar businesses were significantly impacted by traffic headwinds, with some form of store closures or restrictions across 16 of our 17 markets in the region, ranging from curfews and weekend closures to full lockdown. Despite these pressures, our conversion improved and AUR increased 12% to last year, driven by our ongoing strategy to elevate our factory channel. 
Strong momentum in our own digital commerce comp was driven by our new consumer acquisition, up 112%, along with expanded connected retailing initiatives, gifting programs, and improved digital content. 
Europe wholesale revenues declined 22% in constant currency as we continued to limit shipments to reset our inventories to demand. COVID-related challenges at bricks-and-mortar wholesale were partially offset by stronger performance at our wholesale digital accounts, where sell-in and sell-out rates were both positive for the quarter. 
Turning to Asia. Revenue increased 14% on a reported basis and 9% in constant currency. Our Asian retail comps increased 3%, with bricks-and-mortar stores up 1% and digital comps up 54%. We are encouraged that growth in the Chinese mainland is not only back to pre-COVID levels of more than 40% on a reported basis, but growing versus [ LLY ]. 
Japan also returned to positive growth in the third quarter, with sales increasing high single digits on a reported basis following a second COVID wave in Q2. However, we continue to watch Japan closely, as key areas like Tokyo and Osaka entered a state of emergency in January. 
Overall momentum in our Asian digital businesses continued through the quarter, driven by strong performance across all key markets and channels, including our own sites and digital pure plays, where we added 4 new partners in the quarter. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with $2.8 billion in cash and investments and $1.6 billion in total debt, which compares to $1.9 billion in cash and investments and $694 million in total debt at the end of last year's third quarter. 
While we have managed our balance sheet carefully since the start of the pandemic to preserve liquidity, we are monitoring COVID conditions closely. And based on our current outlook, we are planning to reinstate our dividend in the first half of fiscal '22. 
Net inventory declined 4% to last year, including a 2% decline in North America, 15% decline in Europe and a 7% increase in Asia to support growth. While we have taken a highly cautious approach to managing inventory through the pandemic, overall we are encouraged by our team's ability to both move inventories across regions and to merchandise around our core and iconic styles as well as key COVID categories like home, loungewear and casual tees. 
Our increased agility is also enabling us to drive core product replenishment and shift back into pre-COVID categories as consumers start returning to more normalized trends. 
Looking ahead, our outlook is based on our best assessment of current COVID lockdowns and trends and is subject to change given the dynamic nature of COVID developments around the world. 
We currently expect fourth quarter revenues to decline approximately mid- to high single digits, representing a meaningful sequential improvement from the first 3 quarters of the year. This includes the impact of third wave COVID lockdowns in the U.K. and Germany from the start of the quarter through approximately mid-February as well as partial closures in France, Spain and Italy; third wave lockdowns in Japan through early March; and a slow recovery in North America, where we have also seen increased cases and COVID-related traffic headwinds. If government-mandated lockdowns or restrictions are extended from these periods or more severe restrictions are applied, this could negatively impact our current outlook. These COVID-related headwinds should be partially mitigated by continued momentum in China and our global digital businesses. 
We expect gross margins to continue expanding, albeit at a more moderate rate than the first 3 quarters of the year as we strategically repurpose full price product from last year's COVID shutdowns to our factory channels. 
Improved pricing and promotions, including targeted consumer messaging, should continue to be the most durable driver, followed by geographic and channel mix. We expect operating expenses to increase low single digits as we reaccelerate our brand-building investments to support growth coming out of the pandemic, largely offset by our ongoing expense discipline. 
Excluding marketing, operating expenses are expected to decline low single digits. We expect inventories to increase in the fourth quarter as we start building back into demand and lap last year's double-digit decline in response to COVID. 
In closing, we are encouraged by the progress our teams have made over the first 3 quarters of the year. 
As we close out this fiscal year, we are focused on offense as we leverage all of the critical work our teams have done prior to and through the pandemic to position the company for quality, long-term growth. Led by Ralph's enduring vision to guide us through a still highly dynamic global environment, we are accelerating our core strategies, including, first and foremost, elevating our brands; driving our company-wide digital transformation; and targeting expansion in key geographies -- all while adopting new ways of working and executing with discipline around our cost structures. With that, let's open up the call for your questions."

We're a year into the pandemic now, and you've clearly expanded digital capabilities, you've taken meaningful steps to reset distribution cost structure. But if we look at your most important asset, the Ralph Lauren brand, can you talk to what gives you confidence in your brand health now? And is this where you want it to be in order to support strong growth coming out of the pandemic? 
And then my second question, relatedly is on how confident you are that we should see AUR growth in F '22 off the higher AUR base in a backdrop that may well be a little more promotional than during the pandemic?"

I'll take the first part, and then Jane will cover your AUR question. So elevating our brand and attracting high-quality new consumers across all 3 regions, particularly in the U.S., are top priorities, and listen, will continue to be top priorities as we come out of COVID. 
The general message is we're making strong progress. A few points to kind of support that. First, our data shows that our brand has strengthened through the pandemic. Specifically, if you look at brand awareness and purchase intent, they're both up versus a year ago and continuing to progress quarter-on-quarter, with particularly encouraging progress among next-gen consumers and women. 
The second point is that we are acquiring more customers on our digital sites. We've seen 38% growth in North America, 79% growth in Europe and more than tenfold growth in Asia in terms of new customers on our sites year-to-date. This is clearly on the back of the deliberate targeted marketing plans that we've put in place across the regions. And it's also worth noting that we're not just driving higher traffic to our digital businesses, but we're also seeing -- and I think you heard it in Jane's remarks -- an increase in our full-price sales. So we're bringing in new consumers that are higher ticket and higher margin. And I think that bodes well for the future for us. 
The third point is really around our social media presence, which continues to deepen and grow around the world, our followers reached a record high 45 million this quarter, and we're especially encouraged by our progress on key platforms like Instagram and TikTok, YouTube, Kakao Online in Asia, where, as you've likely seen, we've developed some pretty unique partnership, including our recent Bitmoji Snapchat partnership. We're also driving brand heat through product, as you may have seen our recent street work collaboration with Clot, which is a brand founded by Edison Chen and Kevin Poon, based out of Hong Kong. 
There's a lot of excitement around these products. They virtually vaporized as we put them up for access to consumers; within a few seconds, they were sold out. And now you can add them at multiples of the retail price on sites like StockX. So we've been happy with the response we've seen and the contribution to overall brand heat. All this, importantly, is enabled by our strong balance sheet -- Jane just touched on that -- which has allowed us to continue driving our strategic priorities, like brand elevation, like investing in marketing, and also reinstate our dividend in the coming quarters. 
So together, if you put all these elements together, this gives us confidence that we're investing in the right places to elevate our brand and drive interest and heat, particularly with the next generation that we're specifically focused on. And then on your AUR question, I'll let Jane answer that."

So Alex, just -- we are confident in our AUR growth, certainly, because it's led by brand elevation, and that brand elevation is something that we focused on this year and are committed to continuing. And just as I look in the near term, even into Q4, we're expecting AUR growth about comparable to what you saw in Q3. But even as we come out of the pandemic and looking forward into fiscal '22, while we're not guiding, we do expect to comp the underlying AUR growth. Now we know that there have been unusual mix benefits during COVID, with many of our stores and outlet doors closed during the COVID period that lifted AUR. We've tried to be clear about calling that out, and the impacts of COVID to our best estimates were that in Q1, underlying AUR growth was about high single digits. And in Q2 and Q3, it was in the low to mid-teens. So that is what -- that's the basis on which we expect to comp. And what we really feel good about is the long-term guidance for AUR as we move forward, which is in the low to mid-single-digit range, because our long-term drivers are still intact -- as I said, elevating our product, our marketing and shopping experiences, which we've been talking about this year, all focused on elevating our brand; that we have the capabilities and an increasing number of tools that have proved out as we drive personalization in terms of managing promotional levels, better promotional levels, more personalization, more targeted promotions that have been very favorable in terms of driving AUR. Strategic price increases -- it's a muscle that I think we started in F -- over a year ago, starting in our factory channel, and you can see that carries through today, where we've seen sort of a mid-teens price increases in our outlet channels as we elevate that product, put more quality in, and that's been -- we feel that we have more to go on that journey. 
And then, of course, there will be post-COVID continued mix benefits. As structurally, our international businesses grow faster, as we move to be a more DTC oriented company, that will also drive overall AUR. And certainly, the work that we've done in digital on AUR will continue to pay dividends into the future. So we feel really good about our trajectory, understanding there will be some optics coming out of COVID. But I think we've been clear on the base and where we go in the future."

And since that's just a few weeks away for you, can you speak to where we'll see the most important inflections in the recent P&L trends as you transition through into the early part of 2022? 
And then we're starting to hear some commentary around the sector from management teams' thoughts on when they think they can approach pre-pandemic metrics. And as we look at consensus for your company, the general assumption is that the combination of all the work you've done on quality of sales to boost margins, well over $2 of net EPS you've added from the SG&A work you've done -- consensus still has that combination landing at earnings below 2019 levels in the second half of this calendar year, so September and December quarters.

So let's peel that apart. So starting with inventory, as we do look at -- while we're very clear that there is some near term disruption, which likely could last into our fiscal '22 from COVID, our long-term optimism and especially in the second half of our fiscal year is high. And so as I think about what we're going to be overlapping, we expect that store comps will be meaningfully better as we move through the year, and certainly as we move through the fiscal year into the second half. And that's really contingent on the vaccine and some of the abatement in the virus, which we believe in. And so we do believe that store comp will continue to be a positive factor as we move through fiscal '22. Certainly, our wholesale businesses have not been immune to the factors of COVID. And I think that as we emerge from the crisis, you'll also see we've been very tight on our sell-in. And sell-in has been under sell-out. 
And so there are good inventory replenishment needs. In the wholesale channel, especially as like our own channels, they come out of COVID. We feel -- our inventories were down 30% in North America in wholesale. They have been sequentially down in Europe. So we feel good about our position. They're ready for fresh product, which we feel we'll be able to fulfill and expect momentum coming out of there. 
And of course, the investments that we're making in digital, as we look across our total digital business, we expect acceleration global -- with our total digital business in Q4. And certainly, as we finish the cleanup in North America, and you can see that domestic consumer up high teens this quarter, we'll be done with a lot of the daigou cleanup, and you'll start to see that acceleration coming into fiscal '22. 
Those are the key drivers that give us optimism in '22. We do feel comfortable about our savings estimate of 100 -- the majority of $180 million to $200 million that we announced in the first realignment plan flowing through to be an EPS driver. 
And with that, our additional savings that we announced today will be used to accelerate and restart all those drivers that I talked about on sales to make sure that we have the investment funds to continue our digital expansion, elevate our brand, focus on marketing, which you've seen us approach with optimism in the fourth quarter, because marketing will be up 50%. Those are the drivers. The question is timing, but we do feel confident about -- certainly in the back half of '22."

On that one, assuming the game ends in 9 innings and doesn't go over time, we're likely at inning #7 on those. 
So we expect -- we probably need a quarter -- one more quarter, Q4, maybe a bit of Q1 to have that completed across these 3 areas. And then on the second stream, I'll be honest with you, I don't think the game ever ends on brand elevation in North America. I think we want to continuously elevate our product, elevate how we show up in marketing, elevate how we're distributed. And I think that's been part of the success of this brand historically, and that's something we will continue to drive. 
So I probably have us on the first inning with a never-ending game for that work stream."

We intend to grow stores -- new stores. 
We intend to continue that journey as we move forward. We believe we have distribution opportunities in Asia and also more targeted distribution opportunities in Europe and North America, and we will use the savings for that as well as increased marketing.

So Paul, what you -- what we have seen -- let me start with the second part of your question, and then I will go to flexibility and inflection in FY '22. So what we have seen in our Europe business specifically is that when the stores close, we do see an inflection in our digital business, although it's not a one-for-one offset. 
So you can just see by this quarter, with the shutdowns in our store in Europe in November and then into December, that that suppressed the total -- the total Europe growth, but we did see an acceleration in digital and high-quality digital growth. So we were very pleased with our reduction of discount rate in Europe and the very strong growth that we reported in digital in Europe. 
As I think about the volatility as we move into fiscal '22, I think you're right, it's predicated on COVID and the rollout of the vaccine. And I think what you've seen us in the past is moving with agility. And as we look at our expense structure, we've been able to reinvest in the business, as we are in the fourth quarter; elevate marketing, but do so on a timed basis; and investing into high ROIC categories. And I think that that gives us protection on the downside and protects our profitability as we are very focused on the return of that marketing. 
We will also have more pricing flexibility as we move forward, should there be volatility in the top line. And those are the primary factors that we'll look at as we move forward and understand the variability and volatility. Also, just a shout out to our supply chain who, given the high variability of demand and inventory planning has been able to replenish and shift by category across our broad range of categories, and that's given us the capability to meet demand even though it's been highly variable based on COVID. So that gives us a lot of confidence as well."

So good foundation, clean foundation. And moving from there, we know and we see we have share opportunities in the doors we are in. And so continued momentum from share. Even this quarter, we saw share gains in Men's, in Kids and Home in the wholesale channel. 
So with that reset base, there's no reason that we -- and we are focused on comp growth in North America wholesale. And the wholesale dot com is an area of wholesale that we're very optimistic about. And so we expect to grow wholesale in their digital -- in the digital business. And then we've been clear that off-price, and especially this quarter, off-price was down meaningfully. Our full-price wholesale on a sell-in basis and sell-out basis were -- in a sell-in basis was much better than what we reported in aggregate for North America wholesale. 
I expect the off-price cleanout as we exit Q4 to be about done, and it will be repositioned to what it should be, which is a channel that we can liquidate excess in. And so that pressure that you're seeing from off-price will abate in fiscal '22. 
So we feel good about the foundation of where we'll be in wholesale. It will be a smaller channel. As you know, we announced the change of Chaps to licensing. Chaps is almost a completely wholesale business in North America. And so you'll see that part shrink the wholesale base. But we feel confident about the value creation of that change. And we feel good about the positions that we're in and how we move forward and focus on growing share in that channel and maximizing pure plays in digital."

So we are elevating the mix, our product mix on our digital sites. We are pulling away from -- especially in North America from those daigou discount-oriented customers. We're recruiting new customers at a higher gross margin, a bigger basket. And so that's driving a great deal of our margin expansion as well. It's primarily coming from those resets, pricing, quality consumer recruitment. And we are getting some leverage on our fixed cost base, which is well built out and is ready to be leveraged from a growth standpoint. 
So we feel good about it has multiple drivers across all the vectors. And the most work has been on the North America site. That's where we've seen the biggest ladder up in this quarter in terms of digital margins, but tremendous progress in Europe over the past over the past 6 quarters. 
And Asia, with the reboot of Asia, started off with quite healthy margins and continues to grow those margins largely on scale."

Our third quarter performance reflected strong underlying progress on our path to quality, sustainable long-term growth. Overall, revenues improved sequentially and were in line with our expectations. 
Stronger-than-expected recovery in Asia was offset by the impact of continued COVID-19 resurgences across Europe, while North America was roughly in line with our expectations, even with additional COVID pressures. Meanwhile, our focus on brand elevation, improved quality of sales and cost discipline drove better-than-expected gross and operating margin expansion in the quarter, with double-digit AUR growth and digital profitability exceeding our expectations. 
And while COVID is likely to remain a near-term headwind, there is reason to be hopeful as we start the new year and vaccines begin to roll out. Ralph and I are incredibly proud of the dedication, resilience and agility our teams have shown in not only managing through the pandemic, but also positioning the company to emerge stronger than we came into it. 
As part of this, we balanced reset activities with an acceleration of our core strategies, including strengthening our brand and bolstering our marketing and new customer acquisition, expanding key categories in international markets, scaling our connected retail offerings globally, continuing to prune non-elevating distribution and further realigning our cost structure. These actions are consistent with the 5 strategic priorities that we laid out as part of our long-term plan prior to COVID. 
These include: first, win over a new generation of consumers; second, energize core products and accelerate high potential underdeveloped categories; third, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels; fourth, lead with digital across all activities; and fifth, operate with discipline to fuel growth. I will touch on a few of these in a moment. 
But first, let me provide some updates specific to this quarter's performance. As we anticipated at the start of the holiday season, the global retail environment remained volatile due to the pandemic and other macro factors. Nevertheless, apart from the impact of COVID resurgences, we were encouraged by several bright spots in each of our regions this quarter, led notably by Asia and our digital channels globally. 
Asia, which we view in many ways as a blueprint for our progress in other markets, grew 14% to last year. This was driven by continued momentum in the Chinese mainland, with more than 40% reported growth. Japan returned to positive growth in the quarter, while Korea was up double digits. In North America, performance continued to improve sequentially and was in line with our expectations despite rising COVID cases in many of our key markets. 
Our strategy of elevating our brand across digital, department stores and off-price is well underway, and we're still on track to complete the significant portion of this work in fiscal '21. Europe was the most challenging segment this quarter, with the majority of our stores closed for a full month of the key holiday period. In addition to the government-mandated shutdowns, there were also significant operating and travel restrictions throughout the quarter, which have continued into our fourth quarter to date. 
In many ways, the second and third wave restrictions have been more disruptive than the first wave of shutdowns we experienced last spring as they vary greatly by market and by day. Third quarter traffic headwinds were partly mitigated by a strong acceleration across our own and wholesale digital channels in Europe. 
This was driven by our expanded connected retail programs, exclusive capsules with partners like Mytheresa and ASOS, holiday campaigns and influencer activations. We also leveraged this period of disruption to continue our long-term brand elevation in the region, acquiring new high-value consumers and driving increased AUR despite a highly promotional competitive environment. These actions should help position our brands for healthier recovery and ecosystem expansion once we emerge from COVID. 
By channel, digital continues to be a key driver of our performance, with digital sales accelerating in all 3 regions this quarter. We continued to scale up our connected retail offerings and emphasize gifting in key product categories for holiday. These included our iconic sweaters, Holiday Bear programs, home and loungewear that are resonating with consumers today. 
In our brick-and-mortar stores, as I mentioned, traffic was challenged due to COVID, particularly in Europe and North America. But we were strongly encouraged that our teams were able to deliver higher conversion in these channels with double-digit AUR growth and reduced discounting, while also starting to leverage our new connected retail offerings this holiday. 
We also continue to invest in targeted new store expansion in key growth markets with 23 new stores this quarter, primarily in Asia. Within our wholesale business, we were encouraged by continued sequential progress across regions, particularly on wholesale dot com. We still expect pressure on our reported sell-in trends in the near-term as we deliberately exited department store doors early in the pandemic and prioritized inventory management in this environment. As a reminder, this near-term discipline is integral to building price harmonization across our ecosystem and to protecting the elevation in long-term equity of our brands. 
Turning to our efforts to win over a new generation. In the third quarter, we continued to ramp up our personalization initiatives, shift our brand-building efforts increasingly toward digital, and leverage the authentic values that have been central to our brand since Ralph started this company more than 50 years ago. Let me touch on some of the highlights from this quarter. 
First, we launched a fully integrated and diverse Family Is Who You Love holiday campaign across social media, our own stores and digital sites and wholesale environments. We also focused more than ever on creating innovative digital experiences that immerse the consumer in the world of Ralph Lauren. These included our groundbreaking virtual flagship store experiences in Beverly Hills, New York and Paris, where consumers around the world can experience our brands and the full breadth of our assortment in a way that was previously only possible by walking into one of our beautiful stores. Amplifying the reach of our flagships to a global audience, digital traffic in these virtual stores was 8x greater than the foot traffic in these physical stores over the same period. 
We were also the first apparel brand to launch Snapchat's logo scan this holiday. This allows consumers to scan our iconic Polo Pony logo from any surface, including holding items, ads, shopping bags and more to trigger an augmented reality experience that brings them into the world of Ralph Lauren and ultimately transact on our own site. And in Asia, we were excited to launch our livestream selling event with 360-degree activation for Singles' Day, delivering more than 120 million impressions. 
We're investing in these new forms of selling, including social commerce, which we expect to become a greater part of the digital shopping experience long term. 
Looking ahead, we will continue to partner with celebrities and influencers who embody our core values along with being a part of key moments around the world. More recently, Ralph and I were particularly proud of our brand's participation in the U.S. Presidential inauguration. 
Overall, we are encouraged by the momentum we are seeing in consumer engagement across generations. Notably, our brand awareness and purchase intent have accelerated since the start of the pandemic, and we are seeing particularly strong growth from consumers under 35 and women. We added more than 1 million new consumers through our direct-to-consumer platforms alone in Q3. And our total social media followers reached 45 million in the quarter. This was led by continued momentum across key platforms like Instagram, TikTok, YouTube and Snapchat, where our Ralph Lauren Bitmoji Collection is connecting strongly with Gen Z consumers. 
Since the launch last August, over 20 million users have dressed their Bitmoji in Ralph Lauren and tried on the collection over 550 million times. This takes me to our long-term priority of leading with digital. 
Fiscal '21 continues to be a transformational year as we digitize our consumer platform and experiences and how we work as a company. On the consumer-facing side, the continued acceleration of connected retail is essential to creating the best possible experience for our consumers and to our long-term growth. Building on our accelerated connected retail launches in the first half of the year, in the third quarter, we added mobile point of sales across our North American retail fleet, appointment scheduling and curated personal collections online, all while continuing to expand our digital clienteling programs globally. We also launched our Hong Kong digital flagship in time for holiday, which is an important part of our broader ecosystem strategy as consumers shop and travel in new ways. 
In addition to strengthening our digital commerce capabilities, we continue to build our social commerce presence and expand our partnerships with influential digital retailers around the world. Our teams executed a successful global launch campaign this holiday with FARFETCH. We delivered lifestyle content tailored to next-generation consumers, reaching over 15 million impressions globally, including the first ever editorial experience within the FARFETCH app. 
We were encouraged by engagement rates that were 3x higher than our competitive benchmark on this platform. And as we continue to digitize how we work as a company, we launched our integrated vendor management system in the third quarter with the majority of our suppliers. 
This new digitally centralized portal enables us to communicate seamlessly with our suppliers on everything from digital product creation to real-time tracking on our production status and factory capacity. It also enables us to track and support areas like gender diversity at the supplier level. This is all part of our broader goal of elevating our product, streamlining how we bring them to market and making it easier for our teams to stay connected and agile, all while driving our sustainability and citizenship initiatives across everything we do. 
Touching on our work to operate with discipline to fuel growth. Our ongoing focus on balancing growth with productivity continues to be an important element of our long-term plan. And this discipline is even more critical as we make hard choices to realign our cost structure so we can position the company to emerge from COVID stronger than we came into it and pivot back to growth. In the second quarter, we announced the first major actions related to our fiscal 2021 strategic realignment plan. 
These included: first, the simplification of our organization, enabling our teams to move with greater agility; and second, an assessment of our brand portfolio, resulting in the decision to move Chaps to a fully licensed business. Today, we announce the next stage of our plan, which is focused on realigning and driving increased efficiencies across our global real estate footprint. While Jane will discuss these actions in more detail in a moment, I am pleased that we are making good progress on this multi-pronged plan. 
This gives us increased confidence in our ability to start fiscal '22 strong and with the right foundations in place. Importantly, I also want to take a moment to touch on our ongoing work to integrate citizenship and sustainability into everything we do. In the third quarter, we were proud to score 100% on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Corporate Equality Index and earn the designation as a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ equality. On the supply chain and sustainability front, we have leveraged this period of change to continue diversifying across geographies and strengthening our relationships with suppliers, from improved capacity planning to implementing diversity and inclusion training and driving best practices in sustainability. 
In the third quarter, we reaffirmed our commitment to achieving our science-based greenhouse gas emissions targets and joined hundreds of other organizations in calling on the U.S. Federal government to reenter the Paris Climate Agreement, which the new administration recommitted to just a few weeks ago. We look forward to sharing further progress, including our greenhouse gas reduction road map, in our 2021 report update this June. 
In closing, Ralph and I are optimistic about the future of our business and encouraged by the work our teams are doing to emerge from COVID stronger than we came into it. We are spending this time doing the important work of elevating our brand, investing in key strategic areas, streamlining our business and realigning our cost structure. We have made meaningful progress in delivering digital experiences for all of our consumers around the world and driving our direct-to-consumer channels, all while pursuing our goal of becoming a more equitable, diverse and sustainable company. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions."

Our third quarter results demonstrate solid execution of our strategy through this holiday season in the midst of a still challenging operating environment. We continue to focus on what we can control in this dynamic context and on positioning the company to accelerate value creation as we emerge from the pandemic. This includes investing in our powerful lifestyle brands, our digital transformation and maintaining a strong balance sheet while also realigning and streamlining our operational and expense structures. 
As Patrice mentioned, today we announced the second round of actions related to our fiscal '21 strategic realignment plan. This stage focuses on realigning our real estate footprint to our future strategic priorities. This includes: first, reducing our North America corporate office footprint up to 30%, along with selected reductions in Europe and Asia, as our teams embrace new ways of working and we pivot resources to our key strategic priorities; second, closing up to 10 retail locations globally pending ongoing landlord negotiations. Combined with the successful lease renegotiations completed year-to-date, we expect these savings to drive improved profitability in our existing fleet while we continue to expand our brand elevating ecosystems. And third, completing the consolidation of our North American distribution center operations to drive greater efficiencies, improve sustainability and deliver a better consumer experience with faster average delivery times and an increased focus on connected retail. 
Combined, these actions are expected to result in gross annualized pretax expense savings of approximately $200 million to $240 million, inclusive of our previously announced organization savings. 
While we still expect the majority of the original $180 million to $200 million in organizational savings to flow through to the bottom line, we expect to reinvest the majority of our savings related to today's actions in our future growth. We will provide any additional updates to the plan as the actions are finalized. 
Moving on to the third quarter performance. Third quarter revenues declined 18% following a 30% decline in the second quarter. Asia and North America both improved sequentially, while Europe was more significantly impacted by COVID and mandated closures and restrictions in the quarter. Global wholesale revenue declined 19%, and direct-to-consumer revenues were down 16%. Our digital business outperformed with sales up more than 20% to last year, including double-digit growth in all regions. And even more importantly, our digital operating margins continued to expand, with Q3 digital margins up 900 basis points to last year and accretive to our total company rate through a combination of higher quality of sales and operating expense leverage. 
Driving profitability in this business remains key, not only to our long-term margin accretion and shift to DTC, but also to our strategy of repositioning ralphlauren.com as our digital flagship or the best expression of our brand online. Total company adjusted gross margin was 65.4% in the third quarter, up 320 basis points to last year. 
Gross margin expansion was primarily driven by strong AUR growth, along with favorable geographic and channel mix shifts. Around 60 basis points of this quarter's gross margin expansion was driven by unusual mix shifts due to COVID, with the remainder driven primarily by our continued global improvements in pricing and promotions. Third quarter AUR growth of 19% was above our expectations, with North America and Europe up double digits and Asia up high single digits. We continue to elevate our brands across every touch point, significantly reduce promotions, and take targeted pricing increases. Our confidence in this strategy is reinforced by our continued improvement in full price penetration, larger baskets, and better-than-expected conversion, even as AUR growth has exceeded our expectations. 
Operating expenses declined 11% to last year, driven by reductions in compensation, rent and other expenses as we continue to work in new ways. Adjusted operating margin for the third quarter was 13.3%, down 70 basis points to last year. Marketing in the third quarter decreased 3%. We shifted some investments into the fourth quarter of the year as store closures and in-store shopping restrictions increased due to rising COVID cases. 
However, we accelerated select strategic marketing investments this holiday, focusing on higher-margin, new customer acquisition in North American digital and reactivation of in-person events in Asia. We expect fourth quarter marketing to increase about 50% to support our long-term brand-building activities and key events like Lunar New Year and the Australian Open. This elevated growth rate reflects both the timing shift from Q3 and lapping of last year's depressed marketing spend as COVID hit Asia, followed by Europe and North America. 
Moving on to segment performance, starting with North America. Revenue decreased 21% to last year. Retail comps declined 21%, driven by a 30% decline in bricks-and-mortar comps, while our own digital comps improved sequentially to 9%. Brick-and-mortar comps continued to be impacted by COVID-related traffic declines with third quarter traffic down 45% and foreign tourist sales down about 85%. However, we continued to drive our strategy of improving quality of sales, with our third quarter discount rate down nearly 400 basis points, AUR up mid-teens, and conversion up more than 200 basis points in our brick-and-mortar channel. 
Our digital commerce comps were up 9%, with total digital sales up 10% in the quarter. Underlying sales to domestic consumers grew high teens, while sales to international daigou consumers declined double digits to last year as planned. We reduced our site-wide promotions by 52 days compared to the prior year, as we continued to elevate our digital experience, driving AUR up 22% and gross margins up more than 800 basis points to last year in the channel. 
While these deliberate reductions in promotional activity are a headwind to our digital comps in fiscal '21, we continue to invest more aggressively on new consumer acquisition during this transition period. Our accelerated investment in digital marketing generated a 27% increase in new customers during this competitive holiday quarter, exceeding our expectations. 
Year-to-date, these new consumers are transacting at higher gross margin rates and larger basket sizes and represent a higher penetration of consumers under 35. Looking ahead, we are focused on retaining these new consumers and are encouraged thus far by repeat purchase rates. Stronger sales to domestic consumers this quarter were driven by our ongoing investments in connected retailing, like Buy Online-Pick Up in Store; new functionality like online exchanges and Klarna payment installments; and expanded personalization and targeted marketing efforts. All of these initiatives helped deliver a significant increase in our full-price sales this quarter, which grew more than 130% to last year. 
In North America wholesale, third quarter revenue declined 22% as we continue to manage our shipments carefully and realigned inventories to demand. Full price sales declined at a more moderate rate, driven by stronger trends in core replenishment, Polo men's, kids and home, while Lauren Women's remained challenged, consistent with the broader category. 
Our inventories in the marketplace were clean and well positioned at the end of the third quarter, declining more than 30% at North America wholesale. Our sales to off-price were down meaningfully as planned as we continued to significantly reduce our penetration in this channel. 
Moving on to Europe. Third quarter revenue declined 28% on a reported basis and 32% in constant currency. Europe retail comps were down 38%, with a 51% decline in our bricks-and-mortar store comps, partly offset by an acceleration in our own digital commerce, up 68%. 
Across Europe, our bricks-and-mortar businesses were significantly impacted by traffic headwinds, with some form of store closures or restrictions across 16 of our 17 markets in the region, ranging from curfews and weekend closures to full lockdown. Despite these pressures, our conversion improved and AUR increased 12% to last year, driven by our ongoing strategy to elevate our factory channel. 
Strong momentum in our own digital commerce comp was driven by our new consumer acquisition, up 112%, along with expanded connected retailing initiatives, gifting programs, and improved digital content. 
Europe wholesale revenues declined 22% in constant currency as we continued to limit shipments to reset our inventories to demand. COVID-related challenges at bricks-and-mortar wholesale were partially offset by stronger performance at our wholesale digital accounts, where sell-in and sell-out rates were both positive for the quarter. 
Turning to Asia. Revenue increased 14% on a reported basis and 9% in constant currency. Our Asian retail comps increased 3%, with bricks-and-mortar stores up 1% and digital comps up 54%. We are encouraged that growth in the Chinese mainland is not only back to pre-COVID levels of more than 40% on a reported basis, but growing versus [ LLY ]. 
Japan also returned to positive growth in the third quarter, with sales increasing high single digits on a reported basis following a second COVID wave in Q2. However, we continue to watch Japan closely, as key areas like Tokyo and Osaka entered a state of emergency in January. 
Overall momentum in our Asian digital businesses continued through the quarter, driven by strong performance across all key markets and channels, including our own sites and digital pure plays, where we added 4 new partners in the quarter. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with $2.8 billion in cash and investments and $1.6 billion in total debt, which compares to $1.9 billion in cash and investments and $694 million in total debt at the end of last year's third quarter. 
While we have managed our balance sheet carefully since the start of the pandemic to preserve liquidity, we are monitoring COVID conditions closely. And based on our current outlook, we are planning to reinstate our dividend in the first half of fiscal '22. 
Net inventory declined 4% to last year, including a 2% decline in North America, 15% decline in Europe and a 7% increase in Asia to support growth. While we have taken a highly cautious approach to managing inventory through the pandemic, overall we are encouraged by our team's ability to both move inventories across regions and to merchandise around our core and iconic styles as well as key COVID categories like home, loungewear and casual tees. 
Our increased agility is also enabling us to drive core product replenishment and shift back into pre-COVID categories as consumers start returning to more normalized trends. 
Looking ahead, our outlook is based on our best assessment of current COVID lockdowns and trends and is subject to change given the dynamic nature of COVID developments around the world. 
We currently expect fourth quarter revenues to decline approximately mid- to high single digits, representing a meaningful sequential improvement from the first 3 quarters of the year. This includes the impact of third wave COVID lockdowns in the U.K. and Germany from the start of the quarter through approximately mid-February as well as partial closures in France, Spain and Italy; third wave lockdowns in Japan through early March; and a slow recovery in North America, where we have also seen increased cases and COVID-related traffic headwinds. If government-mandated lockdowns or restrictions are extended from these periods or more severe restrictions are applied, this could negatively impact our current outlook. These COVID-related headwinds should be partially mitigated by continued momentum in China and our global digital businesses. 
We expect gross margins to continue expanding, albeit at a more moderate rate than the first 3 quarters of the year as we strategically repurpose full price product from last year's COVID shutdowns to our factory channels. 
Improved pricing and promotions, including targeted consumer messaging, should continue to be the most durable driver, followed by geographic and channel mix. We expect operating expenses to increase low single digits as we reaccelerate our brand-building investments to support growth coming out of the pandemic, largely offset by our ongoing expense discipline. 
Excluding marketing, operating expenses are expected to decline low single digits. We expect inventories to increase in the fourth quarter as we start building back into demand and lap last year's double-digit decline in response to COVID. 
In closing, we are encouraged by the progress our teams have made over the first 3 quarters of the year. 
As we close out this fiscal year, we are focused on offense as we leverage all of the critical work our teams have done prior to and through the pandemic to position the company for quality, long-term growth. Led by Ralph's enduring vision to guide us through a still highly dynamic global environment, we are accelerating our core strategies, including, first and foremost, elevating our brands; driving our company-wide digital transformation; and targeting expansion in key geographies -- all while adopting new ways of working and executing with discipline around our cost structures.

I'll take the first part, and then Jane will cover your AUR question. So elevating our brand and attracting high-quality new consumers across all 3 regions, particularly in the U.S., are top priorities, and listen, will continue to be top priorities as we come out of COVID. 
The general message is we're making strong progress. A few points to kind of support that. First, our data shows that our brand has strengthened through the pandemic. Specifically, if you look at brand awareness and purchase intent, they're both up versus a year ago and continuing to progress quarter-on-quarter, with particularly encouraging progress among next-gen consumers and women. 
The second point is that we are acquiring more customers on our digital sites. We've seen 38% growth in North America, 79% growth in Europe and more than tenfold growth in Asia in terms of new customers on our sites year-to-date. This is clearly on the back of the deliberate targeted marketing plans that we've put in place across the regions. And it's also worth noting that we're not just driving higher traffic to our digital businesses, but we're also seeing -- and I think you heard it in Jane's remarks -- an increase in our full-price sales. So we're bringing in new consumers that are higher ticket and higher margin. And I think that bodes well for the future for us. 
The third point is really around our social media presence, which continues to deepen and grow around the world, our followers reached a record high 45 million this quarter, and we're especially encouraged by our progress on key platforms like Instagram and TikTok, YouTube, Kakao Online in Asia, where, as you've likely seen, we've developed some pretty unique partnership, including our recent Bitmoji Snapchat partnership. We're also driving brand heat through product, as you may have seen our recent street work collaboration with Clot, which is a brand founded by Edison Chen and Kevin Poon, based out of Hong Kong. 
There's a lot of excitement around these products. They virtually vaporized as we put them up for access to consumers; within a few seconds, they were sold out. And now you can add them at multiples of the retail price on sites like StockX. So we've been happy with the response we've seen and the contribution to overall brand heat. All this, importantly, is enabled by our strong balance sheet -- Jane just touched on that -- which has allowed us to continue driving our strategic priorities, like brand elevation, like investing in marketing, and also reinstate our dividend in the coming quarters. 
So together, if you put all these elements together, this gives us confidence that we're investing in the right places to elevate our brand and drive interest and heat, particularly with the next generation that we're specifically focused on. And then on your AUR question, I'll let Jane answer that."

So Alex, just -- we are confident in our AUR growth, certainly, because it's led by brand elevation, and that brand elevation is something that we focused on this year and are committed to continuing. And just as I look in the near term, even into Q4, we're expecting AUR growth about comparable to what you saw in Q3. But even as we come out of the pandemic and looking forward into fiscal '22, while we're not guiding, we do expect to comp the underlying AUR growth. Now we know that there have been unusual mix benefits during COVID, with many of our stores and outlet doors closed during the COVID period that lifted AUR. We've tried to be clear about calling that out, and the impacts of COVID to our best estimates were that in Q1, underlying AUR growth was about high single digits. And in Q2 and Q3, it was in the low to mid-teens. So that is what -- that's the basis on which we expect to comp. And what we really feel good about is the long-term guidance for AUR as we move forward, which is in the low to mid-single-digit range, because our long-term drivers are still intact -- as I said, elevating our product, our marketing and shopping experiences, which we've been talking about this year, all focused on elevating our brand; that we have the capabilities and an increasing number of tools that have proved out as we drive personalization in terms of managing promotional levels, better promotional levels, more personalization, more targeted promotions that have been very favorable in terms of driving AUR. Strategic price increases -- it's a muscle that I think we started in F -- over a year ago, starting in our factory channel, and you can see that carries through today, where we've seen sort of a mid-teens price increases in our outlet channels as we elevate that product, put more quality in, and that's been -- we feel that we have more to go on that journey. 
And then, of course, there will be post-COVID continued mix benefits. As structurally, our international businesses grow faster, as we move to be a more DTC oriented company, that will also drive overall AUR. And certainly, the work that we've done in digital on AUR will continue to pay dividends into the future. So we feel really good about our trajectory, understanding there will be some optics coming out of COVID. But I think we've been clear on the base and where we go in the future."

And since that's just a few weeks away for you, can you speak to where we'll see the most important inflections in the recent P&L trends as you transition through into the early part of 2022? 
And then we're starting to hear some commentary around the sector from management teams' thoughts on when they think they can approach pre-pandemic metrics. And as we look at consensus for your company, the general assumption is that the combination of all the work you've done on quality of sales to boost margins, well over $2 of net EPS you've added from the SG&A work you've done -- consensus still has that combination landing at earnings below 2019 levels in the second half of this calendar year, so September and December quarters. I'd love to hear your thoughts on that if you have visibility. So just help us a little bit because of the fiscal year-end that you have here in March?"

So let's peel that apart. So starting with inventory, as we do look at -- while we're very clear that there is some near term disruption, which likely could last into our fiscal '22 from COVID, our long-term optimism and especially in the second half of our fiscal year is high. And so as I think about what we're going to be overlapping, we expect that store comps will be meaningfully better as we move through the year, and certainly as we move through the fiscal year into the second half. And that's really contingent on the vaccine and some of the abatement in the virus, which we believe in. And so we do believe that store comp will continue to be a positive factor as we move through fiscal '22. Certainly, our wholesale businesses have not been immune to the factors of COVID. And I think that as we emerge from the crisis, you'll also see we've been very tight on our sell-in. And sell-in has been under sell-out. 
And so there are good inventory replenishment needs. In the wholesale channel, especially as like our own channels, they come out of COVID. We feel -- our inventories were down 30% in North America in wholesale. They have been sequentially down in Europe. So we feel good about our position. They're ready for fresh product, which we feel we'll be able to fulfill and expect momentum coming out of there. 
And of course, the investments that we're making in digital, as we look across our total digital business, we expect acceleration global -- with our total digital business in Q4. And certainly, as we finish the cleanup in North America, and you can see that domestic consumer up high teens this quarter, we'll be done with a lot of the daigou cleanup, and you'll start to see that acceleration coming into fiscal '22. 
Those are the key drivers that give us optimism in '22. We do feel comfortable about our savings estimate of 100 -- the majority of $180 million to $200 million that we announced in the first realignment plan flowing through to be an EPS driver. 
And with that, our additional savings that we announced today will be used to accelerate and restart all those drivers that I talked about on sales to make sure that we have the investment funds to continue our digital expansion, elevate our brand, focus on marketing, which you've seen us approach with optimism in the fourth quarter, because marketing will be up 50%. Those are the drivers. The question is timing, but we do feel confident about -- certainly in the back half of '22."

On that one, assuming the game ends in 9 innings and doesn't go over time, we're likely at inning #7 on those. 
So we expect -- we probably need a quarter -- one more quarter, Q4, maybe a bit of Q1 to have that completed across these 3 areas. And then on the second stream, I'll be honest with you, I don't think the game ever ends on brand elevation in North America. I think we want to continuously elevate our product, elevate how we show up in marketing, elevate how we're distributed. And I think that's been part of the success of this brand historically, and that's something we will continue to drive. 
So I probably have us on the first inning with a never-ending game for that work stream."

And that -- and we will use those savings to drive important investments in our business like digital, like the work that we've been doing in personalization, which you've seen drive tremendous growth in Europe and is starting to bear fruit in our domestic business in North America; certainly, investment in China, where this year alone, we've opened 85 stores. We intend to grow stores -- new stores. 
We intend to continue that journey as we move forward. We believe we have distribution opportunities in Asia and also more targeted distribution opportunities in Europe and North America, and we will use the savings for that as well as increased marketing. We know that our brand and the elevation of the brand is so much of what is pulling the whole ecosystem up. So continuation of increased marketing across our brand."

So Paul, what you -- what we have seen -- let me start with the second part of your question, and then I will go to flexibility and inflection in FY '22. So what we have seen in our Europe business specifically is that when the stores close, we do see an inflection in our digital business, although it's not a one-for-one offset. 
So you can just see by this quarter, with the shutdowns in our store in Europe in November and then into December, that that suppressed the total -- the total Europe growth, but we did see an acceleration in digital and high-quality digital growth. So we were very pleased with our reduction of discount rate in Europe and the very strong growth that we reported in digital in Europe. 
As I think about the volatility as we move into fiscal '22, I think you're right, it's predicated on COVID and the rollout of the vaccine. And I think what you've seen us in the past is moving with agility. And as we look at our expense structure, we've been able to reinvest in the business, as we are in the fourth quarter; elevate marketing, but do so on a timed basis; and investing into high ROIC categories. And I think that that gives us protection on the downside and protects our profitability as we are very focused on the return of that marketing. 
We will also have more pricing flexibility as we move forward, should there be volatility in the top line. And those are the primary factors that we'll look at as we move forward and understand the variability and volatility. Also, just a shout out to our supply chain who, given the high variability of demand and inventory planning has been able to replenish and shift by category across our broad range of categories, and that's given us the capability to meet demand even though it's been highly variable based on COVID. So that gives us a lot of confidence as well."

But as you look at these new ways of selling in the context of connected retail, we're expecting that to be an accelerator for our digital performance. 
And so a lot of that's been pioneered in Europe. A lot of that is what you see in these very strong numbers this quarter, where we're up 60 -- I believe 68% digital commerce in Europe.

So good foundation, clean foundation. And moving from there, we know and we see we have share opportunities in the doors we are in. And so continued momentum from share. Even this quarter, we saw share gains in Men's, in Kids and Home in the wholesale channel. 
So with that reset base, there's no reason that we -- and we are focused on comp growth in North America wholesale. And the wholesale dot com is an area of wholesale that we're very optimistic about. And so we expect to grow wholesale in their digital -- in the digital business. And then we've been clear that off-price, and especially this quarter, off-price was down meaningfully. Our full-price wholesale on a sell-in basis and sell-out basis were -- in a sell-in basis was much better than what we reported in aggregate for North America wholesale. 
I expect the off-price cleanout as we exit Q4 to be about done, and it will be repositioned to what it should be, which is a channel that we can liquidate excess in. And so that pressure that you're seeing from off-price will abate in fiscal '22. 
So we feel good about the foundation of where we'll be in wholesale. It will be a smaller channel. As you know, we announced the change of Chaps to licensing. Chaps is almost a completely wholesale business in North America. And so you'll see that part shrink the wholesale base. But we feel confident about the value creation of that change. And we feel good about the positions that we're in and how we move forward and focus on growing share in that channel and maximizing pure plays in digital."

Our third quarter performance reflected strong underlying progress on our path to quality, sustainable long-term growth. Overall, revenues improved sequentially and were in line with our expectations. 
Stronger-than-expected recovery in Asia was offset by the impact of continued COVID-19 resurgences across Europe, while North America was roughly in line with our expectations, even with additional COVID pressures. Meanwhile, our focus on brand elevation, improved quality of sales and cost discipline drove better-than-expected gross and operating margin expansion in the quarter, with double-digit AUR growth and digital profitability exceeding our expectations. 
And while COVID is likely to remain a near-term headwind, there is reason to be hopeful as we start the new year and vaccines begin to roll out. Ralph and I are incredibly proud of the dedication, resilience and agility our teams have shown in not only managing through the pandemic, but also positioning the company to emerge stronger than we came into it. 
As part of this, we balanced reset activities with an acceleration of our core strategies, including strengthening our brand and bolstering our marketing and new customer acquisition, expanding key categories in international markets, scaling our connected retail offerings globally, continuing to prune non-elevating distribution and further realigning our cost structure. These actions are consistent with the 5 strategic priorities that we laid out as part of our long-term plan prior to COVID. 
These include: first, win over a new generation of consumers; second, energize core products and accelerate high potential underdeveloped categories; third, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels; fourth, lead with digital across all activities; and fifth, operate with discipline to fuel growth. I will touch on a few of these in a moment. 
But first, let me provide some updates specific to this quarter's performance. As we anticipated at the start of the holiday season, the global retail environment remained volatile due to the pandemic and other macro factors. Nevertheless, apart from the impact of COVID resurgences, we were encouraged by several bright spots in each of our regions this quarter, led notably by Asia and our digital channels globally. 
Asia, which we view in many ways as a blueprint for our progress in other markets, grew 14% to last year. This was driven by continued momentum in the Chinese mainland, with more than 40% reported growth. Japan returned to positive growth in the quarter, while Korea was up double digits. In North America, performance continued to improve sequentially and was in line with our expectations despite rising COVID cases in many of our key markets. 
Our strategy of elevating our brand across digital, department stores and off-price is well underway, and we're still on track to complete the significant portion of this work in fiscal '21. Europe was the most challenging segment this quarter, with the majority of our stores closed for a full month of the key holiday period. In addition to the government-mandated shutdowns, there were also significant operating and travel restrictions throughout the quarter, which have continued into our fourth quarter to date. 
In many ways, the second and third wave restrictions have been more disruptive than the first wave of shutdowns we experienced last spring as they vary greatly by market and by day. Third quarter traffic headwinds were partly mitigated by a strong acceleration across our own and wholesale digital channels in Europe. 
This was driven by our expanded connected retail programs, exclusive capsules with partners like Mytheresa and ASOS, holiday campaigns and influencer activations. We also leveraged this period of disruption to continue our long-term brand elevation in the region, acquiring new high-value consumers and driving increased AUR despite a highly promotional competitive environment. These actions should help position our brands for healthier recovery and ecosystem expansion once we emerge from COVID. 
By channel, digital continues to be a key driver of our performance, with digital sales accelerating in all 3 regions this quarter. We continued to scale up our connected retail offerings and emphasize gifting in key product categories for holiday. These included our iconic sweaters, Holiday Bear programs, home and loungewear that are resonating with consumers today. 
In our brick-and-mortar stores, as I mentioned, traffic was challenged due to COVID, particularly in Europe and North America. But we were strongly encouraged that our teams were able to deliver higher conversion in these channels with double-digit AUR growth and reduced discounting, while also starting to leverage our new connected retail offerings this holiday. 
We also continue to invest in targeted new store expansion in key growth markets with 23 new stores this quarter, primarily in Asia. Within our wholesale business, we were encouraged by continued sequential progress across regions, particularly on wholesale dot com. We still expect pressure on our reported sell-in trends in the near-term as we deliberately exited department store doors early in the pandemic and prioritized inventory management in this environment. As a reminder, this near-term discipline is integral to building price harmonization across our ecosystem and to protecting the elevation in long-term equity of our brands. 
Turning to our efforts to win over a new generation. In the third quarter, we continued to ramp up our personalization initiatives, shift our brand-building efforts increasingly toward digital, and leverage the authentic values that have been central to our brand since Ralph started this company more than 50 years ago. Let me touch on some of the highlights from this quarter. 
First, we launched a fully integrated and diverse Family Is Who You Love holiday campaign across social media, our own stores and digital sites and wholesale environments. We also focused more than ever on creating innovative digital experiences that immerse the consumer in the world of Ralph Lauren. These included our groundbreaking virtual flagship store experiences in Beverly Hills, New York and Paris, where consumers around the world can experience our brands and the full breadth of our assortment in a way that was previously only possible by walking into one of our beautiful stores. Amplifying the reach of our flagships to a global audience, digital traffic in these virtual stores was 8x greater than the foot traffic in these physical stores over the same period. 
We were also the first apparel brand to launch Snapchat's logo scan this holiday. This allows consumers to scan our iconic Polo Pony logo from any surface, including holding items, ads, shopping bags and more to trigger an augmented reality experience that brings them into the world of Ralph Lauren and ultimately transact on our own site. And in Asia, we were excited to launch our livestream selling event with 360-degree activation for Singles' Day, delivering more than 120 million impressions. 
We're investing in these new forms of selling, including social commerce, which we expect to become a greater part of the digital shopping experience long term. 
Looking ahead, we will continue to partner with celebrities and influencers who embody our core values along with being a part of key moments around the world. More recently, Ralph and I were particularly proud of our brand's participation in the U.S. Presidential inauguration. 
Overall, we are encouraged by the momentum we are seeing in consumer engagement across generations. Notably, our brand awareness and purchase intent have accelerated since the start of the pandemic, and we are seeing particularly strong growth from consumers under 35 and women. We added more than 1 million new consumers through our direct-to-consumer platforms alone in Q3. And our total social media followers reached 45 million in the quarter. This was led by continued momentum across key platforms like Instagram, TikTok, YouTube and Snapchat, where our Ralph Lauren Bitmoji Collection is connecting strongly with Gen Z consumers. 
Since the launch last August, over 20 million users have dressed their Bitmoji in Ralph Lauren and tried on the collection over 550 million times. This takes me to our long-term priority of leading with digital. 
Fiscal '21 continues to be a transformational year as we digitize our consumer platform and experiences and how we work as a company. On the consumer-facing side, the continued acceleration of connected retail is essential to creating the best possible experience for our consumers and to our long-term growth. Building on our accelerated connected retail launches in the first half of the year, in the third quarter, we added mobile point of sales across our North American retail fleet, appointment scheduling and curated personal collections online, all while continuing to expand our digital clienteling programs globally. We also launched our Hong Kong digital flagship in time for holiday, which is an important part of our broader ecosystem strategy as consumers shop and travel in new ways. 
In addition to strengthening our digital commerce capabilities, we continue to build our social commerce presence and expand our partnerships with influential digital retailers around the world. Our teams executed a successful global launch campaign this holiday with FARFETCH. We delivered lifestyle content tailored to next-generation consumers, reaching over 15 million impressions globally, including the first ever editorial experience within the FARFETCH app. 
We were encouraged by engagement rates that were 3x higher than our competitive benchmark on this platform. And as we continue to digitize how we work as a company, we launched our integrated vendor management system in the third quarter with the majority of our suppliers. 
This new digitally centralized portal enables us to communicate seamlessly with our suppliers on everything from digital product creation to real-time tracking on our production status and factory capacity. It also enables us to track and support areas like gender diversity at the supplier level. This is all part of our broader goal of elevating our product, streamlining how we bring them to market and making it easier for our teams to stay connected and agile, all while driving our sustainability and citizenship initiatives across everything we do. 
Touching on our work to operate with discipline to fuel growth. Our ongoing focus on balancing growth with productivity continues to be an important element of our long-term plan. And this discipline is even more critical as we make hard choices to realign our cost structure so we can position the company to emerge from COVID stronger than we came into it and pivot back to growth. In the second quarter, we announced the first major actions related to our fiscal 2021 strategic realignment plan. 
These included: first, the simplification of our organization, enabling our teams to move with greater agility; and second, an assessment of our brand portfolio, resulting in the decision to move Chaps to a fully licensed business. Today, we announce the next stage of our plan, which is focused on realigning and driving increased efficiencies across our global real estate footprint. While Jane will discuss these actions in more detail in a moment, I am pleased that we are making good progress on this multi-pronged plan. 
This gives us increased confidence in our ability to start fiscal '22 strong and with the right foundations in place. Importantly, I also want to take a moment to touch on our ongoing work to integrate citizenship and sustainability into everything we do. In the third quarter, we were proud to score 100% on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Corporate Equality Index and earn the designation as a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ equality. On the supply chain and sustainability front, we have leveraged this period of change to continue diversifying across geographies and strengthening our relationships with suppliers, from improved capacity planning to implementing diversity and inclusion training and driving best practices in sustainability. 
In the third quarter, we reaffirmed our commitment to achieving our science-based greenhouse gas emissions targets and joined hundreds of other organizations in calling on the U.S. Federal government to reenter the Paris Climate Agreement, which the new administration recommitted to just a few weeks ago. We look forward to sharing further progress, including our greenhouse gas reduction road map, in our 2021 report update this June. 
In closing, Ralph and I are optimistic about the future of our business and encouraged by the work our teams are doing to emerge from COVID stronger than we came into it. We are spending this time doing the important work of elevating our brand, investing in key strategic areas, streamlining our business and realigning our cost structure. We have made meaningful progress in delivering digital experiences for all of our consumers around the world and driving our direct-to-consumer channels, all while pursuing our goal of becoming a more equitable, diverse and sustainable company. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions."

Our third quarter results demonstrate solid execution of our strategy through this holiday season in the midst of a still challenging operating environment. We continue to focus on what we can control in this dynamic context and on positioning the company to accelerate value creation as we emerge from the pandemic. This includes investing in our powerful lifestyle brands, our digital transformation and maintaining a strong balance sheet while also realigning and streamlining our operational and expense structures. 
As Patrice mentioned, today we announced the second round of actions related to our fiscal '21 strategic realignment plan. This stage focuses on realigning our real estate footprint to our future strategic priorities. This includes: first, reducing our North America corporate office footprint up to 30%, along with selected reductions in Europe and Asia, as our teams embrace new ways of working and we pivot resources to our key strategic priorities; second, closing up to 10 retail locations globally pending ongoing landlord negotiations. Combined with the successful lease renegotiations completed year-to-date, we expect these savings to drive improved profitability in our existing fleet while we continue to expand our brand elevating ecosystems. And third, completing the consolidation of our North American distribution center operations to drive greater efficiencies, improve sustainability and deliver a better consumer experience with faster average delivery times and an increased focus on connected retail. 
Combined, these actions are expected to result in gross annualized pretax expense savings of approximately $200 million to $240 million, inclusive of our previously announced organization savings. 
While we still expect the majority of the original $180 million to $200 million in organizational savings to flow through to the bottom line, we expect to reinvest the majority of our savings related to today's actions in our future growth. We will provide any additional updates to the plan as the actions are finalized. 
Moving on to the third quarter performance. Third quarter revenues declined 18% following a 30% decline in the second quarter. Asia and North America both improved sequentially, while Europe was more significantly impacted by COVID and mandated closures and restrictions in the quarter. Global wholesale revenue declined 19%, and direct-to-consumer revenues were down 16%. Our digital business outperformed with sales up more than 20% to last year, including double-digit growth in all regions. And even more importantly, our digital operating margins continued to expand, with Q3 digital margins up 900 basis points to last year and accretive to our total company rate through a combination of higher quality of sales and operating expense leverage. 
Driving profitability in this business remains key, not only to our long-term margin accretion and shift to DTC, but also to our strategy of repositioning ralphlauren.com as our digital flagship or the best expression of our brand online. Total company adjusted gross margin was 65.4% in the third quarter, up 320 basis points to last year. 
Gross margin expansion was primarily driven by strong AUR growth, along with favorable geographic and channel mix shifts. Around 60 basis points of this quarter's gross margin expansion was driven by unusual mix shifts due to COVID, with the remainder driven primarily by our continued global improvements in pricing and promotions. Third quarter AUR growth of 19% was above our expectations, with North America and Europe up double digits and Asia up high single digits. We continue to elevate our brands across every touch point, significantly reduce promotions, and take targeted pricing increases. Our confidence in this strategy is reinforced by our continued improvement in full price penetration, larger baskets, and better-than-expected conversion, even as AUR growth has exceeded our expectations. 
Operating expenses declined 11% to last year, driven by reductions in compensation, rent and other expenses as we continue to work in new ways. Adjusted operating margin for the third quarter was 13.3%, down 70 basis points to last year. Marketing in the third quarter decreased 3%. We shifted some investments into the fourth quarter of the year as store closures and in-store shopping restrictions increased due to rising COVID cases. 
However, we accelerated select strategic marketing investments this holiday, focusing on higher-margin, new customer acquisition in North American digital and reactivation of in-person events in Asia. We expect fourth quarter marketing to increase about 50% to support our long-term brand-building activities and key events like Lunar New Year and the Australian Open. This elevated growth rate reflects both the timing shift from Q3 and lapping of last year's depressed marketing spend as COVID hit Asia, followed by Europe and North America. 
Moving on to segment performance, starting with North America. Revenue decreased 21% to last year. Retail comps declined 21%, driven by a 30% decline in bricks-and-mortar comps, while our own digital comps improved sequentially to 9%. Brick-and-mortar comps continued to be impacted by COVID-related traffic declines with third quarter traffic down 45% and foreign tourist sales down about 85%. However, we continued to drive our strategy of improving quality of sales, with our third quarter discount rate down nearly 400 basis points, AUR up mid-teens, and conversion up more than 200 basis points in our brick-and-mortar channel. 
Our digital commerce comps were up 9%, with total digital sales up 10% in the quarter. Underlying sales to domestic consumers grew high teens, while sales to international daigou consumers declined double digits to last year as planned. We reduced our site-wide promotions by 52 days compared to the prior year, as we continued to elevate our digital experience, driving AUR up 22% and gross margins up more than 800 basis points to last year in the channel. 
While these deliberate reductions in promotional activity are a headwind to our digital comps in fiscal '21, we continue to invest more aggressively on new consumer acquisition during this transition period. Our accelerated investment in digital marketing generated a 27% increase in new customers during this competitive holiday quarter, exceeding our expectations. 
Year-to-date, these new consumers are transacting at higher gross margin rates and larger basket sizes and represent a higher penetration of consumers under 35. Looking ahead, we are focused on retaining these new consumers and are encouraged thus far by repeat purchase rates. Stronger sales to domestic consumers this quarter were driven by our ongoing investments in connected retailing, like Buy Online-Pick Up in Store; new functionality like online exchanges and Klarna payment installments; and expanded personalization and targeted marketing efforts. All of these initiatives helped deliver a significant increase in our full-price sales this quarter, which grew more than 130% to last year. 
In North America wholesale, third quarter revenue declined 22% as we continue to manage our shipments carefully and realigned inventories to demand. Full price sales declined at a more moderate rate, driven by stronger trends in core replenishment, Polo men's, kids and home, while Lauren Women's remained challenged, consistent with the broader category. 
Our inventories in the marketplace were clean and well positioned at the end of the third quarter, declining more than 30% at North America wholesale. Our sales to off-price were down meaningfully as planned as we continued to significantly reduce our penetration in this channel. 
Moving on to Europe. Third quarter revenue declined 28% on a reported basis and 32% in constant currency. Europe retail comps were down 38%, with a 51% decline in our bricks-and-mortar store comps, partly offset by an acceleration in our own digital commerce, up 68%. 
Across Europe, our bricks-and-mortar businesses were significantly impacted by traffic headwinds, with some form of store closures or restrictions across 16 of our 17 markets in the region, ranging from curfews and weekend closures to full lockdown. Despite these pressures, our conversion improved and AUR increased 12% to last year, driven by our ongoing strategy to elevate our factory channel. 
Strong momentum in our own digital commerce comp was driven by our new consumer acquisition, up 112%, along with expanded connected retailing initiatives, gifting programs, and improved digital content. 
Europe wholesale revenues declined 22% in constant currency as we continued to limit shipments to reset our inventories to demand. COVID-related challenges at bricks-and-mortar wholesale were partially offset by stronger performance at our wholesale digital accounts, where sell-in and sell-out rates were both positive for the quarter. 
Turning to Asia. Revenue increased 14% on a reported basis and 9% in constant currency. Our Asian retail comps increased 3%, with bricks-and-mortar stores up 1% and digital comps up 54%. We are encouraged that growth in the Chinese mainland is not only back to pre-COVID levels of more than 40% on a reported basis, but growing versus [ LLY ]. 
Japan also returned to positive growth in the third quarter, with sales increasing high single digits on a reported basis following a second COVID wave in Q2. However, we continue to watch Japan closely, as key areas like Tokyo and Osaka entered a state of emergency in January. 
Overall momentum in our Asian digital businesses continued through the quarter, driven by strong performance across all key markets and channels, including our own sites and digital pure plays, where we added 4 new partners in the quarter. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with $2.8 billion in cash and investments and $1.6 billion in total debt, which compares to $1.9 billion in cash and investments and $694 million in total debt at the end of last year's third quarter. 
While we have managed our balance sheet carefully since the start of the pandemic to preserve liquidity, we are monitoring COVID conditions closely. And based on our current outlook, we are planning to reinstate our dividend in the first half of fiscal '22. 
Net inventory declined 4% to last year, including a 2% decline in North America, 15% decline in Europe and a 7% increase in Asia to support growth. While we have taken a highly cautious approach to managing inventory through the pandemic, overall we are encouraged by our team's ability to both move inventories across regions and to merchandise around our core and iconic styles as well as key COVID categories like home, loungewear and casual tees. 
Our increased agility is also enabling us to drive core product replenishment and shift back into pre-COVID categories as consumers start returning to more normalized trends. 
Looking ahead, our outlook is based on our best assessment of current COVID lockdowns and trends and is subject to change given the dynamic nature of COVID developments around the world. 
We currently expect fourth quarter revenues to decline approximately mid- to high single digits, representing a meaningful sequential improvement from the first 3 quarters of the year. This includes the impact of third wave COVID lockdowns in the U.K. and Germany from the start of the quarter through approximately mid-February as well as partial closures in France, Spain and Italy; third wave lockdowns in Japan through early March; and a slow recovery in North America, where we have also seen increased cases and COVID-related traffic headwinds. If government-mandated lockdowns or restrictions are extended from these periods or more severe restrictions are applied, this could negatively impact our current outlook. These COVID-related headwinds should be partially mitigated by continued momentum in China and our global digital businesses. 
We expect gross margins to continue expanding, albeit at a more moderate rate than the first 3 quarters of the year as we strategically repurpose full price product from last year's COVID shutdowns to our factory channels. 
Improved pricing and promotions, including targeted consumer messaging, should continue to be the most durable driver, followed by geographic and channel mix. We expect operating expenses to increase low single digits as we reaccelerate our brand-building investments to support growth coming out of the pandemic, largely offset by our ongoing expense discipline. 
Excluding marketing, operating expenses are expected to decline low single digits. We expect inventories to increase in the fourth quarter as we start building back into demand and lap last year's double-digit decline in response to COVID. 
In closing, we are encouraged by the progress our teams have made over the first 3 quarters of the year. 
As we close out this fiscal year, we are focused on offense as we leverage all of the critical work our teams have done prior to and through the pandemic to position the company for quality, long-term growth. Led by Ralph's enduring vision to guide us through a still highly dynamic global environment, we are accelerating our core strategies, including, first and foremost, elevating our brands; driving our company-wide digital transformation; and targeting expansion in key geographies -- all while adopting new ways of working and executing with discipline around our cost structures. With that, let's open up the call for your questions."

We're a year into the pandemic now, and you've clearly expanded digital capabilities, you've taken meaningful steps to reset distribution cost structure. But if we look at your most important asset, the Ralph Lauren brand, can you talk to what gives you confidence in your brand health now? And is this where you want it to be in order to support strong growth coming out of the pandemic? 
And then my second question, relatedly is on how confident you are that we should see AUR growth in F '22 off the higher AUR base in a backdrop that may well be a little more promotional than during the pandemic?"

I'll take the first part, and then Jane will cover your AUR question. So elevating our brand and attracting high-quality new consumers across all 3 regions, particularly in the U.S., are top priorities, and listen, will continue to be top priorities as we come out of COVID. 
The general message is we're making strong progress. A few points to kind of support that. First, our data shows that our brand has strengthened through the pandemic. Specifically, if you look at brand awareness and purchase intent, they're both up versus a year ago and continuing to progress quarter-on-quarter, with particularly encouraging progress among next-gen consumers and women. 
The second point is that we are acquiring more customers on our digital sites. We've seen 38% growth in North America, 79% growth in Europe and more than tenfold growth in Asia in terms of new customers on our sites year-to-date. This is clearly on the back of the deliberate targeted marketing plans that we've put in place across the regions. And it's also worth noting that we're not just driving higher traffic to our digital businesses, but we're also seeing -- and I think you heard it in Jane's remarks -- an increase in our full-price sales. So we're bringing in new consumers that are higher ticket and higher margin. And I think that bodes well for the future for us. 
The third point is really around our social media presence, which continues to deepen and grow around the world, our followers reached a record high 45 million this quarter, and we're especially encouraged by our progress on key platforms like Instagram and TikTok, YouTube, Kakao Online in Asia, where, as you've likely seen, we've developed some pretty unique partnership, including our recent Bitmoji Snapchat partnership. We're also driving brand heat through product, as you may have seen our recent street work collaboration with Clot, which is a brand founded by Edison Chen and Kevin Poon, based out of Hong Kong. 
There's a lot of excitement around these products. They virtually vaporized as we put them up for access to consumers; within a few seconds, they were sold out. And now you can add them at multiples of the retail price on sites like StockX. So we've been happy with the response we've seen and the contribution to overall brand heat. All this, importantly, is enabled by our strong balance sheet -- Jane just touched on that -- which has allowed us to continue driving our strategic priorities, like brand elevation, like investing in marketing, and also reinstate our dividend in the coming quarters. 
So together, if you put all these elements together, this gives us confidence that we're investing in the right places to elevate our brand and drive interest and heat, particularly with the next generation that we're specifically focused on. And then on your AUR question, I'll let Jane answer that."

So Alex, just -- we are confident in our AUR growth, certainly, because it's led by brand elevation, and that brand elevation is something that we focused on this year and are committed to continuing. And just as I look in the near term, even into Q4, we're expecting AUR growth about comparable to what you saw in Q3. But even as we come out of the pandemic and looking forward into fiscal '22, while we're not guiding, we do expect to comp the underlying AUR growth. Now we know that there have been unusual mix benefits during COVID, with many of our stores and outlet doors closed during the COVID period that lifted AUR. We've tried to be clear about calling that out, and the impacts of COVID to our best estimates were that in Q1, underlying AUR growth was about high single digits. And in Q2 and Q3, it was in the low to mid-teens. So that is what -- that's the basis on which we expect to comp. And what we really feel good about is the long-term guidance for AUR as we move forward, which is in the low to mid-single-digit range, because our long-term drivers are still intact -- as I said, elevating our product, our marketing and shopping experiences, which we've been talking about this year, all focused on elevating our brand; that we have the capabilities and an increasing number of tools that have proved out as we drive personalization in terms of managing promotional levels, better promotional levels, more personalization, more targeted promotions that have been very favorable in terms of driving AUR. Strategic price increases -- it's a muscle that I think we started in F -- over a year ago, starting in our factory channel, and you can see that carries through today, where we've seen sort of a mid-teens price increases in our outlet channels as we elevate that product, put more quality in, and that's been -- we feel that we have more to go on that journey. 
And then, of course, there will be post-COVID continued mix benefits. As structurally, our international businesses grow faster, as we move to be a more DTC oriented company, that will also drive overall AUR. And certainly, the work that we've done in digital on AUR will continue to pay dividends into the future. So we feel really good about our trajectory, understanding there will be some optics coming out of COVID. But I think we've been clear on the base and where we go in the future."

And as we look at consensus for your company, the general assumption is that the combination of all the work you've done on quality of sales to boost margins, well over $2 of net EPS you've added from the SG&A work you've done -- consensus still has that combination landing at earnings below 2019 levels in the second half of this calendar year, so September and December quarters. I'd love to hear your thoughts on that if you have visibility. So just help us a little bit because of the fiscal year-end that you have here in March?"

So starting with inventory, as we do look at -- while we're very clear that there is some near term disruption, which likely could last into our fiscal '22 from COVID, our long-term optimism and especially in the second hal",444,"Sure. So let's peel that apart. So starting with inventory, as we do look at -- while we're very clear that there is some near term disruption, which likely could last into our fiscal '22 from COVID, our long-term optimism and especially in the second half of our fiscal year is high. And so as I think about what we're going to be overlapping, we expect that store comps will be meaningfully better as we move through the year, and certainly as we move through the fiscal year into the second half. And that's really contingent on the vaccine and some of the abatement in the virus, which we believe in. And so we do believe that store comp will continue to be a positive factor as we move through fiscal '22. Certainly, our wholesale businesses have not been immune to the factors of COVID. And I think that as we emerge from the crisis, you'll also see we've been very tight on our sell-in. And sell-in has been under sell-out. 
And so there are good inventory replenishment needs. In the wholesale channel, especially as like our own channels, they come out of COVID. We feel -- our inventories were down 30% in North America in wholesale. They have been sequentially down in Europe. So we feel good about our position. They're ready for fresh product, which we feel we'll be able to fulfill and expect momentum coming out of there. 
And of course, the investments that we're making in digital, as we look across our total digital business, we expect acceleration global -- with our total digital business in Q4. And certainly, as we finish the cleanup in North America, and you can see that domestic consumer up high teens this quarter, we'll be done with a lot of the daigou cleanup, and you'll start to see that acceleration coming into fiscal '22. 
Those are the key drivers that give us optimism in '22. We do feel comfortable about our savings estimate of 100 -- the majority of $180 million to $200 million that we announced in the first realignment plan flowing through to be an EPS driver. 
And with that, our additional savings that we announced today will be used to accelerate and restart all those drivers that I talked about on sales to make sure that we have the investment funds to continue our digital expansion, elevate our brand, focus on marketing, which you've seen us approach with optimism in the fourth quarter, because marketing will be up 50%. Those are the drivers. The question is timing, but we do feel confident about -- certainly in the back half of '22."

On that one, assuming the game ends in 9 innings and doesn't go over time, we're likely at inning #7 on those. 
So we expect -- we probably need a quarter -- one more quarter, Q4, maybe a bit of Q1 to have that completed across these 3 areas. And then on the second stream, I'll be honest with you, I don't think the game ever ends on brand elevation in North America. I think we want to continuously elevate our product, elevate how we show up in marketing, elevate how we're distributed. And I think that's been part of the success of this brand historically, and that's something we will continue to drive. 
So I probably have us on the first inning with a never-ending game for that work stream."

We intend to grow stores -- new stores. 
We intend to continue that journey as we move forward. We believe we have distribution opportunities in Asia and also more targeted distribution opportunities in Europe and North America, and we will use the savings for that as well as increased marketing.

So Paul, what you -- what we have seen -- let me start with the second part of your question, and then I will go to flexibility and inflection in FY '22. So what we have seen in our Europe business specifically is that when the stores close, we do see an inflection in our digital business, although it's not a one-for-one offset. 
So you can just see by this quarter, with the shutdowns in our store in Europe in November and then into December, that that suppressed the total -- the total Europe growth, but we did see an acceleration in digital and high-quality digital growth. So we were very pleased with our reduction of discount rate in Europe and the very strong growth that we reported in digital in Europe. 
As I think about the volatility as we move into fiscal '22, I think you're right, it's predicated on COVID and the rollout of the vaccine. And I think what you've seen us in the past is moving with agility. And as we look at our expense structure, we've been able to reinvest in the business, as we are in the fourth quarter; elevate marketing, but do so on a timed basis; and investing into high ROIC categories. And I think that that gives us protection on the downside and protects our profitability as we are very focused on the return of that marketing. 
We will also have more pricing flexibility as we move forward, should there be volatility in the top line. And those are the primary factors that we'll look at as we move forward and understand the variability and volatility. Also, just a shout out to our supply chain who, given the high variability of demand and inventory planning has been able to replenish and shift by category across our broad range of categories, and that's given us the capability to meet demand even though it's been highly variable based on COVID. So that gives us a lot of confidence as well."

But as you look at these new ways of selling in the context of connected retail, we're expecting that to be an accelerator for our digital performance. 
And so a lot of that's been pioneered in Europe. A lot of that is what you see in these very strong numbers this quarter, where we're up 60 -- I believe 68% digital commerce in Europe. And I think that is a sustainable set of capabilities that will help us continue to accelerate progress on that front."

So good foundation, clean foundation. And moving from there, we know and we see we have share opportunities in the doors we are in. And so continued momentum from share. Even this quarter, we saw share gains in Men's, in Kids and Home in the wholesale channel. 
So with that reset base, there's no reason that we -- and we are focused on comp growth in North America wholesale. And the wholesale dot com is an area of wholesale that we're very optimistic about. And so we expect to grow wholesale in their digital -- in the digital business. And then we've been clear that off-price, and especially this quarter, off-price was down meaningfully. Our full-price wholesale on a sell-in basis and sell-out basis were -- in a sell-in basis was much better than what we reported in aggregate for North America wholesale. 
I expect the off-price cleanout as we exit Q4 to be about done, and it will be repositioned to what it should be, which is a channel that we can liquidate excess in. And so that pressure that you're seeing from off-price will abate in fiscal '22. 
So we feel good about the foundation of where we'll be in wholesale. It will be a smaller channel. As you know, we announced the change of Chaps to licensing. Chaps is almost a completely wholesale business in North America. And so you'll see that part shrink the wholesale base. But we feel confident about the value creation of that change. And we feel good about the positions that we're in and how we move forward and focus on growing share in that channel and maximizing pure plays in digital."

And we are getting some leverage on our fixed cost base, which is well built out and is ready to be leveraged from a growth standpoint. 
So we feel good about it has multiple drivers across all the vectors. And the most work has been on the North America site. That's where we've seen the biggest ladder up in this quarter in terms of digital margins, but tremendous progress in Europe over the past over the past 6 quarters.

As we close out this fiscal year, Ralph and I are proud and inspired by the way our teams have navigated through the pandemic. They have demonstrated their resilience, agility and ongoing passion for our brand and our consumers in a year unlike any other. Their commitment and execution shines true in our better-than-expected fourth quarter results. 
Against the volatile backdrop of the past year, we took action that has enabled us to emerge from this period a fundamentally stronger company than when we came into it. This includes: first, across all 3 regions, we accelerated our work to elevate our brands while also strengthening and simplifying our brand portfolio. We're also engaging more meaningfully with consumers and driving increased marketing to deliver higher brand awareness and purchase intent, coupled with higher AURs. 
Second, we repositioned each of our channels and reduced our exposure to secularly challenged areas of distribution, particularly in North America. Within wholesale, we focused our brick-and-mortar presence on our healthier stores and significantly reduced our off-price penetration. Within direct-to-consumer, we accelerated our shift to digital, step-changing profitability by over 1,000 basis points as we added new connected retail capabilities and drove quality of sales. 
Third, we established a stronger visual infrastructure globally while also ramping up our investments in consumer analytics, personalization and high-value new customer acquisition. 
Fourth, within our supply chain, we further diversified across geographies and meaningfully shortened lead times with approximately 2/3 of our products now on lead times of 6 months or less, two years ahead of our goal to reach 50% and compared to just 20% 5 years ago. 
And lastly, we created a leaner, more agile cost structure. This operating discipline is enabling us to accelerate growth investments across areas like marketing, digital and our key city ecosystems, with further expansion in select underpenetrated markets this year. Overall, these actions position our business for healthier, more sustainable growth as we emerge from COVID. And beyond the foundational work we delivered this year, we strongly believe our brand is uniquely positioned to capture share, both during this transitional post-pandemic period and longer term. 
Ralph has created a lifestyle brand that is inclusive and marked by a spirit of togetherness, optimism and love. And we believe this is the kind of luxury that people are creating in this moment. The breadth of our lifestyle portfolio means we have the ability to continue meeting consumers' desires for comfort and timeless core items while also delivering on their increasing appetite to reintegrate elevated dressier styles back into their wardrobes. Over the coming quarters, you will see us progressively evolve our assortments accordingly. 
Before I speak to our growth drivers, I want to share a few of the highlights from our 5 strategic pillars this quarter and year. First, on our efforts to win over a new generation. Some of our key campaigns this year included our Ralph Lauren Bitmoji Collection on Snapchat with over 1 billion trials to date. Our first-of-its-kind virtual store experience, which now includes 5 of our iconic flagships globally. Our Spring '21 collection, featuring a live performance from Janel Mona, with over 36 million video views and more than 8 billion total impressions. Our limited edition Polo collaboration with Edison Chan's Clock brand ahead of the Luna New Year, which sold out in less than 2 minutes on our WeChat Mini program in China and with over 6 billion total impressions. And our [indiscernible] sponsorship of the Australian Open, which resonated particularly well across Asia. And more still to come with our summer sports program, including the Tokyo Olympics starting in just over 2 months. In all, we added approximately 4 million new consumers to our direct-to-consumer platforms alone this past fiscal year. And our total social media followers exceeded 45 million, led by Instagram, Tick Talk, Kakao and Snapchat. 
This takes me to our priority of meeting with digital. Fiscal '21 was a transformational year in digitizing our consumer platforms and experiences as well as how we work as a company. And we were proud to deliver significant acceleration in digital performance across each of our regions, with total digital ecosystem growth of more than 60% this quarter. We accelerated the rollout of connected retail programs to enable our consumers to interact with our brands in new and more personal ways. Among the many new capabilities we added this year, highlights included: digital catalogs, buy online, pick up in store and curbside pickup, mobile checkout, contactless payments and Klarna payment installments. Connected retail options now represents a high single-digit percentage of our retail revenues in North America and a high-teens percentage in Europe, up from low single digits in both regions prior to COVID. We also continued to roll out digital flagships in Japan and Hong Kong, while adding new partnerships with influential digital partners around the world like FARFETCH. 
In the fourth quarter, we also rolled out digital ID tagging to 50% of our Polo products and are on track to reach 100% by end of fiscal '22. These not only enable product authentication and support future circularity, but also provide consumers access to detailed product information. 
In addition to our consumer-facing enhancements, we made significant strides this year in digitizing how we work as a company. This includes the adoption of virtual showrooms and continuing to expand our 3D digital product creation. Touching on our work to operate with discipline to fuel growth. We accelerated key actions this year to realign our cost structure, many of which I outlined at the outset of our call. 
The third and final stage of our fiscal '21 strategic realignment plan was our announcement last week to sell Club Monaco, expected to close in Q1. This sale, combined with our previously announced action on shifting Chaps to a license model, will enable us to further focus our resources on our core name states brands. 
Club Monaco has been an important part of Ralph Lauren for over 2 decades now. We are proud of the brand's evolution over that time, thanks to the passion and dedication of its talented, experienced and engaged global team. We believe that this is the right step forward for the brand, and we are confident in the brand's strong future under Region's stewardship. With this step and the actions we have taken as part of our strategic realignment plan, we continue to progress on our brand elevation journey, as we deliver Ralph's vision in today's dynamic environment, creating value for all of our stakeholders in fiscal '22 and beyond. 
Importantly, I also want to take a moment to highlight our ongoing work to integrate citizenship and sustainability into everything we do. Navigating a highly dynamic global retail environment in the midst of COVID-19, our first priority was to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our employees, partners and communities. This year, we donated hundreds of thousands of PPE to frontline workers; 3 million products to frontline workers and families in need, doubling our initial commitment; and $10 million in COVID-19 relief from the Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation to support our employees, communities and charitable partners. We were also proud to be named once again one of Forbes 2021 America's Best Employers for Diversity, capping off an important and defining year of employee engagement roundtables and learning opportunities for our organization. 
Within sustainability, we launched our Circularity strategy, as well as Color On Demand, a revolutionary platform aimed at delivering the world's first scalable zero wastewater cotton dyeing system. We are open sourcing the first phase of the platform to the fashion industry. Our hope is that we will see broad industry adoption so that together, we can make progress in addressing one of our sector's biggest area of impact. 
We look forward to sharing our comprehensive progress on our citizenship and sustainability journey in our 2021 Design the Change report this June. Looking to fiscal year '22, though still volatile, given ongoing COVID closures and global supply chain disruptions, we are optimistic on a more favorable operating environment ahead. 
Consistent with the 5 pillars of our Next Great Chapter plan, we expect top line growth over the next year to be driven by a combination of continuing to scale digital, which now represents more than 25% of our total sales; expanding our key city ecosystems, led by fast-growing markets like China, in addition to our underpenetrated areas in North America and Europe; accelerating marketing investments, including new consumer acquisition, targeting and personalization; and continuing on our brand elevation journey more broadly across our distribution and product assortments, driving further AUR growth, coupled with unit growth. 
Furthermore, we have confidence in a new post-pandemic fashion cycle based on the strong full price performance of our Spring '21 collections. Our consumers are starting to gravitate back to newness, color and the styles we are best known for, such as our iconic mesh polos, blazers and denim. This trend comes on top of the continued momentum we are seeing in fleece, tees, novelty sweaters and other casual styles that have resonated over the past year. With our brand's unique ability to assort compelling products across sportswear, loungewear and dress to your styles, we will be consumers growing demand across these categories in the coming season. 
In closing, Ralph and I want to reiterate how proud we are of the dedication, resilience and agility our teams have demonstrated as we worked through a challenging year on many levels. We enter fiscal year '22 stronger than we came into the crisis. With a stronger go-to-market model, a more streamlined cost structure, more resilient supply chain and an iconic brand well positioned to capitalize on the relaxed but sophisticated style consumers are craving. As we look ahead, we have significant opportunity and a world-class team focused on becoming an even more elevated, more direct-to-consumer, more digital, more global and more diverse, equitable and sustainable company. 
And before I pass it to Jane, a couple of updates regarding our Board. Hubert Joly will step into the role of Lead Independent Director previously held by Frank Bennack, while Frank will continue to serve on our Board. In addition, Ralph and I would like to extend our thanks to Joel Fleishman, who plans to retire from our Board of Directors this July, for his leadership, significant contributions to the company and unflagging support and kindness. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jane to discuss our financial results. And I'll join her at the end to answer your questions."

With the extraordinary efforts of our teams around the world, we closed out the year significantly stronger than we came into it in terms of both our financial performance as well as our key strategic initia",2282,"Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. With the extraordinary efforts of our teams around the world, we closed out the year significantly stronger than we came into it in terms of both our financial performance as well as our key strategic initiatives. Our fourth quarter and full year results reflected increased agility across our organization as macro conditions and consumer behaviors evolved; a significant leap forward on our elevation journey as we repositioned our distribution and accelerated our pricing gains; our digital transformation from how we serve our consumers to the way we work and driving digital margin accretion; and a better aligned operational and expense structure overall. 
This year, we delivered the highest gross margin in the company's history. Even excluding the onetime mix benefits of COVID, our underlying gross margin for fiscal '21 was about 64.2%. We also strengthened our balance sheet through this year of uncertainty and are pleased to announce the reinstatement of our dividend in the first quarter of fiscal '22. And as Patrice mentioned, we announced the final stage of our strategic realignment plan with the sale of Club Monaco, contributing about 40 to 50 basis points to operating margins this year. These actions set the right foundation and strategic focus for our teams as we enter fiscal '22. 
Moving on to our fourth quarter performance. Our business returned to growth in the fourth quarter. Total revenues increased 1% compared to an 18% decline in the third quarter. All regions improved sequentially, with positive growth in Asia and Europe on a reported basis despite continued COVID-related disruptions. North America also returned to positive comps this quarter, driven by significant digital acceleration. Global wholesale revenues increased 1% and direct-to-consumer revenues were up 4%. 
Total digital ecosystem sales accelerated to more than 60% with double-digit growth in every region, up from mid-single digits in the first 9 months of the year. And we delivered digital margins that were accretive within every region and to our total company rate, expanding more than 1,000 basis points in the fourth quarter and full year. We achieved this outstanding result through a combination of higher quality of sales and operating expense leverage. This was an important step as we work toward our mid-teens company operating margin target and continue to drive digital expansion in the years to come. 
Total company adjusted gross margin was 62.9% in the fourth quarter, up 380 basis points to last year. Gross margin expansion was primarily driven by strong AUR growth, along with favorable geographic and channel mix shift. Product costs were also lower as we lapped last year's tariff impacts in North America, partially offset by higher freight costs this year. Around 80 basis points of fourth quarter and 150 basis points of full year gross margin expansion were driven by unusual mix shifts due to COVID. Fourth quarter AUR growth of 30% represented our 16th consecutive quarter of AUR gains as we continue on our brand elevation journey. Underlying AUR growth of about 20% was driven by a combination of reduced promotional activity, improved full-price selling on our new spring collections and strategic price increases. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our long-term target of low to mid-single-digit AUR growth, supported by the same multipronged strategy of product elevation, acquisition of new full-price consumers and favorable channel and geographic mix while also ramping up our targeting and personalization efforts. 
Operating expenses declined 4% to last year, driven by reductions in compensation, rent and other expenses as we started to realize the early benefits of our fiscal '21 restructuring. Adjusted operating margins for the fourth quarter was 3.4%, up 680 basis points to last year. Marketing in the fourth quarter accelerated to 44% growth as we reactivated in-person activities, continue to drive high-impact digital campaigns and personalization, and shifted certain investments from the first 3 quarters of the year due to COVID lockdowns. For the full year, marketing increased to 6% of sales, up from 4.5% the prior year. With sales growth expected to accelerate in fiscal '22, we expect marketing to remain at an elevated level to support our long-term brand building, digital activations and key events like the Olympics, U.S. Open and Wimbledon. 
Moving on to segment performance, starting with North America. Fourth quarter revenue decreased 10% to last year but continued to improve on a sequential basis, including an earlier-than-expected return to positive retail comps up 3%. Comps in our owned digital commerce business were up 25% this quarter, accelerating from 9% in Q3. Underlying sales to domestic consumers accelerated to over 50% up from high teens in Q3, while the sales to international daigou consumers declined double digits to last year as planned. We reduced our site-wide promotions by 50 days compared to the prior year as we continue to elevate our digital experience, driving AUR up more than 40% and gross margins up more than 700 basis points to last year in the channel. 
At the same time, we continue to invest in new consumer acquisition, up 78% in the fourth quarter and 45% for the full year. These new consumers are transacting at higher gross margin rates and larger basket sizes and represent a higher penetration of consumers under 35. Stronger sales of new Spring '21 product offering, along with continued investments in connected retailing, helped deliver a significant increase in our full-price sales this quarter, which grew more than 150% the last year. Brick-and-mortar comps improved sequentially to down 2% in the quarter, with meaningful improvements in AUR, basket size and conversion. Traffic was down 23%, but inflected to positive growth in the last 3 weeks of March as we started to lap COVID shutdowns while foreign tourist sales were down about 75%. 
In North America Wholesale, fourth quarter revenue declined 22% as we continue to manage our sell-in carefully through the spring season. However, we were encouraged by positive sellout performance along with double-digit AUR increases to both last year and double LY. Our inventories in the marketplace were clean and well positioned at year-end, declining nearly 30% at North America Wholesale. And we expect a meaningful turnaround in our sell-in trends as we enter Q1. 
Our sales to off-price were down double digits as planned, reducing our penetration to the channel by about 450 basis points for the full year. Overall, we completed our distribution reset plans in North America this year across digital, department stores and off-price, enabling us to enter fiscal '22 with a healthier, more elevated brand positioning. We ended fiscal '21 with North America brick-and-mortar full-price wholesale penetration at about 10% of total company revenues, down from mid-teens last year as we continue to accelerate our wholesale.com direct-to-consumer and international expansion. 
Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the positive momentum in our direct-to-consumer comps, including digital acceleration and quality wholesale improvement. 
Moving on to Europe. Fourth quarter revenue increased 5% on a reported basis and was down 4% in constant currency. Europe retail comps were down 45% with 65% decline in brick-and-mortar stores, partially offset by continued acceleration in our owned digital commerce up 79%. More than half our stores were fully closed in the quarter, similar to last spring. Nevertheless, we were able to drive significantly better performance compared to our Q1 lockdown as strong momentum across digital helped to offset brick-and-mortar headwinds. About 80% of our stores in the region are now fully open versus a little over 50% at the end of Q4. Strong momentum in our own digital commerce comps was driven by new consumer acquisition and personalization up 75%. 
Europe wholesale revenue increased 29% in constant currency. COVID-related challenges of brick-and-mortar wholesale were more than offset by stronger performance in our wholesale digital accounts. This quarter's wholesale performance significantly exceeded our expectations despite ongoing COVID headwinds, underscoring both the strength of our partnerships as well as our successful pivot to digital in the market. And while COVID restrictions continue to pressure many of our key European markets into fiscal '22, we are encouraged that the U.K., our largest market in the region, emerged from lockdowns in mid-April and is showing early signs of pent-up demand. Underlying macro indicators are also encouraging with an improving pace of vaccination rollout, high levels of consumer savings and consumer purchases shifting back toward our pre-COVID categories this spring. 
Turning to Asia. Revenue increased 35% on a reported basis and 28% in constant currency in the fourth quarter. Our Asia retail comps increased 23%, with brick-and-mortar stores up 21% and digital up 59%. All of our key markets reported positive growth led by the Chinese Mainland, which was up 145% in constant currency and more than 70% to LLY. Korea also accelerated to 50% growth. Japan, our largest market in the region, grew mid-single digits despite COVID restrictions in the first half of the quarter. 
We are encouraged that our digital businesses continue to accelerate even as brick-and-mortar trends have strengthened. This was supported by a successful Lunar New Year campaign with sales up 75% to LLY. Strong momentum in our newer digital flagships in China, Japan and Hong Kong and powerful partnerships like Kakao and Tmall's Luxury Pavilion, where we became the #1 menswear brand this quarter. 
Looking ahead, we are watching Japan carefully due to a new state of emergency imposed in April, which is included in our Q1 guidance. Nevertheless, we are encouraged that the rest of our key markets in Asia have returned to a more normalized growth trajectory. And we still see significant long-term growth opportunities in the region and particularly in China, which now represents about 6% of total company revenues, nearly double the penetration from a year ago. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the year with $2.8 billion in cash and investments and $1.6 billion in total debt, which compares to $2.1 billion in cash and investments and $1.2 billion in total debt last year. Net inventory increased 3% to support future growth compared to depressed levels of down 10% at the end of last year as COVID hit. Looking ahead, our outlook is based on our best assessment of the current macro environment, which includes ongoing COVID-related disruptions to the global supply chain as well as key markets still operating under government restrictions, primarily in Europe and Japan. 
For fiscal '22, we expect constant currency revenues to increase approximately 20% to 25% to last year on a 52-week comparable basis. We expect double-digit growth in each region, led by Europe and North America due to the significant COVID-related closures in the prior year. We estimate the 53rd week will contribute an additional 140 basis points to this year's revenue growth. 
We expect gross margins to contract 40 to 60 basis points as we lap last year's unusual geographic and channel mix benefits due to COVID closures. This implies about 100 basis point expansion to last year's underlying gross margin ex COVID. Gross margin should benefit from product mix, reduced costs following organization reshaping as well as further improvements in pricing. We expect these drivers to be offset by duties, significantly higher freight costs and global supply chain pressures, notably in the first quarter and consistent with the broader industry. Overall, we are watching a highly volatile and inflationary input cost environment into fiscal '22. 
SG&A should grow at a more moderate rate than revenues. Inflation, along with continued investments in marketing, new stores and digital will be mitigated by continued expense discipline and restructuring savings. As a result, we expect operating margins of about 11%, expanding approximately 620 basis points to last year and exceeding our pre-pandemic levels. 
As previously discussed, we deliberately exited or reduced several areas of our business in fiscal '21 to accelerate our brand elevation strategy. These include transitioning Chaps from an owned to a fully licensed model; exiting more than 200 U.S. department store doors, significantly reducing our off-price business; and shrinking our exposure to international daigou sales on our RalphLauren.com site in North America. Combined with the sale of Club Monaco, expected to close in the first quarter, these strategic actions represent a little more than $700 million in revenues compared to fiscal '20. This implies expected fiscal '22 revenues that are roughly flat to pre-pandemic levels on an underlying basis. 
For the first quarter, which still includes the operational results of Club Monaco, we expect revenues to increase approximately 140% to 150% in constant currency. We expect gross margins to decline approximately 575 basis points as we lap last year's onetime COVID mix benefits due to store closures and from higher freight headwinds in the quarter. 
We expect operating margin of 7% to 7.5%, with gross margin contraction more than offset by significant operating expense leverage. We expect to end fiscal '22 with inventories up 12%, with higher growth in the first half of the year as we continue to build back into demand. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $250 million to $275 million, in line with our pre-pandemic targets as we continue to focus on building out our key city ecosystems and digital infrastructure. 
In closing, in the midst of an unprecedented year, our team showed tremendous dedication and agility as we fundamentally strengthened our business. Led by Ralph's enduring vision, we are leveraging the timelessness and authenticity of our core brands while taking on learnings to evolve with the changing needs of the consumer across our products, platforms and new ways of working. And while we are still navigating a highly dynamic environment, we are confident we have the right foundation to drive sustainable growth over the coming year and beyond. With that, let's open up the call for your questions."

So listen, we're not only well positioned to benefit from a new fashion cycle as we emerge from COVID and as consumers return to the category into the stores, but we've also really strengthened the foundations of our bus",859,"Omar, thank you for your question. So listen, we're not only well positioned to benefit from a new fashion cycle as we emerge from COVID and as consumers return to the category into the stores, but we've also really strengthened the foundations of our business and laid the groundwork over the past year for a sustainable multiyear growth trajectory off a healthier base. So to your point, yes, of course, the comps will look attractive for the coming 12 months but -- because of the base period. But obviously, our lens has been beyond that, looking to the next 3 to 5 years for the company. So as part of the work, we've, of course, accelerated digital, you saw that in the numbers we just announced, and established the infrastructure for connected retail around the world, and that's going to have benefits on a long-term basis. But as I step back, I think there are really 3 key differentiators that I would highlight to underlying how we see our competitive advantage and our long-term growth potential. The first one is the strength of our brand. And over the past year, we've actually seen our purchase intent increase across all of our key markets, which we track now on a monthly basis. And as you saw with our AUR numbers, we continue to progress on our elevation journey, up 30% this quarter, up 26% this fiscal year, 16 quarters in a row of AUR growth, a reflection of our brand elevation journey. 
The other point I would highlight is that we're seeing that our brand aesthetic that's anchored in luxury classics, right, so elevated flows that you can live in, is resonating with consumers who are looking for a different kind of luxury coming out of the pandemic. One important data point for us in this brand strength area is our ability to recruit new consumers. Over the past year, we've brought in more than 4 million new consumers into our franchise. And these new consumers are generally younger, higher basket size and higher profitability. And it's really only the beginning. I think we now have a consumer recruiting machine that's working very well across all of our key markets. So first area is really the strength of our brand, Omar. 
Second area is the breadth of our lifestyle portfolio. And I think this enables us to flex across categories, to flex across different consumer interest and desires whether that's athleisure, lounge wear or more sophisticated casual, and also expand into high-potential underdeveloped categories like home or like outerwear. 
Third area is our resources and particularly our cash position. As you know, and we've prided ourselves to that, we manage our balance sheet conservatively. And I think the past years indicated that, that was probably a good choice. And we are in a position now where, one, we can restart dividends, as you heard Jane mention earlier. And two, we have the fuel to invest in critical growth areas like digital, like marketing and like store openings. So we feel very good about where we are in terms of our ability to fund the investment opportunities for growth, to your point. 
I think it's fair to say that our brand remains bigger than our business. And as we look at our opportunities around the world, both in the category, consumer segment and geographical standpoint, we have many vectors of growth. Even more focused now on the Ralph Lauren namesake brands post the moves that we have made on Chaps and recently announced on Club. So listen, on top of these 3 differentiators, which I think are evergreen and real points of difference for us: we have the benefit of an incredibly talented global organization that's really proven its resilience and agility and skill during this crisis; we have a diversified and flexible supply chain; and I think a portfolio that's now well defined and tight so we can really focus on those key value drivers. 
So while we're not completely done with COVID, as you look at what's happening in Japan, what's happening in parts of Europe and other parts of Asia, I am incredibly encouraged by our positioning and by the foundations that we've laid for the short, the mid and the long term as we pivot back to offense, not only this coming year but for the years to come. 
To your question on quality of sales and general growth, listen, we're in growth mode, right? We're in growth and value-creation mode. We have a number of engines for growth. We will continue our brand elevation journey, which I think will be evergreen for this company. So our expectation is to continue to drive AUR. Obviously, at a more modest pace than this past year, but continue to drive AUR. Our expectation is to continue to recruit new consumers, and we also expect to start to grow units, right? And that's really the factors of growth moving forward. So yes, Ralph Lauren is a growth company, value-creation company. Obviously, we will do it profitably as we've been doing. But we're excited about what's possible for us moving forward."

A lot of the initiatives that you mentioned that you were trying to clean up over the last year focused in that market. So how are you feeling about the North America business now and your ability to grow sustainably in the core market? And maybe you could help us by touching on a few of the key elements driving the plan. And then my second question is on SG&A as we look at the guidance for fiscal '22. I'm trying to -- you've done a lot of work on that line, Jane. And I'm trying to think if the revenues come in, in an upside scenario, where does SG&A go if revenues beat your plan? We're trying to think about how the fixed versus floating in SG&A relative to what we knew about this business pre-COVID. What's the flow-through on upside to revenues if you could?"

Jane and I will tag team on your questions. Listen, big picture, I have the most confidence now in our ability to win in North America since starting with the company close to 4 years ago. That's really the way I feel right now, look",682,"sounds good, Michael. Jane and I will tag team on your questions. Listen, big picture, I have the most confidence now in our ability to win in North America since starting with the company close to 4 years ago. That's really the way I feel right now, looking at where we are, what we've done and the key drivers of growth and value creation for that region. We have significant growth opportunities across the entire region. We are underdeveloped in many key cities across the U.S., particularly in the West and in the South. And we have significant opportunity to expand our direct-to-consumer connected retail footprint. So of course, there's going to be the easy compares versus -- in fiscal year '22 versus this past fiscal year. But all of the long-term drivers that I talked about in response to Omar's question apply here as well in our home market, of course. 
As you mentioned, specific to North America, the past 3 or 4 years has been a year of reset. It's been a year of cleanup to get to a healthy base, to be positioned for growth. And so most of that work is complete now. The vast majority of it is complete. The recent interventions on our brand portfolio kind of being the closing elements of it. And we are clearly pivoting to offense across North America, across channels. We see multiple vectors of growth going forward. So if I take them one by one, first of all, our own digital, right, which you saw the numbers this past quarter, 25% in total. Our domestic customers up 50% versus year ago, we haven't delivered these kind of numbers on our own digital, I think, since we've really been tracking it. So we're excited about the progress we're making there. The numbers are starting to reflect the higher and more margin-accretive underlying growth now that the daigou cleanup is mostly done. And this is a reflection of product that's really resonating with the consumer, connected retail capabilities that the consumer is taking advantage of, better functionalities on the site and a much more effective segmentation targeting and personalization. 
Second area is our own retail stores, right, where our business model, our brand elevation and our connected retailing initiatives are working. You're seeing the progress in the past quarter. We're driving back to sustainable positive comps and AUR. We're encouraged to see that the brick-and-mortar trends are beginning to improve. And just one data point about our March comps were up strong double digits to last year and on a 2-year stack. And with only 44 price stores, and you and I have talked to this, right, we still -- we see a significant opportunity to expand our key city strategy. And actually, our North America team is in the field now visiting a number of locations as we speak. We're going to do it very selectively and with a strong focus on connected retail centered around the consumer. 
And then finally, on wholesale, where we've made dramatic changes over the past few years, a couple of data points. Our wholesale presence is down -- in terms of doors, is down 61% over the past 3 to 4 years. Our off-price penetration is down 50% over the past 3 to 4 years. So massive resets that are now complete. And now we are seeing accelerating growth, accelerating penetration of wholesale.com, where we've got very good momentum and wonderful partnerships here in the U.S. And we're starting to grow share in our existing wholesale doors. Past quarter, we grew share in men's, we grew share in kid's, we grew share in home, and we're seeing more recently our women's business start to respond as well. So we have a healthier partner -- we have healthier partnerships, we have a cleaner footprint from both a digital and brick-and-mortar standpoints in wholesale. And so net, I'd say, Michael, I feel very good about where we are. Now obviously, we got to deliver. But I think we're very well positioned now to win in North America."

So obviously, our guidance implies significant SG&A leverage in this year.

So obviously, our guidance implies significant SG&A leverage in this year. And that's really built on -- it's over -- well over 600 basis points and operating margin expansion of 100 basis points to pre-COVID levels. And that's really predicated on what we've done in terms of achieving savings from our organization restructuring, obviously, what we've called out for Club Monaco. And as you think about upside scenarios, I mean, I think we've guided based on our best visibility that we have today in a fairly dynamic environment. But as you think about revenue upside, as vaccination rates might accelerate worldwide, as tourism may come back, strong maintenance of high digital penetrations like we saw in China, those are all upside scenarios. Our strong gross margin is really going to help us with flow-through there. 
In terms of our cost structure, I think about the big buckets of rent and occupancy, corporate costs, depreciation are all highly leverageable in our model. And so the flow-through that we get on incremental sales, either in wholesale, on digital or in our own stores are accretive and nicely accretive. So I think you will see flow-through if there's an upside scenario on sales, as we typically do. But we feel very good about how our cost structure is positioned. We feel good about our ability to invest in our brands. So our guide also implies a continued higher level of marketing at that around 6% range, which is about 100 to 150 basis points higher than pre-COVID levels. We're committed to our brand elevation journey and see that marketing is a key part of that, plus digital investments and new store investments. We'll have about 50 gross new stores in this coming year. The environment is right, we're optimistic about the environment. It's the right time to go back to elevated distribution expansion. So we think we found the balance between delivering profit accretion and investing in our business."

And past quarter, North America, our digital platforms, new consumers up 79% versus a year ago. We look at our ability to continue to drive AUR, right? And you saw the strong performance, I think our strongest quarter of the fiscal year actually with AUR up 30%. And as we look at -- as we track also brand health, so purchase intent, key metrics of brand health, we continue to see progress. So those all give us confidence that the work we're doing is resonating. Our product is resonating. Our communication is resonating. Our elevation and distribution is resonating. 
And then to the specific share points, I mean you have access to this data as well. We are seeing our share progress on -- quite strong on men's; renewed momentum on kids, which is a business that we've worked hard to energize; and strong performance on home, which, as you know, is a new focus for us, and we think there's significant potential there. And then indeed, more recently, as the consumer behavior on women's ready-to-wear pivots back to more elevated products, pivot back to more fashion, more color, right, we're seeing women buy more into printed dresses. We're seeing them buy more into blazers. We're seeing them buy more into novelty sweaters. We're very well positioned in these categories. So we -- this is translating into accelerating performance for us. It's early days, Matt. I hope to be able to report a lot more once things are fully reopened in about -- at the end of this quarter, but we're feeling good about the momentum that we're building."

That's primarily driven by -- that we'll have Club Monaco in our results for Q1. And we'll have some residual Chaps business before the license shift in our business through Q1 and Q2. So you'll see a little bit of outsized based on those 2 factors. The other -- the daigou repositioning and wholesale door closures and off-price pullbacks, those were relatively ratable through the year. But I think those 2 factors are what will distort 1H and 2H. 
And then on the $180 million of cost savings, about $140 million is -- those savings are recorded in SG&A because of our supply chain and product development organization streamlining, about $40 million of that will be -- is embedded in COGS and will flow through in COGS. And in terms of the year, it's also fairly ratable through the year. And we were encouraged in Q4 that we got an early start on that savings. 
The investment focuses that you point out are what I mentioned in terms of marketing versus pre-COVID levels, about 150 basis points increase in marketing. And then the store investments and digital investments, as you'll see us invest, as Patrice mentioned, in more localized sites and some digital investments in content, digitizing our supply chain, all of those are contemplated in our guidance."

So in terms of our operating margin guidance on a longer-term basis, what we see is that our mid-teens operating margin guidance over the next several years is still the right goal for us. Obviously, COVID put a question mark in terms of timing to achieve. But I think as we come out of this year, we're back on about 100 basis points of margin expansion from pre-COVID levels. Obviously, we're expanding margins over 600 basis points to last year. That feels like a good trajectory and a balance of growth, delivering operating margin profitability and investing in our business to make sure that it's long-term value-creating growth. 
And then in terms of what we're seeing on what we have to see this year, obviously, we've signaled a return to growth. Our -- we've signaled underlying gross margin expansion on the back of AUR growth that's more in line with our long-term guidance of low to mid-single digits. We have to maintain our operating expense discipline while still investing in our business and making sure that those businesses yield the high ROIs that we've seen through this COVID period. We've got great results on ROI from personalization and targeting and marketing investments that really lean on our brands' authenticity and heritage and value. So overall, I think we are feeling confident about our plan. Obviously, we're watching the trajectory of COVID carefully. We had -- it does imply a continued recovery rate in traffic. It does imply that the closures that we see in Europe will be completed in June. So that's a variable, and we're watching disruptions in the supply chain fairly carefully. 
In terms of fall orders, what we're seeing in Europe is that Europe is up. You saw strong wholesale performance in Europe that frankly exceeded our expectations, given European closures. Europe is up on a versus last year, of course, but also on a LLY basis. And in the U.S., we're seeing strong improvement outperforming the broader wholesale trends. And our sell-in is much better aligned now to sell out. You saw over the past year, we've been carefully managing inventories. We're now better aligned with positive sell-out in the fourth quarter and go forward. We're seeing the order book better aligned to our sellout trends, which we're encouraged by."

As we close out this fiscal year, Ralph and I are proud and inspired by the way our teams have navigated through the pandemic. They have demonstrated their resilience, agility and ongoing passion for our brand and our consumers in a year unlike any other. Their commitment and execution shines true in our better-than-expected fourth quarter results.
Against the volatile backdrop of the past year, we took action that has enabled us to emerge from this period a fundamentally stronger company than when we came into it. This includes: first, across all 3 regions, we accelerated our work to elevate our brands while also strengthening and simplifying our brand portfolio. We're also engaging more meaningfully with consumers and driving increased marketing to deliver higher brand awareness and purchase intent, coupled with higher AURs.
Second, we repositioned each of our channels and reduced our exposure to secularly challenged areas of distribution, particularly in North America. Within wholesale, we focused our brick-and-mortar presence on our healthier stores and significantly reduced our off-price penetration. Within direct-to-consumer, we accelerated our shift to digital, step-changing profitability by over 1,000 basis points, as we added new connected retail capabilities and drove quality of sales.
Third, we established a stronger visual infrastructure globally while also ramping up our investments in consumer analytics, personalization and high-value new customer acquisition. Fourth, within our supply chain, we further diversified across geographies and meaningfully shortened lead times, with approximately 2/3 of our products now on lead times of 6 months or less, two years ahead of our goal to reach 50% and compared to just 20% 5 years ago.
And lastly, we created a leaner, more agile cost structure. This operating discipline is enabling us to accelerate growth investments across areas like marketing, digital and our key city ecosystems, with further expansion in select underpenetrated markets this year. Overall, these actions position our business for healthier, more sustainable growth as we emerge from COVID.
And beyond the foundational work we delivered this year, we strongly believe our brand is uniquely positioned to capture share, both during this transitional post-pandemic period and longer term. Ralph has created a lifestyle brand that is inclusive and marked by a spirit of togetherness, optimism and love. And we believe this is the kind of luxury that people are creating in this moment. The breadth of our lifestyle portfolio means we have the ability to continue meeting consumers' desires for comfort and timeless core items while also delivering on their increasing appetite to reintegrate elevated, dressier styles back into their wardrobes. Over the coming quarters, you will see us progressively evolve our assortments accordingly.
Before I speak to our growth drivers, I want to share a few of the highlights from our 5 strategic pillars this quarter and year. First, on our efforts to win over a new generation. Some of our key campaigns this year included: our Ralph Lauren Bitmoji Collection on Snapchat, with over 1 billion try-ons to date; our first-of-its-kind virtual store experience, which now includes 5 of our iconic flagships globally; our Spring '21 collection, featuring a live performance from Janelle Monáe, with over 36 million video views and more than 8 billion total impressions; our limited edition Polo collaboration with Edison Chen's CLOT brand, ahead of the Lunar New Year, which sold out in less than 2 minutes on our WeChat Mini program in China and with over 6 billion total impressions; and our debut sponsorship of the Australian Open, which resonated particularly well across Asia; and more still to come with our summer sports program, including the Tokyo Olympics starting in just over 2 months.
In all, we added approximately 4 million new consumers to our direct-to-consumer platforms alone this past fiscal year. And our total social media followers exceeded 45 million, led by Instagram, TikTok, Kakao and Snapchat.
This takes me to our priority of meeting with digital. Fiscal '21 was a transformational year in digitizing our consumer platforms and experiences as well as how we work as a company. And we were proud to deliver significant acceleration in digital performance across each of our regions, with total digital ecosystem growth of more than 60% this quarter. We accelerated the rollout of connected retail programs to enable our consumers to interact with our brands in new and more personal ways. Among the many new capabilities we added this year, highlights included: digital catalogs; buy online, pick up in store and curbside pickup; mobile checkout; contactless payments; and Klarna payment installments. Connected retail options now represent a high single-digit percentage of our retail revenues in North America and a high-teens percentage in Europe, up from low single digits in both regions prior to COVID. We also continued to roll out digital flagships in Japan and Hong Kong while adding new partnerships with influential digital partners around the world like FARFETCH.
In the fourth quarter, we also rolled out digital ID tagging to 50% of our Polo products and are on track to reach 100% by end of fiscal '22. These not only enable product authentication and support future circularity, but also provide consumers access to detailed product information.
In addition to our consumer-facing enhancements, we made significant strides this year in digitizing how we work as a company. This includes the adoption of virtual showrooms and continuing to expand our 3D digital product creation, touching on our work to operate with discipline to fuel growth. We accelerated key actions this year to realign our cost structure, many of which I outlined at the outset of our call.
The third and final stage of our fiscal '21 strategic realignment plan was our announcement last week to sell Club Monaco, expected to close in Q1. This sale, combined with our previously announced action on shifting Chaps to a licensed model, will enable us to further focus our resources on our core namesake brands.
Club Monaco has been an important part of Ralph Lauren for over 2 decades now. We are proud of the brand's evolution over that time, thanks to the passion and dedication of its talented, experienced and engaged global team. We believe that this is the right step forward for the brand, and we are confident in the brand's strong future under Regent's stewardship. With this step and the actions we have taken as part of our strategic realignment plan, we continue to progress on our brand elevation journey, as we deliver Ralph's vision in today's dynamic environment, creating value for all of our stakeholders in fiscal '22 and beyond.
Importantly, I also want to take a moment to highlight our ongoing work to integrate citizenship and sustainability into everything we do. Navigating a highly dynamic global retail environment in the midst of COVID-19, our first priority was to ensure the safety and well-being of our employees, partners and communities. This year, we donated: hundreds of thousands of PPE to frontline workers; 3 million products to frontline workers and families in need, doubling our initial commitment; and $10 million in COVID-19 relief from the Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation to support our employees, communities and charitable partners.
We were also proud to be named once again one of Forbes 2021 America's Best Employers for Diversity, capping off an important and defining year of employee engagement roundtables and learning opportunities for our organization.
Within sustainability, we launched our circularity strategy as well as Color On Demand, a revolutionary platform aimed at delivering the world's first scalable zero wastewater cotton dyeing system. We are open-sourcing the first phase of the platform to the fashion industry. Our hope is that we will see broad industry adoption so that together, we can make progress in addressing one of our sector's biggest area of impact. We look forward to sharing our comprehensive progress on our citizenship and sustainability journey in our 2021 Design the Change report this June.
Looking to fiscal year '22, though still volatile, given ongoing COVID closures and global supply chain disruptions, we are optimistic on a more favorable operating environment ahead. Consistent with the 5 pillars of our Next Great Chapter plan, we expect top line growth over the next year to be driven by a combination of: continuing to scale digital, which now represents more than 25% of our total sales; expanding our key city ecosystems, led by fast-growing markets like China, in addition to our underpenetrated areas in North America and Europe; accelerating marketing investments, including new consumer acquisition, targeting and personalization; and continuing on our brand elevation journey more broadly across our distribution and product assortments, driving further AUR growth, coupled with unit growth.
Furthermore, we have confidence in a new post-pandemic fashion cycle based on the strong full-price performance of our Spring '21 collections. Our consumers are starting to gravitate back to newness, color and the styles we are best known for, such as our iconic mesh polos, blazers and denim. This trend comes on top of the continued momentum we are seeing in fleece, tees, novelty sweaters and other casual styles that have resonated over the past year. With our brand's unique ability to assort compelling products across sportswear, loungewear and dressier styles, we will meet consumers' growing demand across these categories in the coming season.
In closing, Ralph and I want to reiterate how proud we are of the dedication, resilience and agility our teams have demonstrated as we worked through a challenging year on many levels. We enter fiscal year '22 stronger than we came into the crisis, with a stronger go-to-market model, a more streamlined cost structure, more resilient supply chain and an iconic brand well positioned to capitalize on the relaxed but sophisticated style consumers are craving. As we look ahead, we have significant opportunity and a world-class team focused on becoming an even more elevated, more direct-to-consumer, more digital, more global and more diverse, equitable and sustainable company.
And before I pass it to Jane, a couple of updates regarding our Board. Hubert Joly will step into the role of Lead Independent Director previously held by Frank Bennack, while Frank will continue to serve on our Board. In addition, Ralph and I would like to extend our thanks to Joel Fleishman, who plans to retire from our Board of Directors this July, for his leadership, significant contributions to the company and unflagging support and kindness.
With that, I'll turn it over to Jane to discuss our financial results. And I'll join her at the end to answer your questions."

With the extraordinary efforts of our teams around the world, we closed out the year significantly stronger than we came into it in terms of both our financial performance as well as our key strategic initiatives. Our fourth quarter and full year results reflected: increased agility across our organization as macro conditions and consumer behaviors evolved, a significant leap forward on our elevation journey as we repositioned our distribution and accelerated our pricing gains; our digital transformation, from how we serve our consumers to the way we work and driving digital margin accretion; and a better-aligned operational and expense structure overall.
This year, we delivered the highest gross margin in the company's history. Even excluding the onetime mix benefits of COVID, our underlying gross margin for fiscal '21 was about 64.2%. We also strengthened our balance sheet through this year of uncertainty and are pleased to announce the reinstatement of our dividend in the first quarter of fiscal '22. And as Patrice mentioned, we announced the final stage of our strategic realignment plan with the sale of Club Monaco, contributing about 40 to 50 basis points to operating margins this year. These actions set the right foundation and strategic focus for our teams as we enter fiscal '22.
Moving on to our fourth quarter performance. Our business returned to growth in the fourth quarter. Total revenues increased 1% compared to an 18% decline in the third quarter. All regions improved sequentially, with positive growth in Asia and Europe on a reported basis despite continued COVID-related disruptions. North America also returned to positive comps this quarter driven by significant digital acceleration. Global wholesale revenues increased 1%, and direct-to-consumer revenues were up 4%.
Total digital ecosystem sales accelerated to more than 60%, with double-digit growth in every region, up from mid-single digits in the first 9 months of the year. And we delivered digital margins that were accretive within every region and to our total company rate, expanding more than 1,000 basis points in the fourth quarter and full year. We achieved this outstanding result through a combination of higher quality of sales and operating expense leverage. This was an important step as we work toward our mid-teens company operating margin target and continue to drive digital expansion in the years to come.
Total company adjusted gross margin was 62.9% in the fourth quarter, up 380 basis points to last year. Gross margin expansion was primarily driven by strong AUR growth, along with favorable geographic and channel mix shifts. Product costs were also lower as we lapped last year's tariff impacts in North America, partially offset by higher freight costs this year. Around 80 basis points of fourth quarter and 150 basis points of full year gross margin expansion were driven by unusual mix shifts due to COVID.
Fourth quarter AUR growth of 30% represented our 16th consecutive quarter of AUR gains as we continue on our brand elevation journey. Underlying AUR growth of about 20% was driven by a combination of reduced promotional activity, improved full-price selling on our new spring collections and strategic price increases. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our long-term target of low to mid-single-digit AUR growth, supported by the same multipronged strategy of product elevation, acquisition of new full-price consumers and favorable channel and geographic mix while also ramping up our targeting and personalization efforts.
Operating expenses declined 4% to last year, driven by reductions in compensation, rent and other expenses as we started to realize the early benefits of our fiscal '21 restructuring. Adjusted operating margins for the fourth quarter was 3.4%, up 680 basis points to last year.
Marketing in the fourth quarter accelerated to 44% growth as we reactivated in-person activities, continued to drive high-impact digital campaigns and personalization and shifted certain investments from the first 3 quarters of the year due to COVID lockdowns. For the full year, marketing increased to 6% of sales, up from 4.5% the prior year. With sales growth expected to accelerate in fiscal '22, we expect marketing to remain at an elevated level to support our long-term brand building, digital activations and key events like the Olympics, US Open and Wimbledon.
Moving on to segment performance, starting with North America. Fourth quarter revenue decreased 10% to last year but continued to improve on a sequential basis, including an earlier-than-expected return to positive retail comps, up 3%. Comps in our owned digital commerce business were up 25% this quarter, accelerating from 9% in Q3. Underlying sales to domestic consumers accelerated to over 50% up from high teens in Q3, while the sales to international daigou consumers declined double digits to last year as planned. We reduced our site-wide promotions by 50 days compared to the prior year as we continue to elevate our digital experience, driving AUR up more than 40% and gross margins up more than 700 basis points to last year in the channel.
At the same time, we continue to invest in new consumer acquisition, up 78% in the fourth quarter and 45% for the full year. These new consumers are transacting at higher gross margin rates and larger basket sizes and represent a higher penetration of consumers under 35.
Stronger sales of new Spring '21 product offering, along with continued investments in connected retailing, helped deliver a significant increase in our full-price sales this quarter, which grew more than 150% the last year. Brick-and-mortar comps improved sequentially to down 2% in the quarter, with meaningful improvements in AUR, basket size and conversion. Traffic was down 23%, but inflected to positive growth in the last 3 weeks of March as we started to lap COVID shutdowns, while foreign tourist sales were down about 75%.
In North America wholesale, fourth quarter revenue declined 22% as we continued to manage our sell-in carefully through the spring season. However, we were encouraged by positive sellout performance along with double-digit AUR increases to both last year and LLY. Our inventories in the marketplace were clean and well positioned at year-end, declining nearly 30% at North America wholesale, and we expect a meaningful turnaround in our sell-in trends as we enter Q1. Our sales to off-price were down double digits as planned, reducing our penetration to the channel by about 450 basis points for the full year.
Overall, we completed our distribution reset plans in North America this year across digital, department stores and off-price, enabling us to enter fiscal '22 with a healthier, more elevated brand positioning. We ended fiscal '21 with North America brick-and-mortar full-price wholesale penetration at about 10% of total company revenues, down from mid-teens last year, as we continue to accelerate our Wholesale Dot Com, direct-to-consumer and international expansion. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the positive momentum in our direct-to-consumer comps, including digital acceleration and quality wholesale improvement.
Moving on to Europe. Fourth quarter revenue increased 5% on a reported basis and was down 4% in constant currency. Europe retail comps were down 45%, with 65% decline in brick-and-mortar stores, partially offset by continued acceleration in our owned digital commerce, up 79%. 
More than half our stores were fully closed in the quarter, similar to last spring. Nevertheless, we were able to drive significantly better performance compared to our Q1 lockdown as strong momentum across digital helped to offset brick-and-mortar headwinds. About 80% of our stores in the region are now fully open versus a little over 50% at the end of Q4. Strong momentum in our own digital commerce comps was driven by new consumer acquisition and personalization, up 75%.
Europe wholesale revenue increased 29% in constant currency. COVID-related challenges at brick-and-mortar wholesale were more than offset by stronger performance in our wholesale digital accounts. This quarter's wholesale performance significantly exceeded our expectations despite ongoing COVID headwinds, underscoring both the strength of our partnerships as well as our successful pivot to digital in the market. And while COVID restrictions continue to pressure many of our key European markets into fiscal '22, we are encouraged that the U.K., our largest market in the region, emerged from lockdowns in mid-April and is showing early signs of pent-up demand. Underlying macro indicators are also encouraging, with an improving pace of vaccination rollout, high levels of consumer savings and consumer purchases shifting back toward our pre-COVID categories this spring.
Turning to Asia. Revenue increased 35% on a reported basis and 28% in constant currency in the fourth quarter. Our Asia retail comps increased 23%, with brick-and-mortar stores up 21% and digital up 59%. All of our key markets reported positive growth, led by the Chinese Mainland, which was up 145% in constant currency and more than 70% to LLY. Korea also accelerated to 50% growth. Japan, our largest market in the region, grew mid-single digits despite COVID restrictions in the first half of the quarter.
We are encouraged that our digital businesses continued to accelerate even as brick-and-mortar trends have strengthened. This was supported by a successful Lunar New Year campaign, with sales up 75% to LLY. Strong momentum in our newer digital flagships in China, Japan and Hong Kong and powerful partnerships like Kakao and Tmall's Luxury Pavilion, where we became the #1 menswear brand this quarter.
Looking ahead, we are watching Japan carefully due to a new state of emergency imposed in April, which is included in our Q1 guidance. Nevertheless, we are encouraged that the rest of our key markets in Asia have returned to a more normalized growth trajectory. And we still see significant long-term growth opportunities in the region, and particularly in China, which now represents about 6% of total company revenues, nearly double the penetration from a year ago.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the year with $2.8 billion in cash and investments and $1.6 billion in total debt, which compares to $2.1 billion in cash and investments and $1.2 billion in total debt last year. Net inventory increased 3% to support future growth compared to depressed levels of down 10% at the end of last year as COVID hit. Looking ahead, our outlook is based on our best assessment of the current macro environment, which includes ongoing COVID-related disruptions to the global supply chain as well as key markets still operating under government restrictions, primarily in Europe and Japan.
For fiscal '22, we expect constant currency revenues to increase approximately 20% to 25% to last year on a 52-week comparable basis. We expect double-digit growth in each region, led by Europe and North America, due to the significant COVID-related closures in the prior year. We estimate the 53rd week will contribute an additional 140 basis points to this year's revenue growth.
We expect gross margins to contract 40 to 60 basis points as we lap last year's unusual geographic and channel mix benefits due to COVID closures. This implies about 100 basis point expansion to last year's underlying gross margin ex COVID. Gross margin should benefit from product mix, reduced costs following organization reshaping as well as further improvements in pricing. We expect these drivers to be offset by duties, significantly higher freight costs and global supply chain pressures, notably in the first quarter and consistent with the broader industry. Overall, we are watching a highly volatile and inflationary input cost environment into fiscal '22.
SG&A should grow at a more moderate rate than revenues. Inflation, along with continued investments in marketing, new stores and digital will be mitigated by continued expense discipline and restructuring savings. As a result, we expect operating margins of about 11%, expanding approximately 620 basis points to last year and exceeding our prepandemic levels.
As previously discussed, we deliberately exited or reduced several areas of our business in fiscal '21 to accelerate our brand elevation strategy. These include: transitioning Chaps from an owned to a fully licensed model; exiting more than 200 U.S. department store doors; significantly reducing our off-price business; and shrinking our exposure to international daigou sales on our RalphLauren.com site in North America. Combined with the sale of Club Monaco, expected to close in the first quarter, these strategic actions represent a little more than $700 million in revenues compared to fiscal '20. This implies expected fiscal '22 revenues that are roughly flat to prepandemic levels on an underlying basis.
For the first quarter, which still includes the operational results of Club Monaco, we expect revenues to increase approximately 140% to 150% in constant currency. We expect gross margins to decline approximately 575 basis points as we lap last year's onetime COVID mix benefits due to store closures and from higher freight headwinds in the quarter.
We expect operating margin of 7% to 7.5%, with gross margin contraction more than offset by significant operating expense leverage. We expect to end fiscal '22 with inventories up 12%, with higher growth in the first half of the year as we continue to build back into demand. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $250 million to $275 million, in line with our prepandemic targets as we continue to focus on building out our key city ecosystems and digital infrastructure.
In closing, in the midst of an unprecedented year, our team showed tremendous dedication and agility as we fundamentally strengthened our business. Led by Ralph's enduring vision, we are leveraging the timelessness and authenticity of our core brands while taking on learnings to evolve with the changing needs of the consumer across our products, platforms and new ways of working. And while we are still navigating a highly dynamic environment, we are confident we have the right foundation to drive sustainable growth over the coming year and beyond. With that, let's open up the call for your questions."

If we look out beyond the recovery year, which I'm sure you and many others in the space will enjoy accelerating sales, but can you talk about how your brands are positioned to win in the post-pandemic world over the next few years, longer term?
And Patrice, can you include a discussion of how you think about balancing brand health and probability -- profitability versus chasing sales, i.e., how important is it for Ralph Lauren to return to consistent growth again?"
362220,712253925,2294000,"Ralph Lauren Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, May 20, 2021",2021-05-20,"Earnings Calls","Ralph Lauren Corporation","Executives","Thank you for your question. So listen, we're not only well positioned to benefit from a new fashion cycle as we emerge from COVID and as consumers return to the category into the stores, but we've also really strengthened the foundations of our business",858,"Thank you for your question. So listen, we're not only well positioned to benefit from a new fashion cycle as we emerge from COVID and as consumers return to the category into the stores, but we've also really strengthened the foundations of our business and laid the groundwork over the past year for a sustainable multiyear growth trajectory off a healthier base. So to your point, yes, of course, the comps will look attractive for the coming 12 months but -- because of the base period. But obviously, our lens has been beyond that, looking to the next 3 to 5 years for the company. So as part of the work, we've, of course, accelerated digital, you saw that in the numbers we just announced, and established the infrastructure for connected retail around the world, and that's going to have benefits on a long-term basis.
But as I step back, I think there are really 3 key differentiators that I would highlight to underlying how we see our competitive advantage and our long-term growth potential. The first one is the strength of our brand. And over the past year, we've actually seen our purchase intent increase across all of our key markets, which we track now on a monthly basis. And as you saw with our AUR numbers, we continue to progress on our elevation journey, up 30% this quarter, up 26% this fiscal year, 16 quarters in a row of AUR growth, reflection of our brand elevation journey.
The other point I would highlight is that we're seeing that our brand aesthetic that's anchored in luxury classics, right, so elevated clothes that you can live in, is resonating with consumers who are looking for a different kind of luxury coming out of the pandemic. One important data point for us in this brand strength area is our ability to recruit new consumers. Over the past year, we've brought in more than 4 million new consumers into our franchise. And these new consumers are generally younger, higher basket size and higher profitability. And it's really only the beginning. I think we now have a consumer recruiting machine that's working very well across all of our key markets. So first area is really the strength of our brand, Omar.
Second area is the breadth of our lifestyle portfolio. And I think this enables us to flex across categories, to flex across different consumer interest and desires, whether that's athleisure, lounge wear or more sophisticated casual, and also expand into high-potential underdeveloped categories like home or like outerwear.
Third area is our resources, and particularly our cash position. As you know, and we've prided ourselves with that, we manage our balance sheet conservatively. And I think the past year has indicated that, that was probably a good choice. And we are in a position now where: one, we can restart dividends, as you heard Jane mention earlier; and two, we have the fuel to invest in critical growth areas like digital, like marketing and like store openings. So we feel very good about where we are in terms of our ability to fund the investment opportunities for growth, to your point.
I think it's fair to say that our brand remains bigger than our business. And as we look at our opportunities around the world, both in the category, consumer segment and geographical standpoint, we have many vectors of growth, even more focused now on the Ralph Lauren namesake brands post the moves that we have made on Chaps and recently announced on Club.
So listen, on top of these 3 differentiators, which I think are evergreen and real points of difference for us, we have the benefit of an incredibly talented global organization that's really proven its resilience and agility and skill during this crisis. We have a diversified and flexible supply chain and, I think, a portfolio that's now well defined and tight so we can really focus on those key value drivers. So while we're not completely done with COVID, as you look at what's happening in Japan, what's happening in parts of Europe and other parts of Asia, I am incredibly encouraged by our positioning and by the foundations that we've laid for the short, the mid and the long term as we pivot back to offense, not only this coming year but for the years to come.
To your question on quality of sales and general growth, listen, we're in growth mode, right? We're in growth and value-creation mode. We have a number of engines for growth. We will continue our brand elevation journey, which I think will be evergreen for this company. So our expectation is to continue to drive AUR, obviously, at a more modest pace than this past year, but continue to drive AUR. Our expectation is to continue to recruit new consumers, and we also expect to start to grow units, right? And that's really the vectors of growth moving forward. So yes, Ralph Lauren is a growth company, value-creation company. Obviously, we will do it profitably as we've been doing. But we're excited about what's possible for us moving forward."

A lot of the initiatives that you mentioned that you were trying to clean up over the last year focused in that market. So how are you feeling about the North America business now and your ability to grow sustainably in the core market? And maybe you could help us by touching on a few of the key elements driving the plan.
And then my second question is on SG&A as we look at the guidance for fiscal '22. I'm trying to -- you've done a lot of work on that line, Jane. And I'm trying to think, if the revenues come in, in an upside scenario, where does SG&A go if revenues beat your plan? We're trying to think about how the fixed versus floating in SG&A relative to what we knew about this business pre-COVID. What's the flow-through on upside to revenues, if you could?"

Listen, big picture, I have the most confidence now in our ability to win in North America since starting with the company close to 4 years ago. That's really the way I feel right now, looking at where we are, what we've done and the key drivers of growth and value creation for that region.
We have significant growth opportunities across the entire region. We are underdeveloped in many key cities across the U.S., particularly in the West and in the South. And we have significant opportunity to expand our direct-to-consumer connected retail footprint. So of course, there's going to be the easy compares versus -- in fiscal year '22 versus this past fiscal year. But all of the long-term drivers that I talked about in response to Omar's question apply here as well in our home market, of course.
As you mentioned, specific to North America, the past 3 or 4 years has been a year of reset. It's been a year of cleanup to get to a healthy base, to be positioned for growth. And so most of that work is complete now. The vast majority of it is complete, the recent interventions on our brand portfolio kind of being the closing elements of it. And we are clearly pivoting to offense across North America, across channels. We see multiple vectors of growth going forward.
So if I take them one by one, first of all, our owned digital, right, which you saw the numbers this past quarter, 25% in total. Our domestic customers up 50% versus a year ago. We haven't delivered these kind of numbers on our own digital, I think, since we've really been tracking it. So we're excited about the progress we're making there. The numbers are starting to reflect the higher and more margin-accretive underlying growth now that the daigou cleanup is mostly done. And this is a reflection of product that's really resonating with the consumer, connected retail capabilities that the consumer is taking advantage of, better functionalities on the site and a much more effective segmentation targeting and personalization.
Second area is our own retail stores, right, where our business model, our brand elevation and our connected retailing initiatives are working. You're seeing the progress in the past quarter. We're driving back to sustainable positive comps and AUR. We're encouraged to see that the brick-and-mortar trends are beginning to improve. And just one data point about our March comps, we're up strong double digits to last year and on a 2-year stack. And with only 40 full-price stores, and you and I have talked to this, right, we still -- we see a significant opportunity to expand our key city strategy. And actually, our North America team is in the field now, visiting a number of locations as we speak. We're going to do it very selectively and with a strong focus on connected retail, centered around the consumer.
And then finally, on wholesale, where we've made dramatic changes over the past few years, a couple of data points. Our wholesale presence is down -- in terms of doors, is down 61% over the past 3 to 4 years. Our off-price penetration is down 50% over the past 3 to 4 years. So massive resets that are now complete. And now we are seeing accelerating growth, accelerating penetration of Wholesale Dot Com, where we've got very good momentum and wonderful partnerships here in the U.S. And we're starting to grow share in our existing wholesale doors. Past quarter, we grew share in men's, we grew share in kids, we grew share in home, and we're seeing more recently our women's business start to respond as well. So we have a healthier -- we have healthier partnerships, we have a cleaner footprint from both a digital and brick-and-mortar standpoints in wholesale. And so net, I'd say, Michael, I feel very good about where we are. Now obviously, we got to deliver. But I think we're very well positioned now to win in North America."

So obviously, our guidance implies significant SG&A leverage in this year. And that's really built on -- it's over -- well over 600 basis points and operating margin expansion of 100 basis points to pre-COVID l",334,"And just, Michael, on your question on SG&A. So obviously, our guidance implies significant SG&A leverage in this year. And that's really built on -- it's over -- well over 600 basis points and operating margin expansion of 100 basis points to pre-COVID levels. And that's really predicated on what we've done in terms of achieving savings from our organization restructuring, obviously, what we've called out for Club Monaco.
And as you think about upside scenarios, I mean, I think we've guided based on our best visibility that we have today in a fairly dynamic environment. But as you think about revenue upside, as vaccination rates might accelerate worldwide, as tourism may come back, strong maintenance of high digital penetrations like we saw in China, those are all upside scenarios, our strong gross margin is really going to help us with flow-through there.
In terms of our cost structure, I think about the big buckets of rent and occupancy, corporate costs, depreciation are all highly leverageable in our model. And so the flow-through that we get on incremental sales, either in wholesale, on digital or in our owned stores are accretive and nicely accretive. So I think you will see flow-through if there's an upside scenario on sales as we typically do.
But we feel very good about how our cost structure is positioned. We feel good about our ability to invest in our brands. So our guide also implies a continued higher level of marketing at that around 6% range, which is about 100 to 150 basis points higher than pre-COVID levels. We're committed to our brand elevation journey and see that marketing is a key part of that, plus digital investments and new store investments. We'll have about 50 gross new stores in this coming year. The environment is right. We're optimistic about the environment. It's the right time to go back to elevated distribution expansion. So we think we found the balance between delivering profit accretion and investing in our business."

So those all give us confidence that the work we're doing is resonating. Our product is resonating. Our communication is resonating. Our elevation and distribution is resonating.
And then to the specific share points, I mean, you have access to this data as well. We are seeing our share progress on -- quite strong on men's; renewed momentum on kids, which is a business that we've worked hard to energize; and strong performance on home, which, as you know, is a new focus for us, and we think there's significant potential there. And then indeed, more recently, as the consumer behavior on women's ready-to-wear pivots back to more elevated products, pivot back to more fashion, more color, right, we're seeing women buy more into printed dresses. We're seeing them buy more into blazers. We're seeing them buy more into novelty sweaters. We're very well positioned in these categories. So we -- this is translating into accelerating performance for us.
It's early days, Matt. I hope to be able to report a lot more once things are fully reopened in about -- at the end of this quarter, but we're feeling good about the momentum that we're building."

And then second question is, if I go back to those notes from last call, you talked about the cost savings of around $180 million to $200 million and that the majority of that should flow through the bottom line. Just curious to know if that's the right way to think about it still or are you going to lean into investments? And how do we think about that versus 1H and 2H?"

That's primarily driven by -- that we'll have Club Monaco in our results for Q1. And we'll have some residual Chaps business before the license shift in our business through Q1 and Q2. So you'll see a little bit of outsized based on those 2 factors.
The other -- the daigou repositioning and wholesale door closures and off-price pullbacks, those were relatively ratable through the year. But I think those 2 factors are what will distort 1H and 2H.
And then on the $180 million of cost savings, about $140 million is -- you'll -- those savings are recorded in SG&A. Because of our supply chain and product development organization streamlining, about $40 million of that will be -- is embedded in COGS and will flow through in COGS. And in terms of the year, it's also fairly ratable through the year. And we were encouraged in Q4 that we got an early start on that savings.
The investment focuses that you point out are what I mentioned in terms of marketing versus pre-COVID levels, about 150 basis points increase in marketing. And then the store investments and digital investments, as you'll see us invest, as Patrice mentioned, in more localized sites and some digital investments in content, digitizing our supply chain, all of those are contemplated in our guidance."

So in terms of our operating margin guidance on a longer-term basis, what we see is that our mid-teens operating margin guidance over the next several years is still the right goal for us. Obviously, COVID put a question mark in terms of timing to achieve. But I think as we come out of this year, we're back on about 100 basis points of margin expansion from pre-COVID levels. Obviously, we're expanding margins over 600 basis points to last year. That feels like a good trajectory and a balance of growth, delivering operating margin profitability and investing in our business to make sure that it's long-term, value-creating growth.
And then in terms of what we're seeing on what we have to see this year, obviously, we've signaled a return to growth. Our -- we've signaled underlying gross margin expansion on the back of AUR growth that's more in line with our long-term guidance of low to mid-single digits. We have to maintain our operating expense discipline while still investing in our business and making sure that those businesses yield the high ROIs that we've seen through this COVID period. We've got great results on ROI from personalization and targeting and marketing investments that really lean on our brands' authenticity and heritage and value.
So overall, I think we are feeling confident about our plan. Obviously, we're watching the trajectory of COVID carefully. We -- it does imply a continued recovery rate in traffic. It does imply that the closures that we see in Europe will be completed in June, so that's a variable, and we're watching disruptions in the supply chain fairly carefully.
In terms of fall orders, what we're seeing in Europe is that Europe is up. You saw strong wholesale performance in Europe that frankly exceeded our expectations, given European closures. Europe is up on a versus last year, of course, but also on a LLY basis. And in the U.S., we're seeing strong improvement, outperforming the broader wholesale trends. And our sell-in is much better aligned now to sellout. You saw over the past year, we've been carefully managing inventory. We're now better aligned with positive sellout in the fourth quarter and go forward. We're seeing the order book better aligned to our sellout trends, which we're encouraged by."

So wholesale, of course, is off-price, which we've significantly reshaped strategically and taken down materially. And we feel good about that business, that it's now strategically repositioned to be what it should be, which is a vehicle for excess liquidation. We feel really good that we got out ahead of closing some of the 232 doors in North America. We feel like our store footprint is now elevated and appropriate to move forward.
And you're starting to see us gain market share in the channel. And we feel good about the growth that you -- that we're seeing in Wholesale Dot Com and view that as a continued source of growth for us as we move forward. And you saw a significant pickup in Wholesale Dot Com in North America and in Europe in the fourth quarter. So we feel good about the proof point and the trends on the back of some pilot initiatives, dedicated resourcing and dedicated content that we've put there.
So just for sizing, we feel like the North America will be a source of growth for us. It will also be a source of sustainable growth for us, driven by digital, driven by pure plays and driven by market share gains in the distribution footprint, which we now feel very good about."

They have demonstrated their resilience, agility and ongoing passion for our brands and our consumers in a year unlike any other. Their commitment and execution shine through in our better-than-expected fourth quarter results.
Against the volatile backdrop of the past year, we took action that has enabled us to emerge from this period a fundamentally stronger company than when we came into it. This includes: first, across all 3 regions, we accelerated our work to elevate our brands while also strengthening and simplifying our brand portfolio. We're also engaging more meaningfully with consumers and driving increased marketing to deliver higher brand awareness and purchase intent coupled with higher AURs; second, we repositioned each of our channels and reduced our exposure to secularly challenged areas of distribution, particularly in North America.
Within wholesale, we focused our brick-and-mortar presence on our healthier stores and significantly reduced our off-price penetration. Within direct-to-consumer, we accelerated our shift to digital step-changing profitability by over 1,000 basis points as we added new connected retail capabilities and drove quality of sales."

Hey, if there's 1 thing we've learned over the past 18 months, it's agility and the importance of agility. So apologies for the false start. And now we're ready to go into our prepared remarks.
So good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. Our teams delivered exceptional first quarter performance on both our top and bottom line results and across every geography. Our brand is resonating with consumers around the world as we lean into the breadth of our offering to deliver the products they are craving in this new normal. And all of our regions are in a healthier, more profitable growth trajectory.
Even as we continue to execute through COVID-related challenges, it is clear that Ralph Lauren is back on offense. A few highlights to note. First, building on our consistent brand elevation work in direct-to-consumer business. We are now seeing accelerated demand and increased AUR in our wholesale channel. Second, our digital growth is accelerating following our pricing and promotional reset work last year, and our digital margins continue to be accretive across every region. And third, we continue to make strong progress toward our long-term target of mid-teens operating margins. We delivered the highest Q1 company operating margin since fiscal '14, even as we more than doubled our marketing investment and continue to reinvest in key areas of growth like digital, key city ecosystem expansion and our consumer targeting and personalization.
Our performance demonstrates consistent execution against the 5 strategic pillars that we outlined at the start of our Next Great Chapter plan. Let me share a few highlights from the quarter. First, on our efforts to win over a new generation. As we continue to invest in marketing, we are focused on new consumer acquisition and retention and both global and localized campaigns that capture consumers' optimism and desire to come together as we progressively emerge from the challenges of the past year. Some of our key campaigns in the first quarter included our summer of sports, which we kicked off with our Olympics campaign in North America as the official outfitter of Team USA. In June, we amplified our Wimbledon campaign with a diverse group of athletes, celebrities and influencers such as South Korean Superstar and Tottenham Forward, Sun Hung Min; British procurer, Lucy Campbell; and G2 eSports League of Legend Superstar, Wreckless.
In the world of Golf, we celebrated our brand ambassador, Yuka sasso's first major win at the U.S. Women's Open Championship, and we were excited to welcome LPGA professional golfer, Andrea Lee, as the newest face of our women's golf brand. Combined, these summer sports campaigns generated more than 8 billion total impressions globally in the quarter. And there's still more to come in August and September with the 2021 Ryder Cup and the U.S. Open Tennis Championships right here in New York.
We also announced our launch this quarter as the official outfitter of G2 eSports, 1 of the world's premier professional esports organizations. We are proud of this first-of-its-kind partnership in fashion and gaming as we continue to drive new ways of reaching next-generation consumers in key channels where they engage. In all, we added more than 1 million new consumers to our direct-to-consumer channels alone this quarter. And our total social media followers continue to grow, exceeding 46 million globally, led by Instagram.
This takes me to our second key initiative, energize core products and accelerate high potential underdeveloped categories. As markets reopen around the world, consumers are shifting back to many of the key categories that drove our business prior to the pandemic, while we also continue to develop new and high-potential categories.
While casual styles are still resonating, we're also seeing a progressive return to sophisticated casual. Given the breadth of our assortment, -- We have the unique ability to respond to consumer shifting appetite, reintegrating more elevated styles into our assortments as we scale back on stay-at-home categories.
On the men's side, we're seeing a resurgence in polo shirts, sports coats and trousers, denim, footwear and accessories for our core brands. In women's, we're seeing improvements across dresses, elevated sweaters, novelty fleece, jackets and handbags. And we're also driving better performance in bottoms, including new fashion silhouettes like wide leg as well as new fabrications like Silk and Linen. We are rebuilding the penetration of these categories into fall '21 and beyond as consumers make the transition back to the office and social activities. Our spring performance gives us increased confidence that we will have the right assortments to meet consumers' needs moving forward.
Other product highlights from the quarter included our first of several special collections with Major League Baseball. These limited capsules celebrate the heritage of America's favorite past time and evoke Ralph's lifelong love of the sport. Launched in May across all of our channels, including social, digital, our stores and wholesale. The initial capsule generated over 5 billion media impressions, along with significantly higher spend compared to our average total consumer. 
Spring Polo shirt campaign included the launch of our Polo Color shop, fully made to order customized Polos and our updated Earth Polo in expanded colors. And we launched Polo Colonia Intense, an updated fragrance for a new generation and our new stir of eyewear collection as we continue to elevate and innovate across our licensed categories as well.
Moving on to our third key initiative, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels. With most of our key markets now fully reopened, we are back on offense this year. The build-out of our brand elevating key city ecosystems around the world. This ecosystem approach ensures a consistently elevated experience across our digital, social and physical channels, both in our direct-to-consumer and wholesale networks.
As part of this, in the first quarter, we opened 18 new stores and concessions in priority locations globally, mostly in Asia, and closed 11 locations. China continues to be a significant long-term growth opportunity and our ecosystem approach delivered strong growth again this quarter. with Mainland sales up more than 50%.
We are opening 2 new emblematic store experiences this year in Beijing and Shanghai. With a smaller footprint than our existing flagships around the world, this new format offers consumers an elevated immersive brand experience at a significantly lower investment than our traditional flagships.
Our Beijing store opened at the end of April in Sanlitun Mall, one of the top shopping locations in the country. In addition to featuring a Ralph's coffee, Sunlitun integrates innovative, smart retail and digital activations throughout the store in partnership with Tencent. This includes endless aisle technology virtual trials and in-store treasure hunt using QR codes and customization stations, where consumers use our WeChat Mini Program to order customized products from their mobile phones.
Though still early, the store has significantly outperformed our initial expectations, and we're excited to build on our presence in China with the opening of our emblematic Shanghai location in just a few weeks. Both stores will emerge consumers in the world of Ralph Lauren and will help further develop our ecosystems in these key markets, which already include our smaller format Polo boutiques, in fashions and digital presence across our own site and key partners such as Tmall.
And as foreign tourism continues to be a headwind compared to fiscal '20 levels, we have shifted more of our marketing, clienteling and merchandising to capture local shoppers and regional tourists along with driving digital commerce.
This takes me to our priority of leading with digital. Our global digital ecosystem, including our directly operated sites, departmentstore.com, pure players and social commerce, accelerated to more than 80% growth in the first quarter in constant currency, up from about 60% in Q4.
While traffic is returning -- is starting to return to physical stores, the strength in digital is exceeding our expectations, driving a benefit to our overall operating margin mix. North America drove the biggest improvement this quarter, increasing more than 50% across both owned and wholesale digital channels. Meanwhile, Europe and Asia momentum continued with growth of more than 100% in each region in Q1, led by our wholesale digital and pure-play channels.
Our investments in digital continue to focus on content creation for all of our platforms, enhanced digital capabilities to improve the user experience and continuing to leverage AI and data to serve our consumers even more effectively. Touching on our work to operate with discipline to fuel growth. We continue to drive expense discipline in the first quarter in order to fund our long-term strategic investments in global expansion, digital and brand building, while also working toward our target of mid-teens operating margins. We also successfully completed the sale of Club Monaco at the end of the first quarter as planed. And as previously announced, Chaps will transition from our North America wholesale business to a license model in Q2. These actions will enable us to further focus our resources on our core namesake brands and elevated positioning in the marketplace.
I also want to take a moment to highlight our ongoing work to integrate citizenship and sustainability into everything we do. In June, we published our annual Design the Change report, outlining our updated commitments and actions to drive our impact and champion the lives touched by our business. While I encourage all of you to download the full report from our corporate website, I'll highlight a few important additions this year.
We committed to comprising our global leadership team of at least 20% underrepresented race and ethnic groups by 2023. As part of our comprehensive circularity strategy, we set a target to use 100% recycled cotton in our products by 2025 and to launch additional resale and recycle opportunities for our consumers by 2022. We also announced a goal to achieve net 0 greenhouse gas emissions across our operations and supply chain by 2040, as we continue to work on reducing our carbon footprint throughout our value chain. And beginning this fiscal year, we will incorporate key ESG metrics into our executive compensation plans.
In closing, Ralph and I are very encouraged by the strong start to the fiscal year. Our teams are executing with passion and continue to embrace the agility they demonstrated throughout the challenging and unpredictable last 18 months. While we will continue to monitor key macro challenges closely for the balance of the year, notably around inflation, supply chain disruptions, COVID resurgences and the pace of traffic recovery. The actions we took to strengthen the foundations of our brand and our business last year are enabling us to deliver results even earlier than we expected.
Looking beyond this period of unusual COVID compares, we are increasingly confident in our ability to drive sustainable growth. More than ever, led by Ralph's iconic vision, our teams are intensely focused on executing on our strategic plan, to continue to protect and elevate our brand while realizing the significant growth opportunities that exist for our business in every market. With their passion, talent and careful execution, Ralph and I are confident in our ability to deliver attractive long-term growth and value creation for all of our stakeholders.
With that, I'll turn it over to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions."

Our first quarter performance exceeded our expectations as our teams navigated challenges with agility, our brands connected with consumers, and our strategy drove high-quality growth.

And we continue to drive expense discipline across our business while investing in high ROI initiatives to drive operating margins significantly above our expectations.
First quarter revenues increased 182% to last year on a reported basis and 176% in constant currency. Growth was positive in every region, led by North America. Compared to first quarter fiscal '20 or revenues declined 4%. However, this includes approximately 7 points of negative impact from last year's strategic reset to our distribution and to our Chaps business, which transitions to a license model this month.
Total digital ecosystem sales accelerated to more than 80% growth in constant currency, both to last year and LLY, including 50% growth in our own digital business. Our performance improved sequentially in every region, reflecting our strong assortments, expanded connected retail capabilities and high-impact marketing. North America delivered the strongest sequential improvement with digital ecosystem sales increasing more than 50%, up from low double digits last year. Digital margins also continue to strengthen and we're strongly accretive to every region's profitability.
Total company adjusted gross margin was 69.8% in the first quarter, down 200 basis points to last year on a reported basis and down 260 basis points in constant currency. This was significantly better than expected as we lapped last year's unusual COVID mix benefits driven by better pricing and promotion, along with favorable product mix and the benefit of supply chain organization streamlining. Adjusted gross margins increased 30 basis points to LLY.
First quarter AUR growth grew 17%, marking our 17th consecutive quarter of AUR gains as we continue on our brand elevation journey. This came on top of 25% growth last year, while stores were closed.
Adjusted operating expenses increased 39% driven by higher compensation and rent as we lapped last year's furloughs and store closures during COVID shutdowns. Adjusted expenses declined 2% compared to LLY.
We more than doubled our first quarter marketing investments over the last year's substantially reduced levels at the start of the pandemic. Compared to first quarter fiscal '20, marketing increased 39% as we focus on digital initiatives and reactivating key brand moments as markets reopened around the world. We expect to maintain an elevated level of marketing this year at around 6% of sales to support consumer engagement, acquisition and our long-term brand-building initiatives.
Adjusted operating margin for the first quarter was 16.8% compared to a margin loss of negative 35.7% last year and 460 basis points ahead of LLY operating margin. This was well above our guidance of 7% to 7.5% due to stronger-than-expected replenishment in our wholesale and digital channels, which generate highly accretive margins versus our total company rate.
Moving on to segment performance, starting with North America. First quarter revenue increased 300% to last year, driven by strong spring assortments, improving consumer sentiment and expanded store reopenings as we lapped the peak of store lockdowns last spring. Compared to LLY, North America revenues declined 8%, but included an 18% headwind from our strategic distribution resets and Chaps.
In North America Retail, revenues grew 189% to last year. Comps increased 176% on improved traffic and nearly 40% AUR growth, reflecting our continued elevation around product marketing and more targeted pricing and promotions. Brick-and-mortar comps increased 278% driven by stronger AUR, basket sizes and traffic as most stores reopened. Although foreign tourist sales improved significantly to last year, they were still nearly 70% below LLY due to continued softness in international traffic and travel.
Comps in our own digital commerce business grew 51% this quarter, accelerating from 25% in Q4 as we continue to focus on new consumer acquisition product elevation and enhancing the user experience. While we expect continued momentum in this channel, we note the prior year compares build sequentially after Q1.
In North America Wholesale, revenues increased to $250 million compared to $23 million last year as we carefully restocked into the channel and lapped last year's minimal shipment to customers during the shutdown. Sales meaningfully outperformed our expectations, driving the biggest upside to our guidance this quarter.
The foundational work we completed through COVID to reset and elevate our inventories, exit lower-tier wholesale doors and significantly reduce our off-price penetration is starting to deliver strong early results across every key metric. In North America wholesale, full-price sellout is exceeding our sell-in. Total sellout was up high teens to LLY in Q1, led by market share gains in men's, kids, home and women's footwear. And we are also encouraged by early sequential improvements in women's ready-to-wear.
Wholesale AUR growth continues to accelerate, up more than 20% to LLY. This represents our strongest wholesale pricing gains in the last 6 years. And our focus on wholesale.com is working with digital sell-out up more than 50% in Q1 and more than 75% to LLY. Coming out of the pandemic, our wholesale partnerships are stronger healthier and more collaborative with a focus on marketing, improved digital capabilities and the right product assortment and an appropriate level of inventories as we build back into demand, and we see more to come as we are still in the early stages of driving our brand elevation strategy in this channel.
Moving on to Europe. First quarter revenue increased 194% on a reported basis and 179% in constant currency, above our expectations. First quarter comps increased at 98% with a 154% increase in brick-and-mortar as stores reopened and a 23% increase in digital commerce.
The strong early pent-up demand that started in the U.K. this April was followed by better-than-expected reopening trends across France, Germany and Italy despite extended lockdowns in the quarter. Approximately 20% of our stores were fully closed in Q1 with additional stores operating under partial closures or other restrictions. All of our major markets reopened by the end of June.
Digital commerce outperformed despite a challenging 44% comparison last year when COVID-related closures shifted more business online. While our digital comps partially benefited from extended lockdowns across Europe this quarter, the results also reflected stronger spring assortments, growth in connected retail and our targeted marketing efforts. Europe wholesale exceeded our expectations again this quarter, driven by stronger sellout and reorders in both digital wholesale as well as traditional wholesale accounts.
Turning to Asia. Revenues increased 68% on a reported basis and 61% in constant currency. Our Asia retail comps increased 43% driven by similar performance across our brick-and-mortar stores and digital commerce. Our digital ecosystem continued to accelerate in Asia. In Q1, this was supported by our successful 5 20 gifting campaign, 6 18 shopping event live streamed from our newly-opened Stanley Tune store, and momentum in our newest digital flagships in China, Japan and Hong Kong.
Japan, our largest market in Asia was negatively impacted by an extended state of emergency for the majority of the quarter. These restrictions drove a roughly 6-point headwind to the region's overall growth in Q1. Despite this, our teams were able to successfully mitigate these headwinds with stronger performance across the rest of the region.
This was led by the Chinese Mainland, which was up more than 50% to last year and 70% to LLY in constant currency, driven by a strong product assortment localized marketing initiatives and new store openings.
Korea was also up more than 30% to last year and 40% to LLY. Japan returned to normal operations in late June and started to ramp up vaccinations. However, the government declared another state of emergency in July ahead of the Olympic Games, and we expect a slower recovery in Japan this year.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the year with $3 billion in cash and investments and $1.6 billion in total debt, which compares to $2.7 billion in cash and investments and $1.9 billion in total debt last year. We are confident in our ability to meet our debt leverage requirements, ratio requirements in Q2 and eliminate capital allocation restrictions in our bank waiver.
Net inventory increased 4% to support increasing demand. This compared to a 22% decline last year when we limited shipments to brick-and-mortar channels at the height of COVID shutdowns last spring. Supply chain challenges are increasing. The variability of inventory flows quarter-to-quarter.
Looking ahead, our outlook is based on our best assessment of the current macro environment, which includes ongoing COVID-related disruptions, the global supply chain challenge and the global supply chain challenges. We expect the quarter cadence this year to be volatile given dynamic conditions across our markets. This includes potentially uneven pace of recovery by region and channel as well as the timing of investments as markets reopen.
For fiscal '22, we now expect constant currency revenues to increase approximately 25% to 30% to last year on a 53-week basis. Excluding approximately $700 million in annualized revenues, we deliberately reduced during the pandemic, including department store exits, off-price and dig reductions, Chaps and Club Monaco, this implies revenues up slightly to fiscal '20. Foreign currency is expected to contribute about 30 basis points to full year revenue growth.
We now expect gross margin to expand 50 to 70 basis points even as we lap meaningful geographic and channel mix benefits due to last year's COVID closures. This implies roughly 440 basis point increase to fiscal '20. Our outlook includes slightly higher freight headwinds of approximately 100 to 120 basis points versus our previous expectation of about 100 basis points. However, this is more than offset by our expectation of stronger AUR growth of mid- to high single digits above our long-term guidance of low to mid-single digits annually as we continue our long-term elevation work. We now expect operating margin of 12% to 12.5%, up from our 11% outlook previously. This compares to a 4.8% operating margin last year and 10.3% in fiscal '20.
We expect operating margin for the remaining 3 quarters to moderate from Q1 levels based on increased marketing investments as planned to get to our target of 6% of sales this year, increased freight pressure in the back half of the year and our assumption that the higher-margin wholesale replenishments that we saw in the first quarter does not continue as demand start to normalize. For the full year, we expect operating profit dollars to increase meaningfully compared to fiscal '20 pre-COVID levels.
For the second quarter, which no longer includes Club Monaco, we expect constant currency revenues to increase approximately 20% to 22%. Foreign currency is expected to contribute about 50 basis points to revenue growth. We expect operating margin of about 13% to 14% in the second quarter. This includes gross margin of flat to up 20 basis points as we continue to drive AUR and product mix, largely offset by higher freight as we lap last year's COVID mix benefits. We also expect modest operating expense leverage and restructuring savings, partially offset by higher marketing and new stores. We expect full year tax rate to be about 24% with the second quarter tax rate about 24% to 25%.
In closing, we are proud of our team's agility and execution around the world this quarter. As Patrice mentioned, we are still managing through a highly dynamic environment. We are firmly back on offense with this strong start to the year, and this is only the beginning. Guided by Ralph's original vision and our purpose of inspiring the dream of a better life through authenticity and timeless style. We are connecting with consumers in more exciting and innovative ways than ever before.
Over the coming quarters and beyond, you'll continue to see us driving our targeted strategic investments in key growth opportunities in order to deliver value for all our stakeholders. With that, let's open up the call for your questions."

So first off, I actually really want to take a moment to acknowledge the tremendous execution and agility of our teams in the first quarter as we got back on offense as a company. I'd say the key drivers of this quarter's outperformance were, first, the stronger-than-expected recovery in North America and Europe, especially in wholesale, which, as you know, is accretive to overall margins.
Just a couple of data points to illustrate that, our North America wholesale AUR was up more than 20%. Our sell-out -- full-price sellout was up in the high teens and our wholesale dot-com business was up more than 75% to LLY. All 3 of these numbers are versus LLY, which we think is the more relevant benchmark period. The reset work that we did to create a healthier foundation in wholesale over the past few quarters is really starting to play out nicely and in a brand-enhancing way.
The second point I would call out is the fact that we drove the right elevated product and brand messaging with consumers. Ralph and our design team have done a great job of creating assortments that are resonating with consumers. We've been really pleased with our ability to win in casual, while at the same time, winning in more sophisticated casual as the consumer pivots back into that direction.
And the third point I'd call out is our pivot to digital and connected retail, which is really driving accelerated growth and margin accretion across our digital channels. So therefore, I'd say we are feeling confident in the sustainability of our growth going forward, driven by a structurally healthier base, an important pivot in North America wholesale and digital and investments back into our business."

And there were not as much of a headwind as we originally anticipated. And on the second part of your question, based on the strong Q1 beat, we felt comfortable raising our full year guidance. on strength in digital and improved gross margin outlook with higher AURs and our ability to flow through top line outperformance to operating margin.
That being said, the global environment remains volatile, and our guidance continues to incorporate a number of factors. First, it's clear that COVID isn't over, and we are watching the impact across our markets from both a demand recovery as well as from a supply chain perspective. And second, we expect to have increased inflationary pressures whether it's from freight, raw materials or labor to be a headwind as we move through the year. And lastly, while we're focused on strong growth trajectory in fiscal '22, we're very focused on long-term growth and sustainable value creation. And as Patrice mentioned, we're going to continue to invest in profitable growth.
And as we look towards a mid-teens operating margin, which we still think is the right long-term outlook for our business. We would say that we will continue -- we get to mid-teens margins based on continued revenue recovery, although lower than our original expectation of a $7 billion revenue mark in our original investment day, thanks to the foundational work that we did through COVID. But it will continue to be a story of expanded gross margin and SG&A expense leverage to the top line. And we can do this based on a -- the expectation of a low single-digit comp growth, we've noticed -- as we've noted earlier in prior quarters. We still feel confident about that. That's still our long-term goal, and we feel great about the progress we've made in this year in getting closer to that goal."

But we're really pleased with the progress that the team has made on continuing to elevate the brand and drive AUR growth concurrently. Matt, the biggest areas of progression.
The one thing I would really call out is actually the progress on North America wholesale. Because we haven't grown AUR in wholesale in North America in the long, long time, years. And I think through the great partnership that we have with our wholesale players here in the market as well as the brand elevation work, the work on products, the work on marketing, the work on presenting the brand in a more engaging way, it's translating into meaningful AUR growth. You think we quoted a number up over 20% versus North America wholesale. And listen, this is not a 1 quarter pop. We are confident in our trajectory moving forward, working closely with our partners to continue to drive AUR in wholesale.
The other area I would call out is actually North America, our own website, where we saw, again, very meaningful progression on AUR this quarter, I think, up north of 40%. So quite healthy. Again, we're not pricing. We're not elevating AUR in a vacuum. This is the outcome of brand elevation work. Again, elevating the product, elevating our marketing, elevating our presentation. And as a result, we have the ability to drive AUR through the 4 vectors that we've been talking historically together. One is being much more targeted and surgical in our promotional activity. Two is strategic price increases where we believe we can offer competitive value relative to our peer set. Three is continuing to invest in product mix, and you see us invest in outerwear, in home, now and those products obviously carry much greater AUR levels. And then finally, channel and country mix. So that's some specificity.
But all in all, Matt, we've actually grown AUR really nicely across the board, and we're really pleased with our performance across regions, across channels, which indicates again that the brand elevation work that we are doing is sticking and that the consumers see the value in what we have to offer."

As Patrice mentioned, the wholesale pricing is very encouraging. You saw strong AUR growth in North America. And I think we're really encouraged by the team's ability to add levers of pricing as we move forward. Notably, our new consumer acquisition with those new consumers transacting at higher AURs and bigger basket sizes is a really nice additional lever that we feel confident in and confident that we've proved out the ROI of investing in that new consumer acquisition.
So we feel like there is more upside as we move forward. I think North America is encouraging, but also we're encouraged by the pricing that we put up in our more developed markets like Asia, which has led in terms of AUR levels, but continues to grow nicely as we continue our brand elevation journey."

It's above -- the run rate is above what you thought about at the Analyst Day a couple of years back. It's been just such a source of upside to both our numbers and your plan for so many quarters. And it doesn't sound like the underlying drivers are slowing down at all. So I'd love your thoughts there.
And then I guess in the quarter as you started to refill the North America wholesale channel and Patrice, I heard in your voice, you're very happy with that. The growth rate improved by about 100 basis points sequentially compared to fourth quarter. So good numbers by any standards. And I don't mean to tempt or sound greedy, but as we've watched some of the peers report here lately, I wonder if Ralph Lauren would have seen wholesale up even more. And the only reason I ask that is because you've been very measured about the pace of restocking that channel. And I wonder if you could try to dimensionalize for us how you think about the September quarter and North America wholesale channel trend, the gap between selling and sell-through. Do you feel like you've held it back and that can continue to normalize? Or how should we think about the continuation of the refill the wholesale channel in North America?"

But let me start on gross margin because I think we really step back from our gross margin journey, which we didn't start during COVID. It started 4 years ago. It's really been a couple of big things. It's the power of our brand, our belief in it and our investment in it and the belief that we should be elevating all touch points to the consumer. That's what's given us the durability of our pricing journey, and that's what's really allowed us to continue to expand gross margin. We still believe in that journey.
Both this -- we also see that we have stronger products than ever before at what our breadth of categories and our strength of both opening price points, which we've maintained during this pricing journey and elevated price points, which our consumers are telling us that they have a strong and strong demand for has been an important part of our product mix journey and gives us confidence in our ability to continue to drive gross margin.
We also see the durability of our tailwinds. Longer term, we should continue to see geographic benefits and channel benefits as we lean into direct-to-consumer and lean into digital. Those are the things that underneath the covers are really driving our long-term gross margin journey, which we believe is durable for the next several years, maybe not at the pace that we've seen during COVID, certainly, but gross margin expansion. And you continue to see that in us taking up our guidance to now expanded margins for the balance of the year.
And just a couple of comments on the wholesale channel. -- we're very pleased with what we saw in the wholesale trajectory this year. We've often -- we've said throughout COVID that our sell out and sell-in would start to normalize. While sellout exceeded sell-in this quarter, we expect that to normalize and be strong as we move through with our partners in recovery. We're very encouraged by the comp performance in our North America wholesale business, which was up double digits.

So these areas that we called out like outerwear, denim footwear accessories, and we're adding home to that, we still believe in the potential of those categories. If anything on outerwear, I think the opportunity is probably bigger than we initially estimated 3 or 4 years back. And we're going to continue to invest in that heavily. You will see that in our fall assortment as an illustration of that.
And then across these different categories, I think we feel good about the capabilities we're building, the development of the product, how we're activating from a marketing standpoint and really rethinking the way the product needs to show up from a distribution point.

Well, we -- Aaron, while we saw tourist sales improved slightly in North America, they're still down 69% to LLY, but we did see some improvement on a sequential basis, but international travel remain limited to most regions. Our assumption in fiscal '22 is that we've assumed continued headwinds from tourist sales as we expect foreign travel to be under pressure through the fiscal year. Foreign tourism intensity is a lagging indicator. But fortunately, we are focused on capturing more domestic travel opportunities coming out of the pandemic. And you know we've noted our Sanlitun store, which is outperforming in tourist market like Beijing and local domestic travel to some of our flagships is that we're also leaning into.
And we have a limited presence in travel retail and have anticipated that, that will be slower to recovery as we move forward. And we're very focused on building our business with the Chinese consumer within China. And you've seen our Mainland China growth, continued strong store build-outs and really increased marketing, which we doubled this quarter to engage with that consumer before they start on their travel as the markets start to recover. But our expectation is that will happen after fiscal '22."

As we look at our global wholesale footprint, we want to drive greater focus on more on just natural margin, right? And that's certainly where we're headed. And as we're seeing our improved AUR performance in North America, less reliance on promotional activity. I think that's the direction of travel. So that's certainly the intent and that's what we're working towards. With our partners in a win-win mindset so that we can expand our margins, and they can also expand theirs in a sustainable way.
When it comes to recruiting new consumers on our e-commerce sites, if I understood your question correctly, Omar, I mean, actually, we're quite energized by the progress we're making in terms of new younger consumer recruiting on our site. It's the result of a combination of factors, right? One, our marketing investments are up significantly. Just as a reminder, marketing this year, 6% of revenue.
Two years ago, 4.5% of revenue, so a significant lift in marketing. And then we're playing a much broader palette of marketing activities, ranging from these above-the-line big brand campaigns around the polo shirt to our activities on sports, Olympics, Wimbledon, gaming, right? You saw that we signed a partnership with G2 and in particular, with the wreckless, they're one of their superstars there because that's where the consumer is. And that we want to -- we're going to appeal to that younger consumer where he or she consumes media, where he or she engages and we're seeing gaming as an important component of that.
And then we're continuing to inject product newness and surprise in our program. So Major League Baseball program, frankly, exceeded our expectations significantly what we've seen in Asia, and particularly in China, with the partnership that we did with Edison Chen and the Clot brand, also significant excitement and very strong reaction from consumers. So we are going to continue to appeal to a new generation, right? That's 1 of our 5 core strategic pillars. We think through our increased marketing and our more targeted approach, we have the ability to do that, and I think the numbers would bear that out.
To Jane's earlier point, what we like about the consumer beyond the fact that it's a new generation is higher basket size, more full price and therefore, a more profitable consumer for us. And then we also put a lot of attention and focus on retention, right? Because obviously, the name of the game is interested to bring them in is to make sure they stay in the family. And here, our ability to target them with much more personalized messaging through digital is proving to be a very effective tool for us. So a journey to be continued, but we're excited and encouraged by the momentum we have with that next-generation consumer."

That's puts us 200 basis points ahead of pre-COVID levels on a lower revenue base. So we're feeling very good about our progress towards our mid-teens operating margin. We do note, as we move through the year that we had some exceptional replenishment opportunities in wholesale, both digitally, digital pure players and our wholesale partners, which comes through at a high incremental margin. And don't anticipate that level of replenishment as we move forward. And we note that some of the freight pressures and some of the raw material pressures will continue be a headwind in the balance of the year.
You'll recall, Laurent, that we buy on long-term contracts. And so some of that long-term pricing starts to fade out as we move into higher price layers as we move through the year. And we've incorporated this into our guidance, but we've taken up our freight impact from 100 basis points to 120 basis points for the year.
The key lever for the balance of the year is really top line momentum. Now we're watching a number of factors, COVID, the Delta variant and the supply chain very carefully, but we're very encouraged. It's still early in the year. We feel confident. We feel like we're back on offense and -- but we have a clear-eyed view of where the risk is and the opportunities across channels and the opportunities across our brand."

Their commitment and execution shined through in our better-than-expected fourth quarter results. 
Against the volatile backdrop of the past year, we took action that has enabled us to emerge from this period a fundamentally stronger company than when we came into it. This includes: first, across all 3 regions, we accelerated our work to elevate our brands while also strengthening and simplifying our brand portfolio. We're also engaging more meaningfully with consumers and driving increased marketing to deliver higher brand awareness and purchase intent coupled with higher AURs. 
Second, we repositioned each of our channels and reduced our exposure to secularly challenged areas of distribution, particularly in North America. Within wholesale, we focused our brick-and-mortar presence on our healthier stores and significantly reduced our off-price penetration. Within direct-to-consumer, we accelerated our shift to digital, step-changing profitability by over 1,000 basis points as we added new connected retail capabilities and drove quality of sales."

So good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. 
Our teams delivered exceptional first quarter performance on both our top and bottom line results and across every geography. Our brand is resonating with consumers around the world as we lean into the breadth of our offering to deliver the products they are craving in this new normal. And all of our regions are in a healthier, more profitable growth trajectory.  
Even as we continue to execute through COVID-related challenges, it is clear that Ralph Lauren is back on offense.  A few highlights to note. First, building on our consistent brand elevation work in direct-to-consumer business, we are now seeing accelerated demand and increased AUR in our wholesale channel.  Second, our digital growth is accelerating, following our pricing and promotional reset work last year, and our digital margins continue to be accretive across every region.  And third, we continue to make strong progress toward our long-term target of mid-teens operating margins. We delivered the highest Q1 company operating margin since fiscal '14, even as we more than doubled our marketing investment and continued to reinvest in key areas of growth like digital, key city ecosystem expansion and our consumer targeting and personalization.  
Our performance demonstrates consistent execution against the 5 strategic pillars that we outlined at the start of our Next Great Chapter plan. Let me share a few highlights from the quarter. First, on our efforts to win over a new generation. As we continue to invest in marketing, we are focused on new consumer acquisition and retention and both global and localized campaigns that capture consumers' optimism and desire to come together as we progressively emerge from the challenges of the past year. 
Some of our key campaigns in the first quarter included our Summer of Sports, which we kicked off with our Olympics campaign in North America as the official outfitter of Team USA. In June, we amplified our Wimbledon campaign with the diverse group of athletes, celebrities and influencers, such as South Korean superstar and Tottenham forward, Son Heung-Min; British pro surfer, Lucy Campbell; and G2 Esports League of Legends superstar, Rekkles. 
In the world of golf, we celebrated our brand ambassador, Yuka Saso's first major win at the U.S. Women's Open Championship. And we were excited to welcome LPGA professional golfer, Andrea Lee, as the newest face of our women's golf brand. Combined, these Summer of Sports campaigns generated more than 8 billion total impressions globally in the quarter. And there's still more to come in August and September with the 2021 Ryder Cup and the U.S. Open Tennis Championships right here in New York.  
We also announced our launch this quarter as the official outfitter of G2 Esports, one of the world's premier professional esports organizations. 
We are proud of this first-of-its-kind partnership in fashion and gaming as we continue to drive new ways of reaching next-generation consumers in key channels where they engage. In all, we added more than 1 million new consumers to our direct-to-consumer channels alone this quarter. And our total social media followers continue to grow, exceeding 46 million globally led by Instagram.  
This takes me to our second key initiative, energize core products and accelerate high-potential underdeveloped categories. As markets reopen around the world, consumers are shifting back to many of the key categories that drove our business prior to the pandemic while we also continue to develop new and high-potential categories.  
While casual styles are still resonating, we're also seeing a progressive return to sophisticated casual. Given the breadth of our assortment, we have the unique ability to respond to consumer shifting appetite, reintegrating more elevated styles into our assortments as we scale back on stay-at-home categories.  
On the men's side, we're seeing a resurgence in polo shirts, sports coats and trousers, denim, footwear and accessories for our core brands. In women's, we're seeing improvements across dresses, elevated sweaters, novelty fleece, jackets and handbags. And we're also driving better performance in bottoms, including new fashion silhouettes like wide leg as well as new fabrications like silk and linen. 
We are rebuilding the penetration of these categories into fall '21 and beyond as consumers make the transition back to the office and social activities. Our Spring performance gives us increased confidence that we will have the right assortments to meet consumers' needs moving forward.  
Other product highlights from the quarter included our first of several special collections with Major League Baseball. These limited capsules celebrate the heritage of America's favorite past time and evoke Ralph's lifelong love of the sport. Launched in May, across all of our channels, including social, digital, our stores and wholesale, the initial capsule generated over 5 billion media impressions along with significantly higher spend compared to our average total consumer.  
Our Spring Polo shirt campaign included the launch of our Polo Color Shop, fully made-to-order customized Polos and our updated Earth Polo in expanded colors. And we launched  Polo Cologne Intense, an updated fragrance for a new generation and our new stir of eyewear collection as we continue to elevate and innovate across our licensed categories as well.  
Moving on to our third key initiative, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels. With most of our key markets now fully reopened, we are back on offense this year with the build-out of our brand-elevating key city ecosystems around the world. This ecosystem approach ensures a consistently elevated experience across our digital, social and physical channels both in our direct-to-consumer and wholesale networks.  
As part of this, in the first quarter, we opened 18 new stores and concessions in priority locations globally, mostly in Asia, and closed 11 locations. China continues to be a significant long-term growth opportunity, and our ecosystem approach delivered strong growth again this quarter with Mainland sales up more than 50%. 
We are opening 2 new emblematic store experiences this year in Beijing and Shanghai.  With a smaller footprint than our existing flagships around the world, this new format offers consumers an elevated, immersive brand experience at a significantly lower investment than our traditional flagships. 
Our Beijing store opened at the end of April in Sanlitun Mall, one of the top shopping locations in the country. In addition to featuring our Ralph's Coffee, Sanlitun integrates innovative, smart retail and digital activations throughout the store in partnership with Tencent. This includes endless aisle technology, virtual try ons and in-store treasure hunt using QR codes and customization stations where consumers use our WeChat Mini Program to order customized products from their mobile phones.  
Though still early, the store has significantly outperformed our initial expectations, and we're excited to build on our presence in China with the opening of our emblematic Shanghai location in just a few weeks. Both stores will immerse consumers in the world of Ralph Lauren and will help further develop our ecosystems in these key markets, which already include our smaller format Polo boutiques, concessions and digital presence across our own site and key partners such as Tmall.  
And as foreign tourism continues to be a headwind compared to fiscal '20 levels, we have shifted more of our marketing, clienteling and merchandising to capture local shoppers and regional tourists along with driving digital commerce.  This takes me to our priority of leading with digital. Our global digital ecosystem, including our directly operated sites, department store dot-com, pure players and social commerce, accelerated to more than 80% growth in the first quarter in constant currency, up from about 60% in Q4.  
While traffic is returning -- is starting to return to physical stores, the strength in digital is exceeding our expectations, driving a benefit to our overall operating margin mix. North America drove the biggest improvement this quarter, increasing more than 50% across both owned and wholesale digital channels. Meanwhile, Europe and Asia momentum continued with growth of more than 100% in each region in Q1, led by our wholesale digital and pure-play channels.  
Our investments in digital continue to focus on content creation for all of our platforms, enhanced digital capabilities to improve the user experience and continuing to leverage AI and data to serve our consumers even more effectively. 
Touching on our work to operate with discipline to fuel growth. We continue to drive expense discipline in the first quarter in order to fund our long-term strategic investments in global expansion, digital and brand building while also working toward our target of mid-teens operating margins. 
We also successfully completed the sale of Club Monaco at the end of the first quarter as planned. And as previously announced, Chaps will transition from our North America wholesale business to a licensed model in Q2. These actions will enable us to further focus our resources on our core namesake brands and elevated positioning in the marketplace. 
I also want to take a moment to highlight our ongoing work to integrate citizenship and sustainability into everything we do. In June, we published our Annual Design the Change report, outlining our updated commitments and actions to drive our impact and champion the lives touched by our business. 
While I encourage all of you to download the full report from our corporate website, I'll highlight a few important additions this year.  We committed to comprising our global leadership team of at least 20% underrepresented race and ethnic groups by 2023. As part of our comprehensive circularity strategy, we set a target to use 100% recycled cotton in our products by 2025 and to launch additional resale and recycle opportunities for our consumers by 2022. 
We also announced a goal to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across our operations and supply chain by 2040 as we continue to work on reducing our carbon footprint throughout our value chain. And beginning this fiscal year, we will incorporate key ESG metrics into our executive compensation plans.  
In closing, Ralph and I are very encouraged by the strong start to the fiscal year. Our teams are executing with passion and continue to embrace the agility they demonstrated throughout the challenging and unpredictable last 18 months. While we will continue to monitor key macro challenges closely for the balance of the year, notably around inflation, supply chain disruptions, COVID resurgences and the pace of traffic recovery, the actions we took to strengthen the foundations of our brand and our business last year are enabling us to deliver results even earlier than we expected.  
Looking beyond this period of unusual COVID compares, we are increasingly confident in our ability to drive sustainable growth. More than ever, led by Ralph's iconic vision, our teams are intensely focused on executing on our strategic plan to continue to protect and elevate our brand while realizing the significant growth opportunities that exist for our business in every market. With their passion, talent and careful execution, Ralph and I are confident in our ability to deliver attractive, long-term growth and value creation for all of our stakeholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions."

Our first quarter performance exceeded our expectations as our teams navigated challenges with agility, our brands connected with consumers and our strategy drove high-quality growth. Upside performance th",2026,"Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. 
Our first quarter performance exceeded our expectations as our teams navigated challenges with agility, our brands connected with consumers and our strategy drove high-quality growth. Upside performance this quarter was driven by faster recovery in both North America and Europe led by our wholesale channel. Strong performance across Asia despite extended COVID headwinds in Japan accelerated digital growth with further digital margin expansion and continued brand elevation with high-teens AUR growth. And we continue to drive expense discipline across our business while investing in high-ROI initiatives to drive operating margins significantly above our expectations.  
First quarter revenues increased 182% to last year on a reported basis and 176% in constant currency. Growth was positive in every region led by North America. Compared to first quarter fiscal '20 or LLY, revenues declined 4%. However, this includes approximately 7 points of negative impact from last year's strategic reset to our distribution and to our Chaps business, which transitions to a licensed model this month.  
Total digital ecosystem sales accelerated to more than 80% growth in constant currency both to last year and LLY, including 50% growth in our own digital business. Our performance improved sequentially in every region, reflecting our strong assortments, expanded connected retail capabilities and high-impact marketing. 
North America delivered the strongest sequential improvement with digital ecosystem sales increasing more than 50%, up from low double digits last year. Digital margins also continue to strengthen and were strongly accretive to every region's profitability.  
Total company adjusted gross margin was 69.8% in the first quarter, down 200 basis points to last year on a reported basis and down 260 basis points in constant currency. This was significantly better than expected as we lapped last year's unusual COVID mix benefits driven by better pricing and promotion, along with favorable product mix and the benefit of supply chain organization streamlining.  Adjusted gross margins increased 30 basis points to LLY.  
First quarter AUR growth grew 17%, marking our 17th consecutive quarter of AUR gains as we continue on our brand elevation journey. This came on top of 25% growth last year while stores were closed.  
Adjusted operating expenses increased 39% driven by higher compensation and rent as we lapped last year's furloughs and store closures during COVID shutdowns. Adjusted expenses declined 2% compared to LLY. We more than doubled our first quarter marketing investments over the last year's substantially reduced levels at the start of the pandemic. Compared to first quarter fiscal '20, marketing increased 39% as we focused on digital initiatives and reactivating key brand moments as markets reopened around the world. We expect to maintain an elevated level of marketing this year at around 6% of sales to support consumer engagement, acquisition and our long-term brand-building initiatives.  
Adjusted operating margin for the first quarter was 16.8% compared to a margin loss of negative 35.7% last year and 460 basis points ahead of LLY operating margin. This was well above our guidance of 7% to 7.5% due to stronger-than-expected replenishment in our wholesale and digital channels, which generate highly accretive margins versus our total company rate.  
Moving on to segment performance, starting with North America. First quarter revenue increased 300% to last year driven by strong Spring assortments, improving consumer sentiment and expanded store reopenings as we lapped the peak of store lockdowns last spring.  Compared to LLY, North America revenues declined 8%, but included an 18% headwind from our strategic distribution resets and Chaps. 
In North America retail, revenues grew 189% to last year. Comps increased 176% on improved traffic and nearly 40% AUR growth, reflecting our continued elevation around product marketing and more targeted pricing and promotions. Brick-and-mortar comps increased 278% driven by stronger AUR, basket sizes and traffic as most stores reopened. Although foreign tourist sales improved significantly to last year, they were still nearly 70% below LLY due to continued softness in international traffic and travel. 
Comps in our own digital commerce business grew 51% this quarter, accelerating from 25% in Q4 as we continued to focus on new consumer acquisition, product elevation and enhancing the user experience. While we expect continued momentum in this channel, we note the prior year compares build sequentially after Q1.
In North America wholesale, revenues increased to $250 million compared to $23 million last year as we carefully restocked into the channel and lapped last year's minimal shipment to customers during the shutdown. Sales meaningfully outperformed our expectations, driving the biggest upside to our guidance this quarter.
The foundational work we completed through COVID to reset and elevate our inventories, exit lower-tier wholesale doors and significantly reduce our off-price penetration is starting to deliver strong early results across every key metric. 
In North America wholesale, full-price sellout is exceeding our sell-in. Total sellout was up high teens to LLY in Q1, led by market share gains in men's, kids, home and women's footwear. And we are also encouraged by early sequential improvements in women's ready-to-wear.  Wholesale AUR growth continues to accelerate, up more than 20% to LLY. This represents our strongest wholesale pricing gains in the last 6 years. And our focus on Wholesale Dot Com is working with digital sellout up more than 50% in Q1 and more than 75% to LLY. 
Coming out of the pandemic, our wholesale partnerships are stronger, healthier and more collaborative with a focus on marketing, improved digital capabilities and the right product assortment and an appropriate level of inventories as we build back into demand. And we see more to come as we are still in the early stages of driving our brand elevation strategy in this channel.
Moving on to Europe. First quarter revenue increased 194% on a reported basis and 179% in constant currency, above our expectations. First quarter comps increased at 98% with a 154% increase in brick-and-mortar as stores reopened and a 23% increase in digital commerce.  The strong early pent-up demand that started in the U.K. this April was followed by better-than-expected reopening trends across France, Germany and Italy despite extended lockdowns in the quarter. Approximately 20% of our stores were fully closed in Q1 with additional stores operating under partial closures or other restrictions. All of our major markets reopened by the end of June.
Digital commerce outperformed despite a challenging 44% comparison last year when COVID-related closures shifted more business online. While our digital comps partially benefited from extended lockdowns across Europe this quarter, the results also reflected stronger Spring assortments, growth in connected retail and our targeted marketing efforts. Europe wholesale exceeded our expectations again this quarter driven by stronger sellout and reorders in both digital wholesale as well as traditional wholesale accounts.
Turning to Asia. Revenues increased 68% on a reported basis and 61% in constant currency. Our Asia retail comps increased 43% driven by similar performance across our brick-and-mortar stores and digital commerce. Our digital ecosystem continued to accelerate in Asia. In Q1, this was supported by our successful 5/20 gift day campaign, 6/18 shopping event live streamed from our newly opened Sanlitun store and momentum in our newest digital flagships in China, Japan and Hong Kong.
Japan, our largest market in Asia, was negatively impacted by an extended state of emergency for the majority of the quarter. These restrictions drove a roughly 6-point headwind to the region's overall growth in Q1. Despite this, our teams were able to successfully mitigate these headwinds with stronger performance across the rest of the region.  This was led by the Chinese Mainland, which was up more than 50% to last year and 70% to LLY in constant currency driven by a strong product assortment, localized marketing initiatives and new store openings.  Korea was also up more than 30% to last year and 40% to LLY. Japan returned to normal operations in late June and started to ramp up vaccinations. However, the government declared another state of emergency in July ahead of the Olympic Games, and we expect a slower recovery in Japan this year.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the year with $3 billion in cash and investments and $1.6 billion in total debt, which compares to $2.7 billion in cash and investments and $1.9 billion in total debt last year. We are confident in our ability to meet our debt leverage requirements, ratio requirements in Q2 and eliminate capital allocation restrictions in our bank waiver.
Net inventory increased 4% to support increasing demand. This compared to a 22% decline last year when we limited shipments to brick-and-mortar channels at the height of COVID shutdowns last spring. Supply chain challenges are increasing the variability of inventory flows quarter-to-quarter.
Looking ahead, our outlook is based on our best assessment of the current macro environment, which includes ongoing COVID-related disruptions, the global supply chain challenge -- and the global supply chain challenges. We expect the quarter cadence this year to be volatile given dynamic conditions across our markets. This includes potentially uneven pace of recovery by region and channel as well as the timing of investments as markets reopen.
For fiscal '22, we now expect constant currency revenues to increase approximately 25% to 30% to last year on a 53-week basis. Excluding approximately $700 million in annualized revenues, we deliberately reduced during the pandemic, including department store exits, off-price and daigou reductions, Chaps and Club Monaco, this implies revenues up slightly to fiscal '20. Foreign currency is expected to contribute about 30 basis points to full year revenue growth.
We now expect gross margin to expand 50 to 70 basis points even as we lap meaningful geographic and channel mix benefits due to last year's COVID closures. This implies roughly 440 basis point increase to fiscal '20. Our outlook includes slightly higher freight headwinds of approximately 100 to 120 basis points versus our previous expectation of about 100 basis points. However, this is more than offset by our expectation of stronger AUR growth of mid to high single digits above our long-term guidance of low to mid-single digits annually as we continue our long-term elevation work. 
We now expect operating margin of 12% to 12.5%, up from our 11% outlook previously. This compares to a 4.8% operating margin last year and 10.3% in fiscal '20.  We expect operating margin for the remaining 3 quarters to moderate from Q1 levels based on increased marketing investments as planned to get to our target of 6% of sales this year, increased freight pressure in the back half of the year and our assumption that the higher-margin wholesale replenishments that we saw in the first quarter does not continue as demand start to normalize. For the full year, we expect operating profit dollars to increase meaningfully compared to fiscal '20 pre-COVID levels.
For the second quarter, which no longer includes Club Monaco, we expect constant currency revenues to increase approximately 20% to 22%. Foreign currency is expected to contribute about 50 basis points to revenue growth. We expect operating margin of about 13% to 14% in the second quarter. This includes gross margin of flat to up 20 basis points as we continue to drive AUR and product mix, largely offset by higher freight as we lap last year's COVID mix benefits. We also expect modest operating expense leverage and restructuring savings, partially offset by higher marketing and new stores. We expect full year tax rate to be about 24% with the second quarter tax rate about 24% to 25%.
In closing, we are proud of our team's agility and execution around the world this quarter. As Patrice mentioned, we are still managing through a highly dynamic environment. We are firmly back on offense with this strong start to the year, and this is only the beginning. Guided by Ralph's original vision and our purpose of inspiring the dream of a better life through authenticity and timeless style, we are connecting with consumers in more exciting and innovative ways than ever before.  Over the coming quarters and beyond, you'll continue to see us driving our targeted strategic investments in key growth opportunities in order to deliver value for all our stakeholders.

So first off, I actually really want to take a moment to acknowledge the tremendous execution and agility of our teams in the first quarter as we got back on offense as a company. I'd say the key drivers of",298,"Brooke, thanks for your question to kick us off. So first off, I actually really want to take a moment to acknowledge the tremendous execution and agility of our teams in the first quarter as we got back on offense as a company. I'd say the key drivers of this quarter's outperformance were, first, the stronger-than-expected recovery in North America and Europe, especially in wholesale, which, as you know, is accretive to overall margins.
Just a couple of data points to illustrate that. Our North America wholesale AUR was up more than 20%. Our sellout -- full-price sellout was up in the high teens and our Wholesale Dot Com business was up more than 75% to LLY. All 3 of these numbers are versus LLY, which we think is the more relevant benchmark period. The reset work that we did to create a healthier foundation in wholesale over the past few quarters is really starting to play out nicely and in a brand-enhancing way.
The second point I would call out is the fact that we drove the right elevated product and brand messaging with consumers. Ralph and our design team have done a great job of creating assortments that are resonating with consumers. We've been really pleased with our ability to win in casual while at the same time, winning in more sophisticated casual as the consumer pivots back into that direction.
And the third point I'd call out is our pivot to digital and connected retail, which is really driving accelerated growth and margin accretion across our digital channels. 
So therefore, I'd say we are feeling confident in the sustainability of our growth going forward driven by a structurally healthier base, an important pivot in North America wholesale and digital and investments back into our business."

And on the second part of your question, based on the strong Q1 beat, we felt comfortable raising our full year guidance on strength in digital and improved gross margin outlook with higher AURs and our ability to flow through top line outperformance to operating margin.
That being said, the global environment remains volatile, and our guidance continues to incorporate a number of factors. First, it's clear that COVID isn't over and we are watching the impact across our markets from both a demand recovery as well as from a supply chain perspective. And second, we expect to have increased inflationary pressures, whether it's from freight, raw materials or labor, to be a headwind as we move through the year. And lastly, while we're focused on strong growth trajectory in fiscal '22, we're very focused on long-term growth and sustainable value creation. And as Patrice mentioned, we're going to continue to invest in profitable growth.
And as we look towards a mid-teens operating margin, which we still think is the right long-term outlook for our business, we would say that we will continue -- we'd get to mid-teens margins based on continued revenue recovery, although lower than our original expectation of a $7 billion revenue mark in our original investment day, thanks to the foundational work that we did through COVID, but it will continue to be a story of expanded gross margin and SG&A expense leverage to the top line. And we can do this based on a -- the expectation of a low single-digit comp growth, as we've noticed -- as we've noted earlier in prior quarters. We still feel confident about that. That's still our long-term goal, and we feel great about the progress we've made in this year in getting closer to that goal."

But we're really pleased with the progress that the team has made on continuing to elevate the brand and drive AUR growth concurrently. 
Matt, the biggest areas of progression, the one thing I would really call out is actually the progress on North America wholesale because we haven't grown AUR in wholesale in North America in a long, long time, years. And I think through the great partnership that we have with our wholesale players here in the market as well as the brand elevation work, the work on products, the work on marketing, the work on presenting the brand in a more engaging way, it's translating into meaningful AUR growth. You -- I think we quoted a number up over 20% versus LLY in North America wholesale. And listen, this is not a 1-quarter pop. We are confident in our trajectory moving forward, working closely with our partners to continue to drive AUR in wholesale.
The other area I would call out is actually North America, our own website, where we saw, again, very meaningful progression on AUR this quarter, I think up north of 40%. So quite healthy. Again, we're not pricing. We're not elevating AUR in a vacuum. This is the outcome of brand elevation work, again, elevating the product, elevating our marketing, elevating our presentation. And as a result, we have the ability to drive AUR through the 4 vectors that we've been talking historically together. One is being much more targeted and surgical in our promotional activity; two is strategic price increases where we believe we can offer competitive value relative to our peer set; three is continuing to invest in product mix, and you see us invest in outerwear, in home now, and those products obviously carry much greater AUR levels; and then finally, channel and country mix. So that's some specificity.
But all in all, Matt, we've actually grown AUR really nicely across the board, and we're really pleased with our performance across regions, across channels, which indicates again that the brand elevation work that we are doing is sticking and that the consumers see the value in what we have to offer."

As Patrice mentioned, the wholesale pricing is very encouraging. You saw strong AUR growth in North America. And I think we're really encouraged by the team's ability to add levers of pricing as we move forward. Notably, our new consumer acquisition with those new consumers transacting at higher AURs and bigger basket sizes is a really nice additional lever that we feel confident in and confident that we've proved out the ROI of investing in that new consumer acquisition.
So we feel like there is more upside as we move forward. I think North America is encouraging. But also, we're encouraged by the pricing that we put up in our more developed markets like Asia, which has led in terms of AUR levels, but continues to grow nicely as we continue our brand elevation journey."

I know you guys did a lot of hard work to clean up the business last year. We can see the results of it here. A couple from me. Jane, similar to Matt's question on the AUR, how do you think about the sustainability of gross margins here? It's above -- the run rate is above what you thought about at the Analyst Day a couple of years back. It's been just such a source of upside to both our numbers and your plan for so many quarters. And it doesn't sound like the underlying drivers are slowing down at all. So I'd love your thoughts there.
And then I guess in the quarter, as you started to refill the North America wholesale channel and, Patrice, I heard in your voice, you're very happy with that. The growth rate improved by about 100 basis points sequentially compared to fourth quarter. So good numbers by any standards. And I don't mean to tempt you or sound greedy, but as we've watched some of the peers' report here lately, I wonder if Ralph Lauren would have seen wholesale up even more. And the only reason I ask that is because you've been very measured about the pace of restocking that channel. And I wonder if you could try to dimensionalize for us how you think about the September quarter and North America wholesale channel trend, the gap between selling and sell-through. Do you feel like you've held it back and that can continue to normalize? Or how should we think about the continuation of the refill of the wholesale channel in North America?"

But let me start on gross margin because I think we really stepped back from our gross margin journey, which we didn't start during COVID. It started 4 years ago. It's really been a couple of big things. It's the power of our brand, our belief in it and our investment in it and the belief that we should be elevating all touch points to the consumer. That's what's given us the durability of our pricing journey, and that's what's really allowed us to continue to expand gross margin. We still believe in that journey.
Both this -- we also see that we have stronger products than ever before at what our breadth of categories and our strength of both opening price points, which we've maintained during this pricing journey and elevated price points, which our consumers are telling us that they have a strong and -- strong demand for has been an important part of our product mix journey and gives us confidence in our ability to continue to drive gross margin.
We also see the durability of our tailwinds. Longer term, we should continue to see geographic benefits and channel benefits as we lean into direct-to-consumer and lean into digital. Those are the things that underneath the covers are really driving our long-term gross margin journey, which we believe is durable for the next several years, maybe not at the pace that we've seen during COVID, certainly, but gross margin expansion. And you continue to see that in us taking up our guidance to now expanded margins for the balance of the year.
And just a couple of comments on the wholesale channel. We're very pleased with what we saw in the wholesale trajectory this year. We've often -- we've said throughout COVID that our sellout and sell-in would start to normalize. While sellout exceeded sell-in this quarter, we expect that to normalize and be strong as we move through with our partners in recovery. We're very encouraged by the comp performance in our North America wholesale business, which was up double digits. And we're very pleased by the strong pace of growth that we saw in our digital wholesale business. I think we're working more collaboratively and in greater partnership with our wholesale partners than ever before."

Just a data point to give you the context of the reset work that we've done on wholesale brick-and-mortar North America over the past few years. We're down 66% in terms of wholesale doors over the past 4 years, right? So we're seeing the benefit of that healthier brick-and-mortar base. And then we're also seeing the benefit of amazing partnership we have on the digital front where you saw significant acceleration of our Wholesale Dot Com performance, and we expect that momentum to continue. And I think we are on the very same page when it comes to looking at assortment and continuing to elevate our assortment."

So on men's, it's indeed a pivot towards newness and a pivot towards more elevated products. And so sports jackets, sports coats, polo shirts, trousers, denim and footwear are the areas where we have overdelivered over the past quarter. On women's, we're seeing the same shift towards newness and more sophisticated elevated casual dresses. Novelty sweaters, jackets and bottoms are the key areas, Erinn, for women's.
And as far as our -- we like to call in high-potential categories as opposed to noncore, but -- because over time, they will become core for us. So these areas that we call out like outerwear, denim, footwear, accessories, and we're adding home to that, we still believe in the potential of those categories. If anything on outerwear, I think the opportunity is probably bigger than we initially estimated 3 or 4 years back. And we're going to continue to invest in that heavily. You will see that in our Fall assortment as an illustration of that.
And then across these different categories, I think we feel good about the capabilities we're building, the development of the product, how we're activating from a marketing standpoint and really rethinking the way the product needs to show up from a distribution point. The most recent addition to that group is home. It's very early days on that journey, but we're very bullish on the opportunity and encouraged by the initial momentum we have on those."

Well, we -- Erinn, while we saw tourist sales improved slightly in North America, they're still down 69% to LLY, but we did see some improvement on a sequential basis, but international travel remain limited to most regions. 
Our assumption in fiscal '22 is that we've assumed continued headwinds from tourist sales as we expect foreign travel to be under pressure through the fiscal year. Foreign tourism intensity, a lagging indicator, but fortunately, we are focused on capturing more domestic travel opportunities coming out of the pandemic. And you know, we've noted our Sanlitun store, which is outperforming in tourist market like Beijing and local domestic travel to some of our flagships, is we're also leaning into.
And we have a limited presence in travel retail and have anticipated that, that will be slower to recovery as we move forward. And we're very focused on building our business with the Chinese consumer within China. And you've seen our Mainland China growth, continued strong store build-outs and really increased marketing, which we doubled this quarter to engage with that consumer before they start on their travel as the markets start to recover. But our expectation is that will happen after fiscal '22."

And that's certainly where we're headed. And as we're seeing our improved AUR performance in North America less reliance on promotional activity, I think that's the direction of travel. So that's certainly the intent and that's where -- that's what we're working towards, with our partners in a win-win mindset so that we can expand our margins, and they can also expand theirs in a sustainable way.
When it comes to recruiting new consumers on our e-commerce sites, if I understood your question correctly, Omar, I mean, actually, we're quite energized by the progress we're making in terms of new younger consumer recruiting on our site. It's the result of a combination of factors, right? One, our marketing investments are up significantly. Just as a reminder, marketing this year, 6% of revenue; two years ago, 4.5% of revenue. So a significant lift in marketing. 
And then we're playing a much broader palette of marketing activities ranging from these above-the-line, big brand campaigns around the Polo shirt to our activities on sports, Olympics, Wimbledon, gaming, right? You saw that we signed a partnership with G2 and, in particular, with Rekkles, that's their -- one of their superstars there because that's where the consumer is and that we want to -- we're going to appeal to that younger consumer where he or she consumes media, where he or she engages, and we're seeing gaming as an important component of that.
And then we're continuing to inject product newness and surprise in our program. So Major League Baseball program, frankly, exceeded our expectations significantly. What we've seen in Asia, and particularly in China, with the partnership that we did with Edison Chen in the CLOT brand, also significant excitement and very strong reaction from consumers. 
So we are going to continue to appeal to the new generation, right? That's 1 of our 5 core strategic pillars. We think through our increased marketing and our more targeted approach, we have the ability to do that, and I think the numbers would bear that out.
To Jane's earlier point, what we like about the consumer beyond the fact that it's a new generation is higher basket size, more full price and therefore, a more profitable consumer for us. And then we also put a lot of attention and focus on retention, right? Because obviously, the name of the game isn't just to bring them in, it's to make sure they stay in the family. And here, our ability to target them with much more personalized messaging through digital is proving to be a very effective tool for us. 
So a journey to be continued, but we're excited and encouraged by the momentum we have with that next-generation consumer."

We do note, as we move through the year that we had some exceptional replenishment opportunities in wholesale both digitally -- digital pure players and our wholesale partners, which comes through at a high incremental margin, and don't anticipate that level of replenishment as we move forward. And we note that some of the freight pressures and some of the raw material pressures will continue be a headwind in the balance of the year.
You'll recall, Laurent, that we buy on long-term contracts. And so some of that long-term pricing starts to fade out as we move into higher price layers as we move through the year. And we've incorporated this into our guidance, but we've taken up our freight impact from 100 basis points to 120 basis points for the year.
The key lever for the balance of the year is really top line momentum. Now we're watching a number of factors, COVID, the Delta variant and the supply chain very carefully, but we're very encouraged. It's still early in the year. We feel confident. We feel like we're back on offense and -- but we have a clear-eyed view of where the risk is and the opportunities across channels and the opportunities across our brand."

So to have it be accretive in every region is even a higher bar than accretive to total company, and it's accretive in every region. We're very proud of that. That can be a lever that we can now lean into and have it be margin accretive.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. We are delivering strong progress on our fiscal '22 plan, with second quarter performance exceeding our expectations across all key financial and consumer engagement metric",1811,"Thank you, Cory. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. 
We are delivering strong progress on our fiscal '22 plan, with second quarter performance exceeding our expectations across all key financial and consumer engagement metrics. Our brand elevation strategy, which cuts across our product, marketing and distribution channels is resonating with consumers in every region. 
We're driving these results despite greater-than-expected disruptions in the global supply chain and extended COVID restrictions in key markets like Japan. And while we continue to face a volatile environment, the work we have done to build a resilient supply chain over the last several years as well as our significant AUR elevation will continue to be competitive advantages as we navigate emerging challenges and mitigate risk. 
To give you some context and color, our supply chain is intentionally diversified across multiple markets, a key initiative we started over 4 years ago. This allows us to quickly shift production when certain markets are affected by COVID or other issues. We've created a strategic supplier program whereby we prioritize our partners with a presence across multiple markets, enabling these ships to happen even more seamlessly. 
And we have proven pricing power, elevating our AUR across every channel and geography over the last 4.5 years so that we have room to absorb near-term pressures we've seen in our business, such as tariffs or current inflationary headwinds. This built-in agility gives us confidence as we continue to navigate a volatile global operating environment ahead. 
But I want to be clear that this is not just about our ability to play defense. Even as macro challenges arise or subside, Ralph Lauren is firmly driving offense to position the company for long-term sustainable growth. We are leveraging our strong momentum to further accelerate investments across brand building, personalization and new customer recruiting, digital and key markets and categories in the months ahead. 
Reflecting on the last quarter, a few key highlights. First, our overall recovery is outpacing our expectations. This was led by outperformance in Europe and North America, with Asia in line with our plan and positive to fiscal '20 or LLY despite extended COVID measures as our product assortments resonated strongly with consumers globally. 
Second, our digital momentum continues, following our reset work across product, pricing and promotions last year and our digital operating margins continue to be strongly accretive to our overall company margin rate. And third, our elevation strategy is translating across all channels, including positive trends in wholesale across regions. 
On top of all of this, we made further progress toward our long-term target of mid-teens operating margins, with second quarter margins of 17%, representing the highest Q2 rate since fiscal '13. And we achieved this even as we continue to reinvest for future growth and plan to increase returns to shareholders over the next several quarters. 
Our performance demonstrates our team's strong execution against the 5 strategic pillars that we outlined at the start of our Next Great Chapter plan. Let me share a few highlights from the quarter across each one. 
First, on our efforts to win over a new generation. We continue to invest in our brand building initiatives to drive both new customer acquisition and retention in order to fuel long-term growth. In the second quarter, we further strengthened our brand consideration, purchase intent and Net Promoter Scores globally, while Ralph Lauren brand sentiment also improved across every region. 
Some of our key campaigns underpinning these results included: the continuation of our summer sports program with the U.S. Open Tennis Championships here in New York as well as Team USA's victory at the 2021 Ryder Cup in Golf. These came on the heels of our sponsorship of the U.S. Olympic Team in Tokyo earlier in the quarter. Together, these campaigns generated over 71 billion media impressions in the second quarter as we continue to inspire new generations of athletes and dreamers. 
In September, we celebrated the return of fashion's biggest line, the Met Gala. And what better opportunity to showcase this year's theme of American fashion than with one of the most iconic American brands, Ralph Lauren. Celebrities and influencers from Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck to Chance the Rapper and Lily Aldridge were featured in our designs, driving strong engagement and traffic to our channels. Ralph's designed of Lilly Collins' wedding dress, some of you will know her as Emily in Paris, garnered worldwide media attention. 
And we were excited to announce a new collaboration this quarter with Zepeto, a metaverse or virtual world, where user's avatars can socialize and create content. This partnership represents the latest frontier in digital engagement in which users can purchase exclusive digital and apparel for their 3D avatars for the first time ever. 
Early engagement has outpaced our expectations with 100,000 items already sold in just a few weeks. In all, we added 1.4 million new consumers to our direct-to-consumer channels alone this quarter, a 19% increase to last year. And our total social media followers continue to grow, reaching 46.9 million globally led by Instagram. 
Moving to our second key initiative, energize core products and accelerate high potential underdeveloped categories. Ralph and our design teams continue to inspire consumers around the world as they begin to incorporate sophisticated casual styles back into their closets, while still seeking elevated comfort with categories like loungewear. We are uniquely positioned to capture this evolving hybrid way of dressing given the breadth of our portfolio. 
And we're also making strong progress on our high potential categories like outerwear and denim. During the second quarter, we drove our core sportswear categories along with seasonal styles such as transitional sweaters and fleece as we headed into early fall selling. On the men's side, we saw strength across bottoms, including denim, active styles and shorts, as well as sweaters and performance fleece. Though a small part of our business prior to COVID, tailored clothing and dress shirts continued to show sequential improvement. 
In women's, we drove outsized performance in sweaters, sweatshirts, mid-layer knits and bottoms. Outerwear, including transitional quilted jackets, updated lasers and denim jackets, also grew double digits to LLY. This should bode well for the key outerwear selling period of fall and holiday. 
We also launched our new Ralph's Club Fragrance globally with a digital-first campaign featuring Luka Sabbat and Gigi Hadid. This marked our first major fragrance launch in China. And in its first month, it ranked among the top 3 men's fragrances in key markets around the globe, including in the U.S. and more than 75% of purchases on ralphlauren.com were made by consumers who are new to the brand. 
This takes me to our third key initiative, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels. We continued the build-out of our brand elevating key city ecosystems around the world in the second quarter, with 35 new stores and concessions opening in top cities globally and 13 locations closed. The majority of these store openings were in Asia and particularly the Chinese Mainland, which continues to represent a significant long-term growth opportunity for our brand. 
Despite COVID-related shutdowns in July and August, our Mainland sales were still up more than 25% to last year and more than 70% to LLY in constant currency. And comp trends rebounded quickly in September once restrictions were lifted. We opened our second emblematic store experience in China at Shanghai's Kerry Centre this quarter, following our first opening in Beijing this spring. 
The emblematic concept provides an example of how we are transforming the retail experience, with digital integration throughout, exciting in-store activations and hospitality features like Ralph's Coffee that are fueling new consumers acquisition. Early performance is well ahead of our expectations, and these stores are also lifting overall growth trends in their respective omnichannel ecosystems. 
Moving to our priority of leading with digital. Our global digital ecosystem, including our directly operated sites, departmentstore.com, pure players and social commerce, grew approximately 45% in the quarter in constant currency and 50% to LLY. Our digital momentum continues even as traffic returns to physical stores, driving a benefit to our overall operating margin mix. This is the result of our continued digital investments focused on content creation, data analytics and AI to serve our consumers through an elevated connected retail experience. 
Now touching on our work to operate with discipline to fuel growth. As I mentioned, our teams continue to operate with agility and focus to mitigate supply chain headwinds, delivering better-than-expected gross and operating margins in the second quarter. At the same time, we continue to drive expense discipline as we accelerate both near-term and multiyear investments in the back half of the year to fuel long-term growth. 
And lastly, on our brand portfolio, we successfully transitioned Chaps from our North America wholesale business to a license model in the second quarter, as previously announced. This completes our exit from moderate-priced U.S. department stores, enabling our teams to focus on our core namesake brands and elevated positioning in the marketplace. 
I also want to take a moment to highlight our ongoing work to integrate citizenship and sustainability into everything we do. We recently announced the launch of the U.S. Regenerative Cotton Fund in partnership with the Soil Health Institute. Funded by the Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation, this program works directly with farmers to transition 1 million acres of American cotton crop land to regenerative production. In all, it is set to eliminate 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent from the atmosphere by 2026, both increasing sustainable cotton supply and making important progress in the urgent call to action on climate. 
We are proud to share today that this program is being recognized at the COP 26 International Meeting on Climate as an innovation spread partner by the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate. In addition, this quarter, we joined the Global Fashion Agenda's Strategic Partner Group to prioritize sustainability and fashion as well as the Ellen MacArthur Foundation as a partner in its mission to create a circular economy for apparel. And we were also honored to be recognized as one of the 2021 Best Places to Work for People with Disabilities by the Disability Equality Index and as one of the world's best employers of 2021 by Forbes. 
In closing, Ralph and I are strongly encouraged by the company's progress through the first half of the fiscal year. All channels and geographies are showing strong momentum as we build on the healthier foundation we set over the past 18 months. Our performance, along with the resilience of our supply chain and pricing power in the market give us confidence as we accelerate our investments in the back half to support long-term growth. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions."
362220,1684453906,2421183,"Ralph Lauren Corporation, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Ralph Lauren Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results outperformed our expectations with progress across each of our key strategic initiatives, even in the midst of continued COVID and supply chain headwinds around the world. Perfor",1955,"Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. 
Our second quarter results outperformed our expectations with progress across each of our key strategic initiatives, even in the midst of continued COVID and supply chain headwinds around the world. Performance this quarter was driven by strong top line growth led by our full-price wholesale channels globally and broad-based outperformance in Europe, continued digital momentum across owned and third-party channels, further gross margin expansion on top of last year's COVID mix benefits with double-digit AUR growth and elevated product mix more than offsetting higher freight. And higher-than-expected operating margins, including cost savings benefits, improved wholesale margins and favorable channel mix shifts from wholesale and digital. 
Second quarter revenues increased 26% to last year with positive growth in every region, led by Europe and North America. Compared to second quarter fiscal '20 or LLY, revenues declined 12%. However, this included approximately 8 points of negative impact from last year's strategic reset of our distribution and our Chaps business, which moved to a licensed model. 
Total digital ecosystem sales grew approximately 45% in constant currency to last year and 50% to LLY, including 35% growth in our own digital business. Momentum continued across every region, reflecting our strong assortments, expanded connected retail capabilities and high-impact marketing. Digital margins were also strongly accretive to our second quarter profitability, consistent with last year and about 1,300 basis points higher than LLY. 
Total company adjusted gross margin was 67.3% in the second quarter, up 80 basis points to last year on a reported basis and 50 basis points in constant currency despite increased freight headwinds of approximately 150 basis points. Gross margins were better than expected despite lapping last year's unusual COVID mix benefits, driven by better pricing and promotion, along with favorable product mix and last year's supply chain organization streamlining. Adjusted gross margins increased 580 basis points to LLY. 
Second quarter AUR grew 14% on top of 26% growth last year, with increases across every region. This represents our 18th consecutive quarter of AUR gains as we continue on our brand elevation journey, and it gives us strong confidence in our sustained pricing power as we mitigate mid to high single-digit product cost inflation starting in the second half of the year. 
Adjusted operating expenses increased 17% to last year to $755 million and declined 5% compared to LLY, reflecting our restructuring savings. The increase to last year was driven by higher marketing and compensation as we lapped last year's furloughs and store closures due to COVID. 
Marketing increased 83% to 6.1% of sales in the quarter with a focus on new customer acquisition and long-term brand-building initiatives. Operating expenses were below our initial plan as we shifted about $25 million of investment into the second half of the year based on COVID disruptions. In the second half, we will increase marketing and talent investments to support growth this holiday and in customer acquisition to drive longer-term growth. 
Adjusted operating margin for the second quarter was 17.1%, up 450 basis points to last year and 220 basis points to LLY. This was above our guidance of 13% to 14% margin, largely driven by improvements in Europe and North America wholesale. Excluding the timing shift, operating margin was still well ahead of our plan, above 15%. 
Moving to segment performance, starting with North America.  Second quarter revenue increased 30% to last year, supported by strong product assortments, new customer acquisition and market share gains. Compared to LLY, North America revenues declined 20%, but included a 15-point headwind from our strategic distribution reset and Chaps similar to Q1. 
In North America Retail, revenues grew 34% to last year. Comps increased on improved traffic and 23% AUR growth, reflecting our continued elevation around product, marketing and more targeted pricing and promotions. Brick-and-mortar comps increased 31%, driven by double-digit growth in AUR, basket sizes and traffic. Although foreign tourist sales improved significantly to last year, they were still down more than 80% to LLY due to continued softness in international travel. 
Comps in our owned digital commerce business grew 32% this quarter. This was driven by a strong product offering, along with high-quality new consumer acquisition and retention of last year's new consumers, resulting in higher full-priced sales. New consumers increased 12% to last year and more than 50% to LLY and retention of the new consumers acquired last year improved meaningfully as we become increasingly effective at targeting and personalization. 
In North America wholesale, revenues increased to 23% to last year. This was ahead of our expectations as the foundational work we completed through COVID to reset our inventories, elevate our product mix, exit lower-tier wholesale doors and significantly reduced off-price penetration is delivering improved top line growth and quality of sales. 
Total sellout was up low double digits in the second quarter to LLY led by continued market share gains in men's, kids and home. Lauren women's continued to stabilize sequentially, including share gains in women's ready-to-wear. Overall, wholesale AUR growth continues to accelerate, up 30% to LLY as we elevated our assortments and pulled back on seasonal promotions in the channel. 
And our momentum on Wholesale Dot Com drove digital sellout growth of more than 45% to both last year and LLY. All of this is enabled by our healthier brand positioning in wholesale, and we see more to come as we are still in the early stages of driving our brand elevation strategy in this channel. 
Moving on to Europe. Second quarter revenue increased 38% on a reported basis and 36% in constant currency, above our expectations. Revenue inflected to positive growth on a LLY basis this quarter, with all key markets performing better than planned, led by Germany and France. The U.K., our largest market in the region and earliest to reopen this spring, also continued to perform better than planned on strong demand. 
Europe comps increased 27% in the quarter. Bricks-and-mortar comps were up 28%, driven by improved traffic, AUR and basket sizes. Digital commerce comps increased 24% on top of a 26% comp last year when COVID-related closures shifted more business online. Europe wholesale exceeded our expectations again this quarter, driven by stronger sellout and reorders at both digital wholesale as well as traditional wholesale accounts. 
Turning to Asia. Revenue increased 14% on a reported basis and 13% in constant currency. Our Asia retail comps increased 7% with 69% growth in digital commerce and 4% growth in bricks-and-mortar stores. Continued strong momentum in China and Korea this quarter more than offset extended COVID restrictions in Japan, our largest market in the region as well as Australia, Malaysia and Singapore. In total, COVID-related closures and operating restrictions negatively impacted Asia sales by about 3.5% in the quarter. 
And while the Chinese Mainland still grew more than 25% this quarter, our performance was also tempered by COVID lockdowns from late July through August. On a positive note, Mainland comps rebounded quickly in September once stores reopened. 
Japan comps also started to improve towards the end of the quarter with the government lifting all states of emergency following the end of our fiscal Q2. Our digital ecosystem continued to accelerate in Asia. In Q2, this was supported by our successful Chuseok thanksgiving holiday campaign in Korea, Qixi Valentine's Day in China and an overall momentum in our newer digital flagships in China, Japan and Hong Kong. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $3.1 billion in cash and investments and $1.6 billion in total debt, which compares to $2.4 billion in cash and investments and $1.6 billion in total debt last year. Net inventory increased 5%, modestly below our plan due to global supply chain delays. 
While we expect continued variability of inventory flows, from quarter-to-quarter, we believe our inventories are well positioned across key categories and channels to meet demand for the upcoming holiday and spring '22 seasons. Overall, we expect to improve our inventory positions as supply chain headwinds subside and plan to end the year with inventories better aligned to sales growth. 
As we move into the second half of this fiscal year, we are recommitting to our long-term capital allocation priorities outlined prior to COVID. This includes, first, reinvesting in our strategic growth priorities, including brand marketing and elevation, digital and expansion of our key city ecosystems to drive long-term sustainable growth. 
Second, with peak pandemic closures likely behind us, we are focused on returning 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We reinstated our dividend in the first quarter, and we expect this to grow in line with durable net income growth. And we expect to resume our share repurchase program starting in the second half of this fiscal year, with about $580 million remaining under our current share authorization. 
Looking ahead, our outlook is based on our best assessment of the current macro environment, including global supply chain challenges and COVID-related disruptions. We expect the quarterly cadence this year to remain volatile given dynamic conditions across our markets. 
For fiscal '22, we are raising our revenue growth to 34% to 36% growth to last year in constant currency on a 53-week basis, excluding approximately $700 million in annualized revenue we reset during the pandemic. This includes department store exits, off-price and daigou reductions and the licensing and sale of Chaps and Club Monaco. This implies revenues up high single digits to fiscal '20. 
Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact full year revenues by about 20 basis points. We expect gross margins to expand at the high end of our prior range of 50 to 70 basis points or roughly 450 basis points increase to LLY. Our outlook improved on more favorable pricing and product mix this year despite increased freight costs, which we now expect to be in the range of 130 to 150 basis points due to our plans to use more air freight to fulfill strong demand in the back half. 
As a reminder, we renegotiated our ocean freight rates for the year in Q1. Raw materials, notably cotton, were purchased roughly a year in advance, resulting in slightly favorable product costs through the first half of fiscal '22. This is followed by mid to high single-digit estimated cost increases in our second half ending March and through calendar 2022, which we expect to more than offset with continued AUR growth and productivity improvements. 
We raised our AUR outlook to high single-digit growth this year, above our long-term annual guidance of low to mid-single digits as we continue our elevation work. We still expect operating margins of 12% to 12.5%, which compares to 4.8% operating margin last year and 10.3% in fiscal '20. We continue to expect operating margin rates for the back half of the year to moderate from first half levels based on increased second half marketing investments of approximately 7% to 8% of sales reaching our full year target of at least 6% of sales this year, increased air freight expense in the back half of the year and our assumption of more normalized channel mix compared to last year's COVID disruptions. 
For the full year, our increased revenue outlook implies high-teens operating profit dollar growth compared to LLY pre-COVID levels. For the third quarter, we expect constant currency revenues to increase approximately 14% to 16%. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenues by about 140 basis points. 
While our teams are still actively focused on managing through global supply chain disruption,

Listen, we're certainly encouraged by the strong first half we've had this fiscal year. And what's really important to note from a mindset standpoint is we still have massive runway ahead of us. And to a large extent, ou",909,"Sure. Thank you for your question. Listen, we're certainly encouraged by the strong first half we've had this fiscal year. And what's really important to note from a mindset standpoint is we still have massive runway ahead of us. And to a large extent, our brand continues to be much bigger than our business. So our performance so far has given us proof point and the confidence to continue investing in the multiple opportunities for growth that we had ahead of us. 
There are 4 that I would call out, Dana. The first one, which is really our lifeblood, right, is customers, new customer acquisition, and you've seen the numbers this past quarter, up 19% versus last year. We're bringing in a younger consumer. We're bringing in a higher value consumer, a more profitable consumer and less promotion-sensitive consumer. We're very excited about that momentum. We're going to continue to invest in this space to expand our footprint and also, of course, drive retention, and we've seen very good progress on retention for customers that we've brought over the past few quarters. 
Second area is around product and the breadth of our product portfolio and which we've talked in prior forms really sets us apart from many other brands in this space, right? We have a lifestyle portfolio that ranges from tuxedos and evening gowns all the way to sweatshirts. And as you see consumers progressively reinvest into more elevated casual, we're incredibly well positioned to meet that demand. And that's part of what's driven the success in Q2, is this ability to meet this hybrid customer expectation, both more elevated products and also continued interest in athlete. And we've been able to balance both well. 
On top of that, we've talked a lot about our high potential underdeveloped categories. And we've seen really nice momentum in these categories. But again, relatively early days in sneakers, outerwear and denim for example. So much more runway there. Third area is digital, right? And as you know, we've done a lot of work to reset here, reset on product, reset on pricing, reset on brand presentation. We're seeing really good momentum in this channel across both our own sites, up 35% across pure players and breaking clicks, up 57% this past quarter. Total digital, up 45%. 
What's exciting here is the momentum on digital continues as the stores are reopening. So we're seeing consumers with an omnichannel mindset continue to engage both digitally and also in our stores. We're obviously going to continue to invest in capabilities in this space, functionality and connected retail experience. 
Notably, and you touched on it, our margin in digital continues to be accretive to our total company margin. That is one -- I think, one of our most exciting achievements over the past year, and the team has done a fantastic job to reset both product pricing, promotion, operations, cost structure in the way that this is accretive across all 3 regions, and our expectation is that will continue, right? We expect digital to be our fastest-growing channel for the years to come. And we're really pleased that the digital margin is accretive to the company margin. And we have full confidence in that, that will continue and expand. 
And then the final thing I would call out in terms of drivers is our focus on key cities. We don't look at markets as much by country anymore. We really look at them as key cities and building and pardon for the jargon, the building, a connected omnichannel ecosystem in each of the key cities, that's playing out really nicely. The combination of brick-and-mortar, pure-play, wholesale, brick-and-click and our general digital wrapper. We're seeing very strong response from the consumer in those cities where we've made these investments. 
We have a couple of examples in our prepared remarks of things that have happened recently in Shanghai, in Beijing, and we have more to come in the following quarters. When I look at the model we have there, the success we're seeing with it and the opportunity ahead of us, the same thing, a long runway in terms of our ability to go build these ecosystems around the world. So 4 key drivers that certainly drove the performance in Q2 and will continue to play out for the long term. 
As far as risks are concerned, the biggest risk we're facing are clearly macro-related, right? From supply chain to cost inflation headwinds, I mean, those are very real. We've touched on this in the script, and we believe we're actually very well positioned to mitigate them because of our brand pricing power. 18 quarters in a row of AUR growth with multiple levers to drive AUR because of our newly diversified agile, faster supply chain that is not dependent on one specific supplier or one specific country. 
So these headwinds are there. They're real, but we are very confident in our ability to mitigate them. And so I would say, in this context, the biggest mistake we could make with these macro headwinds and these external pressures is actually a shift to defense, right? And as you've seen in our plans right now, we're on offense. We're executing our plans, while mitigating the headwinds. We've got the resources to invest in the business. Our focus is on fueling our momentum next quarter, the quarter after that and for the long term. Thanks for your question, Dana."

Let me answer your first question in 2 parts. First, on the AUR trajectory, we are very confident in our ability to continue our elevation journey from here. We expect to continue driving both positive AUR and gross margin expansion in the back half",370,"Sure. Let me answer your first question in 2 parts. First, on the AUR trajectory, we are very confident in our ability to continue our elevation journey from here. We expect to continue driving both positive AUR and gross margin expansion in the back half of fiscal '22 and through our long-term plan. Over the last 18 consecutive quarters of AUR growth, we've developed a proven multi-levered approach to pricing with a focus on creating value for the consumer, and it's working. 
So while we're still comfortable with our overall long-term guidance of low to mid single-digit AUR growth, it's fair to expect that our AUR rates will be on the higher end over the next year as we work through higher cost and we work those into our broader financial algorithm. On your operating margin question, we're still well on track towards the goal of mid-teens operating margin. 
Our full year fiscal '22 guidance puts us firmly on a path with around 200 basis points of expansion pre-COVID OI levels. And we're planning to achieve this on a lower reset base of revenues and with OI dollars substantially higher than pre-COVID levels as well. And embedded within our guide, our gross margins are expanding despite cost inflation and we're reinvesting back in the business because we have momentum. 
As Patrice mentioned, we firmly believe that now is the right time to invest in the long term. We've reset to a more profitable base and we're seeing strong momentum in our brands, and we have the right tools in place to drive expanded AURs and the gross margin. 
Now on your question about the pace of share buybacks. So we have as you've noted, 580 remaining in our authorization, I would expect that over the -- historically, we've done about $500 million over the course of a fiscal year. I would expect us to do at least that pace as we close out the year. But of course, we'll be looking at the value creation potential of the share buybacks, looking at the market. But I think you can expect this to go at least as fast as we have historically in terms of about $500 million over 4 quarters."

Maybe you can help us disaggregate how much -- North America slowed a little bit in both channels. Maybe you could help us just disaggregate how much the business transition line items impacted both the channels in North America in the quarter. And then I'd be curious if you might be able to help us think about how much supply chain they have held back North America in 2Q? Just to get an idea of what the magnitude of what's going on there is. And then I guess, Patrice, you got the wholesale AURs up now for a couple of quarters in a row. And we've heard good news on that in the retail side for a long time. 
So now that we've got a couple of quarters of AURs going up in that channel, as we look back kind of at the 2018 Analyst Day, which I know is ancient history at this point. But you thought this business could do mid-60s gross margins at that time. And as we're looking at it now, you've got AURs, I think, in a much better place than what you imagined at that time. I would be curious to hear what you think the potential for this business is going forward. And then I guess, Jane, just one last one. I think fourth quarter operating margin has guided sub-4%. Is that -- maybe just help us think about how much conservatism is baked in there versus actual costs that you're planning rising in the business?"
362220,1684453906,2421183,"Ralph Lauren Corporation, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Ralph Lauren Corporation","Executives","Sure. Why don't I take the first part of your question in terms of the disaggregating North America growth. So if you think about North America growth, we have -- as we move into this second quarter, we're really encouraged by the strong -- overall strong",327,"Sure. Why don't I take the first part of your question in terms of the disaggregating North America growth. So if you think about North America growth, we have -- as we move into this second quarter, we're really encouraged by the strong -- overall strong performance in North America. We have a much stronger foundation for growth, solid momentum in the business, where we had to do most of the reset work in digital and in wholesale. 
And our Q2 guidance did assume a sequential LLY slowdown ex resets as we weren't expecting the same level of upside that we saw in Q1 based on some of the inventory restocking that we did in Q1. But overall, Q2 was still in line or better than our expectations. I think that the other aspect in North America was we did see some traffic softness in the outlet centers as the Delta variance started to rise sort of mid to late summer, which impacted traffic overall, but we certainly saw that impact. 
Now encouragingly, we do see our conversion and our comps outpaced the traffic in outlets, but that was also part of the -- a bit of slowdown that we saw through the summer. Do I think the supply chain is impacting -- impacted some of that? Yes. I know that we had less air freight coming in during that mid-summer level. So we were a little slow to get fall on the floor and make that transition. 
And so I do expect that, that impacted North America when we started to airfreight in and we became more aggressive in airfreight as we closed out September. We saw a rise in comps in our outlet doors, and we're very encouraged by that. So I do think it had an impact. There's a lot of dynamics going on, but I do think it had an impact, and we were encouraged by the acceleration that we saw in September."

So first of all, we're actually really pleased with the progress that's happening in wholesale on AUR. And it's really -- to use a baseball analogy, really early innings on this one, right, probably the first inning. You saw the number in the release, AUR U.S. wholesale up 30% versus LLY, with strong momentum there. And what I really like about the progress there is its multiple levers, right? 
It's getting smarter on promotions, when, how, where to implement them. It's like-for-like pricing. It's investing into higher value items. So all these levers that we've seen play out in DTC, we're also seeing play out in wholesale. And we're working very closely with our partners and actually are very aligned in the approach that we want to drive moving forward. So I think long runway on AUR growth and expansion in wholesale and fundamentally healthier business as a result of it.
When it comes to gross margins guidance, Michael, we're not going to change our guidance long term at this point. We're still, as Jane mentioned, very committed to our mid-teens operating margin and very confident in our ability to get there. I think at this point, mid-60s for gross margin expectation in the near term is consistent with what we said and consistent with how to think about it. 
And then once we have the opportunity to kind of guide for the next phase of growth, and we can relook at that together. But the general message is consistency of expectations with the focus, especially on the ability to deliver mid-teens operating margins for this company."

Where could the upside come, really if we see revenues strengthen beyond our expectations into the fourth quarter, supply chain resolved or especially the logistics aspect of supply chain resolves quicker than we expected, you could see some flow-through there. The pressures are twofold, other than the small quarter, we're moving into some of the higher costs that we're seeing on a product basis. And you saw that we've taken up some of our estimates on freight, now moving to 130 to 150 basis points. 
Obviously, given freight was 60 basis points in the first quarter, 150 in the second quarter, the back half to get to our range is more substantial than that. So you see that pressure in back half."

So how to make our white Polo shirt relevant for that younger consumer. And I think through the pivots we've made on marketing going on the platforms that resonate the most with that younger consumer, whether that's TikTok or Snap, participating in those activities that are most relevant for them like gaming, right? Engaging in the metaverse like what we've done recently with Zepeto where we've seen very high level of engagement. 
So the shift in our marketing has really helped broaden the appeal to that younger consumer. And we see it in our data, as I mentioned upfront on Dana's question, we are seeing a younger consumer coming into the franchise as a result of the marketing content and targeting. On the product front, we have, of course, also leveraged categories that resonate the most with the younger consumer, Polo Sports, which we've reenergized, and I think there's a really clear positioning now is resonating very nicely elevated at leisure and fleece is also connecting nicely with that consumer. 
And then some of our core products, our sweaters or chinos or denim, some of our more elevated outerwear has also resonated -- quite resonating quite nicely with that younger consumer. So as I look at the broad categories that have been successful in the past quarter and as we look ahead in terms of where we've invested, we feel very nicely positioned broadly and in particular, for that younger consumer, whether that's, again, denim, investments in sneakers, driving more elevated casual that is resonating with that group, both on the men's side and on the women's side. 
And I'm actually very encouraged that the progression we're making in terms of attracting that younger and higher value customer is not a 1-quarter phenomenon. We've now seen this for a number of quarters and is the direct results of interventions, targeted interventions we're making across product, across marketing and across product brand distribution."

In terms of the broad buckets, Brooke, where we're focusing our investments moving forward that we expect to drive long-term growth are one, new customer acquisition. Right? Younger customer, higher value customer. And we now have the tools with the consumer intelligence group that we have in place, with our ability to target and tailor the messaging to really be providing very high ROIs on these types of investments. So we've seen the success behind them, we're going to dial that up across the region. 
The second is continue to fuel our digital momentum, right? And that's a combination of functionality on our own sites, elements of connected retail, work that we're doing with our wholesale partners, and you'll see we have a number of exciting things coming online over the next couple of quarters when it comes to our digital capabilities, in addition to localizing sites, so expanding our footprint into new markets with localized propositions from a ralphlauren.com standpoint. 
And then the third one is continuing to invest in building our store footprint in the context of our key city ecosystem. And we've had 2 good examples recently with Shanghai and Beijing, and there's more to come there. So these are investments that will not just generate an impact over the next 1 or 2 quarters, but there will be long-lasting -- will have long-lasting effect. We really look at lifetime value of customers that we bring in to the franchise, and we're actually really pleased with the profiles we're bringing in. We're really pleased with our retention performance. So these 3 areas will have a long runway in terms of contributions to growth and value creation."

Obviously, with some of the shift we did, the $25 million that came out of the first half and went into the second half, you'll see heavier marketing spend into the second half because we're able to sort of post COVID and restrictions and shutdowns, we're able to activate things like the Australian Open. And we have the events coming up the fashion show, fashion week coming up. Those things will be activated, and that's a portion of the spend that shifted. So you will see this back half be closer to 7% to 8% of sales relative to our run rate, which is up 5.8% of sales into this quarter for the first half. 
Now outside of SG&A versus -- outside of marketing, I'm sorry, versus last year, SMB is normalizing. Last year, we had furloughs and we had government subsidies during the height of the pandemic. We're obviously open across all our stores now. And we are seeing some wage rate pressure. It's been most notable in our distribution centers with temporary and hourly workforce and in our retail doors. 
I'm pleased to say that we are well-staffed right now, but there is some inflation in wages that we saw. And of course, we're committing this year to opening new doors. As a part of our drive towards direct-to-consumer, we're going to open 90 new doors this year, and there is some investments and expenses associated with that. 
Now as you ask in terms of what do we have control of, overall, we're committed to making these investments. We do have some control over marketing, as you saw us exercise in the first half to make sure we're in tune with local markets and the operating dynamics that we're working with today, we do feel now is the right time just with the holiday and what we're seeing in terms of opening around the country, now is the right time to invest. And as Patrice mentioned, we're also investing in local e-commerce sites, have a very strong ROI and payback after the first 10 months."

So that's little more than 10 points of pressure in the second half to our wholesale business. It's absolutely the right strategic move. 
Underlying ex that reset, we expect continued momentum outside of Chaps in our wholesale business and higher levels of profitability as Patrice mentioned. In retail, obviously, Club Monaco will be excluded from our overall corporate results. But in retail, we expect as the situations of COVID normalizes that we'll see better traffic back to the store. We've got strong conversion rates, strong AUR growth plan -- that we've already put up and planned for balance of year that will help us drive overall retail. 
We're planning for some store openings in North America and continuing comp growth. On a long-term basis, we haven't yet guided the region, but we do expect North America is on a healthy base and is positioned for growth from here out. You see the digital momentum, you see us gaining share in wholesale and we're very encouraged by what our existing store base can do in our new store base."

I think if you kind of step back and say, okay, what are the drivers in North America is going to be moving forward. And you heard me say last quarter -- I think it was last quarter, there have been this confidence in our ability to win in North America since I started. And that command confidence completely holds true as we speak together today. As Jane mentioned, if you look at the key vectors of growth moving forward, digital, right? We now have, after a painful reset dealing with daigou, dealing with the site that was over promotional that didn't have the right product offering, We now feel very good about our ralphlauren.com site in the U.S., both in terms of how the brand is presented, how we're engaging with consumers, the connected retail capabilities that come with it, and of course, the profitability. So that's the first element. 
Second element, as you mentioned, is our retail footprints, right, both productivity and our outlet and expanding our own full-priced store footprints. So more to come in this space. So we know that there is an opportunity for us to increase our presence -- physical presence from a DTC standpoint in a number of key cities in the U.S. and network is well underway with the format that we're excited about and the brand presentation that we're excited about. 
And then the final point is now wholesale, which used to be a drag and a bit of an candidly around our Next is now reset is now on a healthy base, both the brick-and-mortar side, where we've closed, as a reminder, 65% of all our locations over the past 3, 4 years. And the digital front, you saw the digital numbers -- the digital growth numbers from wholesale this quarter are quite strong, and we believe only the beginning of the long term. 
So multiple vectors of growth, Jane, as you mentioned, we're not ready to guide North America longer term. But I think on both of our behalf, I think I could say we have a lot of confidence in our ability to not only grow but win in this market, right? The last thing I would leave you with is recent latest share readings. We're growing share in men's, we're going sharing kids, we're growing share in home. We're going sharing women's ready wear and there's more to come. So we've got really nice momentum, a healthy foundation, and we're investing to win. 
All right. With that, we're going to close it here. Thank you for joining us today. We look forward to sharing our third quarter fiscal '22 results with you in February. In the meantime, we hope to welcome you at the Polo Bar, little advertising never hurts, which just reopened here in New York City a couple of weeks ago where you can experience the magic of the Ralph Lauren lifestyle.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. We are delivering strong progress on our fiscal '22 plan, with second quarter performance exceeding our expectations across all key financial and consumer engagement metric",1809,"Thank you, Cory. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. 
We are delivering strong progress on our fiscal '22 plan, with second quarter performance exceeding our expectations across all key financial and consumer engagement metrics. Our brand elevation strategy, which cuts across our product, marketing and distribution channels, is resonating with consumers in every region. 
We're driving these results despite greater-than-expected disruptions in the global supply chain and extended COVID restrictions in key markets like Japan. And while we continue to face a volatile environment, the work we have done to build a resilient supply chain over the last several years as well as our significant AUR elevation will continue to be competitive advantages as we navigate emerging challenges and mitigate risk. 
To give you some context and color, our supply chain is intentionally diversified across multiple markets, a key initiative we started over 4 years ago. This allows us to quickly shift production when certain markets are affected by COVID or other issues. We've created a strategic supplier program whereby we prioritize our partners with a presence across multiple markets, enabling these shifts to happen even more seamlessly. 
And we have proven pricing power, elevating our AUR across every channel and geography over the last 4.5 years so that we have room to absorb near-term pressures we've seen in our business, such as tariffs or current inflationary headwinds. This built-in agility gives us confidence as we continue to navigate a volatile global operating environment ahead. 
But I want to be clear that this is not just about our ability to play defense. Even as macro challenges arise or subside, Ralph Lauren is firmly driving offense to position the company for long-term sustainable growth. We are leveraging our strong momentum to further accelerate investments across brand building, personalization and new customer recruiting, digital and key markets and categories in the months ahead. 
Reflecting on the last quarter, a few key highlights. First, our overall recovery is outpacing our expectations. This was led by outperformance in Europe and North America, with Asia in line with our plan and positive to fiscal '20 or LLY despite extended COVID measures as our product assortments resonated strongly with consumers globally. 
Second, our digital momentum continues, following our reset work across product, pricing and promotions last year, and our digital operating margins continue to be strongly accretive to our overall company margin rate. And third, our elevation strategy is translating across all channels, including positive trends in wholesale across regions. 
On top of all of this, we made further progress toward our long-term target of mid-teens operating margins, with second quarter margins of 17%, representing the highest Q2 rate since fiscal '13. And we achieved this even as we continue to reinvest for future growth and plan to increase returns to shareholders over the next several quarters. 
Our performance demonstrates our team's strong execution against the 5 strategic pillars that we outlined at the start of our Next Great Chapter plan. Let me share a few highlights from the quarter across each one. 
First, on our efforts to win over a new generation. We continue to invest in our brand building initiatives to drive both new customer acquisition and retention in order to fuel long-term growth. In the second quarter, we further strengthened our brand consideration, purchase intent and Net Promoter Scores globally, while Ralph Lauren brand sentiment also improved across every region. 
Some of our key campaigns underpinning these results included: the continuation of our summer sports program with the U.S. Open Tennis Championships here in New York as well as Team USA's victory at the 2021 Ryder Cup in golf. These came on the heels of our sponsorship of the U.S. Olympic Team in Tokyo earlier in the quarter. Together, these campaigns generated over 71 billion media impressions in the second quarter as we continue to inspire new generations of athletes and dreamers. 
In September, we celebrated the return of fashion's biggest line, the Met Gala. And what better opportunity to showcase this year's theme of American fashion than with one of the most iconic American brands, Ralph Lauren. Celebrities and influencers from Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck to Chance the Rapper and Lily Aldridge were featured in our designs, driving strong engagement and traffic to our channels. Ralph's designed of Lilly Collins' wedding dress, some of you will know her as Emily in Paris, garnered worldwide media attention. 
And we were excited to announce a new collaboration this quarter with Zepeto, a metaverse or virtual world, where user's avatars can socialize and create content. This partnership represents the latest frontier in digital engagement in which users can purchase exclusive digital and apparel for their 3D avatars for the first time ever. 
Early engagement has outpaced our expectations with 100,000 items already sold in just a few weeks. In all, we added 1.4 million new consumers to our direct-to-consumer channels alone this quarter, a 19% increase to last year. And our total social media followers continue to grow, reaching 46.9 million globally led by Instagram. 
Moving to our second key initiative, energize core products and accelerate high potential underdeveloped categories. Ralph and our design teams continue to inspire consumers around the world as they begin to incorporate sophisticated casual styles back into their closets, while still seeking elevated comfort with categories like loungewear. We are uniquely positioned to capture this evolving hybrid way of dressing given the breadth of our portfolio. 
And we're also making strong progress on our high potential categories like outerwear and denim. During the second quarter, we drove our core sportswear categories along with seasonal styles such as transitional sweaters and fleece as we headed into early fall selling. On the men's side, we saw strength across bottoms, including denim, active styles and shorts, as well as sweaters and performance fleece. Though a small part of our business prior to COVID, tailored clothing and dress shirts continued to show sequential improvement. 
In women's, we drove outsized performance in sweaters, sweatshirts, mid-layer knits and bottoms. Outerwear, including transitional quilted jackets, updated blazers and denim jackets, also grew double digits to LLY. This should bode well for the key outerwear selling period of fall and holiday. 
We also launched our new Ralph's Club fragrance globally with a digital-first campaign featuring Luka Sabbat and Gigi Hadid. This marked our first major fragrance launch in China. And in its first month, it ranked among the top 3 men's fragrances in key markets around the globe, including in the U.S. and more than 75% of purchases on ralphlauren.com were made by consumers who are new to the brand. 
This takes me to our third key initiative, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels. We continued the build-out of our brand-elevating key city ecosystems around the world in the second quarter, with 35 new stores and concessions opening in top cities globally and 13 locations closed. The majority of these store openings were in Asia and particularly the Chinese Mainland, which continues to represent a significant long-term growth opportunity for our brand. 
Despite COVID-related shutdowns in July and August, our Mainland sales were still up more than 25% to last year and more than 70% to LLY in constant currency. And comp trends rebounded quickly in September once restrictions were lifted. We opened our second emblematic store experience in China at Shanghai's Kerry Centre this quarter, following our first opening in Beijing this spring. 
The emblematic concept provides an example of how we are transforming the retail experience, with digital integration throughout, exciting in-store activations and hospitality features like Ralph's Coffee that are fueling new consumers acquisition. Early performance is well ahead of our expectations, and these stores are also lifting overall growth trends in their respective omnichannel ecosystems. 
Moving to our priority of leading with digital. Our global digital ecosystem, including our directly operated sites, departmentstore.com, pure players and social commerce, grew approximately 45% in the quarter in constant currency and 50% to LLY. Our digital momentum continues even as traffic returns to physical stores, driving a benefit to our overall operating margin mix. This is the result of our continued digital investments focused on content creation, data analytics and AI to serve our consumers through an elevated connected retail experience. 
Now touching on our work to operate with discipline to fuel growth. As I mentioned, our teams continue to operate with agility and focus to mitigate supply chain headwinds, delivering better-than-expected gross and operating margins in the second quarter. At the same time, we continue to drive expense discipline as we accelerate both near-term and multiyear investments in the back half of the year to fuel long-term growth. 
And lastly, on our brand portfolio, we successfully transitioned Chaps from our North America wholesale business to a license model in the second quarter, as previously announced. This completes our exit from moderate-priced U.S. department stores, enabling our teams to focus on our core namesake brands and elevated positioning in the marketplace. 
I also want to take a moment to highlight our ongoing work to integrate citizenship and sustainability into everything we do. We recently announced the launch of the U.S. Regenerative Cotton Fund in partnership with the Soil Health Institute. Funded by the Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation, this program works directly with farmers to transition 1 million acres of American cotton crop land to regenerative production. In all, it is set to eliminate 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent from the atmosphere by 2026, both increasing sustainable cotton supply and making important progress in the urgent call to action on climate. 
We are proud to share today that this program is being recognized at the COP26 International Meeting on Climate as an innovation spread partner by the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate. In addition, this quarter, we joined the Global Fashion Agenda's Strategic Partner Group to prioritize sustainability and fashion as well as the Ellen MacArthur Foundation as a partner in its mission to create a circular economy for apparel. And we were also honored to be recognized as one of the 2021 Best Places to Work for People with Disabilities by the Disability Equality Index and as one of the world's best employers of 2021 by Forbes. 
In closing, Ralph and I are strongly encouraged by the company's progress through the first half of the fiscal year. All channels and geographies are showing strong momentum as we build on the healthier foundation we set over the past 18 months. Our performance, along with the resilience of our supply chain and pricing power in the market give us confidence as we accelerate our investments in the back half to support long-term growth. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions."

Our second quarter results outperformed our expectations with progress across each of our key strategic initiatives, even in the midst of continued COVID and supply chain headwinds around the world. Perfor",2100,"Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. 
Our second quarter results outperformed our expectations with progress across each of our key strategic initiatives, even in the midst of continued COVID and supply chain headwinds around the world. Performance this quarter was driven by strong top line growth led by our full-price wholesale channels globally and broad-based outperformance in Europe, continued digital momentum across owned and third-party channels, further gross margin expansion on top of last year's COVID mix benefits with double-digit AUR growth and elevated product mix more than offsetting higher freight. And higher-than-expected operating margins, including cost-savings benefits, improved wholesale margins and favorable channel mix shifts from wholesale and digital. 
Second quarter revenues increased 26% to last year with positive growth in every region, led by Europe and North America. Compared to second quarter fiscal '20 or LLY, revenues declined 12%. However, this included approximately 8 points of negative impact from last year's strategic reset of our distribution and our Chaps business, which moved to a licensed model. 
Total digital ecosystem sales grew approximately 45% in constant currency to last year and 50% to LLY, including 35% growth in our own digital business. Momentum continued across every region, reflecting our strong assortments, expanded connected retail capabilities and high-impact marketing. Digital margins were also strongly accretive to our second quarter profitability, consistent with last year and about 1,300 basis points higher than LLY. 
Total company adjusted gross margin was 67.3% in the second quarter, up 80 basis points to last year on a reported basis and 50 basis points in constant currency despite increased freight headwinds of approximately 150 basis points. Gross margins were better than expected despite lapping last year's unusual COVID mix benefits, driven by better pricing and promotion, along with favorable product mix and last year's supply chain organization streamlining. Adjusted gross margins increased 580 basis points to LLY. 
Second quarter AUR grew 14% on top of 26% growth last year, with increases across every region. This represents our 18th consecutive quarter of AUR gains as we continue on our brand elevation journey, and it gives us strong confidence in our sustained pricing power as we mitigate mid to high single-digit product cost inflation starting in the second half of the year. 
Adjusted operating expenses increased 17% to last year to $755 million and declined 5% compared to LLY, reflecting our restructuring savings. The increase to last year was driven by higher marketing and compensation as we lapped last year's furloughs and store closures due to COVID. 
Marketing increased 83% to 6.1% of sales in the quarter with a focus on new customer acquisition and long-term brand-building initiatives. Operating expenses were below our initial plan as we shifted about $25 million of investment into the second half of the year based on COVID disruptions. In the second half, we will increase marketing and talent investments to support growth this holiday and in customer acquisition to drive longer-term growth. 
Adjusted operating margin for the second quarter was 17.1%, up 450 basis points to last year and 220 basis points to LLY. This was above our guidance of 13% to 14% margin, largely driven by improvements in Europe and North America wholesale. Excluding the timing shift, operating margin was still well ahead of our plan, above 15%. 
Moving to segment performance, starting with North America.  Second quarter revenue increased 30% to last year, supported by strong product assortments, new customer acquisition and market share gains. Compared to LLY, North America revenues declined 20%, but included a 15-point headwind from our strategic distribution reset and Chaps similar to Q1. 
In North America retail, revenues grew 34% to last year. Comps increased on improved traffic and 23% AUR growth, reflecting our continued elevation around product, marketing and more targeted pricing and promotions. Brick-and-mortar comps increased 31%, driven by double-digit growth in AUR, basket sizes and traffic. Although foreign tourist sales improved significantly to last year, they were still down more than 80% to LLY due to continued softness in international travel. 
Comps in our owned digital commerce business grew 32% this quarter. This was driven by a strong product offering, along with high-quality new consumer acquisition and retention of last year's new consumers, resulting in higher full-priced sales. New consumers increased 12% to last year and more than 50% to LLY. And retention of the new consumers acquired last year improved meaningfully as we become increasingly effective at targeting and personalization. 
In North America wholesale, revenues increased to 23% to last year. This was ahead of our expectations as the foundational work we completed through COVID to reset our inventories, elevate our product mix, exit lower-tier wholesale doors and significantly reduced off-price penetration is delivering improved top line growth and quality of sales. 
Total sellout was up low double digits in the second quarter to LLY led by continued market share gains in men's, kids and home. Lauren women's continued to stabilize sequentially, including share gains in women's ready-to-wear. Overall, wholesale AUR growth continues to accelerate, up 30% to LLY as we elevated our assortments and pulled back on seasonal promotions in the channel. 
And our momentum on Wholesale Dot Com drove digital sellout growth of more than 45% to both last year and LLY. All of this is enabled by our healthier brand positioning in wholesale, and we see more to come as we are still in the early stages of driving our brand elevation strategy in this channel. 
Moving on to Europe. Second quarter revenue increased 38% on a reported basis and 36% in constant currency, above our expectations. Revenue inflected to positive growth on a LLY basis this quarter, with all key markets performing better than planned, led by Germany and France. The U.K., our largest market in the region and earliest to reopen this spring, also continued to perform better than planned on strong demand. 
Europe comps increased 27% in the quarter. Bricks-and-mortar comps were up 28%, driven by improved traffic, AUR and basket sizes. Digital commerce comps increased 24% on top of a 26% comp last year when COVID-related closures shifted more business online. Europe wholesale exceeded our expectations again this quarter, driven by stronger sellout and reorders at both digital wholesale as well as traditional wholesale accounts. 
Turning to Asia. Revenue increased 14% on a reported basis and 13% in constant currency. Our Asia retail comps increased 7% with 69% growth in digital commerce and 4% growth in bricks-and-mortar stores. Continued strong momentum in China and Korea this quarter more than offset extended COVID restrictions in Japan, our largest market in the region as well as Australia, Malaysia and Singapore. In total, COVID-related closures and operating restrictions negatively impacted Asia sales by about 3.5% in the quarter. 
And while the Chinese Mainland still grew more than 25% this quarter, our performance was also tempered by COVID lockdowns from late July through August. On a positive note, Mainland comps rebounded quickly in September once stores reopened. 
Japan comps also started to improve towards the end of the quarter with the government lifting all states of emergency following the end of our fiscal Q2. Our digital ecosystem continued to accelerate in Asia. In Q2, this was supported by our successful Chuseok thanksgiving holiday campaign in Korea, Qixi Valentine's Day in China and an overall momentum in our newer digital flagships in China, Japan and Hong Kong. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $3.1 billion in cash and investments and $1.6 billion in total debt, which compares to $2.4 billion in cash and investments and $1.6 billion in total debt last year. Net inventory increased 5%, modestly below our plan due to global supply chain delays. 
While we expect continued variability of inventory flows, from quarter-to-quarter, we believe our inventories are well positioned across key categories and channels to meet demand for the upcoming holiday and spring '22 seasons. Overall, we expect to improve our inventory positions as supply chain headwinds subside and plan to end the year with inventories better aligned to sales growth. 
As we move into the second half of this fiscal year, we are recommitting to our long-term capital allocation priorities outlined prior to COVID. This includes, first, reinvesting in our strategic growth priorities, including brand marketing and elevation, digital and expansion of our key city ecosystems to drive long-term sustainable growth. 
Second, with peak pandemic closures likely behind us, we are focused on returning 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We reinstated our dividend in the first quarter, and we expect this to grow in line with durable net income growth. And we expect to resume our share repurchase program starting in the second half of this fiscal year, with about $580 million remaining under our current share authorization. 
Looking ahead, our outlook is based on our best assessment of the current macro environment, including global supply chain challenges and COVID-related disruptions. We expect the quarterly cadence this year to remain volatile given dynamic conditions across our markets. 
For fiscal '22, we are raising our revenue growth to 34% to 36% growth to last year in constant currency on a 53-week basis, excluding approximately $700 million in annualized revenue we reset during the pandemic. This includes department store exits, off-price and daigou reductions and the licensing and sale of Chaps and Club Monaco. This implies revenues up high single digits to fiscal '20. 
Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact full year revenues by about 20 basis points. We expect gross margins to expand at the high end of our prior range of 50 to 70 basis points or roughly 450 basis point increase to LLY. Our outlook improved on more favorable pricing and product mix this year despite increased freight costs, which we now expect to be in the range of 130 to 150 basis points due to our plans to use more air freight to fulfill strong demand in the back half. 
As a reminder, we renegotiated our ocean freight rates for the year in Q1. Raw materials, notably cotton, were purchased roughly a year in advance, resulting in slightly favorable product costs through the first half of fiscal '22. This is followed by mid to high single-digit estimated cost increases in our second half ending March and through calendar 2022, which we expect to more than offset with continued AUR growth and productivity improvements. 
We raised our AUR outlook to high single-digit growth this year, above our long-term annual guidance of low to mid-single digits as we continue our elevation work. We still expect operating margins of 12% to 12.5%, which compares to 4.8% operating margin last year and 10.3% in fiscal '20. We continue to expect operating margin rates for the back half of the year to moderate from first half levels based on increased second half marketing investments of approximately 7% to 8% of sales reaching our full year target of at least 6% of sales this year, increased air freight expense in the back half of the year and our assumption of more normalized channel mix compared to last year's COVID disruptions. 
For the full year, our increased revenue outlook implies high-teens operating profit dollar growth compared to LLY pre-COVID levels. For the third quarter, we expect constant currency revenues to increase approximately 14% to 16%. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenues by about 140 basis points. 
While our teams are still actively focused on managing through global supply chain disruptions, we remain confident in our ability to deliver the right product at appropriate levels to meet consumer demand over the holiday selling period. We expect operating margins of about 13% to 13.5% in the third quarter, roughly in line with last year. This has seen modest gross margin expansion, largely offset by the timing shift in strategic investments, input cost inflation and mixed headwinds I noted a moment ago. We now expect the full year tax rate to be about 21% to 22% with a third quarter tax rate of around 22% to 23%. 
In closing, our strong first half performance underscores the timelessness of Ralph's creative vision, the power of our brand and our strengthening consumer base. With these as our foundation, we will leverage our momentum and invest in the key strategic initiatives that will support our long-term growth. And within a highly dynamic global environment, our teams around the world are executing with agility and playing offense to deliver long-term value creation for all our stakeholders.

Listen, we're certainly encouraged by the strong first half we've had this fiscal year. And what's really important to note from a mindset standpoint is we still have massive runway ahead of us. And to a large extent, ou",912,"Sure. Thank you for your question. Listen, we're certainly encouraged by the strong first half we've had this fiscal year. And what's really important to note from a mindset standpoint is we still have massive runway ahead of us. And to a large extent, our brand continues to be much bigger than our business. So our performance so far has given us proof point and the confidence to continue investing in the multiple opportunities for growth that we had ahead of us. 
There are 4 that I would call out, Dana. The first one, which is really our lifeblood, right, is customers, new customer acquisition, and you've seen the numbers this past quarter, up 19% versus last year. We're bringing in a younger consumer. We're bringing in a higher value consumer, a more profitable consumer and less promotion-sensitive consumer. We're very excited about that momentum.  We're going to continue to invest in this space to expand our footprint and also, of course, drive retention, and we've seen very good progress on retention for customers that we've brought over the past few quarters. 
Second area is around product and the breadth of our product portfolio and which we've talked in prior forms really sets us apart from many other brands in this space, right? We have a lifestyle portfolio that ranges from tuxedos and evening gowns all the way to sweatshirts. And as you see consumers progressively reinvest into more elevated casual, we're incredibly well positioned to meet that demand. And that's part of what's driven the success in Q2, is this ability to meet this hybrid customer expectation, both more elevated products and also continued interest in athleisure. And we've been able to balance both well. 
On top of that, we've talked a lot about our high potential underdeveloped categories. And we've seen really nice momentum in these categories. But again, relatively early days in sneakers, outerwear and denim for example. So much more runway there. Third area is digital, right? And as you know, we've done a lot of work to reset here, reset on product, reset on pricing, reset on brand presentation. We're seeing really good momentum in this channel across both our own sites, up 35% across pure players and breaking clicks, up 57% this past quarter. Total digital, up 45%. 
What's exciting here is the momentum on digital continues as the stores are reopening. So we're seeing consumers with an omnichannel mindset continue to engage both digitally and also in our stores. We're obviously going to continue to invest in capabilities in this space, functionality and connected retail experience. 
Notably, and you touched on it, our margin in digital continues to be accretive to our total company margin. That is one -- I think, one of our most exciting achievements over the past year, and the team has done a fantastic job to reset both product pricing, promotion, operations, cost structure in a way that this is accretive across all 3 regions, and our expectation is that will continue, right? We expect digital to be our fastest-growing channel for the years to come. And we're really pleased that the digital margin is accretive to the company margin. And we have full confidence in that, that will continue and expand. 
And then the final thing I would call out in terms of drivers is our focus on key cities. We don't look at markets as much by country anymore. We really look at them at key cities and building, and pardon for the jargon, building a connected omnichannel ecosystem in each of the key cities, that's playing out really nicely. The combination of brick-and-mortar, pure play, wholesale, brick-and-click and our general digital wrapper. We're seeing very strong response from the consumer in those cities where we've made these investments. 
We have a couple of examples in our prepared remarks of things that have happened recently in Shanghai, in Beijing, and we have more to come in the following quarters. When I look at the model we have there, the success we're seeing with it and the opportunities we had ahead of us, the same thing, a long runway in terms of our ability to go build these ecosystems around the world. So 4 key drivers that certainly drove the performance in Q2 and will continue to play out for the long term. 
As far as risks are concerned, the biggest risk we're facing are clearly macro related, right? From supply chain to cost inflation headwinds, I mean, those are very real. We've touched on these in the script, and we believe we're actually very well positioned to mitigate them because of our brand pricing power. 18 quarters in a row of AUR growth with multiple levers to drive AUR because of our newly diversified agile, faster supply chain that is not dependent on one specific supplier or one specific country. 
So these headwinds are there. They're real, but we are very confident in our ability to mitigate them. And so I would say, in this context, the biggest mistake we could make with these macro headwinds and these external pressures is actually to shift to defense, right? And as you've seen in our plans right now, we're on offense. We're executing our plans while mitigating the headwinds. We've got the resources to invest in the business. Our focus is on fueling our momentum next quarter, the quarter after that and for the long term. Thanks for your question, Dana."

Let me take your first question in 2 parts. First, on the AUR trajectory, we are very confident in our ability to continue our elevation journey from here. We expect to continue driving both positive AUR and gross margin expansion in the back half o",372,"Sure. Let me take your first question in 2 parts. First, on the AUR trajectory, we are very confident in our ability to continue our elevation journey from here. We expect to continue driving both positive AUR and gross margin expansion in the back half of fiscal '22 and through our long-term plan. Over the last 18 consecutive quarters of AUR growth, we've developed a proven multi-levered approach to pricing with a focus on creating value for the consumer, and it's working. 
So while we're still comfortable with our overall long-term guidance of low to mid single-digit AUR growth, it's fair to expect that our AUR rates will be on the higher end over the next year as we work through higher cost and we work those into our broader financial algorithm. On your operating margin question, we're still well on track towards the goal of mid-teens operating margin. 
Our full year fiscal '22 guidance puts us firmly on a path with around 200 basis points of expansion pre-COVID OI levels. And we're planning to achieve this on a lower reset base of revenues and with OI dollars substantially higher than pre-COVID levels as well. And embedded within our guide, our gross margins are expanding in spite cost inflation and we're reinvesting back in the business because we have momentum. 
As Patrice mentioned, we firmly believe that now is the right time to invest in the long term. We've reset to a more profitable base and we're seeing strong momentum in our brands, and we have the right tools in place to drive expanded AURs and the gross margin. 
Now on your question about the pace of share buybacks. So we have, as you've noted, $580 million remaining in our authorization, I would expect that over the -- historically, we've done about $500 million over the course of a fiscal year. I would expect us to do at least that pace as we close out the year. But of course, we'll be looking at the value-creation potential of the share buybacks, so looking at the market. But I think you can expect this to go at least as fast as we have historically in terms of about $500 million over 4 quarters."

Maybe you can help us disaggregate how much -- North America slowed a little bit in both channels. Maybe you could help us just disaggregate how much the business transition line items impacted both the channels in North America in the quarter. And then I'd be curious if you might be able to help us think about how much supply chain may have held back North America in 2Q? Just we get an idea of what the magnitude of what's going on there is. And then I guess, Patrice, you got the wholesale AURs up now for a couple of quarters in a row. And we've heard good news on that in the retail side for a long time. 
So now that we've got a couple of quarters of AURs going up in that channel, as we look back kind of at the 2018 Analyst Day, which I know is ancient history at this point, but you thought this business could do mid-60s gross margins at that time. And as we're looking at it now, you've got AURs, I think, in a much better place than what you imagined at that time. I would be curious to hear what you think the potential for this business is going forward. And then I guess, Jane, just one last one. I think fourth quarter operating margin has guided sub-4%. Is that -- maybe just help us think about how much conservatism is baked in there versus actual costs that you're planning rising in the business?"
362220,1684453906,2421638,"Ralph Lauren Corporation, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Ralph Lauren Corporation","Executives","Sure. Why don't I take the first part of your question in terms of the disaggregating North America growth. So if you think about North America growth, we have -- as we move into this second quarter, we're really encouraged by the strong -- overall strong",327,"Sure. Why don't I take the first part of your question in terms of the disaggregating North America growth. So if you think about North America growth, we have -- as we move into this second quarter, we're really encouraged by the strong -- overall strong performance in North America. We have a much stronger foundation for growth, solid momentum in the business, where we had to do most of the reset work in digital and in wholesale. 
And our Q2 guidance did assume a sequential LLY slowdown ex resets as we weren't expecting the same level of upside that we saw in Q1 based on some of the inventory restocking that we did in Q1. But overall, Q2 was still in line or better than our expectations. I think that the other aspect in North America was we did see some traffic softness in the outlet centers as the Delta variant started to rise sort of mid to late summer, which impacted traffic overall, but we certainly saw that impact. 
Now encouragingly, we do see our conversion and our comps outpace the traffic in outlets, but that was also part of the -- a bit of slowdown that we saw through the summer. Do I think the supply chain is impacting -- impacted some of that? Yes. I know that we had less air freight coming in during that mid-summer level. So we were a little slow to get fall on the floor and make that transition. 
And so I do expect that, that impacted North America when we started to airfreight in and we became more aggressive in airfreight as we closed out September. We saw a rise in comps in our outlet doors, and we're very encouraged by that. So I do think it had an impact. There's a lot of dynamics going on, but I do think it had an impact, and we were encouraged by the acceleration that we saw in September."

So first of all, we're actually really pleased with the progress that's happening in wholesale on AUR.

So first of all, we're actually really pleased with the progress that's happening in wholesale on AUR. And it's really -- to use a baseball analogy, really early innings on this one, right, probably the first inning. You saw the number in the release, AUR U.S. wholesale up 30% versus LLY, with strong momentum there. And what I really like about the progress there is its multiple levers, right? 
It's getting smarter on promotions, when, how, where to implement them. It's like-for-like pricing. It's investing into higher value items. So all these levers that we've seen play out in DTC, we're also seeing play out in wholesale. And we're working very closely with our partners and actually are very aligned in the approach that we want to drive moving forward. So I think long runway on AUR growth and expansion in wholesale and fundamentally healthier business as a result of it.
When it comes to gross margin guidance, Michael, we're not going to change our guidance long term at this point. We're still, as Jane mentioned, very committed to our mid-teens operating margin and very confident in our ability to get there. I think at this point, mid-60s for gross margin expectation in the near term is consistent with what we said and consistent with how to think about it. 
And then once we have the opportunity to kind of guide for the next phase of growth, then we can relook at that together. But the general message is consistency of expectations with the focus especially on the ability to deliver mid-teens operating margins for this company."

We are making substantial investments that Patrice noted, largely on new consumer acquisition and new digital sites and digital investments, all of which will pay dividends into the future. It's not a one-and-done kind of return on investments. These will be long-term investments. We're committed to making them. 
Where could the upside come? Really, if we see revenues strengthen beyond our expectations into the fourth quarter, supply chain resolved -- or especially the logistics aspect of supply chain resolves quicker than we expected, you could see some flow-through there. The pressures are twofold. Other than the small quarter, we're moving into some of the higher costs that we're seeing on a product basis. And you saw that we've taken up some of our estimates on freight, now moving to 130 to 150 basis points. 
Obviously, given freight was 60 basis points in the first quarter, 150 in the second quarter, the back half to get to our range is more substantial than that. So you see that pressure in the back half."

So how to make our white Polo shirt relevant for that younger consumer. And I think through the pivots we've made on marketing going on the platforms that resonate the most with that younger consumer, whether that's TikTok or Snap, participating in those activities that are most relevant for them like gaming, right? Engaging in the metaverse like what we've done recently with Zepeto where we've seen very high level of engagement. 
So the shift in our marketing has really helped broaden the appeal to that younger consumer. And we see it in our data, as I mentioned upfront on Dana's question, we are seeing a younger consumer coming into the franchise as a result of the marketing content and targeting. On the product front, we have, of course, also leveraged categories that resonate the most with that younger consumer, Polo Sports, which we've reenergized, and I think there's a really clear positioning now is resonating very nicely, elevated at athleisure and fleece is also connecting nicely with that consumer. 
And then some of our core products, our sweaters or chinos or denim, some of our more elevated outerwear has also resonated -- quite resonating quite nicely with that younger consumer. So as I look at the broad categories that have been successful in the past quarter and as we look ahead in terms of where we've invested, we feel very nicely positioned broadly and in particular, for that younger consumer, whether that's, again, denim, investments in sneakers, driving more elevated casual that is resonating with that group, both on the men's side and on the women's side. 
And I'm actually very encouraged that the progression we're making in terms of attracting that younger and higher value customer is not a 1-quarter phenomenon. We've now seen this for a number of quarters and is the direct results of interventions, targeted interventions we're making across product, across marketing and across product -- brand distribution."

I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the most important spend initiatives within SG&A this year into the back half. What is within your control and accretive to long-term brand health? And are there any other components of SG&A that are rising, whether that's rising labor or given the other types of aspects of inflation, where do you see that opportunity into calendar '22?"

In terms of the broad buckets, Brooke, where we're focusing our investments moving forward that we expect to drive long-term growth are, one, new customer acquisition, right? Younger customer, higher value customer. And we now have the tools with the consumer intelligence group that we have in place, with our ability to target and tailor the messaging to really be providing very high ROIs on these types of investments. So we've seen the success behind them, we're going to dial that up across the region. 
The second is continue to fuel our digital momentum, right? And that's a combination of functionality on our own sites, elements of connected retail, work that we're doing with our wholesale partners, and you'll see we have a number of exciting things coming online over the next couple of quarters when it comes to our digital capabilities, in addition to localizing sites, so expanding our footprint into new markets with localized propositions from a ralphlauren.com standpoint. 
And then the third one is continuing to invest in building our store footprint in the context of our key city ecosystem. And we've had 2 good examples recently with Shanghai and Beijing, and there's more to come there. So these are investments that will not just generate an impact over the next 1 or 2 quarters, but there will be long-lasting -- will have long-lasting effect. We really look at lifetime value of customers that we bring in to the franchise, and we're actually really pleased with the profiles we're bringing in. We're really pleased with our retention performance. So these 3 areas will have a long runway in terms of contributions to growth and value creation."

And Brooke, just as you think about some of the components of SG&A, we've talked about marketing being at least 6%. Obviously, with some of the shift we did, the $25 million that came out of the first half and went into the second half, you'll see heavier marketing spend into the second half because we're able to sort of post-COVID and restrictions and shutdowns, we're able to activate things like the Australian Open. And we have the events coming up, the fashion show, fashion week coming up. Those things will be activated and that's a portion of the spend that shifted. So you will see this back half be closer to 7% to 8% of sales relative to our run rate, which is up 5.8% of sales into this quarter for the first half. 
Now outside of SG&A versus -- outside of marketing, I'm sorry, versus last year, SMB is normalizing. Last year, we had furloughs and we had government subsidies during the height of the pandemic. We're obviously open across all our stores now. And we are seeing some wage rate pressure. It's been most notable in our distribution centers with temporary and hourly workforce and in our retail doors. 
I'm pleased to say that we are well-staffed right now, but there is some inflation in wages that we saw. And of course, we're committing this year to opening new doors. As a part of our drive towards direct-to-consumer, we're going to open 90 new doors this year, and there is some investment and expenses associated with that. 
Now as you ask in terms of what do we have control of, overall, we're committed to making these investments. We do have some control over marketing, as you saw us exercise in the first half to make sure we're in tune with local markets. And the operating dynamics that we're working with today, we do feel now is the right time just with the holiday and what we're seeing in terms of opening around the country, now is the right time to invest. And as Patrice mentioned, we're also investing in local e-commerce sites, have a very strong ROI and payback after the first 10 months."

And what's going to manifest itself through wholesale, though significantly, is the pressure from the Chaps moving to a licensed model. So that's little more than 10 points of pressure in the second half to our wholesale business. It's absolutely the right strategic move. 
Underlying ex that reset, we expect continued momentum outside of Chaps in our wholesale business and higher levels of profitability as Patrice mentioned. In retail, obviously, Club Monaco will be excluded from our overall corporate results. But in retail, we expect as the situations of COVID normalizes that we'll see better traffic back to the store. We've got strong conversion rates, strong AUR growth plan -- that we've already put up and planned for balance of year that will help us drive overall retail. 
We're planning for some store openings in North America and continuing comp growth. On a long-term basis, we haven't yet guided the region, but we do expect North America is on a healthy base and is positioned for growth from here out. You see the digital momentum, you see us gaining share in wholesale and we're very encouraged by what our existing store base can do in our new store base."

I think if you -- indeed, if you kind of step back and say, okay, what are the drivers in North America is going to be moving forward? And you heard me say last quarter -- I think it was last quarter, there have been this confidence in our ability to win in North America since I started. And that confidence completely holds true as we speak together today. As Jane mentioned, if you look at the key vectors of growth moving forward, digital, right? We now have, after a painful reset dealing with daigou, dealing with the site that was over promotional that didn't have the right product offering, we now feel very good about our ralphlauren.com site in the U.S., both in terms of how the brand is presented, how we're engaging with consumers, the connected retail capabilities that come with it, and of course, the profitability. So that's the first element. 
Second element, as you mentioned, is our retail footprints, right, both productivity and our outlet and expanding our own full-priced store footprints. So more to come in this space. So we know that there is an opportunity for us to increase our presence, physical presence, from a DTC standpoint in a number of key cities in the U.S. and that work is well underway with the format that we're excited about and the brand presentation that we're excited about. 
And then the final point is now wholesale, which used to be a drag and a bit of an albatross candidly around our Next is now reset is now on a healthy base, both the brick-and-mortar side, where we've closed, as a reminder, 65% of all our locations over the past 3, 4 years. And the digital front. You saw the digital numbers -- the digital growth numbers from wholesale this quarter are quite strong, and we believe only the beginning of the long term. 
So multiple vectors of growth. Jane, as you mentioned, we're not ready to guide North America longer term. But I think on both of our behalf, I think I could say we have a lot of confidence in our ability to not only grow but win in this market, right? The last thing I would leave you with is recent -- latest share readings. We're growing share in men's. We're growing sharing kids. We're growing share in home. We're going sharing women's ready to wear and there's more to come. So we've got really nice momentum, a healthy foundation, and we're investing to win. 
All right. With that, we're going to close it here. Thank you for joining us today. We look forward to sharing our third quarter fiscal '22 results with you in February. In the meantime, we hope to welcome you at the Polo Bar, little advertising never hurts, which just reopened here in New York City a couple of weeks ago where you can experience the magic of the Ralph Lauren lifestyle. Thank you for joining, and have a great day."
